Totally disgusted. <br><br>2. Your boss gives that dream project u want to do to someone b/c you got reservist for ONE BLOODY MONTH.<br><br>3. two years is really a hell'uva time to be taken away. Our education system is already slow with a redundant A level system, an university curriculum that is way too long and inflexible and government still want us to have more kids...By the time we graduate, we are already 25-26....With HDB flats that sell for 500K....can you imagine the kind of stress ??<br><br>4. Oh yes, i do have a fantastic $1.5K rebate off my taxable income due to having served NS. FANTASTIC....it work out to about $50/yr...MIGHT AS WELL DUN GIVE? <br><br>5. Still it has taken them bloody long when PM came up with " oh , we think we need to make the difference between PR and citizen sharper " recently....Have you guys been sticking your head in the sand for the last 10 years ignoring the problem hoping it will go away?<br><br>It's really sad. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;"> is not bad a place to live in.

This country treat foreigners better than their own sons in a bid to attract what they call talents.... Come on, i scored my 4As in A level, what are you trying to do to retain me? With a $50 yearly tax rebate + taking away 2 years of my time? I can't even defer my NS to purse my interest.....<br><br>I dun buy into the having talent will create more job crap. Firstly, if the man is truly such a talent, you think that if you attract him to come here, he will not be attracted to somewhere else more favorable ?? ( EVERYwhere will seem favorable if his son dun have to do NS....lol)</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;">When I'm bored, I write articles, hahaha... Anyone has writing jobs for me? <br><br>--<br><br>Today marks my 1 year as a soldier in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and the time I should have commissioned as an officer, but did not due to my lack of determination. However, this article is not about me, but it’s about you, the officers of the Singapore Armed Forces.<br><br>I reckoned that in my 1 year stint, I have been to many places, having served as a recruit, officer cadet, signaler as well as a civilian working for the army! I would like to think my time with officers of these different vocations as a good learning experience.<br><br>There are many reasons why many people outside think that officers have the better end of the stick. They are given trust to handle their own matters, awarded higher respect by superiors, receive better pay and viewed by the public as more reliable. It’s almost like a textbook example of Maslow Hierarchy of Needs.<br><br>However, to my own calculative mind, I cannot help but think officers have gotten the shorter end. Like most conundrums, the paradoxical response is often the truth. In the 2 years NSF career, an officer would receive a total of approximately $20,000 while a Man would receive $13,000.<br><br>This makes it a difference of $7,000, which a single trade on the stock market would negate or increase. Think of it as small change once you start working in the civilian world.<br><br>Most Officers endure arduous training in their 9 months in Officer Cadet School (OCS) and finally after much blood, sweat and tears, commission. Having been in there, I can attest to each day being a constant struggle, and no one really knows if he will even commission. It’s a mental and physical challenge everyday. Why did I write ‘most officers”? Because the officers at ALTI (Army Logistics Training Institute) hardly chiong-sua during their Pro Term!<br><br>After they commission, most are sent to units to become platoon commanders, staff officers and so forth. Being an officer is a badge of honor, but like most badges, it is also a magnet for work assignments.<br><br>Unlike a man, who can nonchalantly say he does not know to do it (tah bodoh), most officers have to accept work thrown at them by senior officers or warrant officers. The term “act blur, live longer” does not apply to an officer.<br><br>Being an officer also brings about added responsibilities, and there are many things which only an officer is able to handle, as deemed by the upper echelons of SAF. Many times, men in unit would sit around stare into blank space while the officers can be seen running around handling matters. At the same time, officers also do not trust men to do things other than the most menial of matters. (lucky me I say!)<br><br>Finally, as an NSF Officer, you have to handle regular specialists, who view you with disdain because you have lesser experience, but are of a higher rank than them. If you’re unlucky and pair with a WO who is unfriendly, good luck with your 1 year stint in the unit.<br><br>As if there is not enough grievances they quietly face, officers have to serve their reservist till they hit 50 years old while man and specialists end theirs at 40 years old. Trust me, when you see reservists men ambling around in my unit, you don’t want to be in their shoes. Rounded, and less fit in their later years, every moment in green is not pleasure. This applies to everyone.<br><br>In operation / war, officers must plan and execute. It is no mean feat to plan and think of battle formations in the sweltering heat while caring for your men’s welfare. Men just loll around and eat their muesli bars after setting up the command posts waiting for orders. Every moment is a wayang moment. Even if you’re tired, you cannot show it to your men or risk losing their morale and confidence.<br><br>Now tell me, for seven grand, is it worth it to put in such a sacrifice for a government that doesn’t care for the people’s general welfare? It plainly isn’t.<br><br>Therefore, to my platoon mates who just commissioned, and to the many more officers before and after me, I salute you, for your dedication to the country, to our parents (I remember LTC Fred Chung’s speech), and for your ability to look beyond the dollars and sense.<br><br>Thank you for your sacrifice.<br><br>Ode to Love, Ode to Officers.</span></p>

              <h2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: large; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: medium;">“I will not live by fear”: Activist, businesswoman, mother</span></span></h2>
              <p style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"> </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">What prompts a young mother of two to stand up for her rights and the rights of her fellow citizens in a country known for crushing dissent with frightening efficiency? This is a question that many Singaporeans will ask if they met Jaslyn Go Hui Leng.</span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">This is because Ms Go is one of the 18 Singaporeans charged with taking part in an assembly and procession without a permit on 15 Mar this year.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">That event launched the Tak Boleh Tahan! campaign which is aimed at highlighting the PAP Government’s raising of prices and fees that has thrown hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans into economic disarray and hardship.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And what will be her answer?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">“<strong>I will not live by the fear the PAP seeks to instill in its citizens,</strong>” explains Ms Go. “<strong>They can try to cripple me with arrest, jail or fine, but they can’t stop me from speaking up.</strong>”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So what does the financial plight of workers have to do with a successful businesswoman who leads a more-than-comfortable lifestyle with her family?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“I used to be very poor when I was young,” explained Ms Go, “now that I am better off, I hope I can do my part and highlight the plight our elderly and poor in Singapore are going through.”</strong></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">“<strong>If we continue to allow the PAP to rule with an iron fist, the people’s problems will not be addressed and<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> I fear that the younger generation will suffer more than we are now as the cost of living are skyrocketing and our jobs are being taken over by foreigners.</strong></span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>”</strong></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The Singapore Democrats first came to know Ms Go during the vigil outside the Burmese embassy in September 2007. Since then, the vivacious and determined advocate of democracy has been actively helping to promote human rights in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">“<strong>Prior to the protest, I tried in my own ways to engage the government by writing to my MP, Tanjong Pagar GRC MPs, and the Straits Times. But time and again they refused to reply to me, or publish my letters,</strong>” she writes in her blog.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There is a steely quality about Ms Go that pushes her on. And it is not just starry-eyed ideals that propels the lady’s actions; she makes no bones that she is also doing this for the sake of her two children, aged 3 and 5.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Children in Singapore have been deprived of quality life which is so stressful even for young children, she points out.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“Child suicide has been on the rise. The root of the problem lies in the stiff competition that our children are being put through in school,” says Ms Go. “I hope this can be a thing of the past.”</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Asked what she hopes for in the next 5 to 10 years, Ms Go replies that she would like to see elderly folks who have contributed to Singapore’s progress be taken care of by the government and not reduced to collecting cardboard boxes and empty drink cans to eke out a living.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And how does she think this can be achieved?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">“<strong>I hope to see a change in government to a more humane one that puts the country and the citizens first.</strong>”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Ms Go will appear in Subordinate Court 23 together with the other 17 activists.</span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Many Singaporeans shy away from engaging in the public process by claiming that they have their families to think about. Such fear is a damning indictment of the PAP. Be that as it may, Ms Go’s example and courage should be a ringing call to citizens of this country to overcome their fearful inertia and become actively involved in matters that concern their everyday lives as well as their future.</span></p>

              <p>bro, dont jump to conclusion. There are also technology over there, offices, schools also employ technology to keep up with times. But for some reason, the average aussie is not keen on a career in IT or engineering. Most of them are more keen on typical christian jobs like bankers, accountants and managers. Well u can ginger point at people, but i can say is their SAF soldier proudly can claim they fight a war compared to out singapore soldiers who play around and fiddle with latest sate of the art gadget toys but have no war experience.</p>
              <p>But the important thing about their society is that they seem to be matured.</p>
              <p>and dont bring in japs, germans from WW2 plz. Germans and japs saw no strategic value from australia for their war plans. Its pretty isolated from the rest of the world with a huge sea in between.</p>

              must be objective.<br> <br> Anyway, it's just a personal view of mine..but if i have a choice i
              will not want my son to serve NS. Yes, boy become men there but
              patriotism aside, it's really unfair to Singaporean boys.<br> <br> 1. you lag TWO bloody years behind your Malaysia PR friend.</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black;">Singapore</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black;">government
              subsidies them to study, they come out and compete for jobs with
              you and THEY COMPLAIN WHEN YOUR SALARY IS $150 HIGHER THAN THEM.
              Totally disgusted.<br> <br> 2. Your boss gives that dream project u want to do to someone b/c
              you got reservist for ONE BLOODY MONTH.<br> <br> 3. two years is really a hell'uva time to be taken away. Our
              education system is already slow with a redundant A level system,
              an university curriculum that is way too long and inflexible and
              government still want us to have more kids...By the time we
              graduate, we are already 25-26....With HDB flats that sell for
              500K....can you imagine the kind of stress ??<br> <br> 4. Oh yes, i do have a fantastic $1.5K rebate off my taxable income
              due to having served NS. FANTASTIC....it work out to about
              $50/yr...MIGHT AS WELL DUN GIVE?<br> <br> 5. Still it has taken them bloody long when PM came up with " oh ,
              we think we need to make the difference between PR and citizen
              sharper " recently....Have you guys been sticking your head in the
              sand for the last 10 years ignoring the problem hoping it will go
              away?<br> <br> It's really sad.</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black;">Singapore</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black;">is not bad a
              place to live in. I feel safe, my taxes are low...but, i feel that
              i am better off being a malaysian who come to</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black;">singapore</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black;">to study and
              work instead. I earn 5K here, go back JB become 12K...oh, and that
              gov let me study for 5K/year as uni school fees ( way cheap, you
              cannot find this ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD) ...infact, IF i cannot find
              a job, they will even try to match me up with some job.oh yes, I
              DUN HAVE TO SERVE NS.<br> <br> which is why i am apply for Auzzie PR.<br> <br> I think i am not alone in feeling this frustration. This country
              treat foreigners better than their own sons in a bid to attract
              what they call talents.... Come on, i scored my 4As in A level,
              what are you trying to do to retain me? With a $50 yearly tax
              rebate + taking away 2 years of my time? I can't even defer my NS
              to purse my interest.....<br> <br> I dun buy into the having talent will create more job crap.
              Firstly, if the man is truly such a talent, you think that if you
              attract him to come here, he will not be attracted to somewhere
              else more favorable ?? ( EVERYwhere will seem favorable if his son
              dun have to do NS....lol)</span></p>

              bored, I write articles, hahaha... Anyone has writing jobs for
              me?<br> <br> --<br> <br> Today marks my 1 year as a soldier in the Singapore Armed Forces
              (SAF) and the time I should have commissioned as an officer, but
              did not due to my lack of determination. However, this article is
              not about me, but it’s about you, the officers of the Singapore
              Armed Forces.<br> <br> I reckoned that in my 1 year stint, I have been to many places,
              having served as a recruit, officer cadet, signaler as well as a
              civilian working for the army! I would like to think my time with
              officers of these different vocations as a good learning
              experience.<br> <br> There are many reasons why many people outside think that officers
              have the better end of the stick. They are given trust to handle
              their own matters, awarded higher respect by superiors, receive
              better pay and viewed by the public as more reliable. It’s almost
              like a textbook example of Maslow Hierarchy of Needs.<br> <br> However, to my own calculative mind, I cannot help but think
              officers have gotten the shorter end. Like most conundrums, the
              paradoxical response is often the truth. In the 2 years NSF career,
              an officer would receive a total of approximately $20,000 while a
              Man would receive $13,000.<br> <br> This makes it a difference of $7,000, which a single trade on the
              stock market would negate or increase. Think of it as small change
              once you start working in the civilian world.<br> <br> Most Officers endure arduous training in their 9 months in Officer
              Cadet School (OCS) and finally after much blood, sweat and tears,
              commission. Having been in there, I can attest to each day being a
              constant struggle, and no one really knows if he will even
              commission. It’s a mental and physical challenge everyday. Why did
              I write ‘most officers”? Because the officers at ALTI (Army
              Logistics Training Institute) hardly chiong-sua during their Pro
              Term!<br> <br> After they commission, most are sent to units to become platoon
              commanders, staff officers and so forth. Being an officer is a
              badge of honor, but like most badges, it is also a magnet for work
              assignments.<br> <br> Unlike a man, who can nonchalantly say he does not know to do it
              (tah bodoh), most officers have to accept work thrown at them by
              senior officers or warrant officers. The term “act blur, live
              longer” does not apply to an officer.<br> <br> Being an officer also brings about added responsibilities, and
              there are many things which only an officer is able to handle, as
              deemed by the upper echelons of SAF. Many times, men in unit would
              sit around stare into blank space while the officers can be seen
              running around handling matters. At the same time, officers also do
              not trust men to do things other than the most menial of matters.
              (lucky me I say!)<br> <br> Finally, as an NSF Officer, you have to handle regular specialists,
              who view you with disdain because you have lesser experience, but
              are of a higher rank than them. If you’re unlucky and pair with a
              WO who is unfriendly, good luck with your 1 year stint in the
              unit.<br> <br> As if there is not enough grievances they quietly face, officers
              have to serve their reservist till they hit 50 years old while man
              and specialists end theirs at 40 years old. Trust me, when you see
              reservists men ambling around in my unit, you don’t want to be in
              their shoes. Rounded, and less fit in their later years, every
              moment in green is not pleasure. This applies to everyone.<br> <br> In operation / war, officers must plan and execute. It is no mean
              feat to plan and think of battle formations in the sweltering heat
              while caring for your men’s welfare. Men just loll around and eat
              their muesli bars after setting up the command posts waiting for
              orders. Every moment is a wayang moment. Even if you’re tired, you
              cannot show it to your men or risk losing their morale and
              confidence.<br> <br> Now tell me, for seven grand, is it worth it to put in such a
              sacrifice for a government that doesn’t care for the people’s
              general welfare? It plainly isn’t.<br> <br> Therefore, to my platoon mates who just commissioned, and to the
              many more officers before and after me, I salute you, for your
              dedication to the country, to our parents (I remember LTC Fred
              Chung’s speech), and for your ability to look beyond the dollars
              and sense.<br> <br> Thank you for your sacrifice.<br> <br> Ode to Love, Ode to Officers.</span></p>
