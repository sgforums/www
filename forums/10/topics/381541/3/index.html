              <p>by then my 5 room HDB flat would be worth may be 1 million, sell it can migrate anyway I like. So far HDB flat prices rises higher than the CPF money, at 4 % CPF money interest is higher than the bank interest.</p>
              <p>How much is left in my CPF really depend on how much I put in and how much I take out. My contribution is at the max, I am taking as much as possible for stock, and property investment. except for the minimum sum, I don't expect even to see peanuts in my CPF account when I retire. </p>
              <p> A citizenship is just the platform providing me with a safe place to raise my family, it is worth nothing, ......and everything.</p>
