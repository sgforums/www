            <div class='col-md body'>No doubt the convenience of cashless like NETS is making life easier. VISA made spending superb (if you do have the hard cash backings). But even for many adults, they are getting into bankruptcy because they spent beyond their earnings. The banks will give them twice the spending power of their earning t4 many have a illusion that they are earning more. So why worry when bonus is coming end of each year. (if it comes...what if not?) Even in business, everything is in credit. Don't have it...fraud it.<br><br>Why IS this phenomena happening in this generation but not our forefathers? They don't depend on credit cards...they use hard cash, even in business. They have learnt the value of money, credit is not as easy to come by as now. So spend what you earn, and save if you can for rainy days.<br><br>So by introducing in the pre-text of "convenience of cashless". We are not imparting those value of spend within your means. To a young child, they will not have the ideal the value of money. So what is a $100 or $1000 or $10,000 to them because everything can be credited to their parents. As long as they like it, it does not matter how much it will cost because the transaction is only by digits on computer. They will not value nor appreciate the things you have bought for them with your hard earn money. They will only appreciate only the "in-thing" no matter what is the cost because it cost them "nothing".<br><br>For now when you shop, you will still look at the price tag &amp; pay by VISA/NETS but in near future or even now....many are spending without even think about the price but the merchandise....</div>
