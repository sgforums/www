              <p>I ask only a simple question. I repeat it again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A man has assets worth a million dollars. He lost his wallet and handphone in the streets. He writes a promissory note (I.O.U) to the nearest baker for a piece of bread to feed his kids who were with him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did he commit a crime?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(<span style="text-decoration: underline;">BTW, which accounting firm are you from that you know for sure the man's financial history, when i didnt even mention his name?</span> I dont. But i do know that his oil fields are worth much. his agricultural plots are worth much. His condo in manhattan alone is of staggering costs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>His bodyguards, impressive to look at, and equally effective in action, is only a deterrence, and will not fight unless provoke, just like anybody else, even the baker. They were not with him when he made the IOU to the baker.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the baker can reject the IOC and not give him the piece of bread. No need for the baker to theorize convolutedly like you on the supply chain for a piece of bread. He and his hungry kids will just go and find someone else who will.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you really want to debate, find out the truth, objectively, not subjectively and not based on conspiracy theories or even on anger. These will only cloud your judgement and prevent an open mind to solve problems.)</p>

              <p>Why am I not surprised at the above response to this post?</p>
              <p>xtreyier, in this context, stevenson meant that the man buying bread is a metaphor for the US. If it's the simple situation which you described, then out of compassion, I wouldn't say its a "crime". But who knows what the 'Law' would decide, especially courts over here?</p>
              <p>In his context, it is accurate to say that the US is, and has been, committing fraud all these years for printing Fed notes to fuel its overspending. Even though it has a total debt of $50+ trillion, because the USD is the reserve currency of the world and oil is mostly traded in USD, countries have no choice but to accept USD even if the US was in debt to them already. Having reserve currency status allows the US to have a blank check for all its expenses- military adventures etc.</p>
              <p>Would you kindly explain what you mean by "conspiracy theories"? I'm beginning to think that you don't know what the term refers to. As far as is common knowledge, the US has 11 carrier strike groups and the world's 2nd largest nuclear capability. Correct me if I'm not referring to what you meant by "conspiracy theories".</p>
              <p>Finally, as far as geopolitics is concerned, big sticks matter a lot. Simple logic will tell you that against an heavily armed opponent, you'll most likely capitulate.</p>
