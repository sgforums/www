              <div class="yn-story-content">
              <p>As the holiday season commences, it’s worth taking stock of the last gift that <span id="lw_1229471266_0" class="yshortcuts">President George W. Bush</span> and the <span id="lw_1229471266_1" class="yshortcuts">110th Congress</span> have left for U.S. taxpayers.</p>
              <p>It’s a package of about $8.7 trillion dollars’ worth of potential taxpayer commitments for loans, guarantees and other bailout goodies for businesses and distressed homeowners.</p>
              <p>Amid the tissue paper:</p>
              <p>• More than $1.5 trillion in <span id="lw_1229471266_2" class="yshortcuts">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. loan guarantees, including a $139 billion assist to the lending arm of General Electric Corp.</p>
              <p>• $1.8 trillion in cash, tax breaks and loan guarantees doled out from the <span id="lw_1229471266_3" class="yshortcuts">Treasury Department</span> to taxpayers, financial institutions and credit companies.</p>
              <p>• $300 billion for homeowners from the Federal Housing Authority.</p>
              <p>• $25 billion in assistance for auto companies from a program overseen by the Energy Department, which is separate from the bailout proposal that tanked last week in the Senate.</p>
              <p>• And $5 trillion worth of new money, loan guarantees and loosened lending requirements from the <span id="lw_1229471266_4" class="yshortcuts">Federal Reserve Bank</span>.</p>
              <p>According to <span id="lw_1229471266_5" class="yshortcuts">Bianco Research President James Bianco</span>, who crunched these numbers, that amounts to more government aid and assistance than nine other historic bailouts and <span id="lw_1229471266_6" class="yshortcuts">big government outlays</span> combined.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1229471266_7" class="yshortcuts">The New Deal</span>, for instance, cost an estimated $32 billion in its day, which would be about $500 billion in today’s dollars. The <span id="lw_1229471266_8" class="yshortcuts">Marshall Plan</span> cost about $12.7 billion, which is the equivalent of a paltry $115.3 billion. The <span id="lw_1229471266_9" class="yshortcuts">Louisiana Purchase</span>? The French got $15 million, which would be worth about $217 billion today. </p>
              <p>If you take those three items, add in the adjusted costs of the <span id="lw_1229471266_10" class="yshortcuts">Race to the Moon</span>, the <span id="lw_1229471266_11" class="yshortcuts">savings and loan crisis</span>, the Korean War, the Iraq war, the <span id="lw_1229471266_12" class="yshortcuts">Vietnam War</span> and assistance for NASA, you still get to just $3.92 trillion — not even half of the taxpayers’ exposure today, according to Bianco. </p>
              <p><br>If that weren’t enough to make you want to upgrade your holiday gift list, it’s useful to remember that Congress isn’t done and <span id="lw_1229471266_13" class="yshortcuts">President-elect Barack Obama</span>’s team hasn’t even started.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They are promising a newer and bigger <span id="lw_1229471266_14" class="yshortcuts">stimulus package</span> early next year — one that could make last spring’s $168 billion government giveaway to taxpayers (remember that fixer?) look like pocket change.</p>
              <p>Asked just how much the taxpayers are on the hook for, Bianco said: “I just say you should use the number infinity, because nobody understands these numbers, and I would include the Treasury secretary and chairman of the Fed in that group.”</p>
              <p>There is a bright side, sort of. Only about $2.9 trillion of the government money, loans and guarantees have actually been spent or committed.</p>
              <p>And some of the deals are structured with the idea that taxpayers could one day make money off them by selling pieces of companies or the government’s new stake in them.</p>
              <p>But that can’t be done until the economy rebounds, something that most economists aren’t yet willing to predict — probably because it would be even more depressing.</p>
              <p>Now, all this is not to say that these measures weren’t necessary to save consumers from an even worse fate. That’s a big unanswered question that now will be left to speculators.</p>
              <p>But the vast majority of the smart economic crowd, from both sides of the aisle, say the job losses and economic calamity that would have ensued without <span id="lw_1229471266_15" class="yshortcuts">government intervention</span> today would make the <span id="lw_1229471266_16" class="yshortcuts">Great Depression</span> look like an economic hiccup.</p>
              <p>“If we don’t fix this, it doesn’t matter if we can’t pay for it,” said <span id="lw_1229471266_17" class="yshortcuts">Heather Boushey</span>, a senior economist at the Center for American Progress. “The problem will only get worse and become harder and even more expensive to fix.”</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, she said, <span id="lw_1229471266_18" class="yshortcuts">unemployment rates</span> could soar abruptly, as they did during the Depression. “Every person who loses a job could also lose a house and health insurance and the ability to pay for college,” she added. “We could lose a generation.”</p>
              <p>Given that, it was something of a wonder when Senate Republicans quashed a $14 billion rescue plan last week for domestic automakers.</p>
              <p>Republicans had taken a beating on <span id="lw_1229471266_19" class="yshortcuts">Election Day</span>, in part because of resentment within their own base at the bailout bonanza in Washington.</p>
              <p>But the automakers’ request seems a pittance given all the taxpayer cash already flooding the private market.</p>
              <p>Part of the answer might have come from an Obama-style Internet campaign launched by <span id="lw_1229471266_20" class="yshortcuts">FreedomWorks</span>, a grass-roots organization led by former House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas).</p>
              <p>FreedomWorks purchased Google search ads that popped up any time someone clicked for information about the auto bailout. The ad urged people to oppose the measure.</p>
              <p>Thomas Keeley, the organization’s online advertising specialist, said the ad helped them generate nearly 100,000 messages to Congress. “We did very well, especially given the limited time we had on this,” he said.</p>
              <p>The auto industry wasn’t idle. General Motors and Ford also took out Google search ads urging support for the package — a message that would have been tough to deliver in a big <span id="lw_1229471266_21" class="yshortcuts">television ad campaign</span>.</p>
              <p>The cyberspace campaigns are likely a harbinger of how future bailout battles will be waged once Obama takes office with an e-mail list of more than 10 million supporters.</p>
              <p>Already, Peter Greenberger, who’s heading up <span id="lw_1229471266_22" class="yshortcuts">Google</span>’s new issues advocacy sales team, says he’s warning interest groups that may take a stand on either side of the Democrats’ expected trillion-dollar <span id="lw_1229471266_23" class="yshortcuts">stimulus package</span> not “to organize a 20th-century advocacy campaign against a 21st-century administration.”</p>

              <p>I'm rather shocked how you can read so much information and yet constantly fail to connect the dots.</p>
              <p>The apple trees do not automatically grow to maturity when you bury into the ground and leave it. It requires constant watering, fertilizer created through the use NG, protection from wild animals and strong wind, constant pruning to prevent diseased portions from affecting the tree and pesticides to protect it from bugs. And these are only the few things i can think offhand.</p>
              <p>All of these requires man hours to accomplish, including the transportation of the neccessary fertilizer, water and pesticides. 30 sct on the apples is the gross profit, it has yet to factor in transportation costs and packaging, so in the end your net profit might just be a measy 2-3 scts. And if everyone does it, the prices will deflate and you might end up only being able to sell it for 10-15 scts.</p>
              <p>You also do not include the time it takes to actually grow to maturity, the fact that certain species require another apple tree to pollinate and whether the self pollinating apple trees are growable in a certain climate. You do not see plantations of apple trees growing rampant in the Sahara do you?   </p>
              <p>The issue is that the 8 trillion dollars have no physical value whatever so, there's nothing to back it up. It's 8 trillion and you can buy 8 trillion worth of stuff because the world's most powerful superpower says that it can. That's all there is to it.</p>
              <p>Everything works on a constant cause and effect, and it is the constant tendancy to see only the immediate effect of an action and not how it's affecting the entire chain that's causing the biggest problems in the world.    </p>

              <p><br>It is with sadness that i realized yet again you are missing the critical point. I am not writing a thesis on apple agriculture industry, but to bring a simple point across thru an analogy - value and the creation of wealth, simply so that others may understand and not be muddled as you are in the complexity of the industry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The point carries an undeniable fact. Wealth can be created by harvesting Earth's resources. The  monetary amount of it is based on its value by humans, based on numerous factors, which is why diamond - just a piece of crystal is worth more than charcoal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And your incredulous point about 8 trillion dollars 'having no physical value' is insane! It's like saying the big 3 automakers requirement of 51 billion is a figure drawn up in the air.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>8 trillion is the total amount US needs to spend to get out of the recession. It is to pay off debts as well as to stimulate the economy. These are not money being burn. When it circulates, it would keep many people with jobs and purchasing power, and ultimately, it returns to the national treasury, more than the initial amount spent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Money don't just 'disappear'! It is not oil that gets burn away. It is not coke that becames waste later. That piece of paper just get passed on to someone else in exchange for goods or services. And more money can be printed as Earth's resources gets harvested, and its value based on the accepted norm of valuation, of a person's ability to accept that good at its value. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only time money 'disappears' is only when it is kept in biscuit tins and at home. Which is what is happening now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do not assume US have not the ability to raise 8 trillion or pay its debts. It is a rich nation, not because of its millionaires, but because of its resources.   </p>

              <p>Want to cry , I type a long paragraph and the post did not went through and now I have to type again !!!!</p>
              <p>I wonder where does all these money come from .</p>
              <p>If it have come out of the magic pocket of the govt . Then the US currency will definately devalue . This is make investor to invest in gold and causing the value of gold to increase , just like what happen earlier this year.</p>
              <p>If it has come from budget allocation. The money could have cometo better use by financing large scale projects or innovations. These are the actual value creation that will spur the economy and creat jobs. Instead all these money are going to fill up the hole that was created by the banking people because of their flawed business structure , structure debt selling , leverage , own pockets and fat bonus , scams , wrong asset based accounting.</p>
              <p>More money will be needed as they are all used to slow down a dying process till it reaches another state of self substaining field. They are not used for value creation.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Neo-Alchemy of the Federal Reserve<br><br>By Ron Paul</span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article21468.htm">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article21468.htm</a></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>December 15, 2008 "ICH" -- - A</strong>s the printing presses for the bailouts run at full speed, those in power are no longer even pretending that the new giveaways will fix our problems. Now that we are used to rewarding failure with taxpayer-funded bailouts, we are being told that this is “just a start,” more funds will inevitably be needed for more industries, and that things would be much worse had we done nothing.<br><br>The updated total bailout commitments add up to over $8 trillion now. This translates into a monetary base increase of 75 percent over the last two months. This money does not come from some rainy day fund tucked away in the budget somewhere – it is created from thin air, and devalues every dollar in circulation. Dumping money on an economy, as they have been doing, is not the same as dumping wealth. In fact, it has quite the opposite effect.<br><br>One key attribute that gives money value is scarcity. If something that is used as money becomes too plentiful, it loses value. That is how inflation and hyperinflation happens. Giving a central bank the power to create fiat money out of thin air creates the tremendous risk of eventual hyperinflation. Most of the founding fathers did not want a central bank. Having just experienced the hyperinflation of the Continental dollar, they understood the power and the temptations inherent in that type of system. It gives one entity far too much power to control and destabilize the economy.<br><br>Our central bankers have had a tremendous amount of hubris over the years, believing that they could actually manage a paper money system in such a way as to replicate the behavior and benefits of a gold standard. In fact, back in 2004 then Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told me as much. People talk about toxic assets, but the real toxicity in our economy comes from the neo-alchemy practiced by the Federal Reserve System. Just as alchemists of the past frequently poisoned themselves with the lead or mercury they were trying to turn to gold, today’s bankers are poisoning the economy with accelerated fiat money creation. <br><br>Throughout the ages, gold has stood the test of time as a consistently reliable medium of exchange, and has frequently been referred to as “God’s money”, as only God can make more of it. Seeking superhuman power over money in the way alchemists did in ancient times caused society to shun them as charlatans. In much the same way, free people today should be sending the message that this power and control over our money is no longer acceptable. <br><br>The irony is that even had the ancient practice of alchemy been successful, and gold was suddenly, magically made abundant, alchemists still would have failed to create real wealth. Creating gold from lead would have cheapened its status to that of rhinestones or cubic zirconia. It is unnatural and dangerous for paper to be considered as precious as a precious metal. Our fiat currency system is crumbling and coming to an end, as all fiat currencies eventually do.<br><br>Congress should reject the central bank as a failure for its manipulations of money that have brought our economy to its knees. I am hoping that in the 111th Congress my legislation to abolish the Federal Reserve System gains traction so that the central bank can no longer destroy our money.</span></p>

              <p>Grow an apple tree and that tree becomes your money machine. Each time an apple ripens, you get 30cts. Spread that out to the number of apple trees around the world and you will see billions of dollars being printed based on the value of the apple and exchanged for goods. And that's just apples, there's plenty of other commodities Earth is rich in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only bad news is that most of that trillion of dollars is being hoarded, by the rich and banks. It's time for bank reforms - nationalize them instead. Banks cannot hope to serve only the rich and provide access of funds to them. It only creates an elite society in our world, and only the rich can dictate terms, the rich whom are equally flawed humans as anyone else.</p>

              <p>This goes beyond a farce... the Fed is a "democratic attempt to be an independent overseer of taxpayer's monies and govt fiscal policies"?</p>
              <p>You don't know what and how a fractional reserve system works right?</p>
              <p>Do you even know how the Fed was founded? In 1910, a group of bankers met in Jekyll Island off Georgia <em>in secret</em> and planned another central bank, coming up with the draft of the Federal Reserve Act. The meeting was so hushed up that address was only by first name. The past two central banks in the US were abolished by John Adams and Andrew Jackson because they realised that a privately-owned monopoly over money creation meant the surrendering of sovereignty to power-hungry bankers. In fact, Meyer Amschel Rothschild, the founder of the Rothschild banking dynasty said, "Give me control over a nation's money supply, and I care not who makes its laws."</p>
              <p>Democratic indeed. And today, the chairman of the Fed is not selected by the president. The board of directors submit a list to the president and then, the chairman is selected from that list. I dont see how leaving control of the US money supply to a private corporation and non-elected people is democratic.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Creature-Jekyll-Island-Federal-Reserve/dp/0912986212">http://www.amazon.com/Creature-Jekyll-Island-Federal-Reserve/dp/0912986212</a></p>
              <p>Taft opposed it, but Woodrow Wilson agreed to support it and got banker support during the presidential elections in 1912. In 1913, he signed the Federal Reserve Act, for which he regretted at the end of his life.</p>
              <p>"I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our <strong>system of credit</strong> is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, <em>one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world</em>. No longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but <em>a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men</em>." -Woodrow Wilson</p>
              <p>As for gambling, I was just using it as an <em>analogy</em>. Because money is created as debt in a fractional reserve system, trying to solve a financial crisis caused by excessive debt with more debt ($8+ trillion) is counter-productive. How can you pay off debt <em>by creating more debt</em>? And that is exactly how the global financial system functioned since the fractional reserve system was founded in the late 17th Century.</p>
              <p>As long as this system continues, suffering and exploitation <em>will</em> continue as people are economically enslaved to bankers who don't work towards the betterment of society.</p>

              <p>But like any human enterprise made up of flawed equal humans, the fed is not a model of perfection and subjected to errors, for there is no perfection in the mortal world, made more so by patronage, which is why a lobbyist can earn $500,00 a year.</p>

              <p>Despite the glaring flawws we all face now, it is too late for the blame game. Should we shut down all biz enterprise now just to repair the flaws, which may take decades just to unravel the mess, and everyone else in the meantime starve to death?</p>

              <p>For those who can only physically deal or see in thousands or hundred of thousand dollars daily, $8 trillion is an incomprehensible amount.</p>

              <p>But for those who are versed in international trade, an even more incomprehensible US$6,000 trillion changes hand annually.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to IMF, global economic output stands at an estimated US$6,000 trillion per year, which means $6,000 trillion had been paid for goods and services rendered.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While i will not claim 100% of that amt is in US dollars, it would stand well for everyone to know that a significant portion of international trade is conducted in US dollars.</p>

              <p>Gambling?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you invest in an unknown or 'word of mouth' entity, for high returns in a short time, that's gambling.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, when you invest in a company that deals with necessary products crucial to mankind, that's not gambling but true investments for future wealth and growth to the industry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mankind still has needs. For example, with or without recession, humans need food, water, home and medical attention, at its basic level.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Majority of companies that survived till today are dealing with such products and would see growth. Only that it had been hit by lack of confidence by consumers who had hoard up their monies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To continue to hoard would be to let such companies fail, and in the end, with the lack of economies of scale and fiscal investments, such companies will collapse and mankind will starve or ill to death.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No govt is asking consumers to invest in Revlon or Gucci, Or use bailout funds to buy Prada bags. Therefore, govt's bailout funds are meant for viable companies that creates necessary goods or services to keep mankind employed with the means to survive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This isnt gambling. It's survival of our species.</p>

              <p>This goes beyond a farce... the Fed is a "democratic attempt to be an independent overseer of taxpayer's monies and govt fiscal policies"?</p>
              <p>You don't know what and how a fractional reserve system works right?</p>
              <p>Do you even know how the Fed was founded? In 1910, a group of bankers met in Jekyll Island off Georgia <em>in secret</em> and planned another central bank, coming up with the draft of the Federal Reserve Act. The meeting was so hushed up that address was only by first name. The past two central banks in the US were abolished by John Adams and Andrew Jackson because they realised that a privately-owned monopoly over money creation meant the surrendering of sovereignty to power-hungry bankers. In fact, Meyer Amschel Rothschild, the founder of the Rothschild banking dynasty said, "Give me control over a nation's money supply, and I care not who makes its laws."</p>
              <p>Democratic indeed. And today, the chairman of the Fed is not selected by the president. The board of directors submit a list to the president and then, the chairman is selected from that list. I dont see how leaving control of the US money supply to a private corporation and non-elected people is democratic.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/Creature-Jekyll-Island-Federal-Reserve/dp/0912986212">http://www.amazon.com/Creature-Jekyll-Island-Federal-Reserve/dp/0912986212</a></p>
              <p>Taft opposed it, but Woodrow Wilson agreed to support it and got banker support during the presidential elections in 1912. In 1913, he signed the Federal Reserve Act, for which he regretted at the end of his life.</p>
              <p>"I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our <strong>system of credit</strong> is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, <em>one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world</em>. No longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but <em>a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men</em>." -Woodrow Wilson</p>
              <p>As for gambling, I was just using it as an <em>analogy</em>. Because money is created as debt in a fractional reserve system, trying to solve a financial crisis caused by excessive debt with more debt ($8+ trillion) is counter-productive. How can you pay off debt <em>by creating more debt</em>? And that is exactly how the global financial system functioned since the fractional reserve system was founded in the late 17th Century.</p>
              <p>As long as this system continues, suffering and exploitation <em>will</em> continue as people are economically enslaved to bankers who don't work towards the betterment of society.</p>

If you want to call something a "conspiracy theory", then at least have the guts to disprove it instead of running away like some spineless coward. Ironically, it is that same guts that cause you to disregard anything that you don't agree with. Use your brains for once. The fractional reserve system is no conspiracy theory. It is the monetary system that exists today.</p>
              <p>Tell me the fractional reserve system is a "conspiracy theory". Do it. Do it and show your ignorance to everyone. And while you're at it, how about you explain how money is created today.</p>
              <p>Ron Paul might be a politician, but at least he has the courage to say what no other lying scumbag dares to.</p>
              <p>I don't deny that all government officials are not elected. The point is whether elected officials have the independence to run the country without interference from outside influence. If the president appoints someone to run a ministry and that person hires his own employees, nothing is wrong. But if the president is given a list to choose from, from the same people that run the ministry, something is wrong right? Where is the real power? And we're talking about the central bank of the world's former superpower.</p>

              <p>Perhaps there's a strategic purpose behind being a financial hub. The finance market exists to allocate resources better to produce goods and services. By making itself as such, S'pore will hopefully become even more entwined to the world, such that S'pore can't fall. Imagine, resources to be channeled to the region becomes disrupted because the finance market crashes....hmm.</p>

              <p>Well, you see, someone of xtreyier's caliber just doesn't want to give himself the chance to learn. World GDP is only at $65 trillion. Once you get a grasp of this fraudulent fractional reserve system and know that the entire derivatives (xtreyier, you're right, <em>this</em> is gambling) market- gambling for the financial elites- is worth about $550 trillion, the entire scam becomes clear. You can't just go on creating money (debt) out of nothing. Something will give eventually.</p>

              <p class="datetime"><a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Whered-the-bailout-money-go-apf-13890568.html">http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Whered-the-bailout-money-go-apf-13890568.html</a></p>
              <p>WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's something any bank would demand to know before handing out a loan: Where's the money going?</p>
              <p>But after receiving billions in aid from U.S. taxpayers, the nation's largest banks say they can't track exactly how they're spending the money or they simply refuse to discuss it.</p>
              <p>"We've lent some of it. We've not lent some of it. We've not given any accounting of, 'Here's how we're doing it,'" said Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase, which received $25 billion in emergency bailout money. "We have not disclosed that to the public. We're declining to."</p>
              <p>The Associated Press contacted 21 banks that received at least $1 billion in government money and asked four questions: How much has been spent? What was it spent on? How much is being held in savings, and what's the plan for the rest?</p>
              <p>None of the banks provided specific answers.</p>
              <p>"We're not providing dollar-in, dollar-out tracking," said Barry Koling, a spokesman for Atlanta, Ga.-based SunTrust Banks Inc., which got $3.5 billion in taxpayer dollars.</p>
              <p>Some banks said they simply didn't know where the money was going.</p>
              <p>"We manage our capital in its aggregate," said Regions Financial Corp. spokesman Tim Deighton, who said the Birmingham, Ala.-based company is not tracking how it is spending the $3.5 billion it received as part of the financial bailout.</p>
              <p>The answers highlight the secrecy surrounding the Troubled Assets Relief Program, which earmarked $700 billion -- about the size of the Netherlands' economy -- to help rescue the financial industry. The Treasury Department has been using the money to buy stock in U.S. banks, hoping that the sudden inflow of cash will get banks to start lending money.</p>
              <p>There has been no accounting of how banks spend that money. Lawmakers summoned bank executives to Capitol Hill last month and implored them to lend the money -- not to hoard it or spend it on corporate bonuses, junkets or to buy other banks. But there is no process in place to make sure that's happening and there are no consequences for banks who don't comply.</p>
              <p>"It is entirely appropriate for the American people to know how their taxpayer dollars are being spent in private industry," said Elizabeth Warren, the top congressional watchdog overseeing the financial bailout.</p>
              <p>But, at least for now, there's no way for taxpayers to find that out.</p>
              <p>Pressured by the Bush administration to approve the money quickly, Congress attached nearly no strings on the $700 billion bailout in October. And the Treasury Department, which doles out the money, never asked banks how it would be spent.</p>
              <p>"Those are legitimate questions that should have been asked on Day One," said Rep. Scott Garrett, R-N.J., a House Financial Services Committee member who opposed the bailout as it was rushed through Congress. "Where is the money going to go to? How is it going to be spent? When are we going to get a record on it?"</p>
              <p>Nearly every bank AP questioned -- including Citibank and Bank of America, two of the largest recipients of bailout money -- responded with generic public relations statements explaining that the money was being used to strengthen balance sheets and continue making loans to ease the credit crisis.</p>
              <p>A few banks described company-specific programs, such as JPMorgan Chase's plan to lend $5 billion to nonprofit and health care companies next year. Richard Becker, senior vice president of Wisconsin-based Marshall &amp; Ilsley Corp., said the $1.75 billion in bailout money allowed the bank to temporarily stop foreclosing on homes.</p>
              <p>But no bank provided even the most basic accounting for the federal money.</p>
              <p>"We're choosing not to disclose that," said Kevin Heine, spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon, which received about $3 billion.</p>
              <p>Others said the money couldn't be tracked. Bob Denham, a spokesman for North Carolina-based BB&amp;T Corp., said the bailout money "doesn't have its own bucket." But he said taxpayer money wasn't used in the bank's recent purchase of a Florida insurance company. Asked how he could be sure, since the money wasn't being tracked, Denham said the bank would have made that deal regardless.</p>
              <p>Others, such as Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Carissa Ramirez, offered to discuss the matter with reporters on condition of anonymity. When AP refused, Ramirez sent an e-mail saying: "We are going to decline to comment on your story."</p>
              <p>Most banks wouldn't say why they were keeping the details secret.</p>
              <p>"We're not sharing any other details. We're just not at this time," said Wendy Walker, a spokeswoman for Dallas-based Comerica Inc., which received $2.25 billion from the government.</p>
              <p>Heine, the New York Mellon Corp. spokesman who said he wouldn't share spending specifics, added: "I just would prefer if you wouldn't say that we're not going to discuss those details."</p>
              <p>The banks which came closest to answering the questions were those, such as U.S. Bancorp and Huntington Bancshares Inc., that only recently received the money and have yet to spend it. But neither provided anything more than a generic summary of how the money would be spent.</p>
              <p>Lawmakers say they want to tighten restrictions on the remaining, yet-to-be-released $350 billion block of bailout money before more cash is handed out. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the department is trying to step up its monitoring of bank spending.</p>
              <p>"What we've been doing here is moving, I think, with lightning speed to put necessary programs in place, to develop them, implement them, and then we need to monitor them while we're doing this," Paulson said at a recent forum in New York. "So we're building this organization as we're going."</p>
              <p>Warren, the congressional watchdog appointed by Democrats, said her oversight panel will try to force the banks to say where they've spent the money.</p>
              <p>"It would take a lot of nerve not to give answers," she said.</p>
              <p>But Warren said she's surprised she even has to ask.</p>
              <p>"If the appropriate restrictions were put on the money to begin with, if the appropriate transparency was in place, then we wouldn't be in a position where you're trying to call every recipient and get the basic information that should already be in public documents," she said.</p>
              <p>Garrett, the New Jersey congressman, said the nation might never get a clear answer on where hundreds of billions of dollars went.</p>
              <p>"A year or two ago, when we talked about spending $100 million for a bridge to nowhere, that was considered a scandal," he said.</p>
              <p>Associated Press writers Stevenson Jacobs in New York and Christopher S. Rugaber and Daniel Wagner in Washington contributed to this report.</p>

              <p>US is a 2 party political state. The Fed is a democratic attempt to be an independent overseer of taxpayer's monies and govt fiscal policies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But like any human enterprise made up of flawed equal humans, the fed is not a model of perfection and subjected to errors, for there is no perfection in the mortal world, made more so by patronage, which is why a lobbyist can earn $500,00 a year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite the glaring flawws we all face now, it is too late for the blame game. Should we shut down all biz enterprise now just to repair the flaws, which may take decades just to unravel the mess, and everyone else in the meantime starve to death?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Better we repair the flaws on the go, matching spending CONCURRENTLY.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who can only physically deal or see in thousands or hundred of thousand dollars daily, $8 trillion is an incomprehensible amount.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But for those who are versed in international trade, an even more incomprehensible US$6,000 trillion changes hand annually.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to IMF, global economic output stands at an estimated US$6,000 trillion per year, which means $6,000 trillion had been paid for goods and services rendered.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While i will not claim 100% of that amt is in US dollars, it would stand well for everyone to know that a significant portion of international trade is conducted in US dollars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what is a piddling $8 trillion to stimulate the economy?</p>

              <p>Gambling?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you invest in an unknown or 'word of mouth' entity, for high returns in a short time, that's gambling.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, when you invest in a company that deals with necessary products crucial to mankind, that's not gambling but true investments for future wealth and growth to the industry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mankind still has needs. For example, with or without recession, humans need food, water, home and medical attention, at its basic level.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Majority of companies that survived till today are dealing with such products and would see growth. Only that it had been hit by lack of confidence by consumers who had hoard up their monies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To continue to hoard would be to let such companies fail, and in the end, with the lack of economies of scale and fiscal investments, such companies will collapse and mankind will starve or ill to death.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No govt is asking consumers to invest in Revlon or Gucci, Or use bailout funds to buy Prada bags. Therefore, govt's bailout funds are meant for viable companies that creates necessary goods or services to keep mankind employed with the means to survive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This isnt gambling. It's survival of our species.</p>

              <p>Perhaps there's a strategic purpose behind being a financial hub. The finance market exists to allocate resources better to produce goods and services. By making itself as such, S'pore will hopefully become even more entwined to the world, such that S'pore can't fall. Imagine, resources to be channeled to the region becomes disrupted because the finance market crashes....hmm.</p>
