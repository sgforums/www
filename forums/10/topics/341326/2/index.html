              <p><br>The finance market is essentially where credits are traded.</p>
              <p>These credits include loans.</p>
              <p>A firm needs loans to secure the resources they need. Otherwise where do they get their $$ from? They need to start somewhere.</p>
              <p>This is why banks exists.....and why the financial market exists. To facilitate this type of exchange, amongst other types.</p>
              <p>The finance market is like a "middle-man" to transmit signals from the goods and services market to the guys holding the dough. That's why it can be said to be helping in the allocation of resources.</p>

              <p><br>Again...name calling without even trying to make a sound argument. If you want to call something a "conspiracy theory", then at least have the guts to disprove it instead of running away like some spineless coward. Ironically, it is that same guts that cause you to disregard anything that you don't agree with. Use your brains for once. The fractional reserve system is no conspiracy theory. It is the monetary system that exists today.</p>
              <p>Tell me the fractional reserve system is a "conspiracy theory". Do it. Do it and show your ignorance to everyone. And while you're at it, how about you explain how money is created today.</p>
              <p>Ron Paul might be a politician, but at least he has the courage to say what no other lying scumbag dares to.</p>
              <p>I don't deny that all government officials are not elected. The point is whether elected officials have the independence to run the country without interference from outside influence. If the president appoints someone to run a ministry and that person hires his own employees, nothing is wrong. But if the president is given a list to choose from, from the same people that run the ministry, something is wrong right? Where is the real power? And we're talking about the central bank of the world's former superpower.</p>
              <p>And by the way, nice try, 'guilt by association'. Probably only similarly deluded people buy it.</p>

Not only that, but the money is created when the Fed loans it to the US Govt. So you have a situation where this two factors work to enslave people economically.

              <p><br>Oh..those are literary devices.</p>
              <p>As for my evidence, I've pointed out that the fractional reserve system creates money out of nothing, as debt. The central bank loans money to the US Govt at interest. Who says this doesnt create debt? And this system is controlled in the US by the privately-owned Federal Reserve.</p>
              <p>As for the history of how the Federal Reserve was set up, including Woodrow Wilson's regret, its all on the public domain and can be easily verified even if its not accepted in the much-vaunted MSM. If that means that this is a "conspiracy theory", then so be it.</p>
              <p>If you say M3 isn't the total supply of money in the economy, or disagree with what I say, then its only right that you present opposing evidence instead of engage in name calling. I thought that was just civilised behaviour. Stop running away when you're called out on your despicable bahaviour.</p>

              <p>I agree in general on what you say but does not seem concrete enough on the take of singapore financial hub as you said earlier on.</p>
              <p>I agree in general :</p>
              <p>Eg . For mega projects, eg IR . I rem a few banks joint up to give credit for financing the development of the IR. And also bank lends money to each other too .  </p>
              <p>Seem weak :</p>
              <p>There are tons of SME in sinagpore , the amount of financing that they require are hardly in the sum that what a local bank cannot supply.</p>
              <p>Seem weak :</p>
              <p>If we talk about mega projects , I think a lot projects are initiatied by the government.</p>
              <p>Of cause , being initiatied does not mean they pay too as it depends on the nature of the projects (eg , DBOO , DBOT etc . )</p>

              <p>This is a crisis now. I had already mentioned, there are flaws inherent in any man made system. The Fed had been wrong under Greenspan, and it is being righted now. It is easier to condemn using hindsight. </p>
              <p><strong>It is too late to play the blame game. The world needs to spend, otherwise when massive unemployment occurs, civil strife and chaos will begin, new dark age will descend. AND THAT IS ALL I AM CONCERN ABOUT!</strong></p>
              <p>And your arguments about fractional reserve banking is something which no mainstream economists will ever accept, even in these times because it is based on non mainstream economic theories, akin to your favourite conspiracy theories.</p>
              <p>Only your kind that believe Elvis is alive will take that leap of faith and harp on it as a root cause for recessions. I wonder if Milton Friedman, the man famous for his 'hand of market' and taught unfetted capitalism which led to this crisis was an Elvis fan.</p>
              <p>Thus, i will leave you to your rant against 'debt based monetary system', and i remind you, this is only M3 you are riled against. Banks still have other categories of M to fall back on. Afterall, it is your right to be ignorant and ignore the bigger picture on why the market fell - confidence.</p>

              <p>It is precisely because there is a crisis that we have the opportunity to right the root of the problem, which is uncontrolled monetary creation by the privately-owned Fed. Its no use trying to implement a 'solution' when it doesnt solve the root problem right? I'm sure you agree with this. Its not something only "conspiracy theorists" believe in.</p>
              <p>I dont see how your argument against a "debt based monetary system" and M3 is related. M3 just refers to the total supply of money in an economy. If the US government took money creation into its own hands, then money wouldnt be created as debt and we wouldnt be having this argument. But as it is, the Fed loans money to the US Govt at interest, which spends it into circulation. Can you explain how that doesn't create debt without engaging in ad hominems, if you're so sure that reality is otherwise?</p>
              <p>Answer this: If a belief is non-mainstream, does it automatically make it a lie? Does it? But it seems that you overlook cohesive arguments when dealing with "non-mainstream" arguments and reacting in an emotional way.</p>
              <p>You're ignoring the big picture when you take for granted the fundamentals of the financial system and instead focus on some secondary factor.</p>
              <p>As Aldous Huxley wrote: "Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored."</p>

              <p>Why not you decide? After all, this is the net, you have the freedom of choice and i will never impose my viewpoints on you, even rudely, nor have the power to do so.</p>
              <p>To me, always. the human life is precious. 8 trillion dollars is nothing if it can be use to save lives, many lives. I dont know about you.</p>

              <p>A man prints a 10 dollar bill on his home PC and buys a 1.50 bread. Thus he has committed the crime of counterfeiting and cheating.</p>
              <p>The Federal reserves prints out 8 trillion in treasury bonds, use it to pay the Middle East and South America countries for their natural resources and it is regarded as saving lives.</p>
              <p>I really like the logic here.</p>
