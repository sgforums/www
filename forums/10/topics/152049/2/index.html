            <div class='col-md body'><ol type="1"><br>[*]The officials were wrong to walk out on Dr Mahathir's speech, even though they might disagree with what he is talking about. Basic courtesy, of which the lack of is displayed with rampant arrogance by US and many Western European countries.<br><br>Never mind that they are doing it out of protest. As diplomats, they ought to conduct themselves better than that.<br><br>[*]The unsanctioned war in itself is a controversial subject. True, while life under Saddam was bearable, would the US intervention produce a better life in the long run? Were they confident enough to stay the course, willing to bear the brunt of multiple casualties to bring about the desired end state in Iraq? On the converse side, the will of the Iraqis could not have been reliable: Did they want, or not want US intervention? It is impossible to tell. Firstly, the independence of their thinking has been influenced by Saddam's horrifying regime, and as put by some here, "a lie repeated often enough becomes the truth".<br><br>[*]The subject of Dr Mahatair's lamblast is also due for scrutiny: Historically, he has been the most vocal critic, to put mildly; an opponent to the US and Western European countries, and his criticisms should be put into the context of his inherent bias. Was he venting, or did he had a point with the attitudes of these countries?<br></ol><br><br>These are points those officials ought to ponder, instead of walking out like that. Doesn't that look reminscent of a child stomping off when a parent declines to buy her a gift?</div>
