            <div class='col-md body'>will we? what does it tell us about our "brilliant" and " elite" leaders? is it true that the singapore education system produced nothing but slow-witted, narrow minded morons? let me list out all of our attempted "grand projects":<br><br>late 1980's to early 90's - plan to become a financial &amp; banking hub failed miserably following the rise of shanghai and the business genius of hong kong. the government's plan to match the swiss standard of living was an outright disaster.<br><br>early 1990's - plan to become a tourism hub failed. haw par villa, tang dynasty city, sentosa all failed to attract enough visitors to even sustain operation costs.<br><br>mid 1990's - plan to become an IT hub failed terribly. dot com bubble burst, adding to the spectacular collapse of our seemingly uber-optimistic plan to become the IT capital of asia.<br><br>late 1990's - plan to become a business hub failed. singapore's square graduates failed to generate any appeal to leading financial companies, lacked expertise and experience in the field of commerce.<br><br>early 2000 to 2004, plans to become a biotech, educational and entertainment hub failed. countries with cheaper labour costs or more r&amp;d funds edged us out of the competition in the bio-tech field. educational institutions still failed to provide a world class education that appealed to foreign students, lost out to emerging education powerhouses like australia. the building of fancy arts complexes like the esplanade failed to attract visitors, there was a nice arts centre, but THERE WEREN'T ANY FAMOUS ARTWORKS FOR PEOPLE TO VIEW. censorship also hindered progress of the entertainment industry.<br><br>after reading all the examples above, do you honestly think our plan to become a tourism and a las vegas style casino/hotel hub will work out? i seriously have my doubts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason for so repeated failures in all the projects you mentioned are simple:-<br><br>(1)  To much self-confidence about top-leadership (Self-ness or IQ)<br><br>(2)  Neglecting to build teamwork, coordination and knowledge applications at all levels. (Teamwork or EQ)<br><br>(3)  Lack of true management excellence - ideas, decisions and policies are rhetorics and not translated into result-oriented and people-friendly accountable processes to get results.<br><br>(Read recommendations on good corporate governance at market place) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
