It is inherent in almost every written piece out there. You cannot realistically cover an issue from ALL angles; There is always some cuckoo out there that has funny ideas of his own. In fact, arguably, the very act of covering an issue can be seen as bias since that means that some other event is not being covered.<br><br>But the BBC at least tries to balance their reports by providing the more reasonable alternative views and to allow people with reasonable alternative views a right of reply.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, that probably did some good. But I have the feeling that it only came to pass because the editor decided that it was not a political issue.<br><br>Now, I have noticed that in recent years, the govt (and consequently SPH) has relaxed its attitudes towards the media. The NKF and the CST training incident are, I think, evidence of that relaxed attitude.<br><br>But just because they have improved does not mean they are great. Eg. An F9 student can be the most improved student, but that doesn't really say much about his ability as a student.</div>
