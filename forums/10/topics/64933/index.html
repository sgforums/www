            <div class='col-md body'>The N.C.M.P. : Naked Cock Maid Photographer<br><br>From hero to zero, a sentiment that seems to epitomise the revelations of Steve Chia, the much revered Internet MP, the guy who incidentally coaxed the White Horse out of its cloistered stables deep in the annexes of MinDef a couple of weeks ago.<br><br>The TVD crew is more disappointed than pissed with Stevie, every young strapping guy of course has their "weaknesses", extra-marital affairs, the occasional flings with women ... the only difference is of course when you are a "nobody" and when you are a "somebody". Knowing that you are an Opposition politcian with quite a decent following, perhaps a bit of self control, namely NOT to get into a position where your integrity can be compromised, should have been foremost in your head. The game of politics is a dirty game, some whispers in the forums suggest that the "timing" of Stevie's disgrace, after his success in dragging the White Horse out to the open, has X-files undertones. The seemingly irrational behaviour of the wife in dragging the issue to the public domain by making a police report is also mind-boggling to say the least, though our female TVD crew will wanna beg to differ with this viewpoint. Whatever the case, X-files or not, the simple fact is this : you know you're Opposition so always expect that you will be incarcerated in the open when a misdemeanour occurs. No one is immortal or immune; and when you are an Opposition member in the field of Singapore politics, your life is as fragile as a candle flame in the midst of a tsunami.<br><br>This is the main disappointment, Stevie did not foresee this kind of incarceration. As a politician, he failed because he was not crafty or cunning enough to blur his infidelity. Trying to act the loser in the news conference does not cut it in Singapore, it works for Clinton in the US coz having affairs is part and parcel of the culture there. At a personal level, we are ambivalent about the issue, so what? Stevie likes women, who doesn't?? BUT at a professional politician level, Stevie definitely cock-up and this is where the disappointment lies.<br><br>Our advice, salvage what you can Stevie, while the local Net community awaits The One to lead us out of the Paptrix.<br><br>Lau Ah Pek<br>22.12.03<br><br>PS : Those who have not voted for MiniStar Awards, final cheong hor!<br></div>
