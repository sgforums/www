By 18 yrs, they are studying and practising concepts and subjects that adults usually are familiar with. Furthermore, 18 years old "children" or "boys" are drafted into National Service and perform adult tasks (like shooting a weapon and taking chargeable responsibilities). and oh yes..they are sexually mature, capable of giving birth...eG StandardChart Easisave bank account cannot accept depositers under 21. All those under 21 must go for "Children" account. I wanted to sigh up buy it's sounds wierd for a 19 years old guy to sigh up "Children" account...<br><br>And to add on, 16 years olds can engage in sexual intercourse, but in government's view not deemed matured enough to watch R(A) films? Does tat makes sense?<br><br>Anyway it's pretty pointless to call 18,19 or 20 years old as "children"?<br><br></div></blockquote>So what's your point?  Are you complaining about the bank or our Gov?<br><br>If you complain about our Gov, what's the real difference between 18 and 21?<br><br>16 - allowed to fornicate, NC 16, Juvenile Court<br><br>18 - official smoke, drink, go geylang, driving, M18, Not sure about law<br><br>21 -  RA 21 Film, Charge under full extend of the Law for all criminial/civil blah<br><br>So the point is, basically you are already able to do what you want when you are eighteen.  With the exception you can "siam" or get lesser sentence if you get a run in with the law. I dont see that as a bad point.<br><br>On a Lighter note:<br><br>5 years later *whine* 18 - LEGAL AGE<br><br>10 years later *more whining* 16- LEGAL AGE<br><br>12 years later *worse whining* Puberty - Legal Age + Adulthood<br><br>Then you get 12 year old Man gets charge for Rape of 10 year old woman and gets sentence of 10 years in jail?<br><br>P.S.

Are you complaining about the bank or our Gov?<br><br>If you complain about our Gov, what's the real difference between 18 and 21?<br><br>16 - allowed to fornicate, NC 16, Juvenile Court<br><br>18 - official smoke, drink, go geylang, driving, M18, Not sure about law<br><br>21 -  RA 21 Film, Charge under full extend of the Law for all criminial/civil blah<br><br>So the point is, basically you are already able to do what you want when you are eighteen.  With the exception you can "siam" or get lesser sentence if you get a run in with the law. I dont see that as a bad point.<br><br>On a Lighter note:<br><br>5 years later *whine* 18 - LEGAL AGE<br><br>10 years later *more whining* 16- LEGAL AGE<br><br>12 years later *worse whining* Puberty - Legal Age + Adulthood<br><br>Then you get 12 year old Man gets charge for Rape of 10 year old woman and gets sentence of 10 years in jail?<br><br>P.S. By the TIME they make any such changes you are already over 21 years old anyway.</div></blockquote>No Im not complaining, I am just suggesting wat i feel is "politically" correct reason, anyway this topic supposed to be posted up last year, but was closed by FireIce cos I wanted move topic from Aunt agony to chit chat  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Anyway Im 20 going 21 liao so it's doesnt matter to me anyway</div>

It's not in the games that you play, nor the activities you participate in. The age of adulthood is one whereby the state deems that you are psychologically able to make a rational decision.
