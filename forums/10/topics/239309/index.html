A sec sch student asked that exact same question as you and do you know what they answered? They answered back by saying they believe that if the teenagers did not expose to pornography, the teenagers will not want to try to have sex.<br><br>Which I think might be quite true, however...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Nonsense.....!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Its in human nature to be curious about sex, and its the mindset that counts, IF!!!!!!!!! they blame it, on pornography, then WHY THE HECK, DID THEY WANT TO SURF PORNOGRAPHY IN THE FIRST PLACE, like i said, those teenage can be ignorant at times, they don't know what they are saying, still want to act as if they are adult.<br><br>ONE GOD DAMN THING IS FOR SURE, CAN YOU BLOODY EVEN VOTE, if you can't vote, why should the government give a damn to you, now if any teenage wants to claim rights, then FFS, at least, type in proper english, so that people can understand what your intended message, to me, you, TS, you are whining.</div>
