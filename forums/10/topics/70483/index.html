            <div class='col-md body'>Yes I understand your grounds Mooku. Thank you for your opinions.<br><br>The Censorship Review Board, headed by Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan is established early last year. They have established some guidelines in regards to content and material suitable for the general public's viewing. They are obvious guidelines, (public nudity; Think Hugo Ng and his shaving of his pubic hair and drinking his urine) and bestiality... etc. )<br><br>However, no proper regulations are established on "suitable or non suitable" content. Material is still subjected to cuts or complete censor if deemed inappropriate.<br><br>They have established guideline, like ratings for entertaintment. (18+ viewership) because they have stated that censorship is a protection for the youths. So how then are we able to say (or them) that a certain material is not appropriate?<br><br>Forgive me if I have have stated things which may be falseible. This is an open discussion in which I am genuinely interested in your responses.<br><br>Thanks again</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>err well... artistic expression should never be done in the public eye if it's deemed offensive by asian society e.g. nudity along orchard road...<br><br>Who are to judge if material is suitable for public viewing or not.. Maybe in the case of censorship of materials such as films or art exhibitions, regulations should be loosened alot more since it's mostly up to personal self to decide if you want to view the material or not. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Otherwise for materials that the public may be exposed to involuntarily, these should undergo some form of control...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very well said Mooku.<br>The question can now be reinterpretated as. To what extent should censorship be enforced?

            <div class='col-md body'>My views?? It's not so much content censorship and regulation that has hindered artistic expressionism but rather, the lack of support and sponsorship.<br><br>In Singapore, the regulations on art performances is limited to the annual submission of scripts to (was it MITA?? or NAC?? can't recall) the authorities for approval before performance and this has been extended to once in 3 years instead of annually in the lates censorship review committee report. The reason for this regulation to be in place is so that we can sift the obscene acts from the artistic ones. Remember the incident where a guy snipped his pubic hair in public and drank urine? If Beatrice Chia's production with the title f*cking &amp; shopping can be put up and even win awards, i don't see a problem in regulations placed on artistic expression.<br><br>The arts arena in Singapore takes a super long time to grow and in some cases, arts organisations sputter out of life and died because of the lack of support from local community and sponsorship. It's a natural bias that exists in Singaporeans that anything foreign is good but local productions are deemed poor. Just look at and compare the ticket sales of productions like Les Miserables with local musicals / plays. While international acts have the standards and garner almost 100% attendance for all their shows, good-quality local productions are considered lucky if they could score a 60% and above attendance on weekend shows.<br><br>Given this kind of unsupportive, Pinkleton-syndrome type of environment, can you blame the arts community for losing enthusiasm and creativity in artistic expression?</div>
