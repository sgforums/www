              <p>Singapore – Safe haven for Asian fugitives.<br> <img src="http://i1242.photobucket.com/albums/gg527/jasongreen11/BAMBANGSUTRISNOPICTURE2.jpg" border="0" alt=""><img src="http://s1242.photobucket.com/albums/gg527/jasongreen11/?action=view&amp;current=HANSEN1.png" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> At first glance, Bambang Sutrisno looks like your average Indonesian 
              Chinese. Born in 1941 and of slight build, he walks along the streets of
               Singapore just like any other tourists from Indonesia.<br> <br> <br> However, Bambang Sutrisno is anything but your average Indonesian 
              Chinese. Convicted of corruption in Indonesia, sentenced to life 
              imprisonment and with an Interpol Red Notice issued against him, he is 
              one of Indonesia's top wanted fugitives. Like many other Indonesian 
              fugitives, he resides in Singapore.<br> <br> <br> Bambang Sutrisno together with brother Benny Suherman made their 
              fortunes by linking up with Suwikatmono, the cousin of then President 
              Suharto, to established PT Suptan Film. PT Suptan Film gave birth to 
              Cineplex 21, which hosted 650 movie screens in Indonesia.  <br> <br> <br> Due to disagreements, Benny Suherman and Bambang Sutrisno's 
              relationship turned hostile in the mid 1980s. Bambang left PT Suptan 
              Film to start up his own supermarket chain business, the well-known 
              Golden Truly chain, in Indonesia. Bambang Sutrisno then joined the 
              banking business and set up Bank Surya. In both Gold Truly and Bank 
              Surya, Suwikatmono – cousin of President Suharto -- was once again 
              involved as a partner and shareholder.  <br> <br> <br> In 1997, during the economic financial crisis, the Indonesian 
              government gave banks such as Bank Surya funds as a buffer against the 
              crisis and Bambang Sutrisno embezzled Rp1.5 trillion from the Bank Surya
               and fled to neighboring Singapore.  <br> <br> <br> Bambang Sutrisno was convicted of embezzlement in absentia in 1999 and sentenced to life imprisonment.<br> <br> <br> Meanwhile, for more almost two decades now, Bambang Sutrisno has been 
              living the high life in Singapore. He has two sons and a daughter.<br> <br> <img src="http://i1242.photobucket.com/albums/gg527/jasongreen11/HANSEN1.png" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> His youngest son Hansen Sutrisno was born in Indonesia in 1985 and was 
              raised in Indonesia. With his ill-gained money, Bambang Sutrisno sent 
              his youngest son Hansen Sutrisno to attend Kuo Chuan Presbyterian 
              Secondary School in Singapore before attending Kings College London and 
              City University in the United Kingdom where he read his Bachelor's and 
              Master's degrees in Management – all paid for with stolen money.<br> <br> <br> The Indonesian government has tried to extradite Bambang but Singapore 
              argues that because its laws are based on English common law and 
              Indonesian law is based on Dutch codes, the two systems are 
              incompatible, making an extradition treaty difficult.  <br> <br> <br> And recently, Hansen Sutrisno has found employment in one of Singapore's largest banks as well – allegedly the OCBC bank.<br> <br> <br> For Indonesian Chinese dragon sons such as Hansen Sutrisno, it seems 
              that it doesn't matter where daddy's golden spoon comes from, as long as
               Daddy keeps feeding them well. And that seems to be the stance 
              Singapore is adopting as well when it comes to Asian fugitives.<br> <br> <br> Written by: John Green.</p>
