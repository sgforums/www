She
              received her Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Malaya, and
              subsequently immigrated to Singapore where she continued to work and
              further her postgraduate education at the University of Singapore. She
              obtained her Ph.D. in Applied Linguistics from the National University
              of Singapore. She subsequently attended Columbia University and the
              University of California, Berkeley, in 1990 as a Fulbright Scholar. She
              worked as a teacher initially, and later as a project director with the
              Curriculum Development Institute of Singapore, and a specialist
              lecturer teaching Socio-Linguistics and Literature with the Regional
              English Language Centre. She left her professional career to be a
              full-time writer in 1992. Her works include novels, short story
              collections, poetry and non-fiction.<br> <br> KRC: In your article entitled “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_PAP_and_the_people_-_A_Great_Affective_Divide">PAP and the People – A Great Affective Divide</a>“, you pointed out a trend and we quote:<br> <br> <em>“But the disaffection remains largely coffee-house and cocktail
              party rhetoric only. Singaporeans continue to prefer the cover of
              anonymity. One reason may be the fear that the outspoken person will be
              marked out and victimised; another may be the sheer presence of so much
              proof of concrete well-being, such as a good job, a good bank account,
              a comfortable lifestyle.Whatever the reason, the negative feelings go
              underground. Now subterranean hostility is all the more insidious for
              being that, and has away of surfacing in the most trenchant way, for
              example, applauding any rambunctious opposition party member in
              pre-election rallies.”<br> <br> 15 years have passed since your article made the headlines. To what
              extent is the current reality in Singapore today consistent with the
              aforementioned that you have highlighted years ago? Why?</em><br> <br> <strong>CL:I would like to believe that in 15 years, the situation had
              substantially improved, but the current reality still bears the same
              marks of a people too fearful to speak out their minds. If there
              appears to be greater openness, it is exactly this – appearance only.
              For while people readily make use of the anonymity afforded by the
              Internet, sometimes in the most rambunctious way,no one dares to
              challenge the OB markers* in the conventional media that remains the
              platform for political debate. And in any case, as was true 15 years
              ago (and will probably be true for the next 15), Singaporeans are so
              materially comfortable that even if they disagree with certain PAP
              policies, they are content to leave the work of disagreement and debate
              to the tiny ( oh so regrettably tiny!) minority of dissenting voices.</strong><br> <br> *Wikipedia definition for OB markers – OB marker, short for “out of
              bounds marker”, is a term used in Singapore to denote what topics are
              permissible for public discussion.<br> <br> KRC: Since your 1994 article, there has been a change in Prime Minister
              guard with PM Lee Hsien Loong now in charge. Do you have reasons to
              believe that the OB markers have evolved since the change in guard or
              have they remained the same? Why?<br> <br> <strong>CL:<span style="font-size: medium;">There is a tendency for people
              to believe that there have been sweeping changes, starting with Goh
              Chok Tong and being extended, reinforced and magnified by Lee Hsien
              Loong. I have often pointed out, in my political commentaries that yes,
              there have been very conspicuous changes, BUT NOT IN THE POLITICAL
              DOMAIN. Indeed, if anything, this area, far from keeping up with the
              other domains of industry, trade, business, education, the arts, etc.
              has shrivelled into a backwater – note the demise of political clubs
              like the Roundtable and the Socratic Club and the unlikelihood of
              similar ones emerging in the present political landscape. People – both
              Singaporeans and foreign visitors – have been so dazzled by the
              spectacular liberalisation permitted in virtually every area of
              national life and enterprise, that they have been completely blinded to
              its total absence in the one area essential for the political maturity
              of the society. People sometimes tell me, ‘See, so many letters
              critical of the government in the papers! We never had that before’,
              and I want to remind them that the issues raised are non-political
              ones, for instance on foreign workers, CPF, casinos, maids, etc. ,
              exactly the kind of criticism that the government is happy to receive.</span></strong><br> <br> KRC: Your two political commentary essays drew a strong response from
              the then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. Do you believe that the Prime
              Minister’s response has discouraged those out there from attempting to
              challenge the OB markers? Why?<br> <br> <strong>CL:Yes. After my commentaries, there appeared to be a retreat of the
              critics. There have been sporadic voices, such as Mr Brown’s, but it
              only needs a stern response from the government to shut them up.</strong><br> <br> KRC: We are currently living in the Lee Hsien Loong era. Do you have
              any suggested ways whereby the younger Singaporeans of today can
              attempt to negotiate OB markers if there are any?<br> <br> <strong>CL:I take heart from the fact that the Prime Minister has openly and
              publicly stated his mission of winning the hearts and minds of younger
              Singaporeans; indeed, he has little choice, since they will form a very
              significant percentage of the electorate in future elections, and also
              because the thought of losing large numbers of talented, highly
              educated, bright young men and women, through emigration, must be a
              constant nightmare. I would like to see a greater political awareness
              in young Singaporeans and a greater commitment to a public role, though
              not necessarily through entering politics. Again and again, I have
              exhorted them, through my commentaries and speeches, to ‘think through,
              stand up, speak up, and try not to be too afraid’. For honesty of
              intention, strength of purpose and courage of conviction count for a
              lot with the PAP government which, despite its inherent dislike of
              opposition and conflict, must have a grudging respect for these
              qualities even in the most recalcitrant opponents!</strong><br> <br> KRC:What advice do you have for a local literary (or artistic) talent
              who wishes to produce a piece of work that reflects a critical view of
              political realities in Singapore?<br> <br> <strong>CL:<span style="color: blue;">No matter what vehicle you use
              to express your views, you must take an informed and principled
              approach. Nothing can ever take the place of honesty and sincerity of
              purpose and the courage of one’s convictions.</span> This kind of approach has no place for self-serving opportunism which in any case is quickly exposed.</strong><br> <br> KRC: Earlier this year, the government made amendments to the Films Act
              to “ease an 11-year-old ban on films that promote a politician or
              political party”. Do you think that is a step forward or a step
              backward? Why?<br> <br> <strong>CL:In general, I applaud any change that frees up the arts scene,
              and deplore any change that only PURPORTEDLY does so, that is, it comes
              flanked by so many conditions that it loses all utility ( like the
              Speaker’s Corner), especially if the conditions are so constructed as
              to be interpreted in the government’s favour in the event of a
              disagreement.</strong><br> <br> KRC:What is your opinion on the topic of women’s engagement in Singapore politics (inclusive of ruling party and opposition)?<br> <br> <strong>CL:I am all for ANY concerned Singaporean, regardless of gender,
              race, age, profession, ideology,etc. coming forward to be actively
              engaged in politics. The operative word is of course ‘concerned’; it
              seems to me that as long as Singaporeans are genuinely caring about
              social and political issues in their society and have its well-being at
              heart, they should make their voices heard.<br> </strong><br> KRC:Recently, you posted an interesting question to Minister Mentor (MM) Lee Kuan Yew and we quote:<br> <br> <em>“Sir, in the event of a serious threat of a freak election, would you do the unthinkable, that is, send in the army?”</em><br> <br> It was also a concern that was highlighted earlier in the Kent Ridge
              Common. Hence, do you mind sharing with us your concern on this topic
              of ‘freak’ elections results that prompted you to quiz MM on the topic?<br> <br> <strong>CL:For a long time, I have been interested in and fascinated by the
              special kind of democracy that is practised in accordance with the Lee
              Kuan Yew model of governance that indeed defines Singapore politics. It
              is essentially a sternly pragmatic, no-nonsense approach that has
              little patience with the noise and messiness of the liberal Western
              model. Its chief ( and only?) concession to the western model that was
              a necessary part of the colonial legacy, is the holding of free
              elections. Beyond that, the PAP government will only select those
              aspects that are good for Singapore’s political stability and material
              well-being, notably capitalism, of which Singapore is probably the best
              exponent in this part of the world.<span style="color: blue;"> My question was prompted by my interest in seeing how far the PAP
              government, while Mr Lee Kuan Yew is still around, will go. Will it
              send in the army to retain its power, even if it means making itself a
              pariah in the free world of which it is a permanent member?</span></strong></p>
              <p>KRC: The New York Times described you as a leading voice for liberalism
              and it is difficult to disagree with that. However, do you believe that
              the liberalisation process in Singapore will only make huge strides
              when MM Lee finally leaves the political scene or there is still a
              chance that the process can make huge progress even when he is still
              around. Why?<br> <br> <strong>CL:Even Mr Lee’s most severe critics will allow for the fact that
              without him, Singapore would never be in the fortunate position it is
              today. <span style="color: red;">Mr Lee’s special model of governance which
              had no place for dissent was useful during those early difficult years
              of Singapore’s life as an independent nation, when his knuckleduster
              approach was exactly what was needed to get rid of those unruly
              elements that would surely have destroyed the society.</span><span style="color: blue;"> But the situation today is different, indeed so vastly different in
              terms of a more mature, more highly educated, more exposed electorate,
              that post-Lee, the model will necessarily undergo changes to be
              relevant at all.</span> For one thing, Mr Lee’s practice of
              suing political dissidents is likely to simply fade away, because it
              won’t go down well with a younger, emboldened electorate.</strong><br> <br> KRC:You have been a writer for a good number of years and have a number
              of best selling works under your name and a few other pieces that
              contain fingerprints of your engagement of our local politics. Care to
              share with us the high points and low points of your career thus far?<br> <br> <strong>CL:In general I can say I have been extremely lucky as a writer,
              having had help all the way, for instance, through the generosity of Mr
              Robert Yeo, a fellow writer who, more than 30 years ago, got Heinemann
              to publish my first book, a collection of short stories called ‘Little
              Ironies’. Also I had the good luck to be the only writer writing in
              English at the time, which made me somewhat of a novelty, and you know
              how helpful that can be!</strong><br> <br> The Kent Ridge Common would like to thank Dr Catherine Lim for her
              consent to our interview. We would like to wish Catherine all the best
              in her future endeavours. We definitely look forward to future best
