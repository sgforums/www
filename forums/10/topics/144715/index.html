NOT in our country!.   Government has been depending on us FOR SO LONG to finance their investments, some reckless ones, with our CPF, COE, ERP, overpriced HDB apartments, contributions etc...<br><br>PAP's so-called visions are nothing but flops here and there.<br><br>Why want us to have babies now when we were told to stop at two in the 70s?  You call this a visionary Government?<br><br>Why build the marina barrage now, they call it a vision in the ground breaking ceremony,  when we should have built the  barrage 30 years ago!
