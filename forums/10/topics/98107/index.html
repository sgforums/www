Ok, let's see, last year got SARS but it has 46% return! Why?

Both reports the truth - half-truths. And the best information is always to get it from the source rather than read up commentaries. Commentaries tend to start with a bias objectives. So, they will only quote figures which favors their arguments.<br><br>So, both reports are bias. And I can see why. ST wants to put Temasek in good light, while external reports tends to criticised other economies while boasting how good their own economy are.<br><br>Lesson again is to read more widely and never trust information from only one source. I would even doubt the source if necessary when I see reason for them to have an agenda of their own.</div>

And even then, u indicated in your words u donÂ’t really know, and arent sure of those numbers osoÂ…Â….so really just guessing rite, or to put it nicely, educated guess, since u have econs degree.<br><br>As for profits and losses:<br>i havent looked at the entire report. but from page 46 onwards of my acrobat reader are details of each listed company's performanceÂ…..and there are a lot of them! as i scroll through, there are details of profits and losses for particular years. If u really interested to know, read and calculate lor..Â…..<br><br>frankly i think when doing business and making investments, there will be times when profits are made, and times when losses are made. that is the nature/risks of business and investments...cannot expect every year more and more money made, and the profit graph only going up, but never down.<br><br>world economy changes, industries oso change, property prices can oso go up or down, demand for particular goods/services can oso go up or down..... as the report indicates, even in the same year, some temasek companies made money, some lost moneyÂ…..depends on which industry and industry conditions then.<br><br>Besides hor, my sister reading news reports oso said temasek has national goalsÂ….they do not operate just based on purely commercial goals. So temsek may invest in say some high tech manufacturing company even though it may not always offer the best returnsÂ…..just so that singapore can gain a foothold in that industry in the future.<br><br>when losses made, people shouldnt scream and accuse the company of being evil lah, cheating money lah, losing taxpayer's money lahÂ…...all that very unreasonable rite. wah! and when people STILL complain when profits made.....i dunno wat to say.<br><br>no businessman even if he just owns a provision shop can guarantee business will always be good and NEVER bad. always risks involved..Â….<br>even calculated risks are not 100% guaranteed or accurate.<br><br>and bottomline: they still make profits in last ten years!....people only disagree only whether MORE profits could have been made.<br><br>Ok dinner time lor!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would encourage all to read the report yourself before making conclusions. There is a lot of information in there and I am trying very hard to digest the information now.<br><br>The information within includes the breakdown of the investment by industry and Country.<br><br>Also, it seems everyone choose to quote the Total shareholder's return (TSR) by market value instead of TSR by shareholder fund. The former seems to be a bad measurement to me since it depends on how the stock market is doing at that time. This could also explain why the 10 years comparison is low since it is compared to a good year in stock exchange. The latter is more stable since it depends on the actual performance in those invested companies.<br><br>TSR by Market Value (I.e. X year Versus Y year market value)<br>30 years - 18%<br>10 years - 3%<br>5 years - 6%<br>3 years - 4%<br>2 years - 8%<br>1 year - 47%<br><br>TSR by shareholder fund (I.e. X year total asset Versus Y year total asset)<br>30 years - 16%<br>10 years - 10%<br>5 years - 9%<br>3 years - 8%<br>2 years - 8%<br>1 year - 15%<br><br>Still reading.
