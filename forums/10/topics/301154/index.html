            <div class='col-md body'>Hello friends. For your information, Lau Peet Meng has been in SPF for 13 years. Who says he's not experienced? Have you work with him before? If not, why do we say that he is inexperience because of his age? He has been heighligted in the straits time scholar classified b4 and he has his credentials too. He has been attach to UN and MOE before and even if even some scholars also don't have the chance to experience that. You thought SPF will put some young chap in a commander post and leave him to command on his own? Of course not. SPF is just like any organisation, he has to report to his immediate superior, who is Director, Operation Dept, who has at least 15 years of experience in the force. This is a step that everyone career person have to go through, and will definetly invite crities from those who can only dream of that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think if one choose to embark on a career in the Civil Service, he or she has to be prepared for cases like this. The government invests heavily on scholars, surely they must push them to take on higher responsibilities in order to get a good return on their 'investments'.<br><br>I will personally prefer to work for 'Equal Opportunity Employers' like Shell or Schlumberger.<br><br>No expressways for scholars here, only justified rewards for those who lead, work hard, innovate, and contribute to the company.</div>

Although I cannot quote you exact figures, there is an upward trend in the number of people who leave the service after their bond completion.<br>And of course, the government is not dumb. They have made significant improvements in the pay scale to try to retain these talents just before their bond is fully served. This is certainly a natural progression... afterall if you spent so much money investing in the scholar's education and what not, surely you would want him to stay a little longer.<br><br>But as Singaporeans become increasingly mobile, and their talents sought after internationally... i feel the top talents will still be drawn to the private sectors, both locally or abroad.</div>
