The families that stay intact are those with the wives keeping quiet about what the husband do, AS LONG AS, they stay outside. Don't think sg wives would be that tolerant.<br><br>If you bring in PRC women as maids, you don't bring in trouble into the house, you start the trouble from your house.<br><br>let me share this with you. No sg men or the wives would want to employ maids from the village, though they are very hardworking but their personal hygiene would take time to change. and if you choose one whose hygiene got no problem, can communicate with no problem, can handle modern kitchen, you probably have taken in one who has been living fairly good life in china, you will never find out why they want to be maids, until it is too late.<br><br>besides, too many sg men too confident in keeping distance too early, the 'it will never happen to me' type.<br><br>It is the same reason why there are thousands of philippino maids and indonesian maids in HK, but no families there would want to take the risk. The "yi nai" village is not very far from HK. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>this is no PRC chinese bashing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ofcourse there will be PRC chinese who want to be maid. They some will do anything to be a maid, as long as they can get out of China to pursue their quest to get rich. Right now, the HIT in china is all about 'Fa Chai' quickly. Main objective, "Fa Chai", Money is paramount and its everything.<br><br>Its like singapore in the 1850's arent most of our ancestors from southern provinces of china? They heard about singapore being some paradise, full of promise and riches?<br><br>Come to think about it, its is in our chinese blood dont you agree? We seem to worship material things more. Every new year, thousands of people will go pray, not just for good health or family, but main motive? $$$$$<br><br>And most are also very willing to "give" in the hopes of 'GETTING' more in return. RIght? yeah give more, hopefully get more later, strike 4d or toto or money drop from the sky..<br><br>So i think worshipping money is going on throughout the entire chinese community in this world.<br><br>China is developing so fast, everyone is spurred on to 'Make it'. It can spread real quick, see your neighbours getting rich one by one, even the most laidback will change.<br><br>Overnight millionaires are popping out every day, some even dont know how to spend it.<br><br>Example: coal mines. Just years ago, they were so poor, living like a 'nong ming'. Look whats happening now? China is in need of power for its booming industry. Coal mines are working overtime to excavate as much as their land can offer. We are talking about 300,000Rmb profits a day.<br><br>Then, there are the ones who are not that lucky. But they observe, they see their neighbours striking it rich, so quickly and so easy, they also want to be part of it.<br><br>Success or rather Money is probably their main motivating factor now.<br><br>My HK friend in the UK has a PRC maid currently. She gets paid 1200pounds per month. Thats roughly SGD$3600 per month.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> So, the PRC who comes to singapore are 2nd tier ones. The cream of the crop has already landed themselves in Japan, UK, Germany, France etc...<br><br>He's actually very happy with her, ie she cooks well, and actually look after them, sort of like the olden days 'Ah Ma Che" type. If you dont have appetite, she will nag at you.<br><br>Before this, he had a Malaysian maid. He said it was a real nightmare! He had to beg her to do things, and she questions everything, so he had to explain the logic behind everything he wants to be done. Sounds like army to me.

He had to beg her to do things, and she questions everything, so he had to explain the logic behind everything he wants to be done. Sounds like army to me.

            <div class='col-md body'>The ones from China that want to be maids are those from remote village with lesser hygiene, illiterate, you want those people to be your maids ?? if they are illiterate, what can they teach your kids ?? And for the ones that with good hygiene, high education are the ones from Shanghai, Beijing, Guandong, Shenzhen, and you think those people will come over to singapore just to be your maids ?? It would be a miracle if you can even find a shanghainese maid. Imagine introducing the maid to your neighbour or relatives "My maid is from Shanghai" LOL</div>
