They some will do anything to be a maid, as long as they can get out of China to pursue their quest to get rich. Right now, the HIT in china is all about 'Fa Chai' quickly. Main objective, "Fa Chai", Money is paramount and its everything.<br><br>Its like singapore in the 1850's arent most of our ancestors from southern provinces of china? They heard about singapore being some paradise, full of promise and riches?<br><br>Come to think about it, its is in our chinese blood dont you agree? We seem to worship material things more. Every new year, thousands of people will go pray, not just for good health or family, but main motive? $$$$$<br><br>And most are also very willing to "give" in the hopes of 'GETTING' more in return. RIght? yeah give more, hopefully get more later, strike 4d or toto or money drop from the sky..<br><br>So i think worshipping money is going on throughout the entire chinese community in this world.<br><br>China is developing so fast, everyone is spurred on to 'Make it'. It can spread real quick, see your neighbours getting rich one by one, even the most laidback will change.<br><br>Overnight millionaires are popping out every day, some even dont know how to spend it.<br><br>Example: coal mines. Just years ago, they were so poor, living like a 'nong ming'. Look whats happening now? China is in need of power for its booming industry. Coal mines are working overtime to excavate as much as their land can offer. We are talking about 300,000Rmb profits a day.<br><br>Then, there are the ones who are not that lucky. But they observe, they see their neighbours striking it rich, so quickly and so easy, they also want to be part of it.<br><br>Success or rather Money is probably their main motivating factor now.<br><br>[b]<span class="large"><span style="color: red;">My HK friend in the UK has a PRC maid currently</span></span></strong>. She gets paid 1200pounds per month. Thats roughly SGD$3600 per month.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> So, the PRC who comes to singapore are 2nd tier ones. The cream of the crop has already landed themselves in Japan, UK, Germany, France etc...<br><br>He's actually very happy with her, ie she cooks well, and actually look after them, sort of like the olden days 'Ah Ma Che" type. If you dont have appetite, she will nag at you.<br><br>Before this, he had a Malaysian maid. He said it was a real nightmare! He had to beg her to do things, and she questions everything, so he had to explain the logic behind everything he wants to be done. Sounds like army to me. Thinking soldier? or rather, thinking maid?<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>wtf r u talking about ????????????????????????????????<br><br>HK ? PRC ?? HK also are PRC .

It's either your HK friend bulls around or you got the currency wrong.  If they are currently paying HK$3480 for a filipino maid in HK, would they pay SGD 3600 a month for that so called high class maid.  Even if it's a 'mah che' type of service, she wont earn that much la.  Bull around in this NG because most of them are students here?  Yes, most students here dont even know what a pig-tail mah che is.<br><br>Employers themselves wont get S$3.6K a month.  How could a maid earn more than an employer?  Is your HK friend the equal of Mr Li Ka Shing or Dr Li Kwok Po??  I bet they will never pay that much for a maid.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not sure I want another PRC for maid or not... My parents hired this PRC part time maid... work tmd slow. 1 hour iron only five pieces of clothings. Even I, who is so pampered and rarely does housework can do better than her! Somemore iron until two of my shirts abit spoilspoil... I suspect it's her because before she came, my mother or previous maid iron also no problem. I ownself iron that time also no problem. But two of my shirts (and one of them is my favourite) goes POOF! the moment she came to iron our clothes!<br><br>I super annoyed sia.

            <div class='col-md body'>There are more PRC in the UK than most people think. Anyways, 1.2k pounds per month for a full time maid in the UK sounds fair. About 300pounds a week.<br>That is exactly what my friend is paying now. They live in a big victorian house, 5 blokes sharing the house, each with their own hectic lifestyles, so a full time maid was needed.<br><br>Plus, they tip her from time to time. Its just a token of appreciation for her services, doubt any employers will tip their maids here though.<br><br>But what i didnt mention was also the cost of living. 1.2k might seem alot when converted to SGD, but dont forget, a plate of roast duck rice in the UK cost abt 12 to 18 bucks. So its not a fair comparison.</div>
