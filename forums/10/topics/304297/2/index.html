I forgot to state earlier that one of the problems of jobs not being filled up back then before the influx of FTs came was partly due to our declining birth-rate. Its is even more so now that the government is so eager to boost our population.<br><br>As for the Malaysians working in Singapore, I am absolutely certain that they will NOT convert to PRs. If they can get 2.2 times the salary of what they can get back at home due to the stronger Singapore dollar. They will probably remain as Malaysian citizens as the Singapore government open-arms to them. Although they have their monthly salary deducted of $240 due to the work permit and daily travelling fares of $4 for motorcycle entering Singapore, this loss is more than offset by the weaker Malaysian Ringgit versus the stronger Singapore dollar. Add to that, they are able to live in very big houses for relatively low price back home. Do you think they would want to live here? In apartments packed like sardines? And for a much higher price? Surely not! They would rather take back their salaries to built up their nest-egg back at their homeland.</div>

I forgot to state earlier that one of the problems of jobs not being filled up back then before the influx of FTs came was partly due to our declining birth-rate. Its is even more so now that the government is so eager to boost our population.<br><br>As for the Malaysians working in Singapore, I am absolutely certain that they will NOT convert to PRs. If they can get 2.2 times the salary of what they can get back at home due to the stronger Singapore dollar. They will probably remain as Malaysian citizens as the Singapore government open-arms to them. Although they have their monthly salary deducted of $240 due to the work permit and daily travelling fares of $4 for motorcycle entering Singapore, this loss is more than offset by the weaker Malaysian Ringgit versus the stronger Singapore dollar. Add to that, they are able to live in very big houses for relatively low price back home. Do you think they would want to live here? In apartments packed like sardines? And for a much higher price? Surely not! They would rather take back their salaries to built up their nest-egg back at their homeland.</div></blockquote>There are quite a no of Malaysian who become PR cause of the attractiveness of the CPF esp the employer's contribution. As for them staying here<br><br>permanently, I think they might not want to do so cause buying a car in Malaysia is more attractive in the sense they can own it permanently n no need to pay COE to govt.</div>
