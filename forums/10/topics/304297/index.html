            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore and Malaysia are similar in the extent that our FT policies are too drastic and extreme. Attracting foreign talent to our work force brings in diversity and talent. But at the same time, neglecting the local pool of labor is disastrous for the long term.</div>

They arrested 5,400 foreign sex workers, a 25 percent increase over 2006, he said.<br><br>Despite its reputation as a straight-laced society, prostitution is legal in Singapore, where licensed brothels operate in designated areas such as Geylang. Pimping and public solicitation are illegal.<br><br>Foreign women working voluntarily in the sex trade cannot be arrested unless they are caught offering their services out in the street or violate immigration and other laws.<br><br>Mr Wong, who is also a deputy prime minister, said installation of closed-circuit television cameras in Geylang has helped deter solicitation.<br><br>He said daily police operations to target gambling in the back alleys of Geylang led to 280 arrests last year and an improvement in the situation.<br><br>'Illegal gambling in Geylang is not rampant,' he said.<br><br>'But I should add that it is not realistic to expect vice to be totally eliminated,' he said, particularly as the city-state seeks to promote tourism.<br><br>'Among those who come, there will be a very small number who enter under the pretext of social visits but engage in vice activities. This is the reality which Singaporeans should face up to.' -- AFP<br><br></div>

Personally if you ask me, its not right. The government is simply "giving-up" on Singaporeans. So, their most cost-effective solution would be to hire a army of FTs to replace us, by utilizing our clean-and-green, low-crime-rate country as one of the ways to attract them.</div>
