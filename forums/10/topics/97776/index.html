Nothing is ever their fault , it is always everyone against them. HIV aimed at eradicating black race? Bullshit , we have asians, we have caucasians affected by it but nooooooo it's only poor them , they are the only ones worth caring about.<br><br>Why africa has a large epidemic ? Cultural factors like tribal laws , religious beliefs, corrupted governments who prefer to squander money for their own use, political and civil unrests which translates into rape and pillage, low literatary rates. She should just get to the root of the problem instead of whining about how everyone wants blacks dead. Probably somebody screwed a monkey who had simian immunodeficiency virus ...and got HIV<br><br>They don't fix the problem - the problem remains.<br><br>So if she put it this way , the logic will decree that  SARS was meant to wipe out asians , influenza to wipe out caucasians.  From a view like that , Wangari flaming up people instead of creating peace . Her peace prize should be taken from her!</div>
