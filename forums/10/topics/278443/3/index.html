            <div class='col-md body'>Durai-a power crazy loonie who have escaped the just law of singapore.<br><br>White collar crime offenders can cheat,con and embezzle millions and get away with light sentences.Durai is one of them.<br>Compared with people who robbed/steal 100 dollars from a dwelling or person will result in jail sentence and rotan caning. Why don't they do this to white collar crime?<br>Aren't the amount "stolen" big enough to warrant this?How much money can a robber make in a robbery of a person or place(normal), please do not inlcude billionaires or banks.<br><br>Durai, so far has paid up only one million out of four million of debt. And he is allowed to leave singapore to work. Fair enough, work to pay the debt to NKF,fly out of singapore and work in dubai.Take his family to dubai too.What is can we do if durai do not return and seek refuge in a country that have no ties with singapore or not friendly with singapore?Durai will not pay the money back because his family and what is left of his belongings are out of reach of authorities of singapore.<br><br>Durai is a proven power crazy loonie who expect people to bow to his whims (see NKF report and news reports). He wants to control everything and be like a emperor, too bad his "peanuts" pay became public news.Mrs Goh (oh my god) has lost her common sense,thinking,scored an own goal by saying peanut pay.What can you deduce from this statement?Every pay cheque singapore people write for pap-related people would be million-denominated or else it will be called peanuts (less than 600k).Every talent in the cabinet are paid millions,plus directorships in companies(semi-government controlled).What is the issue with this?Where is the accountability of the government in power, who can check their dealings (personal with official)? The president(pap),the speaker(pap),the cabinet(pap),the mps(almost all pap) only two opposition with limited resources and people.With the government machinery controlled by PAP, every one is a target, they can go after their prey with full force of their "powers" given by our votes.I don't believe in self-check by pap.What bullshit.PM Lee control finance ministry, Ho ching control temasek holdings.There is direct conflict of interest between the jobs they hold.<br><br>Back to the issue, Durai will not return to singapore, bad name and bad press has done their damage to his image and reputation.He will probably emigrate to another country and work there.<br><br>After "cheating" NKF, enjoying the high life of high society, he has come down to earth with a 3month jail sentence.Is this fair?Is this just? I think not.<br>He should be jailed for the numbers of years he has "cheated" NKF, work as prison labourer as a punishment.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We smell something fishy about these, don't we? "Some people" probably think singaporeans are stupid, but there is probably some damage control here... Durai knows people and it's easier for him to get the dogs to obey the master (even if the master isn't Durai himself)... And what company will employ someone who cheats other people's money? Very highly suspicious and apparently there seems to be some cover up here, if this is justice of singapore, then something is wrong. Dr Chee did not commit a crime as bad as Durai, yet he is punished so severly. Dr Chee at least have integrity but Durai the guy who take the public's money and put into his own pocket? If people can take Singaporeans' hard earn money, and when discovered of their crimes, just get a job overseas (obviously with some people's help and some cover up), then I say the PAP is doing a very lousy job at handling justice. In fact, I am even suspecting if the PAP people are trying to help him out in this case, given their relationship. Is there justice in Singapore?</div>
