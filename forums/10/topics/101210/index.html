            <div class='col-md body'>Is this Chinese views on ASEA and Singapore?<br><br>"ASEAN may have a plan which may lead to the unification of South East Asia..." Is there such a plan? NO!<br><br>"ASEAN's combined military would potentially enjoy strategic superiority in the South China Sea ,..." SBSK proves himself to be a paper general only in C&amp;C if he agrees with statement like this.<br><br>"The unification of ASEAN into a polarity will be to the advantage of the US as the US can ally with ASEAN....." with two major muslim countries, one communist country, and one authoritarian country within ASEAN, what is a polarity and how can "it be advantage of the US..."??<br><br>"Singapore with its essentially Chinese population can choose to unify with Malaysia, or unify with ASEAN , or even reunify with China..." most rediculous statement but most like to read it is as China want to unify Singapore. WTF does "unify" mean?<br><br>"The unification of North Korea and South Korea into a Korean Union may be achieved. The Korean Union will have access to the Russian Union , China Union, Japan Union and the Pacific Ocean." How do you respond to such kind of statement? Just a confirmation that the writer is a nut.<br><br>Three statements are made with similar structure : "The combined economic and military strength, asset and resources of South East Asian countries might strengthen the multi-polarity capabilities of the ASEAN polarity."<br>"The combined economic and military strength, assets and resources of China and Singapore will accelerate China to achieve multi-polarity capabilities ."<br>"The combined economic and military strength, assets and resources of North Korea and South Korea will certainly strengthen the multi-polarity capabilities of the Korean polarity."  Should we even react to statements like this?? do you know what he means? china want to take over the world?<br><br>There are 1.3 billion Chinese in China, if 3 million Singaporean can produce 1 NUT, there are 4334 NUTs in China. Sometimes we entertain the NUT in Singapore abit in this forum, but if he brings in the NUTs from China, I don't think we should bother too much, otherwise next time he brings in the NUTs from India........hohoho.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">Is this Chinese views on ASEA and Singapore?<br><br>"ASEAN may have a plan which may lead to the unification of South East Asia..." Is there such a plan? NO!<br><br>"ASEAN's combined military would potentially enjoy strategic superiority in the South China Sea ,..." SBSK proves himself to be a paper general only in C&amp;C if he agrees with statement like this.<br><br>"The unification of ASEAN into a polarity will be to the advantage of the US as the US can ally with ASEAN....." with two major muslim countries, one communist country, and one authoritarian country within ASEAN, what is a polarity and how can "it be advantage of the US..."??<br><br>"Singapore with its essentially Chinese population can choose to unify with Malaysia, or unify with ASEAN , or even reunify with China..." most rediculous statement but most like to read it is as China want to unify Singapore. WTF does "unify" mean?<br><br>"The unification of North Korea and South Korea into a Korean Union may be achieved. The Korean Union will have access to the Russian Union , China Union, Japan Union and the Pacific Ocean." How do you respond to such kind of statement? Just a confirmation that the writer is a nut.<br><br>Three statements are made with similar structure : "The combined economic and military strength, asset and resources of South East Asian countries might strengthen the multi-polarity capabilities of the ASEAN polarity."<br>"The combined economic and military strength, assets and resources of China and Singapore will accelerate China to achieve multi-polarity capabilities ."<br>"The combined economic and military strength, assets and resources of North Korea and South Korea will certainly strengthen the multi-polarity capabilities of the Korean polarity."  Should we even react to statements like this?? do you know what he means? china want to take over the world?<br><br>There are 1.3 billion Chinese in China, if 3 million Singaporean can produce 1 NUT, there are 4334 NUTs in China. Sometimes we entertain the NUT in Singapore abit in this forum, but if he brings in the NUTs from China, I don't think we should bother too much, otherwise next time he brings in the NUTs from India........hohoho.<br><br></div></blockquote>Poster is a chinese national..with 2 piece of name unlike the usual 3 like tan ah kow..<br><br><a href="http://www.asiawind.com/forums/read.php?f=3&amp;i=122758&amp;t=122026&amp;v=f" rel="nofollow">http://www.asiawind.com/forums/read.php?f=3&amp;i=122758&amp;t=122026&amp;v=f</a></div>
