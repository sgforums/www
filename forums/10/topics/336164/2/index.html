              <p>anyway according to govt criterea, we're all cavemen compared to them. they're all highly educated scholars with extremely high IQ and leadership skills who are the best of the best, the cream of the crop. born into family with good genes, good background.</p>
              <p>if we don't understand their actions, its suppose to mean we're idiots, cavemen. we are intellectually incapable of comprehending how chillis and onions can stop rain. i never studied far enough to learn that so its not surprising.</p>

              a good cause<br> YOU have seen them in Parliament, at grassroots events and at
              opening ceremonies.<br> By Elysa Chen<br> <br> 03 November 2008<br> YOU have seen them in Parliament, at grassroots events and at
              opening ceremonies.<br> <br> Now, get ready to see the other side of your Members of
              Parliament.<br> <br> Meet your rock star MPs, and others who were making catcalls and
              whistling when fellow MP Indranee Rajah, took to the stage to
              practise her duet during rehearsals.<br> <br> And there were the ones who brought the house down with their crazy
              antics and mischievous grins.<br> <br> The live band, led by Mr Teo Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary
              Secretary for the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and
              Sports, consists of five other MPs: MrMichael Palmer and Ms Jessica
              Tan on the vocals, Mr Liang Eng Hwa who plays the drums, Mr
              Zainudin Nordin who plays the guitar and Mr Zaqy Mohamad on the

              Cultural Hall during a concert, Sing Sing Sing, which was organised
              to raise funds for the Singapore Street Festival.<br> <br> Playful mood<br> <br> The Singapore Street Festival is an event to promote creative and
              artistic activities among local youths.<br> <br> The New Paper on Sunday spoke to the band during rehearsals just
              before the performance, and caught the MPs in a playful mood.<br> <br> They danced on stage, pushed each other around, belted out their
              songs with gusto and cheekily made 'peace' signs with their fingers
              while standing behind fellow performers.<br> <br> Referred to by his bandmates as 'the chief', Mr Teo said: 'We're
              hipper than Obama. I've done some research, and we are the first
              band to be formed by politicians.'<br> <br> Watching their chemistry and performance, one might think that they
              have been jamming together for a long time.<br> <br> But all the band members were quick to confess that they only had
              their first jamming session in a studio near Simei which lasted
              into the wee hours of Friday morning.<br> <br> Mr Teo had been floating the idea to start a band for the last
              couple of months, but it was necessity that finally brought the six
              of them together.<br> <br> He said: 'We have heard of promising musicians among the MPs, and
              we've been having the intention to form a band.<br> <br> 'It was just right that this event was being held. What's more,
              it's for a good cause.'<br> <br> Most of them had heard the song they were going to sing, Built to
              Last by American pop band Melee, for the first time only on
              Thursday night.<br> <br> Ms Tan chose it after hearing it on the radio.<br> <br> Terrible<br> <br> When asked if their band was built to last, Ms Tan said: 'Our
              friendship is built to last, but the band is terrible.'<br> <br> To much laughter, Mr Palmer quipped: 'The fact that we can still
              stay together after hearing each other sing probably shows that
              (we're built to last)!'<br> <br> And yes, they do intend to keep it going.<br> <br> Another MP at Friday's performance was Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman, who
              played the classic favourite Yue Liang Dai Biao Wo De Xin (The Moon
              Represents My Heart, in Mandarin) on the guzheng.<br> <br> Explaining his choice of instrument, he said: 'I have always been
              intrigued by Chinese culture and the guzheng after watching Chinese
              gong fu series on TV.<br> <br> 'When I play the guzheng, I can imagine myself in a period drama
              with the lake, the bamboo and the pavillion!'<br> <br> Dr Maliki had fallen so much in love with the instrument and the
              'melodious music' that he bought a $1,000 guzheng to play at
              home.<br> <br> However, as Friday was his first solo performance, Dr Maliki was
              very nervous, especially since the song he was playing was a very
              well-known song.<br> <br> 'If I miss just one note, everyone will know.<br> <br> 'But hopefully, the people will 'yuan liang' (forgive in Mandarin)
              my 'yue liang' (moon in Mandarin)!' he added with a
              chuckle.</span></div>

              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">'And that is the whole basis of the GRC system.'</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">The GRC or group representation constituency was introduced in 1988 to protect Parliament's multiracial composition.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">The need for such a scheme shows clearly that we're still tribal folk, flocking together like birds of a feather.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">But the immediate post-65 generation, said Dr Koh, would probably be more ready for other ideas as to who the PM can be.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">'They were brought up to think One Singapore, One Nation, and would probably not be averse to the idea because of the political ideals of their time,' she added.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">The young and the cosmopolitan are likely to be even more colour-blind, say some observers.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">They will let the best man lead.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Political analyst Terence Chong from the Institute of Southeast Asia Studies said: 'Many Singaporeans, especially younger ones, are ready because the ideologies of multiculturalism and meritocracy have become part of the Singaporean myth.'</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Singaporeans are very pragmatic, and will look for leaders with management ability and people-skills, IPS' Dr Koh said.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Citing an IPS post-2006 election survey, Dr Koh said respondents indicated they voted their members of parliament based on whether they thought they would be effective, fair and have a heart for the people in general.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Another survey last year by two academics at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) on race and religion also produced surprising results.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">It found that over 91 per cent of all races polled said they would accept a prime minster of another race, while at least 92 per cent said they would vote an MP or a Singapore president of a different race.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Among the Chinese, 94 per cent did not mind if the PM was an Indian, and 91 per cent, if he was a Malay.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Referring to the topic of race as an old issue, Workers' Party's organising secretary Yaw Shin Leong said: 'If we truly believe in merit and capabilities, then so long as the person is Singaporean and can do a good job, there should be no reason why the person can't be given the top job.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">'To say that certain ethnic groups are not suitable or ready for top office is regressive'.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">All that debate might be purely academic given that the electoral system here is focused on political parties, not individual candidates.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">The party which has the majority forms the government and chooses the prime minister.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Dr Koh said: 'I think we would need a fully functioning two-party system before we ever reach that scenario.'</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">The question of race and prime ministership was on then-PM Lee Kuan Yew's mind back in 1988.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">He publicly said then that he would have considered then-National Development Minister S Dhanabalan for the PM's job if not for his Indian ethnicity.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Singapore, Mr Lee said, was not ready for an Indian prime minister.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Mr Dhanabalan himself did not think Chinese Singaporeans were ready to accept a non-Chinese PM. In a Straits Times report in November last year, he said that such cross-racial acceptance takes time.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Referring to the RSIS race survey, Mr Dhanabalan felt that the respondents probably gave 'politically correct' answers that did not reflect their real feelings.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">He said then: 'I'm not quite convinced. It will take a bit more time. You look at the United States. How long, how many years were they a nation before a Catholic could be elected?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">'Let's don't even talk about blacks. Now Barack Obama is the first one. Well, he may not even make it through the primary, right?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">'So these are very deep feelings. I'm not saying it's not possible, but I think it will take some time.'</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Fast forward a year later.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Mr Obama has done it, despite the widespread fears of voting along racial lines.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Commentators even spoke openly of the prospect of his assassination by a white supremacist group.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">But, as in Malaysia's general election, many voters surprised even the experts by rejecting race to 'do the right thing'.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">All this gives Singaporeans good reason to gaze in the mirror and ask ourselves how deep runs a tribal instinct and how far we want to evolve as a society.<br> <br> <br></span></strong></p>
