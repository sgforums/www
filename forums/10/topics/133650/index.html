            <div class='col-md body'>If any public transport companies in Singapore think that they could not continue to provide an efficient service due to rising fuel cost or any other factor cost, they should give up their license and give another capable company a chance to carry out the much needed service to Singaporeans!<br><br>ComfortDelgro has requested the govt to allow them to raise the commuters' fares, it irks the general public not once, but many times just because it earns a little bit less as compare to last year!Many Singaporeans are still out of job and many in the heartland are still struggling to keep their heads above water, many top guns are sitting beauty and still never see the big picture on the ground! Comfort Delfro, MRT have raised fares many times in the past due to fuel cost increases, but when the fuel price receded, have they adjusted the price downwards, it  is a definate NO! Just because the company earning a  little less does not mean that the company will wrap up in no time. Now what is their intention of trying hard to squeeze out from its poor commuters? To impress on their investors so that they will vote them in again and pay them bigger bonuses?<br><br>Earning a lower or higher annual incomes are the norms of many listed companies. Company A may earn less this year, but it may earn double next year if they know how to be efficient even at adverse conditions! Most may not adopt the easy way out like ComfortDelfro and MRT! Anyone can do the job if they always take this path!Ask Mr. Sim Wong Woo how he manages his Creative and still stay on top! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The sad thing about the whole situation is that we cannot vote with our wallets because there are no alternatives. And the transport companies know this. I sometimes wonder if they realise that part of the reason for the outcries is that travelling by public transport in Singapore is a very unpleasant experience, and making us pay more for it is like rubbing salt into the wound.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, we get the government we deserve. Most people either vote for the incumbents because of fear(e.g. fear of the country becoming destabalised after becoming influenced by the mass media propaganda), or greed (for the carrots that the incumbents dangle during the elections, e.g. HDB upgrading, NSS, ESS....) while others are too lazy even to show up and vote.

Only the current government can answer the question of why citizens based overseas cannot vote, why they practise gerrymandering just before every GE, why not voting during one election means they can remove your name from the electoral rolls etc.<br><br>I know many people around me who had the chance to vote during the last GE but chose to sleep in and not show up, saying whats the point, ruling party will still win anyway.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
