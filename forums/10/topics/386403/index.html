              <p>USA is talent based meritocracy and australia is actually better cos its skills/expereince based meritocracy where u have the leeway of being pushed up the ladder throug formal training and education.</p>
              <p>But in singapore it cheaper, better, faster meritocracy</p>

              <p>Its not like what u think. Australia has the 2nd best human development index in the world  and these problems u stated also exist elsewhere, also exist in Sg civil service  Are u saying Singapore is any better in terms of productivity, recent news says singapore's productivity has fallen significantly.</p>
              <p>But truth is australia is a better economy than singapore's because they are not concerned abt GDP, they have better value added jobs to begin with</p>
              <p>Its of no use developing their towns cos the place is simply too big and unlike singapore's they dont need to show flashy stuff to attract investment as they have natural resources.</p>

              <p>U are quick to shoot yr words out. Think logically before put down others country. Aussie jobs are much more value added than Singapore's and there are lots of types jobs which are not found in Singapore too.</p>
              <p>Pls take a look at www.career.com.au or seek.com.au</p>
              <p>What is yr definition of value added? Despite the Singapore's current "breakthru" economic policies, they failed to create value added jobs.   it all the same old menial jobs withlower pay now. The true value added aspect of a job is its progression aspects, renumeration package and benefits.</p>
              <p>About the natural resources is true, but isnt that the same with all other countries too, including US ?If u go to US they still also use dirt trucks to dig up things on the ground to make your apple iphones.</p>
              <p>U are not getting the real picture of economy here. Economy in its true sense is driven by gold, oil, agriculture  and minerals . These create jobs, from financial to technological. In thats sense Australia is a natural economy driven by natural inputs. Singapore's a freak economy which relies heavily on market pricing, speculation, property market, security, foreign investment, monetary flow ect.Such an economy is nothing but  a gambling game and will face numerous problems.

              <p>Singapore model is GDP based and its flawed. the GDP input is thru  mostly taxes paid by people rather than from economic activity. There is not much economic activity in Singapore, there is one thing ,however - Speculation, artificial manipulation of market, inflation, price monopoly, anti competition, debt traps, exploitation of cheap labour. the GDP growth is mostly achieved with these.</p>
