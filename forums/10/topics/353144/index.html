              A Paper Fit For Peasants
              
              I have been busy and so distracted by my real life that I have not been able to come here to participate in inane conversations with morons. A very close friend of mine was a very close friend of Dr. Allan Ooi, the SAF scholar doctor who committed suicide, and comforting her day and night has left me emotionally drained as well.
              
              Needless to say, readers of my blog must have seen his suicide note all over the internet. First of all, I must confirm that the SAF bond is, for all intents and purposes, is unbreakable. Do not ask me for details - if any of you have SAF scholar friends, you can ask them. That was also probably the main reason for Allan's suicide.
              
              But that is not the point of this post. The point of this post is to express my utter disgust at the *censored* who run especially The Straits Times, and all the SPH papers. A few days after the suicide, the Straits Times, OUR NATIONAL BROADSHEET, printed a full page article on PAGE THREE, speculating that Allan had committed suicide because he played too many computer games. Notwithstanding the fact that by then, a copy of the letter had already been emailed to them, that article was so utterly banal, puerile and noxiously unbelievable I doubt it would have even made it to The News of the World. Yet, it appeared on PAGE THREE of our NATIONAL BROADSHEET, who regularly awards prizes to itself for 'superb journalism'. Other papers like Sin Min, The New Paper etc also ran equally moronic articles, but at least they do not labour under the responsibility of being our nation's only broadsheet. As such, I do not hold them to equally high standards of journalistic ability, even if they do exhibit the same level of intellectual disability.
              
              Every day, I am forced to read The Straits Time because it is my only source of local village news, except that sometimes, this local village news, which should really be buried somewhere in the Home section, somehow appears in Prime News. Like when Fandi Ahmad's wife fell down. Really now - prime news? In a national broadsheet? If David Beckham's wife Victoria fell down, even though they are true celebrities,it would hardly deserve a mention in The Guardian. But we do live in a village populated by peasants, and our national broadsheet surely is an authentic reflection of this.
              
              Yet, many bright minds have gone overseas to the best global universities, and could have come back to join what is one of the most respected professions in the world, journalism. But that is precisely the problem. Journalists in Singapore, having for years having to bear the stigma of writing for a village witless newspaper, have become one of the most denigrated, laughed-at and even despised profession. As such, no self-respecting intellectual will ever aspire to join SPH. Thus, only third-rate minds join SPH, and continue to churn out third-rate dribble. Even SPH scholars are third-rate, often having been rejected by other scholarship boards, and the good ones break their (breakable) bonds way before they are up. And so, the vicious cycle continues.
              
              The newspapers in Singapore are not worth the paper they are written on. Like any generalisation, it remains that. There are a few journalists I admire, like Janadas Devan (the son of our Singapore's third President Devan Nair), especially when he tore apart the parliamentary speech of that repulsive bigoted homophobe and religious fundamentalist, MP Thio Li-An.
              
              By and large however, this incident has re-affirmed what I have known all along. The Straits Times is truly a paper fit for peasants.

              Does that mean that ladymelissa admits she is a peasant?
              
              Anyway, we shouldn't believe anything without thinking.

              <p>She is right. Singapore, despite its global ambitions, is only a small village of 3million plus. Is there a need to know about grits and the cowboy's loss of horse-shoes the way bigger nations report their news? Can we relate to it so much information that may not be relevant to us?</p>
              <p>Worse still - newspaper are private organisations and no matter how noble one would like to believe, it exists on profits. Without money it will belly up. So in order to win subscriptions, they will have to 'sensationalize up' news - scandals, rumours, etc that will only undermine our society so that they make profits. Do we need more news agencies?</p>
              <p>She is also right. I am a peasant. Everyone singaporean is. None has a drop of royal blood. But we are not stupid or devoid of opportunities in life. We bow before no man or principalities. We are a republic.</p>
              <p>When the day comes that the majority are suffering and an elite few enjoying life on citizens back, will see me unearthing my pitchfork and head towards them, irregardless of whether if anyone else is following behind me. If sufferings were my own doing, that i will remain silent for i am responsible for myself. But if everyone else is suffering and a minority few enjoying life, then something must be done.</p>
              <p>But that time had not come. The malls are still packed. 90%+ of singaporeans are still employed. Hospitals still accept the poor. Children are still being educated. Our news agencies had been keeping us inform on relevant data. Even offering help to the unfortunates in our society through relaying of information without resorting to sensationalism. And do remember they were the ones who uncovered the NKF scandal. Not bad for a small town newspaper.</p>
              <p>So my pitchfork is still kept away. But in this downtime where everyone else is suffering, from the PM to the roadsweeper, i'm keeping my pitchfork well oiled and sharp. The minority who attempts to destroy our society by sowing suspicions, discord, etc, will face the end of my pitchfork.  </p>

              <p><strong>The mainstream media’s clear bias for the political elite</strong></p>
              <p>Written by Ng E-Jay<br> 29 March 2009</p>
              <p>When the Straits Times ran an article on March 21 entitled
                                      “Report card on Class of 2006″ quoting an anonymous People’s Action
                                      Party (PAP) cadre as saying that Dr Fatimah Lateef, an MP of Marine
                                      Parade <span>GRC</span>, had some trouble connecting with
                                      management members of Chinese temples in her ward, the mainstream
                                      media was quick to give airtime to both Dr Fatimah Lateef as well
                                      as SM Goh Chok Tong to rebut this claim.</p>
              <p>The report in the Straits Times had quoted the <span>PAP</span> member as saying that Chinese temples had clashed
                                      with Dr Fatimah Lateef over issues such as the granting of permits
                                      for the holding of events like deities’ birthday celebrations, and
                                      this could be to the detriment of her standing with residents who
                                      are Buddhists or Taoists.</p>
              <p>This prompted an almost instantaneous reaction from four
                                      community leaders, namely, the Chairman of the Inter Racial
                                      Confidence Circle at Geylang Serai, the Honorary Chairman of
                                      Geylang Villagers’ Association, the Honorary Secretary of Geylang
                                      Lorong 29 Liaison Committee, as well as Mr Tang Song Hee of the
                                      Thong Kheng Charitable Institution, who had their joint letter to
                                      the Straits Times forum page published in the print edition on 23
                                      March. In their letter entitled “MP has no trouble connecting with
                                      Chinese temples”, they defended Dr Fatimah Lateef’s record of
                                      communicating well with residents and supporting their religious
                                      and cultural events.</p>
              <p>On 26 March, SM Goh Chok Tong also weighed in on the issue. In
                                      an article entitled “SM Goh says newspaper report on MP Fatimah
                                      Lateef inaccurate”, Channel News Asia quoted him as saying: “I do
                                      not like the inaccuracy because it suggested that a minority
                                      community MP, a Malay MP, could not reach out to the Chinese temple
                                      people, (and) the hint that maybe, she, as a Muslim, did not want
                                      to reach out to these people. That is the implication … … The
                                      suggestion that a minority MP could be biased against others who
                                      don’t believe in your own religion is, I think, a very serious one.
                                      I do not think the reporter or the journalist writing it realised
                                      the implication — a Malay MP could not reach out to the Chinese. I
                                      think that is very bad for the <span>PAP</span>.
                                      Fortunately, that is not true, so better put it right.”</p>
              <p>On 28 March, <span>TODAY</span> newspaper also ran a
                                      full-length article entitled “MP Fatimah Lateef speaks up” giving
                                      Dr Fatimah Lateef ample opportunity to present her side of the
                                      story. Like SM Goh, Dr Fatimah Lateef also expressed concerns that
                                      the original offending article might stir emotions along racial
                                      lines. She also vigorously defended her active involvement in
                                      various temple activities, such as the birthday of deities and
                                      Seventh Month celebrations, and emphasized that there had been no
                                      miscommunication with any religious leaders.</p>
              <p>On the surface, it might appear to the unsuspecting reader that
                                      the mainstream media is merely playing its role of responsible
                                      reporting and allowing public figures to clear the air about
                                      themselves when misunderstandings arise. However, other examples
                                      abound in which the mainstream media falls far short of this ideal,
                                      especially when members of the Opposition, as opposed to the
                                      self-appointed political elite of the <span>PAP</span>,
                                      are involved.</p>
              <p>07 June 2008, the Straits Times published a column by ex-ISD
                                      officer and current Political Editor Ms Chua Lee Hoong, in which
                                      she penned a full scale propaganda piece against the Singapore
                                      Democratic Party (SDP) and attacked Dr Chee Soon Juan’s religious
                                      beliefs by unceremoniously questioning whether “Christians will
                                      accept his pattern of behaviour as being particularly
                                      Christian“.</p>
              <p>Ms Chua then remarked that Dr Chee could be suffering from
                                      antisocial personality disorder (APD), even going to the extent of
                                      saying “if he does, we have got to feel sorry for him“.</p>
              <p>To put the icing on the cake on this worst kind of gutter
                                      journalism, Ms Chua’s article was published when Dr Chee Soon Juan
                                      was in jail together with his sister for contempt of court, when he
                                      had no chance of responding to the article. (Read the full article:
                                      Ms Chua Lee Hoong, why do you even bother?)</p>
              <p>In June last year as well, there was a tragic incident involving
                                      Opposition candidate Mr Tan Lead Shake’s brother, in which the
                                      latter died after being stabbed by a china woman. Rather than
                                      reporting the tragedy as they normally do for cases involving
                                      ordinary civilians (read: non-Opposition members), the mainstream
                                      media was quick to pounce on the fact that the victim was Mr Tan
                                      Lead Shake’s brother, and highlighted the political connection
                                      repeatedly in all their news articles. The mainstream media even
                                      went to the absurd length of calling Mr Tan Lead Shake “slipper
                                      man” all over again, and mentioning his poor performance in past
                                      General Elections. (Read the full article by Mr Law Sin Lin:
                                      Singapore Press — Rushing To Infernal Self-Condemnation.)</p>
              <p>More recently, in early March this year, the <span>TODAY</span> newspaper published a column in the print edition
                                      repeating lies and falsehoods about Dr Chee Soon Juan’s historical
                                      political relationship with Mr Chiam See Toong — falsehoods that
                                      have been been perpetuated by the mainstream media countless times
                                      over the years. Reporter Mr Loh Chee Kong took aim at the Singapore
                                      Democrats and accused them of practising the “darker side of
                                      politics” by “ousting” Mr Chiam from the party in the 1990s,
                                      completely and irresponsibly ignoring the fact that Chiam resigned
                                      from the party on his own accord, and that he had done so after
                                      executive committee members voted against a motion that he himself
                                      tabled. The Singapore Democrats were not given any chance to
                                      clarify the situation in the mainstream press. Dr Chee Soon Juan’s
                                      letter to <span>TODAY</span> was only published in the
                                      online edition, where the readership is many times smaller than
                                      that of the print edition. (See here and here.)</p>
              <p>Besides giving <span>SDP</span> members highly unfair
                                      and biased coverage in an attempt to assassinate their characters
                                      in the eyes of the public, the mainstream media is also not above
                                      targetting ordinary civilians when it suits their purposes.</p>
              <p>When news of an alleged “stabbing” incident involving final year
                                      Indonesian undergraduate student David Hartonto Widjaja at the
                                      Nanyang Technological University (NTU) campus surfaced a few weeks
                                      ago, the mainstream media descended like a pack of rabid wolves
                                      onto the story, caring not for impartiality and honest reporting,
                                      but on spinning David as someone who possibly was suffering from
                                      mental problems, as well as an aggressor and a suicidal man who got
                                      out of control.</p>
              <p>The likes of <span>OMY</span>, Today, Channel News
                                      Asia, Asia One, and to a certain extent The Straits Times,
                                      misrepresented critical information in their stories and engaged in
                                      unsubstantiated speculation regarding pertinent facts of the case
                                      based entirely on the testimonials provided by friends and
                                      colleagues of the alleged victim, Associate Professor Chan Kap Lup.
                                      (See here and here.)</p>
              <p>When news of Dr Allan Ooi, the <span>SAF</span> Medical
                                      Scholar who committed suicide in the south Australian city of
                                      Melbourne, broke, the mainstream media initially painted him as a
                                      melancholic young man who possibly took his life over a failed
                                      romantic relationship, and deliberately downplayed the possibility
                                      that his suicide could have been due to the rigid and lengthy
                                      scholarship bond that he had been made to serve as well as his
                                      overly stressful work environment. It was only after contents of
                                      his farewell letter was released to the public that the mainstream
                                      media toned down their unbridled speculation over his alleged
                                      failed relationship. (See here, here, and here.)</p>
              <p>In an earlier article entitled “Protection from harm: One set of
                                      rules for political elites and another set of rules for common
                                      folk“, I pointed out that the self-appointed political masters from
                                      the <span>PAP</span> appear to be treated differently as
                                      far as protection under the law is concerned. Clearly, the examples
                                      I have listed also attest to the fact that the mainstream media
                                      treats them differently from ordinary civilians and Opposition
                                      politicians</p>
              <p>The political elite is given very comprehensive coverage in the
                                      mainstream press, which allows them ample opportunity to paint as
                                      good a picture of themselves as possible, but at the same time
                                      denies others the same privilege. In contrast, Opposition
                                      politicians like Dr Chee and other members of the <span>SDP</span> in particular are frequently slimed by the mainstream
                                      media with no opportunity to respond or engage the public.</p>
              <p>This media bias and abhorrent lack of professionalism points to
                                      an urgent need for media reform. Unfortunately, as long as the
                                      <span>PAP</span> is in control of the mainstream media and
                                      exerts a repressive influence on free expression via the Newspapers
                                      and Printing Presses Act, the alternative side of Singapore
                                      politics will have to find expression on the internet instead.</p>

              <p>I have been observing that blog and seems like it is getting less comments compared to earlier in the year and last year.</p>

              A Paper Fit For Peasants
              
              That is an insult to peasants.
              
              I think state propaganda mouthpieces like ST is only for those who support PAP regime.
              
              Basically everything there is pro-PAP regime, praise for PAP regime and speeches and activities of PAP regime.
              
              If you don't support PAP regime or despises PAP regime, reading propaganda mouthpieces like ST will make you vomit in disgust.
              
              I respect ST for what it is - a PAP regime propaganda mouthpiece.
              
              We need ST also to find out when GST increase, when to pay income tax, changes in laws, more ERPs, bus fare increases etc.
              
              But if you are looking for objective news and journalism and non state propaganda, then quite obviously, ST is not the paper for you.
              
              Go and look for local print media that is not under control of PAP regime.
              
              It will have freedom to publish more critical reports.
              
              Of course, such a media does not exist in Singapore.

              <p>i dont know whether the TS is trying to insult the singaporeans reading ST or the ppl managing ST.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway, you can have my word, many ppl like myself buy ST to read the "money" section, " sports" section and" internation news". i dont bother to read local news. the local news are reported by third grade reporters.</p>
