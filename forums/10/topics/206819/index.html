Got to know people from all walks of life. Make new friends.<br><br>Many brotherhood like relationships are carved out from the SAF.<br>We learn about cultural diversity comes united as a nation when everyone regardless of race &amp; religion (perhaps background is omitted; white horse) kiss the same floor when your SGT knock everyone down.<br><br>I have a friend Mr Wong Wah Poh Paul (HQ ARMCEG/MNT COY) currently in UK studying. Having grown up his whole life in Liverpool, he speaks only British accented English. He finds that NS helped him positively towards building his character and opened his vision to a wider horizon. Paul also contributed greatly towards the sports culture in the unit and he plays fantastic soccer &amp; tennis.<br><br>And being an ex-sergeant, he said it helped him a lot to have better leverage against his competitors back in UK. In school and he believes even in the working world.<br><br>Looking beyond economic gains, NS is not as simple as we think.<br><br></div>

Not IRON FIST.<br><br>The complete opposite. By robust, I mean stronger democratic institutions as opposed to the Party Rule effect.<br><br>Somehow along the way, we traded off human development for economic development. But by Maslow's hierarchy of needs, we have to eventually develop human security, although it is not in a normal timeline sort of fashion.<br><br>How fast will this take, could determine the sense of belonging for the current generation.Those who can leave , have done so and are working abroad. Most Singaporeans I know living abroad, still hope that one day we will be a freer and more caring society.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NS or the conception of citizen soldiers is not just about military defence. It is also a very good policy to development community spirit over individualism and helps blend the society. The idea being to throw the black, brown and yellow guy into the same mud pool and they will crawl out looking the same. Same deal goes to the rich and the poor, they will wear and eat the same thing in SAF.<br>According to scholars, the future military will be a small professional groups of military units, so en masse conscripts are not likely to be the focus of our military anymore. But NS is still a very good form of National Education and I foresee greater flexibility and shorter NS in the future.<br>I also think that perhaps NS can be broaden to include other pple like females and new PR and citizens too. But instead of focusing on military, send them for some courses that develop them in terms of national education and team building.</div>
