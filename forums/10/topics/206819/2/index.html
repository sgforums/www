            <div class='col-md body'>To maintain a defence force of only 50,000 is definitely not enough... Our 4 million population 1% is 40,000 hmmm that's too little... We need aleast 150,000 Soldiers. If these people are joining the army. The economy will definitely suffer. But Singapore can definitely set up foreign legions like the FFL. It could ease the effects of our NS load. But our security should never be left alone to others, than our very own citizen. After we need the loyalty of all the people here to make this island of nothing work!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>National Service doesn't take all that much out of the economy.  True our workforce is 40,000 people smaller but honestly the pros more than make up for the cons.<br><br>The SAF has a standing force of around 20,000.  If you include NSFs and NSmen, the figure is very much larger.  Without NS, Singapore's forces would be no comparison to the 100,000 that our nearest neighbour fields.  The added security more than makes up for the pain of going through NS.  Never make the mistake of thinking that our neighbours are completely friendly towards us or that the confidence with which we conduct our dealings with them can be maintained without a credible armed force.<br><br>We cannot add forces to the SAF by attempting to have a larger standing army.  This is simply due to the fact that it costs very much more to pay an army of regulars as compared to NSFs and NSmen.<br><br>The strength of the SAF lies in the airforce and navy, two wings that have much lower representation from NSFs than the army.  Yet this does not mean that we can neglect to develop our ground forces.  In the event of a war, they will be needed to take and hold territory to give our commanders strategic depth to work with.<br><br>As a Singaporean male who has to give up 2 years of his life like everyone else, I can safely say that I feel more confident in Singapore for having NS.<br><br></div>

Its because we need these people for the long run in order to keep the economy going. The 2 years of NS, in terms of manpower hours are not going to affect our economy in the long run and will certainly not be enough to cover the ones contributed by the FT. Singapore like most modern cities are facing an aging population and the only exception of these modern cities is the US which just keeps bringing in new FTs and immigrants to replenish their blood.<br>The problem that the US is now facing however, is that their society is very segmentated where the rich and the poor doesn't interact. The US military in specific, is becoming a poor man's havan because generally, only poor people are willing to endure the hardships within the military because of the pay. Having a citizen soldier model such as Singapore's NS will help reduce the problem of isolating the military from the rest of the society. In Singapore, it doesn't matter if you live in Holland Ville or some 1 rm flat in Potong Pasir, as long as the person has been tru NS, he will have some knowledge and attachment for the military. At times, these people may be complaining about how F up the military is or whatever, but the thing is that they've been tru it together and a much better bond is fostered among these pple than most US citizens.<br>There are very often no "good" political decisions and we will always be forced by circumstance to take the lesser evil. Bringing in the FTs and having NS are such lesser evils.<br>When you say that you don't feel loyal to the nation because the govt doesn't do good things for you anymore, does it ever occur to you that the govt are not that separated from you? The govt is elected among the pple, there is not you and me but only we. If you wishes things to be better for Singapore, then you must fight and work for it, not hoping to have your kinsmen do it for you. The government's job is to facilitate an environment that allows us all to have a chance to fight for better lives, and on top of which would be our education.<br>If there is one thing that I believe that the government had let you down, it is that the government and the rest of us as a society had not develop your ethos in a way to contribute to the society. If you think that I am selfish in asking you to contribute to the society, please also consider that you, in asking the government to take care of you, is asking the entire society of 4 million people to contribute to your personal desire.</div>
