Though I admit that the employers should practise self control, but shouldn't we pay more attention to the source - the quality of the maid.<br><br>Would you kill your boss if your boss always pressurise you and speak negatively on you because you cannot perform?<br><br>Would your boss have to treat you like his own family member just to prevent you from killing him?<br><br>If your answers to the above 2 questions are no, then what makes you think that maids have the special previlage of killing their employers just because they are being told off for non performance.<br><br>For the maid in this incident, there were no bruise on her body that shows that her employer had physically abused her. Moreover, the employer was out for work from 6a.m. till 11p.m., meaning, the maid had so much freedom between this time, where is the abuse and ill treatment?  The employer was merely telling her off for non performance, don't the employer have the right to do so? Would you go and tell your boss that he has no right to tell you off even if you don't perform?<br></div>

If he/she can sense harm, she/he will be veri defensive or even offensive to strik first. Thus, imagine this maid can sense that the family is just treating her like dirt.. how will she feel?<br><br>Thus i really feel that maid shld be welcomed with open arms and not as if u go into a pet shop to buy some pets back home....</div>
