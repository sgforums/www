How does it compare with the average person?<br><br>According to the Report on the Labour Force in Singapore 2006, the median gross monthly income of workers in full-time employment is $2,170. In other words, a worker takes a month to earn what a Minister earns in half a day! For university graduates, the median gross monthly income is $4,450. This would take the Minister one day to earn.<br><br>As you move the salaries up to 88% of the benchmark, we will find that the average worker's monthly pay will be earned by a Minister in 2-3 hours. Does the Cabinet not feel a tinge of discomfort drawing taxpayers' money at such rate? At such rates, can Ministers and Singaporeans share the same dreams?<br><br>Another reality is that our leaders may face problems in marshalling the people to make sacrifices for the country.</span><br><br></blockquote></span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it sure is difficult to find much information on the income distribution of Singapore! I have some stats on income inequality, but they are outdated.<br><br>According to the Human Development Report 2006, based on 1998 stats (why do they not have updated stats??), Singapore's Gini coefficient is 42.5, where 0 rep zero inequality (ie everyone's income is equal) and 100 rep full inequality (richest owns all). This is much higher than the other countries listed above Singapore in the HDI with the sole exception of HongKong, although I admit this figure is prob no longer accurate since the stats almost 10 years ago.<br><br>Nevertheless, they do give a clear indication that Singapore IS heading towards an unhealthy distribution of income. Perhaps policies implemented should focus on distributing more income, without going to the extent of affecting econ growth (coz if economy isn't growing, there isn't any point in discussing income equality in the first place), and without leaning towards the view that perfect equality is good (and feasible). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Its ok to have super-rich people, however, the standard and cost of living of Singapore should be at a level where the average guy also lives a life of satisfaction here.<br><br>A bigger stretch in income gap btw the poor and the rich will only stir up more discontent, and if there ever comes a time when the poor revolts (This is possible, even though right now, the govt controls things in a very strict manner), how many dollars you have are all useless, coz the economy collapses, the richer people get hanged, and whatever big bucks you earn goes up in smoke.<br><br>That is why the govt must never ever just side with the rich, coz its in their interests to ensure that everyone lives a good life in Singapore, thereby ensuring the stability and the economy of this nation.<br><br>That's why I believe the reason why many truly rich guys do a lot of work to try to bridge the gap for the poor, is not because they want to (though yes some of them are sincere in helping), but because they know it is necessary.<br><br>At the end of the day I believe the 80/20 rule applies (or even 95/5 in Singapore's case), where 80-95% are the poor and the truly rich is a mere 5-20%. En-masse if the poor are discontented, the rich suffers as well. Therefore, both are interdependent.</div>

For sure ministers pay are high. but they are still not in the catogory of  super rich people. If we want to talk about income gap, we might as well talk about the top end of the spectrum, such as those super rich living in Nassim and Tanglin.<br><br></div>

Therefore, both are interdependent. </div></blockquote>Discontentment will always exist regardless of how wide or narrow is the income gap.

As such dont you think that a boom is property prices will give these people a life line?<br><br>c) The construction industry has been experience nagative growth for so many years, even when the economy is recovering. Hence dont you think that the boom in property market today will give a life line to fellow singaporeans working in the construction industry?<br><br>d) Inflation will exisit regardless if the property market in singapore is booming or not. Unless you are going to get yourself involve in buying prime property market or renting private apartments, if not I dont think this is going create  addition cost burden to Singaporeans already living in HDB flat<br><br>e) Property price increase will benefit all existing home owners because they will have positive asset instead of negative ones. If they need the cash ugently, they can always cash in on their existing home by downgrading to smaller units.<br><br>f) The reason for the property boom is because Singapore property market has been lagging behind other major cities such as HK, Sydney London, and with Singapore IR, there willl be a surge in demand for properties. The effort by the government to turn singapore into a more vibrant city and the new income tax law have also attracted many foreigners to this country.<br><br>Is this bad news for Singapore? I dont think so.<br><br>g) A sudden crash is unlikely to hit singapore property market because majority of the buyers are people with high net worth and the boom is concentrated in the prime district or areas close to the IR, not island wide. If you are not in the market speculating, why should you worry about it. Furthermore recession is a cycle, no country in this world will be able to avoid it, you just have to be prepared and face it like a man.<br><br></div>
