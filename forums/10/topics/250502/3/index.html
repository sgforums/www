Unless you meet someone who experienced it, or personally experienced it, most of us are blind to what is happening.<br><br>I know for a fact, that many IT projects are contracted out to Indian IT firms, whom then will not employ Singaporeans unless it is REALLY REALLY cannot help it, and will go to India to source for IT people to come here to Singapore to work on the project.<br><br>From the experience I know, the company giving out the contract, is convinced (duped) by the Indian IT firm, that whatever requirements they need, Singaporeans cannot fulfill it. From my knowledge of Singapore workers, this is absolutely not true.<br><br>Its not a question on whether Singaporeans are incapable of helping themselves. Its a question on how even our own govt and own companies kick Singaporeans out of the picture and use foreigners, even when there ARE singaporeans willing to do the job.<br><br>This is so sad, and is unlike Korea or Japan, where the national spirit is so strong, that they will consider local first, before outsiders.<br><br>Then there is another case. A govt agency awarding a project to a big IT local consulting firm (GLC actually), whom in turn awards a project to an Indian IT firm, whom then sub-contracts again to another Indian IT firm.

Why is that so? Its because none of our companies here have the experience of running a casino or such a huge resort, thus its reasonable for the govt to give this to the foreign company experienced in such a project.<br>Two, our govt set out certain criteria, to ensure that the IR WILL do the economy good. The companies running the IR are made to ensure certain levels of investment are always in Singapore.<br><br>Giving blindly to useless local companies like Malaysia is stupid. But giving to foreign companies, when CLEARLY (I am telling you clearing coz I was too lazy to reply you just now, but our grads CAN and ARE able to take on indian graduates), the locals are able to do an equally good job, is really stupid. Coz end of the day, these companies do not have the same restrictions as IR, and money is being siphoned out of our country, thus doing our country and our locals no good.</div>
