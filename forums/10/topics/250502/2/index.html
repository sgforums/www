            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The idea has rule-of-thumb application in many places, but it is commonly misused. For example, it is a misuse to state that a solution to a problem "fits the 80-20 rule" just because it fits 80% of the cases; it must be implied that this solution requires only 20% of the resources needed to solve all cases.<br><br>Mathematically, where something is shared among a sufficiently large set of participants, there will always be a number k between 50 and 100 such that k% is taken by (100 − k)% of the participants; however, k may vary from 50 in the case of equal distribution to nearly 100 in the case of a tiny number of participants taking almost all of the resources. There is nothing special about the number 80, but many systems will have k somewhere around this region of intermediate imbalance in distribution.<br><br>This is a special case of the wider phenomenon of Pareto distributions. If the parameters in the Pareto distribution are suitably chosen, then one would have not only 80% of effects coming from 20% of causes, but also 80% of that top 80% of effects coming from 20% of that top 20% of causes, and so on (80% of 80% is 64%; 20% of 20% is 4%, so this implies a "64-4 law").<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">One should not be seduced by the symmetry of the idealised case - 80-20 is only a shorthand for the general principle at work.</span> In individual cases, the distribution could just as well be say 80-10 or 80-30. (There is no need for the two numbers to add up to 100%, as they are measures of different things, eg 'number of customers' vs 'amount spent'). The classic 80-20 distribution occurs when the gradient of the line is -1 when plotted on log-log axes of equal scaling.</strong> </blockquote>Question: Is this 80/20 rule in our case the result of fair or unfair processes? After all one can probably find the 80/20 rule in many differing countries, and not all have the same quality of life.<br><br>What is it for us now?</div>

Employed households across the board experienced an increase in income per household in real terms,'' said the DOS report.<br><br>However, the DOS says that despite the strong pickup in income per household member among the lower-income employed households, individual wages among lower-income workers had generally remained stagnant.<br><br>It says this apparent discrepancy can be explained by two factors. First, there had been an increase in the number of working persons in the lower-income employed homes as more had been able to get jobs in a growing economy.<br><br>Secondly, there had been a reduction in the size of households during 2006, thereby increasing the average income of each member in the household. (Some of the reasons households shrink include children moving out to form their own nuclear families after marriage, death, divorce or a rental tenant leaving).<br><br>For statistical purpose, a household refers to a group of persons living in the same dwelling unit and sharing common living arrangements. A household may comprise related or unrelated members. Incomes taken in consideration do not include those of domestic workers.<br><br>DOS said that in real terms, the income of each working household in the lowest 10 per cent of homes had recovered to the 2001 level.<br><br>For all other income groups, their incomes had recorded new highs.<br><br>In particular, the higher-income households saw faster income growth, reflecting higher wage increases for skilled and knowledge workers.<br><br>This means that the income distribution among all employed households continued to widen.<br><br>The study also found that more homes had moved up to the higher-income brackets. In 2006, half of employed households had household income of at least $4,500 generated from work, up from $4,320 in the previous year.<br><br>There were also more employed households with $10,000 or more household income last year - 15.8 per cent, against 14.7 per cent in 2005.<br><br>Interestingly, while all ethnic groups enjoyed growth of household income in 2006, Indians showed the faster increase in average household income at 4.2 per cent, as against 3.5 per cent for Chinese and 3.1 per cent for Malays.<br><br>For more details of the household income trends, go to DOS's website at http://www.singstat.gov.sg<br><br>Â» Have your say on this and other issues in our forum pages<br></blockquote></div>

The payslips of many people are decided by the private companies they work for that probably pays according to the skills the employee has.. even the government cant do anything.. even though they somewhat promised.. except increase their own pay  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>seriously i have no idea how one would go about lowering the income gap<br><br>And even if it is possible is it desirable? Imagine if we really did lower the income gap that would mean A CEO of a company that brings about employment to thousands of people, a company that manufactures products that bring about a rise in the standard of living of the population, a company he painstakingly built from nothing, would earn somewhat the same (perhaps afew K higher) as those he employs? now thats not fair isnt it.. and it would drive all entrepreneurs away which ultimately would result in damage to the economy.<br><br>Yes there are some people suffering..  but its not the system's fault.. If the system could speak, it might say 'Its nothing personal' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> They just have to find a way to survive or they don't.<br><br></div></blockquote>Well, for a start, YOU can do something about yourself. Build up your skills and EQ skills and move towards foreign companies. Many Singapore companies typically pay real low pay, and force people to work like horses.<br><br>And note, I did not mention lower the income gap. I meant helping the poor to try to bridge the income gap. Those that are caught in the whirlwind progression of our economy and whom are helpless to do anything about it.<br><br>If you look at our Gini coefficiency, our gap is something like 3rd world countries.<br><br>Sometimes, I believe becoz we move so fast within 30 years from 3rd world to 1st world living, many people are caught in their tracks, and cannot react fast enough to the changes. Credit to LKY for bringing us up to this level, but the consequence is that many people are left behind.</div>
