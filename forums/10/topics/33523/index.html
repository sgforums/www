            <div class='col-md body'>Okay. Enough of the Malaysia-flaming. Can we get back to internal topics?<br><br>Being part of the education system in Singapore [I'm in ACS(I)], I feel that the standard of education in Singapore is too high and the O and A Level examination thing should be changed.<br><br>Firstly, the systen in Singapore is too exam-based. Everything you hear from the teachers in Sec3 to Sec4 is about how to avoid losing marks by doing correct working (in Maths) blah blah blah which is really infuriating for a person like me who just goes for the answers and does not like wasting time on stating working when you've done it on rough paper in the first place. In Maths papers, you can just do the working and get a wrong answer but still get a majority of marks as "working marks". Does this make sense?  To me, Mathematics is about calculations and getting the correct answer in is the main goal. In the end, the O Level system, in its aims to ensure that the students know what they're doing, Singaporean teachers twist everything and tell everyone how to do the working and couldn't care less about your answers because all they want you to do is to get an A1 in that subject and raise the ranking of the school in the Straits Times (gonna raise that issue later).<br><br>I know that carbon under pressure produces a diamond, but MOE is seriously over-emphasising this "proverb". Everyone is over-stressed. Even Primary School kids can be over-stressed and committ suicide when they're supposed to have a happy childhood. Probably the best example of stressing kids regarded as "the best method to make students do better" is the River Valley High School.<br><br>My cousin was posted to RVHS after a stint in another school (I forgot which one) as a teacher. Using her usual method of getting close to students and to know their strengths and weaknesses to teach them better, the RVHS principal disagreed with her teaching method, saying that "Teachers and students should be poles apart. The teacher's job is to stress the students so that the students will be compelled to do better." Disturbed by this, my cousin, being a civil servant, transferred out a year later.<br><br>Under the excuse of "international competition" and "no natural resources but people", is it justified to starve the kids of a happy and memorable childhood just to get a super-good education to best the world? It is no surprise that the students which the MOE produce students that top the world in subjects like Math and Science, but do rather badly in Humanities.<br><br>The subject of Social Studies. In Singapore, Social Studies is another word for "must-do-in-exam-propaganda-subject".<br>Having studied it for a year and reading through this year's textbook, it is pure propaganda. In taking advantage of the general student's mentality of "will come out in exam, must study" and making the subject an elective Humanities subject (elective humanity is half a subject. Social Studies makes up half your marks in Combined Humanities, plus another half of History, Geography or Literature. You cannot drop an elective humanity). Is pure mugging going to instill patriotism for the country through compulsory-studying propaganda? No.<br><br>I'm not finished... will add later.</div>

It is never easy for one to reach a compromise ie having a not so stressful education system and yet have the ability to keep on with the change in technology. About the social studies program, i too, have undergone it, and i found it quite educational.Of course some of the topics may seem to be propaganda, but if you apply the imformation given in the future, it can be of quite good use.For example, the social studies shows examples of good and bad goverments, ie rise and fall of vienice etc.</div>
