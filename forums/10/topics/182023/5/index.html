It happens everywhere in capitalism market.<br></strong><br><br>exactly, it happens everywhere so your claim that fuel price is increasing elsewhere is merely the same thing as fuel price is increasing here.<br><br><strong><br>At least in Singapore, the fares is affordable and you get World Class transportation system.<br></strong><br><br>and elsewhere public transportation is unafforable?  and what do you have to give up in return for our world class system?  individual wish for car ownership?  and is ours the only world class system?  japan, hong kong, taiwan have second class systems?<br><br><strong><br>Even with their government subsidise, the fare is still higher than Singapore.<br></strong><br><br>for a tourist perhaps but not for the locals who have yearly passes that work out just the same.<br><br><strong><br>Do you want an inefficient subsidise public transportation or an efficient public own transportation?<br></strong><br><br>before you ask this question you should ask yourself given the monopoly it has, the huge customer base it enjoys because nobody can afford cars, is the local public transportation as efficient as it ought or should be?<br><br><strong><br>Over there, ratepayers that don't drive (poor folks) subsides those that drives (apparently more well-off).<br></strong><br><br>that's a bit far fetched.  please quantify your statement.<br><br><strong><br>You call this fair? In Singapore, you don't pay a single cents if you don't drive. The public transport system is good enough. If you chose to drive, you pay.

Why would you want to see our government fail elsewhere? Afterall, their success will benefits us all. In business, sometime you pay a price to learn. The game is not over yet.

Bare that in mind.<br></strong><br><br>i have no problems, do you?  i didn't say i wish to see the govt fail elsewhere, on the contrary i said i wish to see the govt succeed elsewhere since you said anyone (including the govt) can succeed anywhere else.<br><br>somehow their success has been mostly local successes, built upon monopolistic rules and regulations that benefit themselves at the detriment of individual entreprises.  paying a price to learn is well and good, but please do so with your own money and not the people's money.<br><br>yes the game is not over yet, and if you continue to play the way you have always been playing, someday there will be serious unrest ...<br></blockquote></div>

Too many a times have we seen the government fail to remember that they are elected by the people for the people. Keeping investments and keeping Singapore's economy is one thing. Doing it at the expense of the citizens is another.<br><br>That being said; standing up to be counted, volunteering and putting in your own money can be at best, valued as courage and a true passion for the good of the people. It doesn't mean anyone who volunteers has the capacity to handle the role and responsibility.<br><br>While the incumbent PAP has not done everything right, they have brought Singapore to where it is today.

And their credentials, for the majority, fail to show that they have the experience or the capability to live up to the expectation.<br><br>True that we do not know much about PAP candidates but we all know that PAP will not put any Tom, Dick or Harry into the election simply because they volunteer. I believe if we were to disect any PAP candidates and pit them against the opposition, even the lesser of them would have come with substantial background and experiences to show that they can do the job better.<br><br>My suggestion to the opposition is simple. Rather wait for people to volunteer; they need to actively court potential candidates that could bring credibility to their party. Successful business, experienced managers, self-made millionaires, union leaders etcÂ…<br><br>Many would like to see more opposition in the government. But I believe majority will not want to put Singapore's future at risk simply for the sake of seeing more opposition. Studies have shown that most Singaporeans would like to see more opposition but they would still like PAP to run the show. Isn't that what the opposition resign to last election?

Everything changes so quickly nowadays that background becomes totally worthless within 5 yrs. Plus, your statement seems to implicitly assume that the opposition put any Tom, Dick and Harry into elections, which I believe is an unfair assumption to make.<br><br>5) Hmmm.... guess tt's an issue for the opposition.
