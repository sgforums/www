Now you are comparing Singapore with New York and Chicago. How many locals commute by cars within New York City? Most of them take subway right? Why???<br><br><strong> what? westerners pay through their noses for cars? first time i hear anybody say this. is it because ang mohs have bigger noses that they pay a lot more thru their noses? exactly, what is a necessity to them is a luxury to us. what is affordable to most of them is unreachable by many here. </strong><br>I am referring to poor westerners. You definitely did not mix around with poor locals. I think car ownership is utmost important to you. In Singapore, is car a necessity to you? What is a necessity to you does not mean a necessity to others.<br><br><strong> their fuel price increase, ours have remained stagnant? so their govt has been subsidising until they can't afford to anymore. ours? no subsidies since day one. </strong><br>It means our government knows very early that fuel subsidies donÂ’t work. Over there, where does fuel subsidy come from? Taxpayer money! How about those poor taxpayers that canÂ’t afford to drive subsidize those who drive?<br><br><strong> exactly, it happens everywhere so your claim that fuel price is increasing elsewhere is merely the same thing as fuel price is increasing here.</strong><br>Agree.<br><br><strong> and elsewhere public transportation is unafforable? and what do you have to give up in return for our world class system? individual wish for car ownership? and is ours the only world class system? japan, hong kong, taiwan have second class systems? </strong><br>What is the point of owning cars and canÂ’t afford to drive? Look at Tokyo, most locals take subway anyway.<br><br><strong> for a tourist perhaps but not for the locals who have yearly passes that work out just the same. </strong><br>Agree. Even with subsidies it works out just the same.<br><br><strong> before you ask this question you should ask yourself given the monopoly it has, the huge customer base it enjoys because nobody can afford cars, is the local public transportation as efficient as it ought or should be? </strong><br>Tell me which country public transportation is not monopolized by private entity or government? You need economy of scale to be viable and efficient. I would rather the monopoly falls into an entity that serve public interest. Yes, our local public transportation is efficient, though we are not 100% perfect.<br><br><strong> that's a bit far fetched. please quantify your statement. </strong><br>Easy, over there where does fuel subsidy come from? Taxpayer money! How about those poor taxpayers that canÂ’t afford to drive subsidize those who drive?<br><br><strong> any different elsewhere? </strong><br>Yes, refer to above.<br><br><strong> simple. monopoly means only bread crumbs left for any aspiring local entrepreneur ...</strong><br>If you are real entrepreneur, nothing can stop you.<br><br><strong> examples? there are volumes of anti-trust cases in US and Europe ... small players are well protected and where the industry structure allows, thrives on fair competition. our anti-trust laws have only just started, even then, i don't think it would touch the GLCs ...</strong><br>You are naive. Anti-trust laws and fair trade act are often manipulated to protect oneÂ’s interest. Fair trade act is used to protect a particular business entity, not consumers. Anti-trust law is often political driven, not consumer driven.<br><br><strong> friend who rented a stall from a food court owned by a GLC, the rental was so high his daily earnings couldn't even cover rental, let alone supplies and he had to wind up his business in the end. in his case, 100% of the money he earned went to the govt. what about taxi drivers? easily 50% of their daily takings go straight to govt owned cab companies. </strong><br>This is a business failure. Your friendÂ’s did not do his sum before jump into the business. Did the GLC point a gun at your friend to rent the stall?<br><br><strong> i have no problems, do you? i didn't say i wish to see the govt fail elsewhere, on the contrary i said i wish to see the govt succeed elsewhere since you said anyone (including the govt) can succeed anywhere else.<br><br>somehow their success has been mostly local successes, built upon monopolistic rules and regulations that benefit themselves at the detriment of individual entreprises. </strong><br>Local success??? Capital land? SingTel?<br><br><strong> paying a price to learn is well and good, but please do so with your own money and not the people's money. </strong><br>Where do you expect the money comes from??? Ministerial wealth?<br><br><strong>yes the game is not over yet, and if you continue to play the way you have always been playing, someday there will be serious unrest ...</strong><br>FYI, I am a Singaporean without any party connection. If more irresponsible opposition candidates vote into cabinet than there will be serious unrest.<br></div>

The person is probably politically blind and not aware of the current affairs happening around him/her.<br><br>That being said... people living in Potong Pasir has expressways bypass them, deprive goodies from government and even Chiam has to live with begging for budget from his opponent who lost to him in the last GE.<br><br>In addition, they have to pay 4 ERP charges to get into town... first one in bendemeer, second one for PIE, third for CTE and the last one is CBD. Walk into PP and you seem to take 5-10 years back into Singapore's history. Can't blame people for wanting upgrades.<br><br>The crux of the issue is... why would upgrading be part of political bargain? Upgrading should be the HDB/government's responsibility and not the ruling party's gift to the people. I like one comment from last GE when someone ask if it means that people living in opposition wards does not need to pay tax. Afterall, upgrading fees are subsidize by tax payers money.

I can't really be bother to explain these fundamentals. Suppose we have 7 million and we can now reduce the cost for public transport.

Then I conclude that not only have you not been to US, you are just plain stupid to think everything has constant cost regardless of where you are.<br><br>How much do you think a BigMac meal cost in Malaysia (I sure you must have been to Malaysia)? That's right RM$6! But wait, should it cost RM$12 since it cost $6 here???<br><br>Like I've said. If you're earning SGD and spending it all in US. Then yes. You are poorer. Likewise, if you take all your SGD and spend only in Malaysia, then you are wealthier. But if you take your SGD and spend it in SG, it's the same as a Malaysian taking his RM and spending it in Malaysia.<br><br>Please don't be a fool and make your statement without doing your homework.

San Francisco? London? I've just return from San Jose and a BigMac meal there cost me US$5.25 before tax. In London, it cost me almost 6 pounds. Shall I mention prices in Hamburg? What happen to Malaysia's BigMac price then?<br><br>Even McDonald's cost differently between those located in heartland Singapore and in ShentonWay but they maintain around the $5-6 mark.<br><br>Just put up 2 links and you justify that price is constant?<br></strong><br><br>you challenged me by saying it is not US$4.  i showed you it is US$4, maybe not at all places but definitely at some of the places, the price of big mac meals is US$4.<br><br>you don't seem to get what i'm saying, i'm not arguing about price constancy.  i'm not even concerned about big mac prices.  i'm just using the big mac to illustrate that on average with purchasing power parity, things are going to cost the same in both places and when you have that and yet salaries are lower here, it simply means our purchasing power is not as strong as the other place and so we can only afford less.<br><br><strong><br>Anyway, these are irrelevant. As I've said, there's only significant difference if you live in Malaysia and is paid in US dollars.<br></strong><br><br>yes i agwee, you're not exactly relevant here but its ok.<br><br>let's us assume for a moment that you are right.  that things have the same price tag (irregardless of their currencies) anywhere in the world.  so a mac in US costs US$6.  a mac in UK costs 6 pounds.  a mac in SG costs SGD $6 and a mac in Malaysia costs RM6.  going back to where we left off.<br><br>in US,<br>salaries = US40K-65K (after deducting 40% tax)<br>big mac = US6<br>let's take away the K to simplify calculations.<br>price of big mac as a percentage of salary = 6 / 40 to 6 / 65 = 15% to 9%<br><br>in SG,<br>salaries: SGD35K-50K (haven't deduct CPF and taxes yet)<br>big mac: SGD$6<br>similarly taking away the K,<br>price of big mac as percentage of salary = 6 / 35 to 6 / 50 = 17% to 12%<br><br>so i'm still right after all!  their higher salaries more than compensates for their higher taxes so that even while they have to buy a US$6 big mac whereas we can buy an SGD$6 big mac, given their salaries, their big macs are actually more affordable than our big macs.<br><br>so you're wrong in saying that because they are spending US$, their situation is worse off.<br><br>on top of that, they don't have to "pay thru their noses" to own cars remember?<br></blockquote></div>
