Other western countries are catching up too. Singapore has one of the best public transport systems in the World. If given a choice, many foreigners would rather take public transport. Many foreigners are forced to own cars because their public transport is expensive and useless. Those poor folks who cannot afford cars are confined at home. BTW, Singapore taxi fare is one of the cheapest in the World. Try taking taxi in western countries.<br><br>What is your solution to our traffic problem?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by casino_king:</div><div class="quote_body">Only the rich - so you see, the system is by the rich for the rich. I guess you must be "the rich."<br><br>That is why there is the need for the legal cheating and the suppression to go on. You see, the majority are "the poor."

Even China economy is gradually moving toward capitalism. Nobody is going to deprive you from getting rich. Bare in mind, you need to be rich to help the poor. Wrong! I am not rich. I drive a 10 years old Nissan March. Not for my job, I will take public transport.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is a small country with limited land space. With cheaper cars, it'll mean more traffic jams.
