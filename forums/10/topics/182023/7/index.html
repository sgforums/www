So far, it has proven to be a success formula.<br></strong><br><br>nobody owes me a living too.  but being successful doesn't prevent me from being sensitive to the plights of the less well off and to speak up for injustice.<br><br><strong><br>Improvement on infrastructure mean increasing the train frequency, increasing the number of trains, add more routes etc... I doubt you will ever understand unless you ran your own business.<br></strong><br><br>by how much can you increase train frequency?  at most a minute or two in between trains.  increase the number of trains so what?  there is only one track that can only carry that many trains at any given time.  i seriously think you need to learn some common sense from common folks.  the way you run trains, i'm glad you're not the minister of transport.<br><br><strong><br>I wasn't born rich.<br></strong><br><br>now that you are, you're forgetting your roots and demanding that common folks be jam packed inside trains like sardine?  how selfish you are.<br><br><strong><br>Who are you that I should justify my claims? Do you own property and car in Hong Kong?<br></strong><br><br>why you care?  i won't pursue this further if you can't substantiate what you're saying.  so now you're trying to show off you have property and car in hong kong is it?  since you're so rich, it is no wonder you have absolutely no care or concern for the plights of the common folks who have to bear with the inadequacies of public transportation day in day out.<br><br><strong><br>I didn't challenge you saying that a BigMac meal is not US$4.<br></strong><br><br>then what is this: "So you think a BigMac meal cost US$4 because it cost about S$6 here?"<br><br><strong><br>I challenge you because you used a ridiculous hypothesis that a burger in Singapore would cost S$2 if it cost US$1 in justifying that it'll cost more because you're earning SGD. I've said that price of specific items are irrelevant.<br></strong><br><br>don't be stupid please.  how many times must i repeat myself?  the burger is just an artefact used to explain how purchasing power parity, if it were to operate to its full efficiency would result in identical items to cost the same in two different places.  granted it may not be perfect there are cases (which i demonstrated) where it actually holds true.<br><br><strong><br>Why are you so fixated with specific numbers?<br></strong><br><br>do not forget, you're the one who started using numbers.  i'm merely using your numbers to prove you wrong.<br><br><strong><br>It began with you saying that US citizens earns more a person of the same profession and calibre.<br></strong><br><br>that wasn't exactly what i said.  i said "they certainly earn much higher wages that more than compensate for higher taxes".  your US wages of "US65K-US90K" are indeed much higher than our wages of SGD35K-50K which more than compensates for higher US taxes because ultimately, after deducting for taxes, your "US40K-65K" is still higher than our SGD35K-50K which is as yet undeducted.<br><br><strong><br>I said that though that maybe true, both will be earning approximately the same after tax.<br></strong><br><br>really?  let me refresh your memory again.  you began by saying 'wrong again. they do not earn higher wages compared to Singaporeans.'  your "US65K-US90K" wages are indeed much higher than our wages of SGD35K-50K.  your statement would only be correct if you have said "their net income is not significantly higher than ours but still higher no doubt, despite their 40% taxes".<br><br><strong><br>You should be comparing between someone who earns US100k but end up with about US60k after tax and someone who earns approx SGD60k after tax. Don't pluck numbers to suit your calculations.<br></strong><br><br>i was merely using your figures of US65K-US90K.  now you're changing it to US100k to better suit your arguments.  so who is the one plucking numbers to suit his calculations?<br></blockquote></div>
