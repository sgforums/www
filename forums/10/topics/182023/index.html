            <div class='col-md body'>You might want to take a look at these facts.<br><br>in 1988<br><br>opposition won 37% of votes but gets only 1 seat in parliament.

            <div class='col-md body'>What make U say tat. I,m not staying hougang. Heard tat the resident there like him. He is good mp willing to help &amp; serve the people there.<br>I think this yrs a lot of policy no good, e.g workfare bonus<br>Those disabled ,  older worker can,t find a jobs due to age not qualify for the bonus. These are the people who really need the money.<br>The garmen always say economy good , jobless rate low not true b,cos election tactic.<br>Went for wda jobfair plumbing specialist, they wanted 70 pple , u know how much pple came to apply 200 pple, some more this only first batch still got second batch on and on . Some more the stactistic of jobles rate not truth. If U register for unemployment  after 3 months , no response from them. After 3 months never register again , MOM asume tat U a employ. so the figure they gave U is not correct.<br>I,ve went to this coming Jobfair, register for low end jobs rm careerlink. I saw this guys 24 yrs old , very young with a degree jobless for many months. so more have 2 yrs experience previously.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>instead of criticising or even dismissing anonymous coward's concerns, the opposition should seriously look into his concerns.  if running for election is like selling a good or service, then anonymous coward is a potential customer and here we have a potential customer telling you what he wants and if you don't give him what he wants he will not patronise your stall.  in fact, i tend to think that he would like to patronise your stall otherwise he wouldn't have been disappointed but if you do not satsify his basic needs, he will still walk away.<br><br>i would categorise him as belonging to the swing vote group of perhaps 20% of the voters, with 40% being outright pissed with PAP and 40% pah si will vote for PAP one.  in other words, the key to winning really is to win the swing votes and that means giving what the swing voters want.<br><br>the very basic quality they're looking for is ... quality.  i see some good quality candidates but they're trying to chew more than they can bite, by trying to win a GRC.  if you put these good quality candidates, like the medical doctor or Gomez in a single ward, swing voters like anonymous crowd would have more confidence with opposition quality and perhaps there is a fighting chance.  it is utterly futile to try and win a GRC for GRCs are helmed by heavy weights and giants, which cannot be toppled yet.<br><br>in order to win a GRC, you have to first win all the single seats, do a good job and continue to be re-elected for at least a second term.  only then would singaporeans come to know who these candidates are and their confidence and trust can be gained.  only when you have enough single seat veterans can you then pool these veterans together to form a credible GRC team that the people would come to trust.  until then, you can forget about GRCs.</div>
