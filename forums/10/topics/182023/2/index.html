Ling How Doong didn't survive one term.  why?  because he looks like a butcher and speaks with no flair.  from what i can gather, the younger generation has more faith in the PAP than the older generation and as the latter passes on, we're gonna have an overwhelmingly pro-PAP electorate that would make it extra difficult for the opposition to turn the tables unless they can re-invent themselves ...<br><br></blockquote></div>

As I've stated in my last posting, people vote for the opposition for 2 reason;<br><br>1) They think that the opposition can do a good job despite their lack of credentials (as evident in this thread).<br>2) They are simply too fed up with PAP that they'll vote for anyone else (like me).<br><br>Imagine now that you have a candidate who (for example) is a self-made man who fought against poverty to become a businessman, politically active, runs a successful company that actively pushes for employee benefits and is a philanthropist.<br><br>What do you think the opposition success rate is, compared to a 28 year old passionate system administrator who probably couldn't get a job as a IT manager because of his lack of management experience?<br><br>Many of my friends feels the same way.
