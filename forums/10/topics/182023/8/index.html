There are many types of businessman and/or entreprener.

I don't believe in property is for investment, angmo don't do that. That why you don't see them carrying their door along when they are outside (more carefree life style).<br><br>A flat to me is actually for my shelter needs only and nothing else. A HDB flat only a lease to you, 60 years may be you will be relocated again. What there to be proud of having a 5 rms or even exec units. (only unless it landed and/or freehold 999)<br><br>Your $1 compensation, is just like saying good morning to Mr Robin Hood. I don't want to spell it out (You know it).

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not saying that money is not essential.  Unfortunately, under the capitalist system, money is important.  But there must still be a balance, and an understanding that politics goes far beyond economics.  Politics governs your way of life, and especially in Singapore, your ability to think and to come to your own opinions.  There are myriad other important matters that politics shape as well.<br><br>If you want to fight for these other intangible aspects of life, then what I am suggesting is that a person should vote for the opposition even if it is simply for the sake of having one - because it is symbolic, and because without a symbol of dissent, the incumbent can only become complacent and even more authoritarian (on this point, my view is that the incumbent has become less authoritarian over the many years, but primarily for reasons other than domestic politics).<br><br>We now have more qualified and credible members of the opposition standing for elections.  They may not be the best brains, but at least they have heart.  Why should we not give them a chance?  Is there so much to lose in reality or is it just an irrational fear of economic collapse?  And there is so much to gain...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've stated in my earlier post that I've read and wrote enough; and so I thought I'll sit back, come in to read once in a while and wait for the GE. Unfortunately, it seems that is not possible...<br><br>So.. to ObviousMan  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I'm not King108. If there's anyone else in this thread who thinks like myself, I would say it's Oxford Mushroom. Reading past posting should give clarity as to whether King108 is my clone.<br><br>I chose this nickname because I didn't want to burn too many brain cells thinking of a nice nickname; only to realize that it has already been taken.<br><br>"Anonymous Coward" is a term applied within some online communities to describe users who post without a handle; it is a dummy name attributed to anonymous posts used by some weblogs that allow posting by people without registering for accounts.<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_Coward<br><br>I edited my profile... thanks to ObviousMan, who help me realize that it is actually possible to look into one's profile; although the information gathered may not be of much use and may not be true anyway (although mine is). It is not of importance for me to remain anonymous and I am willing to share with anyone my email address.<br><br>I'm not a coward. I supported opposition in their rallies and I would continue to do so. I would love to stand for election but I find myself unqualified, unconvincing and I have too dirty a past that I'll probably be a liability. I don't mind forking out $13000 although I seriously doubt the any party would make me pay with my own money if they felt I can do the job.<br><br>Lastly, I really don't want to make anymore comment on this thread. It has lost it's original intention of suggesting to the opposition that they should be pro-active in recruitment if they wish to win more votes than those from their fervent supporters. I would love to take up the challenge of making more arguments but I've been called childish for doing so.<br><br>After reading all the comments, I find myself questioning the value of having more opposition in the parliament. Almost everyone here believes there is no possibility of them becoming an alternative government (although I think they should); none believe that they are capable of blocking any policy made by the ruling party. And if all they can do is to question these policies, why the need for so many oppositions? ShouldnÂ’t they posses the qualities and knowledge of lawyers like CST and JBJ? I look at Thailand and their quest for "democracy" and I asked myself if I want to put this country into that situation.<br><br>I find myself more reluctant to vote for any candidates without substantial credentials.<br><br>There are supporters here who would vote for the opposition regardless of their candidates; there are those who would vote for the opposition if they have good candidates; they are those who would vote for any good candidates; and there are those who would support the PAP. To each his own and to each, his views and reasons. I am not ashame to say that my reasons are driven by economical, social and political stability.<br></div>

It is not of importance for me to remain anonymous and I am willing to share with anyone my email address.<br><br>I'm not a coward. I supported opposition in their rallies and I would continue to do so. I would love to stand for election but I find myself unqualified, unconvincing and I have too dirty a past that I'll probably be a liability. I don't mind forking out $13000 although I seriously doubt the any party would make me pay with my own money if they felt I can do the job.<br><br>Lastly, I really don't want to make anymore comment on this thread. It has lost it's original intention of suggesting to the opposition that they should be pro-active in recruitment if they wish to win more votes than those from their fervent supporters. I would love to take up the challenge of making more arguments but I've been called childish for doing so.<br><br>After reading all the comments, I find myself questioning the value of having more opposition in the parliament. Almost everyone here believes there is no possibility of them becoming an alternative government (although I think they should); none believe that they are capable of blocking any policy made by the ruling party. And if all they can do is to question these policies, why the need for so many oppositions? ShouldnÂ’t they posses the qualities and knowledge of lawyers like CST and JBJ? I look at Thailand and their quest for "democracy" and I asked myself if I want to put this country into that situation.<br><br>I find myself more reluctant to vote for any candidates without substantial credentials.<br><br>There are supporters here who would vote for the opposition regardless of their candidates; there are those who would vote for the opposition if they have good candidates; they are those who would vote for any good candidates; and there are those who would support the PAP. To each his own and to each, his views and reasons. I am not ashame to say that my reasons are driven by economical, social and political stability.<br></div></blockquote>Just my way of checking by drawing you out dude.<br>People can get in trouble for all sorts of nonsense.<br>To each his own then.</div>
