He could have migrated and lead a good life, get a job befitting his PhD. He chose to stay and fight, I don't agree with all of his methods, but his resilience is rather commendable.</div></blockquote>he is the person who knows more about singapore's politics than any of us.  the fact that he keeps ending up in jail simply mean that he does not have to skill to survive.  obviously, he fights and bring along his family with him.  he goes swimming in a sea of sharks and brings along his family knowing that there are sharks out there.  why din he do something smarter than go swimming in the sea?  surely there are other ways to get across the sea.<br></div>
