If you allow all kinds to operators in to run any route they like in a free-for-all, you will see popular routes oversubscribed whereas non-profitable services will be withdrawn. Those who live in more remote parts will suffer. Forcing operators to run a mixture of profitable and non-profitable routes is the way to go. There must be greater regulation. In addition to giving more privileges to buses over other motorists, bus operators must be required to adhere to certain service standards such as frequency og buses and maximum occupancy.</div>
