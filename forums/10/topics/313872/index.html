              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore. All b<strong>ig things came from small beginnings.</strong></h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>If there is anyone who doubts the
              effectiveness of peaceful protests in Singapore, think again. All big
              things had small beginnings and this saying is particularly true in
              Singapore's case.<br><br>Human nature is such that men always try to
              follow safe courses in life. This is only natural. In Singapore, there
              is a nationwide fear of the Lee Administration if they were to openly
              show their dissatisfaction to their policies. Loss of job, demotion in
              their careers, ostracized from government departments and victimization.<br><br>In
              the past, one used to see protests in numbers no more than 2 or 3. 3
              miserable people standing in a row putting up some placard or other, in
              a country of 4.0 million or so! Hardly a mass movement. The government
              would naturally feel that these 3 isolated individuals is no threat to
              the mighty Lee Kuan Yew family.<br><br>But this was some years ago.
              Steadily we have seen, over the years the numbers of peaceful
              protestors increasing which culminated in the Tak Boleh Tahan of March
              15, 2008 at 2 pm in front of Parliament House; a huge number of 50
              protestors. Oh yes, you may say 50 is hardly a huge number. But it is
              in the Singapore context. In Singapore 10 years ago, you would not have
              been able to find a single person to even raise a whimper in protest,
              let alone publicly doing it!<br><br>And the numbers can only increase
              as time goes on. More and more people will be taking to the streets in
              Singapore as the government will find it increasing difficult to
              justify punishing them. Then, with ever larger numbers out in the
              streets demanding justice, the Lee Regime will find it has no choice
              but to listen to the people to avoid a catastrophe.<br><br>As for
              Singaporeans it now your chance to be a part of the historic political
              change that is imminent in Singapore. You will not be alone as there
              will be thousands of others. And when that change comes, you have the
              benefit of the realization that among the four million Singaporeans, it
              was you who was its pioneer in change. It is a great feeling to have.
              Don’t waste that opportunity.<br><br>If you question my optimism, there
              are good reasons for it. Firstly, in any contest, good always has the
              upper hand over evil. In this case take the government policies. The
              Ministers paying themselves $3.7 million a year each is unacceptable to
              each and every Singaporean, regardless of their social status. In this
              case, resistance to this theft of Singapore’s wealth by these ministers
              is justified and noble. The refusal to give the elderly their CPF
              retirement savings is entirely unacceptable. The government has no
              excuse in not doing their duty under law.<br><br>The government has no
              justification whatever in denying the people their human rights such as
              the right to assemble, which happens to be their right under the
              Constitution. Everyone in Singapore bitterly hates judges like Belinda
              Ang who misuses the law of defamation in order to destroy Lee Kuan
              Yew’s opponents like Dr. Chee Soon Juan. I can go on, but you already
              see my point.<br><br>In all these major areas of contention, the Lee
              Administration has no leg to stand on at all. All they are doing at
              present is to use brute force and the misuse of the law to deny the
              citizens their rights. And when that is the case; the people, and in
              this case; the protestors cause is viewed with sympathy, with kindness
              and with support. They become the underdog suffering under the yoke of
              the bully, Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>Protests in any society is usually the
              last resort in political action. When you have good democratic systems
              in place, there is no need for protests. Political disputes are handled
              in gentlemanly fashion in Parliament where both the government and the
              opposition act in a fair minded honorable manner. Where the incumbent
              government steps aside where it is lawfully defeated in elections
              making way for the opposition. Where disputes are argued in Parliament
              in a temperate decorous manner as gentleman do and solutions are found
              in a civilized democratic fashion.<br><br>But when you see that a
              government like that of Lee Kuan Yew is not prepared to play by the
              rules; when they deliberately cheat and rig elections by defamation
              actions and what not, to destroy the opposition, the people cannot get
              redress for the woes through normal Parliamentary channels. They have
              no choice but to resort to peaceful protests; a right which is
              enshrined as a fundamental right of the people in the Constitution.<br><br>In
              today’s age, protest is the greatest tool that any citizen can have.
              With instant communication throughout the world of news images and
              video, the damage done to the reputation of any government is
              infinitely greater. No government can afford to stand idly by in the
              face of mounting protestors. They have to either use force to stop them
              or they have to give in to their demands. And using force,
              unfortunately for governments is a double edged sword. You may
              initially thwart an uprising but in the end, you will have to face a
              much greater uprising than the one before.<br><br>Singapore is uniquely
              suited for protests. A highly densely built up place with great people
              density. Also it is an international city depending on tourism and
              international commerce. It cannot be seen as a place where thousands of
              peaceful protestors are shot. Singapore is not Tien Anmen.<br><br>As
              for the 50 at the Tak Boleh Tahan on March 15, 2008, the numbers will
              grow. I understand when Mahatma Gandhi started off in Pietermartizburg;
              Natal South Africa at the turn of the last century, his movement for
              civil rights consisted of only one man, himself! I don’t have to tell
              you how many millions joined him in the peaceful protests as time went
              on to drive the mighty British Imperials out of India. Same with
              Mandela, same with Martin Luther King, same with all protest movements
              who have succeeded throughout the world. They all have one quality in
              common. They had truth on their side.<br><br>In the same way in
              Singapore, in Dr. Chee Soon Juan's peaceful protests, he has truth on
              his side. He has law on his side. He has justice on his side. He has
              compassion on his side. Compassion for the poor. The law, in the
              Constitutional right to protest. The truth, since the Lee regime
              illegally stays in power by unlawful means. And this quality of truth
              and justice being on the side of Dr. Chee and the protestors; this
              gives them strength. And with this strength, the numbers will grow as
              others will see the light and join in, and then you have a full scale
              movement.<br><br>Everyone has his part to play in this. I can educate
              and disseminate these facts through this blog. The readership of this
              blog is steadily rising, thank you. My call to each reader to
              disseminate it has had positive results. The information is being
              widely spread. And I shall continue writing as my contribution to the
              cause of democracy. If in Singapore, you can join the protests.
              Everyone can contribute in their own small way. And it is with this
              combined and determined effort on everyone's part that will even topple
              the mighty Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>
