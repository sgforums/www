So whoever is going to sit in the Oval office will still have to work on Iraq for the first few years.<br><br>Rather than military operation with regime changed as objective. A wider expansion on the fight against terrorist will be redeployment of smaller forces and more focus on Terrorist cell and organization across the region.

If by anything, getting out of there and not giving cause for some nationalist elements, even supposed ones, excuses for guerrilla warfare against the US. As it is, there are 3 main factions, and even within the Sunni and Shia Arabs, there is plenty of intra-factional fighting and the Iraqi Govt continues to coast towards oblivion. Not least, the real threats to the entire concept of an Iraqi state come from the south and north; Iran and Saudi Arabia.<br><br><blockquote>Rather than military operation with regime changed as objective.
