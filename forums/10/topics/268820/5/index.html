But since she is running as the first Female commander in chief and people are voting for it. I do believe the True test in voting for Hiliary is during voters cast the vote, The reality is when people start seeing Bill more often what would they remember.<br><br>Obama raise a lot of $$ he has that financial capacity to go thru the end. He has the demeanor in his speech. If you listen carefully when he speaks he always fall back into the history of US civil liberty within context. That helps to get support from both parties member. Obama may also be the right profile to be the next chief for 2 reasons.  First he doesn't have the excess baggage that Hiliary is carrying from Bill that I think is important. The future foreign policy that needs attention will be coming out from Africa and the middle east.  Than again the show is still early into</div>
