            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by walesa:</div><div class="quote_body">I think the bigger flaw stems from Al Gore's campaign - by distancing himself from Clinton, he made himself unavailable to most (if not all) of the key players who had propelled Clinton to office in 1992. Of course, the worse thing he could have done was to prevent Clinton, who'd readily made himself available, from campaigning for him. Besides, I'm unconvinced if Al Gore had had James Carville (the strategist who had propelled Clinton to office in '92 and re-election in '96) on board running his strategy, he'd have lost.<br><br>Of course, it's easy for me to talk about that on hindsight, but if you consider the fact that Gore lost by 537 votes in Florida - a state where more than 100, 000 votes went to Ralph Nader - and numerous other close losses elsewhere (and Gore had the simple majority, mind), the whole Clinton economic legacy could have just tipped things his way.<br><br>The whole notion of the GOP paddling their religious drivel to the fundamentalists doesn't really strike a chord with me despite it covering 10% of the eligible electorate because it's hard to track how many of those eligible in this category actually turned up to vote on election day. Referring to the above paragraph, it's pretty clear - to me, at least - Al Gore's indiscretions which could have swung things his way. Ironically, if you needed an indication (Gore was needlessly worried about the female votes considering the Lewinsky affair), more women had actually voted for him in 2000 than those who did for Clinton's re-election bid in '96 - it's indeed a shame, among his other oversights, he placed too much of an emphasis on the women's votes.</div></blockquote>Certainly if he allowed Clinton to back him, I believe more of the Democrat base would have supported him. However, if I recall correctly, feminists are quite a number in the democrat bloc and perhaps he tried to gain their support. What with the Lewinsky scandal and the feminists were baying for Clinton's blood. It might have been remedied if Hillary Clinton came out as well to support Gore.<br><br>Not entirely sure what was the state of the Democrat leadership then but the Republican political machinery managed to side track the debate into a values debate (pretty much what the PAP does every election) which the Democrats lost. It's little wonder that Hillary Clinton herself tried to play the values thing especially when she tried (foolhardy in my opinion) to ban violent video games or something like that.<br><br>Apparently, from some articles I read, the Republicans, at least for the 2004 election, went as far as getting vehicles to transport their supporters to the booths. The trouble with the electoral system of course, is that voting is not compulsory. It's one thing to get supporters, it is another to get them to vote.</div>

Actually they consider most of the political establishment as idiots. The reason being is that Howard is feeling weak politically at home with rising domestic resistance to Australian involvement of the war and the rising popularity of his political opponents made him attempt to pander to Bush. I mean, he is one of Bush's pet dogs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Actually, CNN and FoxNews are right wing..... and FoxNews hates the Democrats.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> It's not because the Democrats have the most money really. Even news networks know that hte tide of public opinion is against the war.<br><br></div></blockquote>HmmÂ….perspectiveÂ…<br><br>I donÂ’t think Hillary is riding on Bill but more because she is might be the first female commander in chief. She is gaining popularity from different demographic that cut across party line. infact i think her last name maybe a drag rather than positively influence. Voters does not want another Bush nor Clinton to be in the whitehouse.<br><br>As for Bill his popularity maybe stronger in Asia especially after he stepped down in contrast with Walker Bush.  But after 911, public took a 2nd look and the continue developing of Nuke in NK did not help his popularity within the USÂ…..but left with Monica. Both houses were dominated by Republican because voter could not find a cohesive democrats agenda.<br><br>Bill was probably more fortunate during his white house term, For economics success, I would attribute more to James Rubin abilities to reduce interest payment on national debt, and Greenspan abilities to keep interest low during the BillÂ’s years, all these help for the fed to balance budget. Bill was also fortunate that the global economy was ridding on IT growth and increase productivities. I believe the one bill was probably his legacy was 401K Plan.<br><br>As for fiscal cut, (as a matter of perspective) I think he cut too steep into CIA cold war intelligent ops. That may have weakened Intel capabilities on highlighting other threats to the United States. Especially some of the FBI/CIA works. There was serious critical report came up but than it was the beginning of a cool down period between Russia and US. Spooks were out of job. It may have contributed to Clinton miss-calculated the threats and did not response strong enough to take out Osama when he had the chance.  For that he has to live with it.<br><br>I think in the US money is important to run campaign look at the campaign contribution fund they generated. Its a Lot of Money. CNN (Clinton News Network) only Fox audience is republican base.  News media know how to project their candidates in a positive limelight. Opera Winfrey came out to support Obama with fund raising dinner of US$2400 a plate that is hard to bit. So money and media are important.<br><br>I think if one held a democrats view, we tend to see the positive side of it, and if you held a Republican view than it is easy to see the other way.  For democrats I think I will look for the underdog Â“John EdwardÂ”    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

Right after Bush came along, he cut taxes and the recovery took less than a year. It was the fastest every recovery in history of US. And that came after 911.

This bill had taxes cut for the lower class and for small businesses which provide a strong bulk of the employment in the US. The end result was a huge surplus. Please tell me why a huge surplus should appear when you claim he merely rode on their policies. And one more thing, budget surplus depend quite nearly entirely on the previous year's budget policy.<br><br>And yet when taxes were cut, these Republican presidents were unable to balance the budget because they continued heavy spending on the military and other things. Typical Republican budget policies.<br><br>And give historical evidence that taxes cut = economy boomed. Such a correlation is overly simplistic.<br><br>And guess what, George H W Bush did raise taxes at the end of his term in an attempt to address the growing deficit:<br><br><blockquote>Several other factors were key in his defeat, including agreeing in 1990 to raise taxes despite his famous "Read my lips: no new taxes" pledge not to institute any new taxes. In doing so, Bush alienated many members of his conservative base, losing their support for his re-election. Bush raised taxes in an attempt to address an ever-increasing budget deficit, which some attributed the to the Reagan tax cuts and military spending of the 1980s. George Bush had been supported in 1988 by conservatives to continue the Reagan revolution, and was seen as a failure in this regard. Ironically, Bush had previously admonished Reagan's supply side tax cuts in the 1980 presidential primary when he referred to Reagan's tax proposals as "voodoo economics."</blockquote>How many times are you going to ignore what I said before? Reagan spent so much money on the military he sent the country into a huge debt. Under the Clinton administration, the US actually managed to pay off some of that debt, only to have George W. Bush erase all of that. Do note that George W. Bush practically replicated some of the older Republican policies.<br><br><blockquote>really? they didn't back track on kyoto and they didn't back track on foreign policy either. </blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Oh really? The Kyoto treaty was never ratified, since the Republicans were pro-business. The foreign policy? Good lord have you been sleeping the last 10 years? Foreign policy under the Bush administration was a complete polar opposite compared to the Clinton administration's.<br><br><blockquote><br>Wrong again. Social funding hit record highs under Bush.<br>You sure didn't follow US politics did you?</blockquote>For someone who painted all the democrats as bumbling fools in the Californian electric shortage crisis, that is rich. More so for a person who is totally ignorant of history and fires one accusation after another without producing any evidence.<br><br>Are you in the business of rewriting history ? Or are you pretending to be knowledgeable? For one claiming to be, you are doing a really bad job at making it seem like it.</div>
