He has the demeanor in his speech. If you listen carefully when he speaks he always fall back into the history of US civil liberty within context. That helps to get support from both parties member. Obama may also be the right profile to be the next chief for 2 reasons.  First he doesn't have the excess baggage that Hiliary is carrying from Bill that I think is important. The future foreign policy that needs attention will be coming out from Africa and the middle east.  Than again the show is still early into </div></blockquote>Your 2 reasons are self-contradictory (assuming you know what you're talking about, which obviously doesn't look that way) on many fronts.<br><br>Firstly, I'm not sure if that many Americans think Hillary's shouldering Bill's "liabilities" - if anything, and considering Gore's failed campaign in 2000, I'd think more would regard it as an asset. Although, should she get elected, the inevitably higher expectations (founded on her husband's achievements) placed on her shoulders would be opened to debate. That said, I think it's important for those voting for her to realise she's not going to be like her husband and it certainly wouldn't make sense for her to be judged on benchmarks set by her husband.<br><br>Secondly, the Clinton administration did more for Africa and the Middle East than any other administrations since the second world war. How you perceive Hillary to be disadvantaged through her association with the most active President in the aforementioned regions is beyond me. For you to make such shallow sweeping statements clearly indicate how little you know about Clinton's initiatives and efforts in Tanzania or his efforts in concluding a deal in the Middle East when Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat held the helms of Israel and Palestine respectively.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now now boys, no personal attacks or poison dipped words.<br>The reason why politics quickly go from a civilised talk and a debate and end up into gangsta politics (esp seen in our Parliament House) is because people tend to try to ridicule the other party to gain points for themselves. Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, our country may be a high tech dictatorship, but we here in SG Forums are still in our own community of democracy and freedom.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I feel that US politics is a very high level game, possibly the most complicated issue in the entire world. This is because it is in the entire world's interests that their favoured party wins. I believe that many powerful international figures and entities are influencing US politics, not just the local citizens or powers.  It isnt fair to say that one candidate or party isnt competent or familiar with ground issues, because everyone of them are very qualified, even Bush, although many ppl will disagree. And I daresay all of them have someone supporting them behind. (There are always two powers, one on the throne and one hiding behind the throne aka LKY &amp; LHL/Naden)<br><br>The main issue here is not what the person intends to do but rather what the person can or cannot do.<br><br>Obama, Kerry and Hilary all claim to want to end the war and withdraw US troops in their campaigning, but what I notice is...<br><br>Being a Presidential candidate is not being a President.<br><br>Things will change and their perceptions and values will all change if any of them step up to be the most powerful person on earth.<br><br>The US seems to be after global superiority. The balance of power shifted to the West for the first time in Human history after the Cold War. For millenia, the superpowers of the world were all in Europe or Asia. I think the US is more concerned with falling behind rising powers in the world than with their comparatively small domestic issues like what their citizens are occupied with... EG. abortion rights, same gender marriage, minority rights, union law, healthcare provision, etc etc. All these things are good and important, but pale in comparison to the threats that the only global superpower faces from rising countries like our dragon in the east. Notice that the US have always always been 10x more occupied with international issues than its home affairs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> That's my opinion anyway, if u wanna flame me for my stupidity or weak command of english, thats alright, anything to make ur day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
