I'm not so sure about that. Most of the American newspaper articles pretty much show that Hillary Clinton is in the lead running for the Democrat nomination, while Obama next, and John Edwards even further. That was a recent poll. A recent article in the Times magazine (US edition) show that she brings him around a fair bit, and quite a lot of people cheer for him. Even if she doesn't derive much support because of her ties to Bill Clinton, the latter is certainly helping her plan the campaign, which is a key advantage for her.<br><br></div></blockquote>Contrary to popular beliefs, I regard the biggest threat to Hillary to be Al Gore.

Highest employment rate and highest salaries exists today, not during the Clinton years.<br><br>If you study US economy and politics carefully, clinton did nothing for the economy. The boom under his admin came about thru the spill over effect of the Reagan and Bush years and the IT boom. The Clinton administration was not able to even sustain the boom and we actually saw a shortage of power in California under Democrats. Recession actually set in during the Clinton admin itself.<br><br></div></blockquote>You must be disconnected from reality to suggest the highest employment rate and highest salaries exist today. With a weakening USD that is as low as I can remember and inflation far higher today than during the Clinton administration, you must be in the midst of unravelling some new economic theory that's nobel-worthy to suggest what you've just said.<br><br>The IT boom did catapult Clinton's economic achievements, no doubt about that. To suggest "he did nothing" is as true as this regime being a bonafide democracy as understood by the harshest definitions of a dictionary. As a matter of fact, Clinton presided over the longest economic boom in American history (yes, that 116 months of consecutive economic growth started from the latter part of George H W Bush's term, but it's no coincidence it lasted the entire Clinton term - even after taking into account the growth had slowed near the end of the Clinton Presidency - and continued into the start of George W Bush's term).<br><br>Now, that's what you call having done nothing for the economy? Kim Jung Il must be the greatest living democrat on the planet then.</div>

You can't really blame them for anything, and many of the institutions exercise a fair degree of independence. This isn't Singapore you know, where the PAP exercises maximum control over everything.<br><br>And during the last 2 years of the Clinton Administration, the Republican controlled Congress simply stonewalled just about anything the Clinton Administration put out, and set the course for how the conservative right steamrolled just about anything for the last 6 years.<br><br>If there is something that Clinton can claim to, is that he reaped some of the largest surpluses the US Govt has ever had thanks to prudent spending. Contrast that against Reagan who simply spent tonnes of cash on military and other stuff and lowered taxes. The same went for the current administration.<br><br>The thing I believe I have noticed, is that the US Federal Government has very little control over the economy in general, and they only have some degree of macro control. I am no economist, but I have noticed that the economy of each state is highly dependent on how each state runs it.

Even though New Hampshire's seemingly few seats looked negliglible on the surface, the eventual 271-267 defeat for Gore proved just how decisive New Hampshire could have been had Gore allowed Clinton to campaign for him.<br><br></div>
