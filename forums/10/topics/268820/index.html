            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>July 18, 2007<br><strong>Debating Iraq responsibly</strong><br>THE United States has three options in Iraq: One, stay the course with the current troop levels - the long stay; two, withdraw immediately - the quick goodbye; and three, half-withdraw, half-stay - the long goodbye. Realistically speaking, the second option, the quick goodbye, is not viable, militarily or politically. Militarily, the US cannot withdraw totally from Iraq, leaving the Iraqi government defenceless. Politically, though US public opinion has turned against the war, there is still a broad consensus in favour of retaining some presence in Iraq, if only to train Iraqi troops and to conduct counter-terrorism operations.<br><br>Setting aside the rhetoric of bloviating politicians on both sides of the aisle, the real debate in Washington is between the 'long stay' and the 'long goodbye'. Indeed, it is probably between different versions of the 'long goodbye', for even President George W. Bush has said he would consider pulling back troops 'in a little while'. He wants to wait until September, when his military commander will issue a report, before deciding on his options; the Senate Democratic leadership wants to decide now. The Bill the Senate is debating calls for troops to begin withdrawing within four months, with the pull-out to be completed by April 30 next year. Some troops will remain behind to conduct counter-terrorism operations and to train Iraqi troops. Democratic senators have not explained how they propose to protect this rump force.<br><br>It is difficult to avoid the impression that Democratic leaders have forced this debate for political reasons. They do not expect their Bill to pass, for they do not have the votes. Their aim is to embarrass the President and force Republican legislators to take an unpopular stand in supporting him. There has been no debate as to how the proposed withdrawal is to be conducted, how many troops will remain, and the consequences of a partial pull-out. America needs to conduct such a debate - seriously and responsibly. If the current strategy is not working, both Congress and the President need to explore options - together. Mr Bush's request that Congress wait till September is not unreasonable, for the military commanders should be heard. But he should also talk to Congress in good faith, and not just repeat mantras. Things are not going well in Iraq. In the Bush administration's own assessment, the Iraqi government has not performed satisfactorily. If the 'long goodbye', around which there is a possible consensus, is not to turn into a rout, Washington must get its act together. The US has obligations in Iraq that it cannot abandon. All responsible leaders in Washington must see that.<br><br></blockquote>Fact 1: Notice how they pander the word "responsibility" here and there.<br><br>Fact 2: Notice they mentioned the word "embarrass"<br><br>Fact 3: Notice the stance. Not only is it completely out of touch with the situation in Iraq, and given that the ST acts as a barometer for Govt viewpoints, it just goes to show our much vaunted Government has no idea what it is talking about.<br><br>Some time back, I attended a talk by our US Ambassador. What came out of the talk was that: SEA Govts do not like Democrat Governments as they do not pay too much attention to SEA, and mostly Republican Govts do so. Then we have the idiot for a PM Lee going to Washington recently and totally indulging in some bootlicking.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The American people are saying, "Oh, this is our the Vietnam war all over again, one that has thousands of our boys killed, what the heck are we doing there for? Get them out of there a.s.a.p!"<br><br>In my view, that's short-sighted. It has been predicted that it will take 7-9 years before American troops can contemplate moving out totally and say to themselves that the job is done in Iraq. Pulling out now will only let the civil war degenerate into a more serious crisis, and move the Middle East into more turmoil. The Iraqi government cannot seriously protect themselves with the current army they have. The Sunnis and Shiites are just gonna kill each other even more. Other countries such as Iran will start moving in, and cause even more chaos. Believe it or not, the US presence in Iraq is probably why other countries hadn't interfered in Iraq yet.<br><br>As for the next elections in 2008, my professor who taught me American politics just last week said that no one candidate can seriously hope to win the elections if their stand is for American troops to stay the course in Iraq. And candidates will definitely go out all to promise withdrawal of troops. Whether that is advisable or not, is open for debate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought traditionally gov deal with the state department rather than political entity; With the exception of LHL of course (since he is so use to do what he likes) . In any case, the future relationship between the state departments will be towards the region rather than focus on single nation.  Since they have an ambassador to Asean to direct policy to the region. There will be some "distaining" from both parties whoever take over the oval office. In fact, I think the distaining has already begun. Could be the unresolved issue with Myanmar, and sg continue support for the military gov may have contribute to the postponing of Bush trip to SEA.<br><br>I also notice that there is a common duet between Aus and Sg to sing the "to stay" tune to the democrats. Generally American voters have a short sighted view rather than taking a long and strategic perspective.  However, they seemed to change direction rapidly base on media influence.

All one needs is Sadr to swing the finger and the US is in for a hell it has never before seen. Sure here and there are successes, but there are plenty of cities where this isn't happening. While there are success stories, there are plenty where it isn't working. The US in fact is doing Sadr a favour and suppressing his opponents and him stocking up on Iranian arms for the final push if he doesn't get what he wants. And in case you haven't noticed, the Sadr faction walked out of the Iraqi cabinet for over a mth. He can bring the Govt down if he so chooses. Hell, the issue of ridding the Interior ministry of infiltration hasn't even been solved yet.<br><br>And there's the law and order issue. Elements of the militias has gone rogue, and there's plenty of weapons to go around. The police and army have been infiltrated. There are bombings involving people with uniform. What can the US military do in such a situation?<br><br>As for the Iranians, they have become very suspicious of foreign interference for a long while. Who can blame them? The Shah was supported by the US, until the Islamic revolution. They are not about to let US set up a puppet state in Iraq. No they won't.<br><br>Bottomline, this problem is a political one requiring a political solution. That's the reason why the US is talking to the Iranians.</div>

Get them out of there a.s.a.p!"<br><br>In my view, that's short-sighted. It has been predicted that it will take 7-9 years before American troops can contemplate moving out totally and say to themselves that the job is done in Iraq. Pulling out now will only let the civil war degenerate into a more serious crisis, and move the Middle East into more turmoil. The Iraqi government cannot seriously protect themselves with the current army they have. The Sunnis and Shiites are just gonna kill each other even more. Other countries such as Iran will start moving in, and cause even more chaos. Believe it or not, the US presence in Iraq is probably why other countries hadn't interfered in Iraq yet.<br><br>As for the next elections in 2008, my professor who taught me American politics just last week said that no one candidate can seriously hope to win the elections if their stand is for American troops to stay the course in Iraq. And candidates will definitely go out all to promise withdrawal of troops. Whether that is advisable or not, is open for debate.</div></blockquote>Actually, the Iranians are in Iraq already.....<br><br>And I won't be surprised if the Saudis too...</div>

As it is, the US is being led by the nose by Iran. The Iranians have threatened before that if they want to be wreck havoc on US troops it can and will. The entire Iraq is now being turned into a trap and the US is walking right into one. The US Army will get roasted alive in an urban warfare scenario. Period. Better to withdraw now, and then force all parties to come to terms. Everyone in Iraq barely tolerates the US because they all view the US as a foreign occupier.<br><br>Not to mention, the situation in the Middle East is such that taking sides will eventually lead some ... distant problem in the future... Especially when there are already 2 sides existing for centuries with plenty of mutual hatred. In any case, the Saudis are shitty allies to begin with.<br><br>The solution lies in the Iraqis finding common ground between all 3 major "factions": The Sunnis, the Shia, and the Kurds. A forced Military solution will not work especially when all sides have been brutalised by Saddam and before that now the capacity for revenge is far greater than anything the US can impose upon them.<br><br>If the insistance on staying is because the US created the mess it must fix it, then put it this way, there is nothing the US can do militarily except politically. If this was the initial phases of the invasion, it would have been achievable, but this administration bungled the initial phases of the invasion that it has far crossed the point of no return.<br><br>And now there is the issue of blooded terrorists going from Iraq and taking their trade elsewhere.</div>
