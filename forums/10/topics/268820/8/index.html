I contend that for all the so called greatness he had, he had saddled the US with a huge debt that has strategic problems. Now, US treasury bonds are held by China who could potentially use it as a lever of power if they so choose. Not least, if the US suffers recession and collapse, it is going to owe a  heck of a lot of money. Not least, Reagan did not tip it over. The Soviet economy was already buckling under stress and they wanted to negotiate. There was no need for even a kick. The state of the economy, already practically total war levels, is simply buckling and they wanted to reform. You do understand the meaning of "total war" no?<br><br>P.S.

Every country, empire, that committed itself to such an affair simply bankrupted itself and collapsed, much as the Western Roman Empire has, or any other empire. By no means has Reagan anything to do with the Soviet Economy collapsing, since the Soviets did it to themselves and Reagan had nothing to do with it whatsoever. He only attempted to intimidate the Soviets into telling them that they will not win in the long run militarily. Which is true.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Arapahoe:</div><div class="quote_body">Africa. Here is an observation by a well known writer. I think he outline it fairly and politely.<br><br>ClintonÂ’s trip was the longest and most extensive of any president of the United States to Africa. In an era of imagery, ClintonÂ’s eleven-day and six nation jaunt included a huge entourage of businessmen, politicians, and press members. His call for mutual regard and mutual respect was the turning point for America to open its mind and eyes to Africa. He was at ease and comfortable, clapping to the beat of tribal music. He offered a broad expression of contrition for what he called his countryÂ’s shameful legacy in Africa, including AmericaÂ’s role in the slave trade and its support of repressive anti-Communist dictators during the Cold War. And he even acknowledged the AdministrationÂ’s resistance to appeals for intervention in the Rwanda crisis.<br><br>In summary, let me say this: beyond the legacy of being the President who initiated the move to making Africa visible, Clinton will be seen as one who raised the profile of Africa, opened the eyes of the bureaucracy, exposed Americans to AfricaÂ’s diversity, and changed peopleÂ’s thinking about the continent. His efforts have raised the level of expectations for the next administration vis a vis Africa.<br><br>Still, the news is not all good. [b]Clinton did not fundamentally address real issues. As many a Caribbean and African leader would say, "Trade and investment are critical, but they are not enough in themselves." American foreign policy toward Africa and the Caribbean must be more all-embracing.<br><br>[/b][/b][/quote]<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by Arapahoe:<br><strong><br>First he doesn't have the excess baggage that Hiliary is carrying from Bill that I think is important.

Instead of conceding the Clinton administration actually not having done anything for Africa, you're now saying they just haven't <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">done enough</span></span></strong>, eh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So is Hillary's efforts still hindered by her association with a President who did more than any previous administrations since the second world war for a region you regard to be important as far as the next administration's foreign policy goes? Or are you unable to make up your mind and need further research to ascertain millions of Americans' fixation on a President who left office with the third highest approval ratings in history?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>While his foreign policies were, broadly speaking, extensively all-encompassing, the degrees of his successes were invariably different. It's not rocket science it wouldn't be realistic every foreign policy endeavour he pursued would have resulted in success on the scale of the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Good Friday Agreement</span></span></strong> he had in Northern Ireland, would it? Or is it too complex for you to understand, by the law of averages, policies would invariably yield different measures of success? Or is your world blinded by the excessive monochromes that you can't actually look past success and failure in absolute terms, and perhaps understand that policies that aren't totally successful are hardly abject failures?</strong></div>

If you'd been earning USD20, 000 per annum for 5 years, see a dip in the 6th to USD15, 000 before picking off with an average increase of 5% for the next 4 years, are you necessarily better off economically than someone who has been keeping a static USD20, 000 per annum wage for the same decade, averaging an increment of 2% per annum?<br><br>To qualify your point, In The New Republic (Sept. 2), Matthew Miller wrote, "The boom supply-siders love to tout, the 3.8 per cent annual growth between 1982 and 1989, came mainly because we were emerging from a deep recession that left jobless rates in double digits and much idle capacity."

You hardly need starker evidence to illustrate your stupidity - even taking aside Clinton's economic achievements, George HW Bush did better than Reagan on scores of inflation and unemployment (if anything, unemployment was lowest from the latter half of '91 to the summer of '92 during the 12 years of Reagan-Bush). The economic expansion under the Reagan administration was 32.8% even after accounting for the 2 periods of recession; Clinton's stood at 50%.

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought during the Reagan years, there was a big increase in the budget deficit, probably due to increase military spending in SDI (Star Wars project). Research into SDI resulted in non conclusive outcome.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_%281980%E2%80%931988%29" rel="nofollow">Following the economic recovery that began in 1983, the medium-term fiscal effect of Reaganomics was a soaring budget deficit as spending continually exceeded revenue due to tax cuts and increased defense spending. Military budgets rose while tax revenues, despite having increased as compared to the stagnant late 1970s and early 1980s, failed to make up for the spiraling cost.<br><br>In his first term, Reagan continued to demand increases to the defense budget of up to 10 percent a year. Congressional committees, meanwhile, investigated charges that the $1 trillion of U.S. military spending in Reagan's first term bought surprisingly little, pointing to alleged Pentagon mismanagement. In the 1980s, for example, nearly 50 of the largest U.S. defense contractors came under investigation for overcharges and other criminal malfeasance.<br><br>The 1981 tax cuts, the largest in U.S. history, also eroded the revenue base of the federal government in the short-term. The massive increase in military spending (about $1.6 trillion over five years) far exceeded cuts in social spending, despite wrenching impact of such cuts spending geared toward some of the poorest segments of society. Even so, by the end of 1985, funding for domestic programs had been cut nearly as far as Congress could tolerate.<br><br>In this context, the deficit rose from $60 billion in 1980 to a peak of $220 billion in 1986 (well over 5 % of GDP). Over this period, national debt more than doubled from $749 billion to $1,746 billion.<br><br>While deficit spending has value as an economic stimulus, and assisted the recovery in the post-1982 Reagan years, the dimension of the budget shortfalls of the 1980s left interest rates high and the dollar over-valued, causing investment and exports to suffer and, consequentially, increasing the U.S. trade deficit.<br><br>Since U.S. saving rates were very low (roughly one-third of Japan's,) the deficit was mostly covered by borrowing from abroad, turning the United States within a few years from the world's greatest creditor nation to the world's greatest debtor. Not only was this damaging to America's status, it was also a profound shift in the postwar international financial system, which had relied on the export of U.S. capital.</a><br><br>Few ways to encourage growth, keynesian style, goverment spend more, then through the multiplier effects, the economy grows. Depending on spare capacity, there might be real output growth as opposed to inflationary growth.<br><br></div>
