He has the demeanor in his speech. If you listen carefully when he speaks he always fall back into the history of US civil liberty within context. That helps to get support from both parties member. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Obama may also be the right profile to be the next chief for 2 reasons.

On the basis of your initial post which you claimed Obama to have the edge over Hillary because of 1.the former not having the "excess baggage" of the latter through association with Bill Clinton and 2.the foreign policy that needs attention will be coming out from <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Africa</span></span></strong> and the middle east.<br><br>Let's give you the benefit of the doubt and accept - for whatever reason you've yet to explain - your first point as being a salient one that augurs well for your stance, I still see nothing but a load of self-contradictory polemics that is effectively senseless as far as your second point goes. Why should Obama have an edge over Hillary if Africa should indeed be a central theme of the next administration's foreign policy?<br><br>If you could even go as far as to suggest Africa should play a crucial role in determining the next administration's foreign policy, how then should Hillary - through her association with the most active President in the last 50 years in that region - be handicapped against a Senator who has virtually no experience of advocating/advancing any cause or initiative in Africa?<br><br></div>
