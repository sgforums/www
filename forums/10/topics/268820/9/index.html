Turnaround of the US economy took place right under Reagan's policies of tax cuts.<br>Real economic growth averaged 3.2 percent during the Reagan years versus 2.8 percent during the Ford-Carter years and 2.1 percent during the Bush-Clinton years.<br>Real median family income grew by $4,000 during the Reagan period after experiencing no growth in the pre-Reagan years; it experienced a loss of almost $1,500 in the post-Reagan years.<br><br>Interest rates, inflation, and unemployment fell faster under Reagan than they did immediately before or after his presidency.<br><br>The only economic variable that was worse in the Reagan period than in both the pre- and post-Reagan years was the savings rate, which fell rapidly in the 1980s. The productivity rate was higher in the pre-Reagan years but much lower in the post-Reagan years.<br><br>Now yu really showed you dunno US economics and politics.<br>The very Clinton policies were proven to be destructive as it resulted in a recession that was turned around soon after Bush jr. did his tax cuts. The taxes were the killer of the economy. </strong><br><br>Errr.....sorry to disturb you. Mate,I think you are mistaken that US President do not actually run the US economical policies. As a matter of fact, US economic policies is basically run by the  FED (Federal Reserve) which is the Central Bank. The FED is an independent federal government agency.<br><br>During Reagan years, the FED was headed by Mr Paul Volcker (1979-1987). He was nominated, by President Carter, as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Volcker's Fed is widely credited with ending the United States' stagflation crisis of the 1970s by limiting the growth of the money supply, abandoning the previous policy of targeting interest rates. Inflation, which peaked at 13.5% in 1981, was successfully lowered to 3.2% by 1983 and has remained low ever since. The change in policy contributed to the significant recession the U.S. economy experienced in the early 1980s, which included the highest unemployment levels since the Great Depression. And of course, he is also partly responsible for the 1987 market Crash.<br><br>After Volcker, then came my idol Mr Alan Greenspan  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> . He was norminated in 1987 by President Reagan. Mr Alan Greenspan hold  his ofice from Aug 1987 - Jan 2006.  During his period at the FED, Mr Alan Greenspan never publicly commented what algorithms or inflation and unemployment targets the fed uses in setting the interest rate. Yet, over the years he built credibility in the financial markets that he was willing to fight inflation. The flexibility permitted him to affect the economy by, say, lowering interest rates in order to fight a recession while his credibility made it possible to do this without shocking the bond market.<br><br>These are the 2 person that had direct influence on the US economy then and not so much of the Presidents. ( Reagan, Snr Bush, Clinton, Jnr Bush )<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
