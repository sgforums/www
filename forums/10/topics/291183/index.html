            <div class='col-md body'>Our leaders told us we need talents and have recruited ministers like Dr. V to lead us to a greater future.<br><br>However it seems like our Ministers like Dr. V seems to know only how to use hypocrisy to justify more hard-ball tactics against alternative or opposition politicians contending against the government to protect their own interests like the million-dollar salaries and entrench themselves in power come what may.<br><br>So he has learned well from the predecessors how to avoid accountability and opening up of political process in order to do better jobs as our leaders - by motivating people with creative policies to work together and improve their lives.<br><br>By his intelligence he should well know that the oppositions have their roles to play and are serving the country in their own way like providing alternatives but he seems deliberately to choose to talk like he is doing such a great job in using of past unfair tactics like civil libel suits against the oppositions so as to justify wrongful tactics to stay in power.<br><br>The ministers' own mindset in regarding opposition as obstacles has to change. They should instead regard the oppositions or alternatives and good to have to provide future generations with choices and motivations to survive any crisis.<br><br>This part of our politics is wrong and ministers must lead the change. Singarporeans too have to grow up and mature in their political thinking for the larger good of the whole country.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Is it not the same old propaganda line of maintaining high political standards to keep Singapore politics clean, when the politics employed by the Ruling Party is no different from the petty politics practised by President Mugabe from Zimbabwe ?<br><br>High political standards should be set according to the standards and demands of Singaporeans, and not dictated by the self-serving objectives of a small group of professional politicians - given that they have long expired the trust of the LARGER MAJORITY of Singaporeans.<br><br>Can the existing political standards in Singapore be considered high, and comparable to that of the First World countries which these politicians have the vanity to associate with Singapore, when Singaporeans are purposefully made to shun  -and prevented from any form of political activism ?<br><br>Can the the existing political standards be comparable to any <span style="text-decoration: underline;">progressive</span> political institutions in Asia - let alone that of Europe, UK or the USA ?<br><br>To start with, the present Singapore political climate that is generated by the Ruling Political Party is no better then the political climate created by President Mugabe in Zimbabwe.<br><br>Off election season, Singaporeans are purposefully made to be politically dull, and filled with apathy to actively support the political activities of alternative political parties. Financial support given to the political parties in any substantial form will result in the Government machinery being employed to trace the background of the financial benefactor to the alternative political parties.<br><br>Political activism is purposefully suppressed to prevent Singaporeans from being too politically involve, which become inconvenient for the political incumbents in fixing their own secure positions.<br><br>After 50 years of self-government from Colonial Rule, has Singapore's political standards allow Singaporeans to be involved in the political process that allow Singaporeans to identify oneself to the political realities of Singapore, and making Singaporeans rooted to oneself to this land ?<br><br>Unfortunately, the high standards that this Ruling Party has created is nothing more then self-serving standards that exclude a larger majority of the Singapore population from being involved in the political process - which besides the political climate enforced - also resulted from the constant political gerrymeandering of political boundaries, in multiple sub-divisions of electoral constituencies, and the grouping of GRCs that are beyond geographical logic, nor encourage political commitment to any location.<br><br>The self-serving high political standards that the Ruling Clique has imposed on Singaporeans have prevented other political parties from reaching out to Singaporeans through all kinds of legislative means that empower the Police and Licensing Authority in handicapping the political activities of the alternative political parties.<br><br>High political standards ?<br><br>If one is to review the results of the high political standards that have been achieved since the 2006 Elections, it has resulted in Singaporeans being burdened with a higher cost of living - with round after round of cost increases that begin with fares and fees, and end with more increases in fares and fees.<br><br>While the management of our National Assets remained opaquely questionable with non-transparent practices that even the Elected Presidency no longer wish to involve itself - after the bitter experience encountered by the late President Ong Teng Cheong - Singaporeans are numbed and politically dumb to the constant depletion of our national reserves from the reported disasters of overseas investments made by the brilliant political elites engaged through high standards.<br><br>High political standards seems to be flexibly applied based on a double standard of values used.<br><br>One for the Ruling Clique and another for Singaporeans in general.<br><br>Do we need to pay these Ministers a few million dollars to tell us what kind of political standards we need to live our lives ?<br></span><br><br></div>
