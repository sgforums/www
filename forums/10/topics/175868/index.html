After dealing with them for the past 16 years over so many issues and our dear SM still don't know their tricks? Anyway, LHL made a smart move to ask GCT to negotiate with them.<br><br><a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/1/27/nation/13232303&amp;sec=nation" rel="nofollow">http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/1/27/nation/13232303&amp;sec=nation</a><br><strong>Mahathir happy 22-year wait for bridge is over</strong><br><br>KUALA LUMPUR: Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad is Â“very happyÂ” that finally a decision has been made for Malaysia to go ahead with the scenic bridge on its side of the Johor Strait.<br><br>The former prime minister is also not surprised that Singapore has not agreed to jointly build the bridge to replace the Causeway.<br><br>Â“I have waited 22 years, and we still have not gotten the permission to even raise (the price of raw water sold to Singapore) from 3 sen to 4 sen. So if you want to wait, you can wait until kingdom come,Â” he told reporters yesterday after launching EduSmith, a local magazine for students.<br><br>It was reported yesterday that Malaysia would build the bridge, and work would start after the Chinese New Year.<br><br>The report also said that the bridge would now be referred to as Â“scenicÂ” bridge instead of Â”crooked bridgeÂ”. The bridge was termed Â“crookedÂ” because of its shape. It will be built only on the Malaysian side.<br><br>In jest, Dr Mahathir said: Â“I thought it was Â‘cynicÂ’ bridge. Is that how you spell it?Â”<br><br>From New Straits Times:<br><a href="http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/nst/Thursday/Frontpage/20060126075531/Article/index_html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/nst/Thursday/Frontpage/20060126075531/Article/index_html</a><br><br><img src="http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/nst/Thursday/Frontpage/barge"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DR M is losing his mind and cannot remember what he said.  He want to raise the water to rm$6 - RM$10.  Not 3 to 4 sen.  Our LKY offer 60sen, DR M refuses.  Dr M wanted to wait until we throw in the towel as no water we die, so he never wanted to sign the water contract along, till singapore knee down and beg.<br><br>that moment never arrive.    Johore even transfer the authority to federal KL to decide so that KL can get the income of water sale.  The earlier water agreement was signed between johore and singapore and not federal KL.<br><br>they sell to selangor about 30sen to 40sen.  Even  till today selangor feel its still expensive.   60 sen was a good deal.  If not johore would have more money in its pocket, can even be more than federal KL income.<br><br>whatever increase will translate to whatever johore buys back for treated water.  not to mention singapore PUB invested more than $100 million in ongoing water infrastruture projects in johore to maintain and increase supply.  All these assets will go to johore gov once the contract ends.  But federal KL wants a big piece of the cake.<br><br>Now they want to make southern johore suffer even more by diverting money to the RM$1b bridge.     Kelantan resisted because of the income from oil revenues.  federal KL took quite a lot and left a few bucks for kelantan.  Thats why kelantan is always resisting KL.   toll money collected going to huge and every officials wants a bit of the actions.</div>

They are off their mind<br><br>It will just become a joke of the world<br><br>They say the bridge is to clear pollution, ya ya, they have no proper pollution control. They wanted it to divert traffic away, but dun think possible as of emergence of container ships like OOCL Shenzhen or MSC Pamela that are around 9,000 TEU in capacity<br><br>Proton case is a simple case of Dr M's imcapability</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the whole point of building the bridge is to take business away from Singapore. Currently, ships must sail around Singapore to get from the Strait of Malacca to the South China Sea but with the causeway dismantled, ships can sail directly from Tanjung Pelapas to Pasir Gudang without going around Singapore. Therefore, businessmen would choose Malaysia over Singapore due to lower prices. I think this is Malaysia's attempt to drive Singapore into a corner since they failed to get Thailand to build the Kra Canal across the Isthmus of Kra.</div>
