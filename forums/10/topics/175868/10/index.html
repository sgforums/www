SO that it can flow into our Straits?  Are they trying to flush their problems to our side?.  They had set aside about 20mil RM to clear up their river problems (whole country) i believe.<br><br>They are bringing media attention because they have already started work on the bridge.  They have already PAID for it paid the contractors signed the dealand they cannot pull out without losses....and since we are still Discussing whether to build, they dont want to look like fools.<br><br>How are they going to tranfer traffic from our causeway to their new bridge without disrupting traffic flow?  Impossible.  The bridge may eventually be built but how we get connected.....we have to ask them.<br><br>The Thailand, Bangkok LRT starts to look so familiar i fear.</div>
