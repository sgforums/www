I mean they could have just make PSA as the empty container storage yard<br><br>Even so, the shift of the many feeder svs I believe is to break the double calling at both PSA and PTP.. Esp feeder ships, it is very inefficient if there are double calling at both PSA and PTP... Time becomes a constrain as these ships has to complete 7 day rotation like PSA - PTP - Songkhla (Thailand) - Sihanoukville (Cambodia) - PSA... If PTP is skipped, containers can be concentrated at PSA and the ship need not waste time to call PTP for another batch of containers<br><br>It is possible as Maersk do have a ship called SIMA EXPRESS that makes thrice weekly call haul bet PTP and PSA</div>
