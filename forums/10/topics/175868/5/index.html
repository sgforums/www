            <div class='col-md body'>littlespeck has thisinfo to offer:<br><br>Crooked bridge<br>Strategic importance<br>For Malaysia, includes stopping Singapore tanks from crossing in unlikely event of war. By Seah Chiang Nee<br>Feb 4, 2006<br><br>It is becoming clear that the bridge project is as important to Johor as its water is to Singapore.<br><br>Everyone knows that the proposed east-west shipping route south of the Malayan mainland will promote the use of JohorÂ’s Port of Tanjung Pelepas at the expense of PSA (Port of Singapore Authority).<br><br>But apparently, thatÂ’s not the only reason. John Burton, Financial Times correspondent, said that it is Â“part of a grander plan to turn the southern state of Johor into a Â‘second SingaporeÂ’ that would serve as a regional transport hub.Â”<br><br>He added: Â“Its revival now appears linked to Malaysia's forthcoming five-year economic plan, which is expected to finance several big infrastructure projects that will benefit Johor, including a high-speed rail link with Kuala Lumpur.<br><br>Besides spending on ports, roads and railways to develop Johor as a logistics hub to rival Singapore, the plan is expected to include tourist projects to attract visitors who are likely to flock to Singapore once it opens two casino resorts in 2009.Â”<br><br>Burton said analysts believe the half-bridge may be a negotiating ploy to push Singapore on a range of bilateral issues whose resolution has been stalled for years.<br><br>Not only is the bridge a crucial deciding factor of JohorÂ’s future, other analysts believe thereÂ’s a defence reason for Malaysia, too.<br><br>Since former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew declaring years ago that in an event of MalaysiaÂ’s unilateral cut-off of crucial water supplies to Singapore, Singaporean tanks would move in to defend the RepublicÂ’s survival.<br><br>He said If that happened, he would not wait for United Nations to intervene because by then it would be too late.<br><br>Unlike the Causeway, the new replacing link will have a drawbridge that can be raised at intervals to allow ships to pass under.<br><br>So even a crooked half-bridge would have a defence value for Malaysia. A raised drawbridge could stop the Singaporean tanks from crossing into Johor in the unlikely event of war.<br><br>In the latest development, both countries have agreed to negotiate on a full bridge - on the basis of a balance of benefits, so there's a glimmer of hope, yet.<br></div>
