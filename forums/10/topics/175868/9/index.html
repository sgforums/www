            <div class='col-md body'>What's wrong with singapore Government ? If Malaysia wants to build his half of the bridge and demolish the half of causeway just let them do it la.<br>Any it is their half of the bridge. As long as they rebuilt a connection to it whether it is a crooked or straight it is fine.<br>I think if singapore Government takes Malaysia to world court I don't think it would stop Malaysia from replacing his half of the causeway with a bridge. I think the argument would be as long as Malaysia rebuilt the connection and does not distrupt the traffic flow everything is ok. The same goes when Malaysia tried to stop Singapore from performing reclaimation of land near its border. The world court also said that Singapore can carry on work under some enviromental guidelines.<br><br>If Singapore worries that the bridge can affect Singapore ports. I don't think it will. One thing for sure I don't think big tankers or containers carrier can go through a half bridge. Further more the Second link also doesnt provide enough room for that la. Probably only some small boats can pass.<br><br>I think the only bad thing is BAD fengsui. A disrupt flow of chi from the North due to the crooked bridge.<br><br>I think Singapore Government should let Malaysia do what they like with his half of the causeway. If Singapore Government feel that it is too costly to built his half and no gain from doing so. $200 million is a big sum. I would suggest Singapore goverment to pump this money in to the charity to help the poor and needy.<br><br>Let Malaysia built the bridge and get this issue off the shelf.One less issue to argue about.<br><br></div>
