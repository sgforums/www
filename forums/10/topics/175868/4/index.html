The "opening" of the Strait of Johor will undoubtly increase competition for Singapore's ports now that Tanjung Pelapas and Pasir Gudang are directly linked by sea. I doubt Klang will be a major threat as it is too far up North and would not be in a position as good as Singapore for ships heading to Australia.

Currently, ships must sail around Singapore to get from the Strait of Malacca to the South China Sea but with the causeway dismantled, ships can sail directly from Tanjung Pelapas to Pasir Gudang without going around Singapore. Therefore, businessmen would choose Malaysia over Singapore due to lower prices.

            <div class='col-md body'>Been over to our Northern neighbours a couple of days back and I realise this whole 'cynic bridge' is going to be much of a hassle and the joke of all times!<br><br>Why do I say that?<br><br>1) Malaysian Constructing Companies are doing such a poor job in maintaining their own networks of roads an buildings; how more can they screw up this new construction?? Just look at the roads (heading to SG) that lead to their customs - blocked here and there, improper barricades and direction flow. Some of the pillingsmay cause hazzards to drivers!<br><br>2) How the hell are they going to divert traffic to start work on the new bridge? Those big lorries, busses that enter leave JB/SG are going to face huge problems negotiating the diversions.<br><br>3) I don't think they need a new bridge; they should start slowly and perhaps begin by having better and efficient Customs Officers; the ones they have are simply inefficient, slow and sometimes rude too!<br><br>4) I believe that the money spent on the bridge should be put to better use on other things such as developing those run-down areas all around JB; not to mentioned the whole country itself.<br><br>5) My bet is they will take a mightttty long time to built that bridge. HAha<br><br>But in agreeing to built the new bridge, I bet our government has other plans as well; the people there must have carefully weigh the pros &amp; cons and must have come to the decision with proper and carefull thinking. They must have seen either something beneficial to SG or something detrimental to MY in times to come.
