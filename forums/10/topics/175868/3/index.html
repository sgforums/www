The "opening" of the Strait of Johor will undoubtly increase competition for Singapore's ports now that Tanjung Pelapas and Pasir Gudang are directly linked by sea. I doubt Klang will be a major threat as it is too far up North and would not be in a position as good as Singapore for ships heading to Australia. I think our only salvation now probably lies in the biomedical sciences as our ports will probably lose out to Tanjung Pelapas and Pasir Gudang because of prices unless all our port employees are willing to take a 60% pay cut.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone ever been to the northern shore of Pulau Ubin and see how close the Johor shore is ? And why are we so actively reclaiming land in our northern shore ?<br><br>The intention is to narrow the Johor straits so that larger ships will not be able to sail through according to International shipping rule.<br><br>And its really a relief that the Malaysian Govt decides to go ahead and built the half bridge. It will only serve to show the other nations and private companies what a joke the Malaysian govt are.<br><br>If the Msian govt can go back on their words , based on the 2 water contracts signed with Spore many decades back,  and changing their minds many many times during the biliteral talks, how will the private foreign companies think ?  If a govt can eat their own words though a contract had been signed with another govt, whats a PTE Company to the Msian govt?<br>Any contracts the pte companies signed with the Msia govt can be void too.<br><br>And the decision to build the half bridge, is showing other govts of foreign nations how irrational is the Msian Govt.<br><br>Come to think of it. Msia have problems with all its neighbour. The Sipadan islands in Sabah area, collision with Indo warships. Border rows with Thailand etc.<br><br>Boy. i'm really glad that they had once again showed the world and the foreign investors ( pte companies ) how irrational is the Msian Govt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually the new bridge with the curves looks okay to me.  All i can say is, let them build their side of bridge and of course they have to charge toll money both ways.  They have every right to do what they believe in.<br><br>If the charges are the same as tuas, then, i guess, 50% of singaporeans and malaysians will use the tuas bridge if they stay near the west.  And a new JB town will surface in the west.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All the best to the JB govt. With cheap budget air tickets to bangkok and a little bit more effort from the Batam govt, I guess we will be more willing to pay abit more to visit Thailand and get away from the rubbish and nonsense that the Msia govt had been throwing at us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have a conspiracy theory .... I believe the reason why they want to build a new bridge is not just to allow commercial ships to pass thru, that just an excuse and a smoke screen.<br><br>A good analogy/riddle will be something like this.<br><br>Say there is a shallow but wide river running between your banana plantation and the forest and everynight a troupe of greedy monkeys from across will wade over and steal your precious bananas. So one day you become fed up and introduced a few buayas and piranas species into the longkang.<br><br>So in the end can the monkeys still wade over ? ... Yes they still can but it will be difficult. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
