This when comparing our soaring oil prices, property costs, utilities and basic costs?<br><br>What price is this 10% worth to us in term of the exponential rise in basic costs compared to the low costs of living of our neighbours?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tiggersgd:</div><div class="quote_body">4. we 'try' not to call others names first.</div></blockquote>It is regrettable that our neighbours resort to name calling during elections or over minor diplomatic disputes.

Is re-drawing electorial boundaries at the last min a fair deal to opposition chances? Is the use of GRCs to 'bring more neophytes' who ride on the coat tails of better known politicians considered FAIR? And you think Malaysia was bad...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tiggersgd:</div><div class="quote_body">6. cleaner roads, cleaner air quality.</div></blockquote>Cleaner roads? Cleaner air quality?<br><br>Malaysian roads vs SG roads? Apple to orange comparison? Is that a fair assessment at all? Have you seen the massive LAND MASS that is Malaysia against the TINY DOT that is SG?<br><br>And i assume you're refering to vehicle exhausts with regards to cleaner air quality? Have you seen the TON of Malaysian BIKES releasing their carcenogic gases onto SG roads? Why the double standards in ensuring SG drivers comply with Viacom standards when they fail to enforce those of our neighbours? Again you think the fair play of Malaysian authorities is bad?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tiggersgd:</div><div class="quote_body">7. no police to stop and 'demand' that you pay a fine which said they have your vehicle captured in their supposedly cameras as proof? (please refer to point 5).</div></blockquote>Bribery is always there; Malaysian police is rifle with them. But the main culprit is an impossibly large workforce and relatively low pay. There have been cases of bribery concerning our local boys in blue as well, even with a decent pay.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tiggersgd:</div><div class="quote_body">8. better education standards.</div></blockquote>Have you encountered the Malaysian Chinese? Despite the Malaysian education system, many of them are way better performers than us, this despite our 'world-class education' system. And certainly, SG meritocracy has benefitted us, allowing all races a fair shot at the cake; instead of Malaysian politics insisting on bumiputra laws that include reserving a fixed number of university seats to safeguard the interests of the Malay majority.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tiggersgd:</div><div class="quote_body">1. at least salman supported a cleaner govt.<br></div></blockquote>No comment here...you can draw your own conclusion after a while in SC.<br><br></div>
