Maybe in the past, you think that his writing is insightful, but for me, a lot of it is rubbish, because he likes to use bombastic english to attack those that challenge his views, and he also insulted me and a few others as well.  So yes, i take that personally and i will not stand being put down that way. Most of the time, i am nice and civil when discussing issues, at the most, just sarcastic, but so what? everyone is sarcastic too.<br><br>if you don't know much about british politics, maybe you wouldn't know what we are talking about, just give us the benefit of the doubt ok?

I supported his arguments because it makes sense. You didn't make any good rebuttals. I guess the whole lot of people here who support Atobe's view are all ass lickers then. I see alot of supporters for Atobe, only afew for you. If you want more people to lick your ass, make better rebuttals, else you have to be contend with oxymoron, stupidinsipidstupidus and inbred deer licking your puritis. Everybody must support your views no matter how ludicrous it sounds? Sounds alot like the Pigs Action Party to me, force feeding people to their way of thinking. That oxymoron who called me names is not a well respected person in this forum, he's a lot like you. When he fails to convert you to his point of view, he makes personal attacks on you. You will notice that his postings normally elicit a deluge of responses. Most of his views are not his own, he just plagiarises others. I have lots of views, but I spare myself the drugery of explaining issues to narrow minded people like you. It's difficult to teach a simpleton basic logic.<br><br>In another thread, you say that you are no expert in economics, then you correct other non experts about economic terms. Then you claim that you are no expert on economics, but you have basic knowledge of economics then you begin correcting Atobe on that premise.
