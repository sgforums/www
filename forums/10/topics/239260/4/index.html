briliantly insulted the Philippines; turned a warm relationship with Suharto's Indonesia into present day tension by harboring ill gotten gains of the Rich and Wealthy Indonesian and refusing an extradition treaty; messed up our relations with Thailand through sheer ambitios economic imperialism; even our warm relationship with Myanmar has become an embarrassing liability after the Military Junta refused to listen to further advise from a fellow hardline Government.<br><br>Even Modern China has turned skeptical to the supposed altruistic help extended by the Singapore Government, and looked at <a href="http://singaporeelection.blogspot.com/2006/03/temasek-brings-bad-name-to-singapore.html" rel="nofollow">Temasek's attempt - to buy a stake in the Bank of China - as nothing more then Economic Imperialism</a>.<br><br>Internally, how certain are you that this Singapore Government aka the Ruling Party will continue to back your boastful claims that Singaporeans are fortunate that we do not have to be like the Filipinas working as maid overseas, or our menfolk having to work overseas to make a living to support our families at home ?<br><br>At present, the Government has succumbed to forces of globalisation without any defensive effort to protect Singaporeans, but have instead opened the floodgates to allow more foreigners into Singapore claiming that they will create more jobs for Singaporeans.<br><br>In the present open policy towards foreign talents, for every foreign expatriate that is employed, this person employed in this position will almost automatically bring other cronies along into Singapore.<br><br>Many Singaporeans - who have been displaced in the last economic downturn in 2002 - and who are in their 40s and 50s - remain unemployed; and despite their most ardent effort many in these age groups are jobless not by choice but by the present changed circumstances.<br><br>Most of these white-collared Singaporeans - and some blue collared ones too - have used their retrenchment benefits with new start-ups in small enterprises, with most of them entering the Food and Beverage field.<br><br>After 45 over years of continuous monopolistic rule, Singaporeans are continuously milked off their savings through a slew of financial charges executed by different Government Agencies and Government Linked Companies.<br><br>Wealth flow from the Citizen's bank account to the State Treasury by way of taxes that are artificially created to take Private Wealth at every step and every turn of economic consumption and economic activity.<br><br>The wealth of the nation has been transferred from the individual Citizens into the State Treasury.<br><br>While the State Treasury continue to grow, the Singapore Citizens savings continue to shrink, to the extent that the Singapore Citizen cannot even look after themselves in their old age.<br><br>Despite the wealth that the State has extracted from Singaporeans, what has the State planned for Singaporean that will not further extract further sums of remaining monies from the Private Citizens ?<br><br>Under the guise of no welfare - but called Workfare - the Citizens have to pay in order to get some back from Workfare.<br><br>Medical and Health Care require the Citizens to contribute to Medisave and Medishield. Unfortunately, the money transferred into these funds will benefit the Authorities through investments that generate revenue; while the Citizens who are Account Holders have limited use from these Funds that are not allowed to pay for the total medical bill.<br><br>With all the wealth robbed from the Citizens, the Government will not contribute to help the Aged, but will demand that the Citizens continue to look after their own Aged.<br><br>Education remains the Citizens' responsibility, when Polytechnic Diploma are not accepted by our own local Universities, while the same Diploma will gain entries in foreign universities that will even grant exemptions and shorten term.<br><br>Is there any Government Policies - past and present - that deserve praise, when all the policies have removed the POLITICAL RIGHTS of Singaporeans ?<br><br>If you are brave enough to plagiarise this piece from the SDP - that was already published since OCTOBER 2006, why are you not brave enough to see the reality of Singapore as it is ?<br><br><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Hear Hear!</div>
