Even I cannot be bothered about Ho Ching - she would never step down because of the family and there is nothing Singaporeans can do about it.<br><br>Lee Hsien Yang was clever - No doubt he knew that overpaying 10 BILLION dollars for optus was a very bad thing (yes the aussies are laughing at it all the way to the bank) and he offered to step down before people found out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>she should step down..<br><br>not for the reasons you mention about her being there adversely affecting the Lee Dynasty (we'll come to that later) but for the simple fact that she's shown to be hopelessly and ineptly out of her league..<br><br>she's supposed to be an electrical engineer by training and maybe she's "the most powerful woman in Singapore" by the perverse nature of business as seen by Dilbert.. where the more spectacular your failure, the more prestige you earn.. Shin Corp is just the latest of the string.. others like Micropolis come to mind...<br><br>she should step down... because she's messing with the Nation's money... she should step down because her inept handling of corporations cost us, the taxpayer, a lot of money.. she should step down.. because any other CEO who has screwed up this much, would have been thrown out by the board long ago..<br><br>as for adversely affecting the Lee Dynasty, even Lau Goh once admitted that there is a conflict of interest but was probably told to zip it and added that "they will eventually work for the common good"...<br><br>the conduct of the Lee Dynasty has smeared themselves worse than anything.. and with her being where she is.. they can't tarnish themselves any other further short of looting everything on a grand scale...<br><br>so, yes.. she should step down.. because anywhere else, she would have her tenure as CEO terminated with extreme prejudice..<br><br>p.s. btw, sacrificing one member who married into the Lee Family for the "good" of rest of the Lees is a masterstroke of a suggestion by you... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Ho Ching is a liability to the PAP and the government. No individual is greater than the organization and the nation.<br><br>Thaksin was a good friend and the friendship was useful to us when he was in power. But the moment the Thai king wants him out, he becomes a liability to us and I have said many times before, the government should have sold him to the dogs the moment the coup happened. Similarly, Ho Ching is becoming a liability. In the interest of the party and the government, LHL should get rid of her.</div>
