She will never be able to do a good job, no matter how good she may be. If she did something well, people will say it's her husband who blows her trumpet. If she does badly, people will say her husband hides her faults.<br><br>In contrast, Lee Hsien Yang is smart to step down whilst the going is good. He leaves at a time when Singtel has made lots of profits and he has plenty of bonus in his bank account. Ho Ching has left it too late but rather late than never.<br><br>However the Shin Corp issue will pan out, Temasek is likely to lose money and even her husband has said that if Temasek loses money over Shin Corp, they will have to be held to account. Having her husband, being Minister of Finance, as effectively the regulator of Temasek is a bad idea from the start. Whatever fault is attributed to Temasek eventually, LHL cannot escape responsibility as the regulator. The question will be raised as to why the Minister for Finance had been sleeping on the watch. He can hardly distance himself from the CEO, as he could if someone else held that position. The fact that his wife is head of Temasek will no doubt cast suspicion on his independence whilst carrying out his duties, even if he is beyond reproach.<br><br>Justice has to be done and seen to be done. In view of Ho Ching's relationship to LHL, any mistake she makes will have an adverse impact on her husband, the ruling party and the entire government. In other words, she is becoming a liability for the government. Get rid of her before it is too late. </div></blockquote>Hey OM, this is one side of you I have never seen!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

The sensitive parts of the business can be delinked from the investment aspects and let the professionals do what they are best at doing. After all, Ministry of Finance has a role in monitoring what the CEO does. Both Temasek and GIC can be run by FT and in my opinion, that is probably a good thing.<br><br>All the top investment bankers and fund managers in the world are in top financial institutions in the UK and US. Statistically, it is much easier to find a FT with the sterling track record we want compared to the limited talent pool in Singapore. Of course we will have to pay them millions to do the job, but as long as they deliver the billions, that's fine. If they do not perform, just sack and replace ruthlessless. It is harder to replace a wife compared to a FT CEO.</div>
