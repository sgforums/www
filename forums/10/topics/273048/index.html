We could have just simply asked: "How patriotic are Singaporeans?" Â— as if there was some fixed formula to calibrate this.<br>.<br>But looking at all the families who turn up in red-and-white face paint to support the footballing Lions, and every 18-year-old male who <span style="color: red;">surrenders?</span> part of his life to the military, how do you measure any individual's love for and <span style="color: red;">willingness[color] to stand up for his (or her) country when it truly counts?<br>.<br>[color=red]What defines the "country"? Who deserves your allegiance? The state, the community, the physical land, your family?</span><br>.<br><span style="color: red;">And who's to say</span> if a "stayer" who votes responsibly, raises his children here, works within "the system" and donates to the needy knows any more about patriotism than the growing number of <span style="color: red;">globe-trotting citizens, who seek opportunities abroad but continue to criticise and defend Singapore beyond her shores?</span><br>.<br>So, instead of doing the predictable and holding a measuring rod up to Singaporeans, we asked them to tell us: <span style="color: red;">What is important to you about being a citizen? What does this tiny city-state mean to you?</span><br>.<br>Who, in short, is the new "patriot" Â— and <span style="color: red;">does that image in the mirror comfort or disturb us?</span><br>.<br>TO LOVE Â…<br>.<br>IF Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong's worry once was that <span style="color: red;">Singapore would become more like a hotel than a home to its people,</span> here's some heartening news.<br>.<br>Of the resident citizens polled in TODAY's National Day Survey, 76 per cent said they were proud or very proud of being Singaporean - 72 per cent of Singaporeans overseas shared this sentiment.<br>.<br>It was perhaps not a surprise that, when asked to rank the reasons for this bond (they were asked to pick three out of 11 statements), the top pick for both groups was <span style="color: red;">"a place where my friends and family are". </span><br>.<br>Both also agreed Singapore was where their roots were, however far a-field they ventured Â– and to a lesser extent, that they'd like to raise and educate their children here.<br>.<br>But is Singapore "a place to live out one's dreams"? <span style="color: red;">Maybe notÂ…</span><br>.<br>This statement scored the lowest overall ranking among overseas respondents, and not much higher among Singaporeans at home.<br>.<br>Tellingly, overseas citizens felt a more poignant connection to <span style="color: red;">the food and culture of home, than to Singapore as a place that they wanted to live out the rest of their lives</span> Â– something residents, on the other hand, felt strongly about.<br>.<br>But even if the Singapore Dream isn't shared equally by all, at least, it was clear that few endorsed cynical statements such as <span style="color: red;">"I'm here because I've no choice"</span> or <span style="color: red;">"this is a fallback if I fail it make it elsewhere".</span><br>.<br>SUPPORT Â…<br>.<br>Asked what being a supportive citizen meant, there were <span style="color: red;">starkly different answers from the overseas and resident groups.</span><br>.<br>Generally speaking, resident citizens thought in tangible terms Â– that you had to be physically here, contributing to the economy and society. That you helped those around you. <span style="color: red;">That you hung out the flag every August, and watched the parade</span> Â– if not in person - then at least "live" on television.<br>.<br>Politically, <span style="color: red;">being supportive implied compliance.</span> Back the Government so that it could run the country more effectively. <span style="color: red;">Stay out of trouble, pay your taxes, study hard.</span><br>.<br>For the Singaporean living abroad, on the other hand, physical presence was Â– for obvious reasons Â– <span style="color: red;">the last thing on their minds. </span><br>.<br>Rather, being a supportive citizen to them was more likely to mean <span style="color: red;">speaking out critically and constructively</span> Â– in <strong>newspaper forums, in cyberspace</strong>, through <span style="color: red;">official channels</span> Â– if, and when, policies proved inadequate. Or even <span style="color: red;">trying to drive change if they felt something was wrong.</span><br>.<br>Despite their disagreements with the state on <span style="color: red;">some issues</span>, the Singaporean expatriate felt that it was also important to speak up in defence of Singapore when outsiders criticised her.<br>.<br>Which leads us to the third aspect of patriotismÂ…<br>.<br>AND DEFEND<br>.<br><span style="color: red;">Are Singaporeans prepared to die for the love of their country? </span><br>.<br>If the survey results <strong>are to be believed</strong>, and they were <span style="color: red;">done professionally by Media Research Consultants</span>, just over half of the Singaporeans polled Â– here and abroad - are willing to lay down their life for their nation.<br>.<br>Should we be disturbed that <span style="color: red;">23 per cent of overseas citizens and 13.5 per cent of locals</span> do not attach any importance, or willingness, to make the ultimate sacrifice for the nation Â– <span style="color: red;">the rest aren't sure either way</span>.<br>.<br><span style="color: red;">Does this mean Singaporeans will refuse to take up arms, or worse, turn tail and run, if a threat loomed?</span><br>.<br>No, some would argue, pointing to this study's limitations.<br>.<br><span style="color: red;">Most Singaporeans from the post-65 generation</span> don't feel this urgency because they have never faced the threat of actual hostilities. The real test, will not come in the shape of a survey question, and may well evoke a completely different response when the stark prospect of losing everything is thrust in one's face.<br>.<br>But others worry because they see a young country with a population, which has largely <span style="color: red;">not had its character, nor its patriotism, tested</span> in the fires of war, disaster or real hardship.<br>.<br>They see a people, <span style="color: red;">cultured and conditioned</span> to entrust important decisions to wiser authorities, as they speed down the road of globalisation passing pastures green with opportunities.<br>.<br>Against this broad canvas, one wonders about the character, and characteristics, of the new Singapore "patriot". And if this patriot's ties to country centre solely on factors such as food, family and jobs, or even pure happenstance of birth Â– <span style="color: red;">can this be enough</span>?<br>.<br>The TODAY team explores these questions, in this special National Day issue.<br>Patriot: One who loves, supports and defends one's country (American Heritage Dictionary)<br></div>
