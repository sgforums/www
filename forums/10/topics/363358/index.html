              <p>Tuesday, 09 June 2009</p>
              <p><em>Kelvin Teo<strong><br></strong>Kent Ridge Common</em><br><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/news3/uchee.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="230" align="left"><em>Kent Ridge Common conducted an online interview with Dr Chee Soon Juan. </em><em>The
                  SDP secretary-generall talked about everything from political reform to
                  being an activist. We reproduce the interview here.  </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em><strong>Foreword</strong>:
                  Dr Chee Soon Juan (CSJ) obtained his Ph.D. from the University of
                  Georgia and is a neuropsychologist by training. He joined the Singapore
                  Democratic Party (SDP) in 1992, and subsequently became its
                  secretary-general. He was formerly an Honorary Research Associate at
                  the Monash Asia Institute (1997) and University of Chicago (2001), and
                  was a Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellow at the Washington-based National
                  Endowment for Democracy (2004). He received the Defender of Democracy
                  Award (2003) given by the Parliamentarians for Global Action. He is the
                  the Chairman of the Alliance for Reform &amp; Democracy in Asia (ARDA).</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p><em><br><strong>What measures would the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) propose that would help Singapore tide through the current recession?</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>  </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>During the Budget 2009 debate we proposed the following which, by the way, was echoed by some PAP MPs:</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Suspend
                  the GST for at least two years. This will help especially the poor and
                  lower-income groups, not to mention businesses that need customers and
                  patrons to survive. <br><br>Reduce ERP rates as well as bus and MRT
                  fares. Such a step would help to keep expenses down for the average
                  individual and motorist.<br><br>Introduce an unemployment entitlement
                  programme. It will ensure that retrenched workers receive temporary
                  relief from a sudden loss of income.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Give
                  out spending vouchers. Again this will assist the lower-income
                  households in their daily struggle.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>The measure will keep the economy
                  alive.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>These proposals are explained in greater depth in <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/1845-budget-spending-not-transparent-sdp-proposes-alternative-5-point-plan-">Budget spending not transparent, SDP proposes alternative 5-point plan</a>.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em><strong>Which current economic policy is in most urgent need for reform? And what are the proposed reforms?</strong></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>In
                  the immediate term it is crucial that we stop the mindless and
                  indiscriminate influx of foreign workers. The foreigners are being
                  exploited for their cheap labour to artificially suppress wages of
                  Singaporeans. The foreign talent policy needs an overhaul: Only
                  foreigners with the requisite skills unavailable from the local
                  population should be allowed to join the Singaporean workforce.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Apart
                  from economic consequences, the mass of foreigners forced upon the
                  locals and competing with them for survival will have grave social
                  repercussions which we have yet to examine. Is this an accident waiting
                  to happen?</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>In the longer term, we
                  must wean the economy off our dependence on MNCs. We have become
                  addicted to foreign direct investments so much so that we have not
                  allowed home-grown enterprises to flourish. Coupled with GLCs, our
                  domestic private sector and SMEs are squeezed out of the corporate
                  scene.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>During a major economic crisis like the present one, we find our
                  economy much harder hit than anyone else.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>In
                  addition, the crush of MNCs and GLCs ensure a dearth of Singaporean
                  entrepreneurs. Apart from economic consequences, the lack of the
                  entrepreneurial spirit has a spill over effect into the social and
                  political circles, making our society distinctly lackadaisical.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Without
                  the verve and dynamism, the quality of life here suffers. This is why
                  Singaporeans continue to be one of the most stressed and unhappiest
                  people in the region and our youths constantly express a desire to
                  leave the country.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em><strong>Would
                  the losses at Temasek Holdings and Singapore Government Investment
                  Corporation (SGIC) lead to a decline in votes for the PAP? Why?</strong></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>We
                  are not looking for just a decline of votes for the PAP. The opposition
                  needs to make significant inroads into Parliament to effect policy
                  change. This is only possible if the election system is fair and the
                  media is free.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>No matter how badly
                  Temasek or the GIC perform, or for that matter how disastrous PAP
                  policies are, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>as long as the Elections Department and the media operate
                  at the behest of the ruling party, no one can change policy and the
                  Government will not be held accountable. </strong></span></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><br></strong></em></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>At
                  the moment, our political culture is one driven by fear and ignorance.</strong></em></span><em> Without addressing these twin scourges, the PAP will always be
                  "victorious" at the polls. This is why the Singapore Democrats
                  emphasize so much on reforming the political system.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em><strong>You
                  wrote a book "Dare to change" way back in 1994 with a set of
                  recommended changes for Singapore's future. How many of your
                  recommendations have been considered currently or implemented already
                  by the government and what are they?</strong></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>In
                  the area of education, I wrote that the process of streaming our
                  children at the primary school level was inane. This is because neural
                  processes are still developing at such young ages and attempts to grade
                  and categorise our students is woefully premature. While I'm glad the
                  PAP has acknowledged the problem of streaming, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the changes it has made
                  to the education system in this area are cosmetic and do not address
                  the real problem. </strong></span></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>The Government
                  is also belatedly beginning to see the problems<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> I raised about our
                  over-reliance on MNCs and GLCs, and the suppression of local SMEs.</strong></span> But
                  there will not be any serious attempt to change the economic approach
                  because to do so would entail a concomittant liberalisation of the
                  political system, something that the PAP will not do voluntarily.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>I had also written in <em>Dare To Change</em> that because of the stifling political climate Singaporeans were
                  leaving the country in alarming numbers. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Today, Mr Lee Kuan Yew admits
                  that the brain drain is a serious problem. </strong></span><br><br>The Government is
                  now trying to encourage Singaporeans to be creative in the hope of
                  fixing the creativity problem here. Apparently there is a course at NUS
                  that teaches students how to think. <br><br>But Singaporeans know how
                  to think. We are no different from our American or European or Japanese
                  counterparts. What we need is political space to express those
                  thoughts. This is the nub of the problem. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>As long as the PAP keeps its
                  choke-hold on the people, this society will be soulless and the exodus
                  will continue. </strong></span></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em><strong>Do you
                  think a typical heartlander will be able to grasp the idea of democracy
                  and its benefits? Assume you come across a typical heartlander during
                  your walkabout, how would you convince him into voting for democracy so
                  to speak?</strong></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>The average
                  Singaporean understood the meaning of freedom and democracy in the
                  1950s. That's why they rose up against the British and kicked them out.
                  They are now our parents and grandparents. If they could appreciate the
                  importance of freedom of speech and assembly then, why can't we now
                  especially when the population is now much better schooled? <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>The
                  difference is that, unlike in the 1950s, the PAP Government has locked
                  up the media and disallowed Singaporeans to think and express
                  themselves. </strong></span>We interpret that as Singaporeans not understanding nor
                  wanting democracy. If Singaporeans are really that uninterested in
                  their rights, why is the Government nervously putting in place more
                  laws that further ban people from gathering in public and speaking out?</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>How do I convince a voter into
                  voting for democracy? I don't. Democracy is something you practice and
                  experience, not vote for. If you have to vote for democracy, chances
                  are that you are doomed to labour under an autocratic state in the
                  first place.<br><br>I have, however, tried to speak to voters about
                  policies that are hurting them. The result is that I have been
                  convicted of six charges of speaking in public and face another six
                  more. This will never happen in a democracy. Without the ability to be
                  able to freely communicate with the people, we cannot break the cycle
                  of fear and ignorance that the PAP has so successfully instilled in
                  society.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><br></strong></em></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>It is not that Singaporeans don't understand democracy, it is that they are not allowed to practise it.</strong></em></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em><strong>It
                  is rare for politicians in Singapore to take on the role of an
                  activist, and I think SDP is the only party whose members have such
                  dual roles. How did you all manage to reconcile the role of an activist
                  with that of a politician?</strong></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>In
                  a democracy, the roles of a politician and an activist can be neatly
                  separated and compartmentalised. This is because they have distinct
                  roles to play: One makes laws by contesting for power while the other
                  seeks to affect legislation on specific issues.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Both
                  need an open and democratic society to function effectively. In a
                  non-democratic state where opposition politicians and activists are
                  deprived of their roles, doesn't it make sense for both groups to come
                  together to work for democracy first? Without democratic freedom there
                  can be no oppositionist and civil society activist to speak of.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>In
                  our situation, it would be wonderful if democracy activists could come
                  out to actively campaign for freedom and make all the necessary
                  sacrifices. The SDP can then step in when the heavy lifting is done and
                  just campaign to win power. We won't have to go through all the
                  difficulties and hardship of fighting the autocrats.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>But
                  this is not the reality. There are no democracy activists fighting for
                  reform. Under the such circumstances the Singapore Democrats can do one
                  of two things: Play it safe and let others do the dirty work, or roll
                  up our sleeves and lead by example. We choose leadership.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Under
                  undemocratic regimes, activists and opposition politicians often merge
                  into the same role. Nelson Mandela, Vaclav Havel, Lech Walesa, Kim Dae
                  Jung, and Xanana Gusmao were all activists fighting for democracy

              <p> </p>
              <p>Consistency.</p>
              <p>Since entering politics in the 1990s, CSJ has been consistent in his political views that got him into politics.</p>
              <p>At least, CSJ could see that what he had written in 1992, had resulted in parallel policy changes in 2001 - even as the PAP government will deny reading his book.</p>
              <p>From views expressed in 1992 and action taken in 2001, a generation of young Singaporeans would have passed through Primary to Secondary School - which will represent a generation educated but leading them to no where.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have endured more then 52 years of continuous PAP social, educational, and political experimentation in their flip-flop policies implemented, some with die-hard NO U-Turn mind sets.</p>
              <p>Since independence until this day, LKY and his PAP government has forced their policies onto Singapore - with Singaporeans bearing the consequences of failures.</p>
              <p>In the early 1960s, against the loud voices who understood the Malayan politics, LKY forced a 'false referendum' to get Singapore to merge with Malaysia in 1963, which broke up two years later when Singapore was evicted from Malaysia in 1965 amidst heavy racial politics that polarize the various ethnic groups in both countries till today.</p>
              <p>Malaysians and Singaporean continue to carry the burden of the misjudgment of the hurried political actions taken in the early 1960s, with continued abrasive relations betwen both countries despite over 40 years of separation.</p>
              <p>From the mid-1960s through late 1970s, Family Planning was supported with draconian laws and implemented with such fervor even against more reasonsed and educated voices that cautioned the long term effects of such a policy.</p>
              <p>Forty years later,the consequences of this policy continue to haunt us each time when the PAP leadership will unashamedly lament the lack of Singaporean fertility - without acknowledging that higher cost Sweden has been able to sustain population growth in this 21st Century.</p>
              <p>From the late 1960s to the late 1970s, Singaporeans were lamenting for more tertiary education places in the single University after the closure of Nanyang University; it led to the reopening of NU into a renamed Nanyang Technology University in early 1980s.</p>
              <p>Besides, the limited places available, Singaporeans were subjected to "Suitability Certificates" that were designed to filter undesireable Singaporean applicants who are related to any family members with ties to politcal activities.</p>
              <p>Singapore had already begun to lose talents as early as the 1970s, when many were forced to study overseas.</p>
              <p>After 40 years, we have the PAP Government opening the doors to "commercial universities" to establish themselves in Singapore. </p>
              <p>Today, the PAP Government will continue to lament the lack of talent, creativity and entrepreneurship - but will not acknowledge the policies of exclusion and greed to muscle out private capital by passing legislations to takeover private enterprise and private capital in the name of efficiency in the use of limited national resources.</p>
              <p>After more then 40 years of industrialisation, Singaporeans continue to be tied to the capital and enterprise of foreign MNCs - begining with low tech manufacturing in the late 1960s, and now to higher value added manufacturing and research.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the patents and royalties belonged to the foreign MNCs.</p>
              <p>Private enterprise and research remains weak when the Government Linked Companies will continue to compete with Private Capital.</p>
              <p>Japan, South Korea and China have seen their weaning away from foreign MNCs involvement, and the growth of Private Enterprise that lead to major household names that proudly identify the country of origin of the many reliable products.</p>
              <p>Singapore has been involved in industrialization since the late 1960s for as long as the same period taken by Japan and South Korea, and shorter period by China, yet Singapore continue to be stuck in her dependence on foreign MNCs.</p>
