              <p>It just an pattern that certain group of singaporean are excel

              if you asked an chinese whether IT skills is his interest, most
              possibly his answer will be something like it is 'sian' (boring in
              singlish), or they have enough of IT. That why from my experience,
              it is just an matter of interest that certain group will only do

              India
              
              Singapore has enjoyed a special relationship with India both in terms of business and culture.
              
              Approximately 9% of the population of Singapore is of Indian origin and our city offers many attractive employment opportunities for Indian professionals and business entrepreneurs. In fact, leading Indian names can be found in such diverse fields as finance &amp; banking, IT and law.
              
              Singapore is the second most popular destination for overseas investments from India, with over 4,000 Indian corporate and individual investors setting up companies in Singapore. These include world-renowned business houses like the Tata Group, leading technologies companies like Infosys and a large number of small and medium enterprise owners who utilise Singapore as a springboard to enter new markets in the rest of Asia. With the signing of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) in 2005, Singapore and India have grown ever closer culturally and commercially.
              
              For Indian professionals, Singapore offers many unique advantages, starting with the presence of many multi-national companies drawn by our strategic location in the heart of Asia and our innate commercial strengths. Professionals who yearn for international exposure will find opportunities in the many international and regional headquarters based here.
              
              On the family front, excellent education systems and healthcare facilities, as well as a low crime rate, make Singapore a safe and family-friendly environment. Other advantages include an English-speaking population, close proximity to India, similar cultural values, as well as a wide and growing range of Indian cuisines available.
              
              http://www.contactsingapore.sg/contact/india/
              
              Singapore remains attractive hub for highly skilled Indians
              
              The financial services and banking sectors in Singapore are emerging as the most important global destinations for highly skilled talent from India. And the government is very supportive. "The financial services sector in Singapore is one of the biggest employers attracting new talent from India. Singapore has emerged as one of the key banking hubs in the world. Increasingly more client money is flowing in, especially for the private banking and wealth management industry.
              
              The large number of Indian companies with operations in Singapore, about 4,000, are also huge employers of Indians. A big advantage that Singapore provides for Indian professionals is a tax-friendly regime. Average taxes range between 7% and 15%. Additionally there are schemes to ease the payment of tax, for instance, the option to pay via monthly instalments.
              
              Singapore is now becoming a big draw for Indian students as well because of the quality of educational institutions, as well as the safe and secure environment. "Job opportunities are definitely available for Indian students in Singapore and most students continue to stay and work after they complete their courses. Several banks have started picking up students straight from campus," says Xavier Raj.

              <p>   The study surveyed more than 4,000 Singapore residents between December 2012 and April last year.</p>
              <p>   The findings were presented at the IPS Singapore Perspectives 2014 conference yesterday.</p>
              <p>   More than 40 per cent of respondents felt that prejudice levels in the categories of race, religion, language, gender, age and nationality have remained the same.</p>
              <p>   Almost half felt that the levels of racial prejudice has not changed, while 16 per cent felt that it has grown.</p>
              <p>   For the religion and gender categories, the percentage of those who felt there was no change in the levels of prejudice was slightly higher - 50.7 per cent and 50 per cent respectively.</p>
              <p>   Less than half said there was less gender prejudice, while 39.2 per cent felt the same for religion.</p>
              <p>   About 70 per cent agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that the Government is responsible for racial and religious harmony to Singapore.</p>
              <p>   Less than half felt that the Government  has done well to improve the integration of new immigrants here.</p>
              <p>   The data also showed that respondents were very comfortable with different local -born racial groups in public and private settings, but less so with those who were foreign-born.</p>
