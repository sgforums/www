              Because their religion causes us to eat our meals seperately
              hahaha. This is a pain in the ass. I am a free thinker. So I guess
              I am more receptive to different religion. My Christian friend

              It depends to the Muslim individuals and many too eat together at the same table with their Non-Muslim colleagues that are eating pork or Non-Halal food. I'm one of them. I see this thing happens in Malaysia most of the time. I am a universal man. I have a brother who is a Christian and a Sister who is a Hindu. Both my decease Muslim parents went to Haj twice. I'm half Chinese and half Malay.

              <p>But you have missed the point.
              Here I am talking about Foreigners (Indian Nationals) taking over

              disharmony.</p>
              <p>Local people including or rather mainly PAP supporters are very
              confused. They thought that every Indian Nationals arrived in
              Singapore and the next day they are already Singaporeans. facepalm
              /.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">PAP leaders can't run away
              from their responsible if their policy of bring in Indian Nationals
              to dominate our Finance Industry resulted in other Singaporeans
              envy and get angry and causes racial disharmony. They might have
              mistaken Indian Nationals to be local Indians hahaha. If PAP
              supporters are confused then most likely the rests will be confused
              too unlike you think PAP supporters are more stupid

              <p>To azhai.</p>
              <p>Are you working in the Finance Industry in Singapore?</p>
              <p>Singapore is an open economy and Singapore delegation has
                  invited Indian companies to invest in Singapore and vise versa for
                  Singapore companies to invest in India too. There are quite a
                  number of Indian companies presence in Singapore and perhaps you
                  are misluded to conclude that most of the key positions in the
                  financial industry are occupied by Indian nationals. They will
                  bring in their own people from India to oversee and run their
                  companies key business positions here before they employ local
                  Singaporeans should they intend to expand their business operations
                  here. Singapore companies operating in Indian sub-continent will do
                  likewise…this is one of the business strategy.</p>
              <p>Indian nationals are mostly employed in the IT Industry in
                  Singapore. Financial Industry are mainly dominated by professionals
                  from the Western countries.</p>

              <p>Actually I am a property agent. Every 100 condo tenants I come across 90 are Indian Nationals (Foreigners). They are mostly if not 100% employed in the Banking Industry. They could be senior bankers or software engineers but all the same the fact is they are all working in the Banking Industry. So I am very alarmed.</p>
              <p>You are making a lot of wild guesses while mine is all first hand info. That is the different my friend.</p>

              <p>But Ang Moh number is still very small compared to Indian Nationals(Foreigners not Singaporeans mind you). So we have to tackle the more pressing issue. If 90 tenants out of 100 is Indian Nationals foreigners than we jolly well focus on them.</p>
              <p>We cannot put nationality one side because we Singaporeans are being disadvantaged. If you put it one side then there is nothing to discuss anymore.</p>
