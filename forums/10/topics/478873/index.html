              <p>Although PAP always claims that racial harmony is utmost impt. to Singapore and warn everybody to thread carefully about it. But here I would like to point out that their actions could cause the contrary. </p>
              <p>Any sensible people will know that you can't bring in one race to dominate one industry. Although in this case they are Indian Nationals (foreigners) but Indian happens to be one of the 4 major races in Singapore. So you have to be very careful. You should have conducted national dialogue with Singaporeans before you went ahead.</p>
              <p>So now we have many Local Chinese(Singaporeans) envying those jobs hold by Indian Nationals(Foreigners).....This is obviously a time bomb. It is a local vs foreigners issue that could easily turn into a racial disharmony issue.</p>
              <p>So it is very impt that our government take drastic actions on this issue immediately. Our Finance Minister is not capable of handling this very sensitive issue. Someone more capable has to take over the job.</p>
              <p>Racial harmony was so difficult to achieve in Singapore but we finally did it. Why are you becoming so insensitive now ? You are not balancing your policies well !</p>

              <p>Not Ang Moh la. You are not well informed enough. Most of the best jobs in the Finance Industry have gone to Indian Nationals. Ang Moh's number is still neligible. The same can't be said for Indian Nationals, Citizens of India.</p>

              <p>I see you want to fight for interests of chinese in Singapore. But your target is incorrect.</p>
              <p>The no.1 person suppressing chinese in Singapore is the peranakan baba Harry Lee Kuan Yew, not indians.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 24px;"> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">From another paradigm, Singapore could be seen as
                      the domination of one group over another. Most of the leadership
                      has been drawn from the Baba Chinese community, a group cultured in
                      Malay and “Colonial British.” Babas hold strong family values,
                      community cohesiveness, and tend to respect
                      authority.</span></span></strong> This is in contrast to the
                      southern mainland Chinese migrants to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore who fled oppression and tended to
                      oppose authority.</span></span></strong> Singapore has thus been
                      run more in the manner to which a British colonial administrator
                      would have aspired. Thus patriarchal leadership with neo-Victorian
                      values is not something the migrating Chinese accepted openly.
                      <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore has seen many campaigns, incentives,
                      and deterrents to achieve the values of the Baba
                      class.</span></span></strong></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If you set chinese against indians, malays, foreigners, ang mohs or other groups, you will be playing into the hands of Harry Lee Kuan Yew. That won't do. That is only a dead end. People like Harry Lee will hide in the background and reap the rewards.</p>

              <p>Why 90% of the best Banking jobs goes to Indian Nationals (Foreigners) ? This is not an issue of talent. This is an issue of discrimination by PAP minister against locals and in this case local Chinese(mainly). They have a certain agenda which I have already explained in my warning against PAP leaders anti-china post.</p>
              <p>When Dr Richard Hu was in charge of Finance Industry. There was no Indian Nationals(Foreigners) at all in Singapore Banking Sector. Why all of a sudden they are so much demand for them here ? Read my post. The black hand behind all these are PAP leaders.</p>
              <p>And don't you confuse Indian Nationals with Singaporean Indian. If you are confused and it seems you are then obviously PAP policy to build a Singaporean identity failed badly.</p>
              <p>The are Indian Nationals from India. One day after they arrived in Singapore you already think they are Singaporean. You are so failed. facepalm /</p>

              <p>Personally I quite like our Malay friend except their religion. Because their religion causes us to eat our meals seperately hahaha. This is a pain in the ass. I am a free thinker. So I guess I am more receptive to different religion. My Christian friend can't say the same hahaha.</p>
              <p>So Malay position in Singapore is a bit sensitive. Indonesia leaders don't like us too because we allow money money laundering by rich Indonesian Chinese hahaha.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">As for local local Indian I think they are already doing too well. There should be less Indian ministers. hahaha</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">But you have missed the point. Here I am talking about Foreigners (Indian Nationals) taking over locals jobs. The confusion generated may resulted in racial disharmony.</span></p>
              <p>Local people including or rather mainly PAP supporters are very confused. They thought that every Indian Nationals arrived in Singapore and the next day they are already Singaporeans. facepalm /.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">PAP leaders can't run away from their responsible if their policy of bring in Indian Nationals to dominate our Finance Industry resulted in other Singaporeans envy and get angry and causes racial disharmony. They might have mistaken Indian Nationals to be local Indians hahaha. If PAP supporters are confused then most likely the rests will be confused too unlike you think PAP supporters are more stupid hahaha.</span></p>

              To azhai.
                      
              Are you working in the Finance Industry in Singapore? 
                      
              Singapore is an open economy and Singapore delegation has invited Indian companies to invest in Singapore and vise versa for Singapore companies to invest in India too. There are quite a number of Indian companies presence in Singapore and perhaps you are misluded to conclude that most of the key positions in the financial industry are occupied by Indian nationals. They will bring in their own people from India to oversee and run their companies key business positions here before they employ local Singaporeans should they intend to expand their business operations here. Singapore companies operating in Indian sub-continent will do likewise...this is one of the business strategy.
                      
              Indian nationals are mostly employed in the IT Industry in Singapore. Financial Industry are mainly dominated by professionals from the Western countries.

              <p>It just an pattern that certain group of singaporean are excel in different area, for example, Malay in the area of art/music and sport like Sepak takraw or Soccer etc, Indian in IT/Technical area while Chinese in business or government job. In fact, for example if you asked an chinese whether IT skills is his interest, most possibly his answer will be something like it is 'sian' (boring in singlish), or they have enough of IT. That why from my experience, it is just an matter of interest that certain group will only do jobs they prefer and not really because their 'rich bowl' is being taken away.</p>
              <p>And I noticed recently, food seem to be the only thing which united Singaporean and foreigners alike. and people always use their smartphone to take snapshot of food and post it in social media, regardless of race.</p>

              I remembered this incidence clearly. It took place in the 80s. There were silent activation to recall the respective reservists. Weapons all drawn out, in full SBO and on high stand-by. Artilleries were deployed around Singapore. This incidence is irrelevant here so what are you trying to say here?
