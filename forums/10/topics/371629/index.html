              <p>Sunday, 09 August 2009</p>
              <p><em>Singapore Democrats</em><br> <br> <img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/PAP/gyhillary.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="200" height="150" align="left">Yesterday, Dr Chee Soon Juan posted on Mr George Yeo's Facebook to invite the Minister to an online debate (see <a href="http://yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/2644--chee-soon-juan-invites-george-yeo-for-an-online-debate">here</a> and <a href="http://en-gb.facebook.com/people/Chee-Soon-Juan/606486772">here</a>). This set off an exchange of messages which we think readers might be interested to read.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Dear Dr Chee<br><br> May I suggest you write to the PAP as what you propose seems rather formal.</strong></p>
              <strong><br> I don't really want my FB activities to be so formal or serious. I am
                  happy to engage as and when issues arise, but I do so as an individual
                  without getting the PAP or MFA involved. Short responses, not long
                  exchanges if possible. So far it has been fun for me and I hope to keep
                  it that way. Hope you understand.<br><br> George </strong>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Dear George,<br> <br> Thanks for your reply.<br> <br> I have this impression that you are saying that you don't want to debate the issues without really saying so.<br> <br> First, you say that you don't want your Facebook to be so formal or
                  serious. And yet you use a picture of yourself in a business suit
                  sitting in front of the Singapore flag with Hillary Clinton, obviously
                  using your status as Foreign Minister.<br> <br> Second, you say that you don't want to involve the PAP or MFA in the
                  discussions. You are a minister and obviously a senior member of the
                  PAP. How do you discuss political issues, as you are obviously doing
                  with your FB visitors, without involving the PAP or the ministry you're
                  in charge of?<br> <br> Can an NSman say that he wants to discuss military matters on his FB
                  (informally) but without involving the SAF? I hope you see the
                  difficulty of your argument.<br> <br> Be that as it may, I would be grateful if you could pass my message for
                  a debate on to your secretary-general at your next CEC meeting. I'll
                  write to Hsien Loong separately.<br> <br> On this note, let's start a discussion. We can make it as informal as
                  you want it to be but let's take it seriously. I can appreciate your
                  sentiments about keeping your FB activity fun. But I think our fellow
                  citizens would be aghast if we treated such weighty issues flippantly.<br> <br> And if you insist, we can suspend the notion that you are a member of the PAP or cabinet.<br> <br> I'd like to start with these three matters:<br> <br> First, about your salary. Do you think you deserve the amount (it's
                  nearly $3 million at last count, I believe) and are you comfortable
                  with this knowing that the poorest of our poor whom you and your
                  colleagues rule over are paid as little as $400 a month? Economically
                  is this just? Morally is it sustainable?<br> <br> Second, do you consider the Public Order Act that allows even a lone
                  protester to be considered an illegal assembly constitutional? Also,
                  organisations like the PAP Community Foundation and CASE are allowed to
                  hold assemblies and processions while democracy activists are not. Is
                  this fair? Constitutional?<br> <br> Last but not least, is it right that the GIC and Temasek handle our
                  national reserves but don't reveal the accounts and don't account for
                  their transactions? What do you think about Ho Ching staying on as CEO
                  after losses of $40 billion?<br> <br> Happy National Day!<br> <br> Soon Juan</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Dear Dr Chee<br><br> I use a range of pictures for my FB accounts, some serious, some not so.  Hillary was a celebrity in Phuket.<br><br> On salaries, the Public Orders Act and accounts of GIC and Temasek,
                  there were extensive debates in Parliament which I don't think I can
                  add much to, or subtract from. I believe the questions you ask were
                  specifically replied to in Parliament.<br><br> On foreign visits, I often receive favourable comments about how
                  Temasek is run. A number of countries actually hold Temasek up as a
                  model to follow.<br><br> Happy National Day to you too!<br><br> George</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Dear George,<br> <br> I put a few issues to solicit your personal views because it was you
                  who said that you didn't want to involve your party or your ministry in
                  the discussions. But in your reply, you cite Parliamentary debates and
                  say that the questions I asked were specifically replied to in
                  Parliament.<br> <br> Aren't these the views of your party that you didn't want to involve in the first place?<br> <br> I ask again: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What are your <em>personal</em> views about the amount that you are paid and do you feel you deserve
                  it? What do you think about Singaporeans getting paid $400 a month? Do
                  you think this is morally and economically defensible? Don't worry
                  about the Parliamentary debates, I would like to hear what you as an
                  individual think.</strong></span></span><br> <br> I also asked you about the Public Order Act and whether it is fair and
                  constitutional for PAP supporters to hold processions and assemblies
                  while supporters of the opposition are not. Again, I'm asking you for
                  your thoughts and views, not those of your colleagues in Parliament.<br> <br> Third, I asked you whether you thought that Ho Ching should stay on as
                  CEO despite her losing $40 billion. You avoided my question by saying
                  that other countries hold Temasek up as a model.<br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> It's okay if you don't want to answer my questions. I would be
                  grateful, however, if you would say it plainly rather that skirt the
                  questions and give non-answers.</strong></span></span><br> <br> Soon Juan</p>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore. Gay pride? No, Eurasian pride!</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The
              Singapore state controlled newspaper's online edition of August 4, 2009
              has this article "Eurasian Pride. Racial Harmony in Singapore". Talk
              about a wrong choice of words, and worse, an insult to every red
              blooded Eurasian in Singapore!<br><br>Normally when you say "pride" for
              a section of the community, you normally think of a people downtrodden
              because of a distasteful or immoral past reputation, such as the
              "gays". That is why you have "gay pride week" or "reformed criminals
              pride week".</p>
              <p>The need to assert their "pride" is to challenge the
              normally held derogatory view of them, an attempt to rehabilitate from
              a past bad reputation. I have no problem with that when it comes to
              gays and others previously disadvantaged, and I am sure neither do you.<br><br>But
              to write an article about "Eurasian pride" is to insult every Eurasian
              in Singapore or anywhere else. George Yeo, Lee Kuan Yew's Foreign
              Minister, makes several false assertions in the article which means
              either he has never lived in Singapore or he is deliberately putting
              out falsehoods, because with a state controlled press in Singapore, he
              can say anything however false unchallenged. The latter is of course
              the case here.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First he says "More than 20 years ago, Eurasians
              were not treated in a respectable way and therefore many left for
              Australia." I have lived in Singapore too and I have never come across
              anyone treating Eurasians in a "less respectable way". In fact, with a
              European ancestry, albeit only part, Eurasians felt themselves better
              and higher class than the Asian Chinese in Singapore, like George Yeo. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Considering Singapore being a predominantly Chinese island and they
              feeling European; not wanting to be associated with the Singaporeans
              Chinese coolies, of which George Yeo's ancestors were one; they
              preferred to settle in Australia which was principally a white country.</p>
              <p>Their leaving Singapore was certainly not because anyone in Singapore
              looked down at them. In fact it was the other way around; the Eurasians
              looking down on the Asian Chinese; and the Asian Chinese like George
              Yeo admiring Eurasians for their usually better looks and their
              European culture. George Yeo's name itself gives this away, since why
              is he calling himself George Yeo instead of Yeo Heng Hock or whatever
              Chinese name he was born with since his Mongoloid appearance has
              nothing to do with a European name like George! <br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>George being a
              typical English name, I am sure King George V of England, would be
              turning in his grave to know a Singapore Chinese guy whose parents were
              Chinese coolies from Southern China, in pigtails kowtowing every five
              minutes to the Emperor's servants, lest their heads be chopped off; is
              now running around Singapore island and calling himself George! </strong></span></span><br><br>George
              Yeo then says Eurasians now are asking that they be described as
              Eurasians in the Singapore identity cards. Apart from the fact that
              they may or may not have asked to be described as "Eurasians" in their
              ID cards, since with a state controlled paper like the Straits Times
              you can say any lie you want anytime; the whole concept of marking a
              person’s race in his ID as Chinese, Indian etc, is totally
              unacceptable.</p>
              <p>It smacks of apartheid, since the constitution
              specifically declares all to be equal; what need is there to mark a
              persons' race other than to discriminate him? This practice is outlawed
              in all free civilized nations in the world except for the totalitarian
              and repressive regimes such as the previous racist S Africa. For
              instance my California ID carries the name Gopalan Nair. It does not
              say Gopalan Nair, Indian. <br><br>He then says "Everyone in Singapore
              is given equal treatment". Really?<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> In 1938, Singapore Chinese
              population was only 51%. Today, despite the decreasing birth rate among
              the Chinese, which would have meant the Chinese population, would have
              declined even further, it now stands at 75%, because George Yeo's
              government in total violation of the Constitution brings in
              disproportionally large numbers of Chinese from China to ensure they
              remain the majority. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>This is a violation of the Constitution as it
              requires equal treatment among the races. Is George Yeo, Lee Kuan Yew's
              Foreign Minister not lying through his teeth when he says “everyone is
              given equal treatment"? Tell me George Yeo, are the Malays and Indians
              treated "equally"?<br><br>George Yeo, who appears to be completely in
              the dark about Eurasians, should be told one more thing. Eurasians, the
              educated ones that is, are continuing to leave Singapore in
              progressively greater numbers to Australia and elsewhere.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And they are
              leaving because there is no democracy in Singapore and also because the
              Straits Times, Singapore’s state controlled newspaper continues to
              insult their intelligence and their ethnicity by writing this nonsense
              such as that put out here by Lee Kuan Yew's foreign Minister George
              Yeo, this Chinese George. </strong></span></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>My name is Gopalan Nair. Not Archibald Adams Nair. And I am proud of it. </strong></span></span><br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>I always considered angmoh name on asian people to be filth and disrespectful to their heritage.</p>
              <p>Even that anglo bastard Lee Kuan Yew has to drop his Harry and become Kuan Yew to even have a chance to be elected.</p>
              <p>People in those days see him yellow skin but got angmoh name, they won't respect him, they will see him as a british dog.</p>
              <p>That is why the name must change.</p>
              <p>But that bastard change his fucking name, inside still white.</p>
              <p>Skin outside is yellow skin, but meat inside is white meat, that is Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>Such filth as him.</p>
              <p>Singapore is made up of asian people, malay, tamil, dialect chinese, but sway enough to have an anglo filth like Lee Kuan Yew come and rule us, come and mess up everything.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew and all of his mother fucking anglo filth.</p>

                  posted on Mr George Yeo's Facebook to invite the Minister to an

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Dear George,<br> <br> I put a few issues to solicit your personal views because it was
                  you who said that you didn't want to involve your party or your
                  ministry in the discussions. But in your reply, you cite
                  Parliamentary debates and say that the questions I asked were
                  specifically replied to in Parliament.<br> <br> Aren't these the views of your party that you didn't want to
                  involve in the first place?<br> <br> I ask again: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What are your
                  <em>personal</em> views about the amount that you are paid and do
                  you feel you deserve it? What do you think about Singaporeans
                  getting paid $400 a month? Do you think this is morally and
                  economically defensible? Don't worry about the Parliamentary
                  debates, I would like to hear what you as an individual
                  think.</strong></span></span><br> <br> I also asked you about the Public Order Act and whether it is fair
                  and constitutional for PAP supporters to hold processions and
                  assemblies while supporters of the opposition are not. Again, I'm
                  asking you for your thoughts and views, not those of your
                  colleagues in Parliament.<br> <br> Third, I asked you whether you thought that Ho Ching should stay on
                  as CEO despite her losing $40 billion. You avoided my question by
                  saying that other countries hold Temasek up as a model.<br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> It's okay if you don't want to answer my questions. I would be
                  grateful, however, if you would say it plainly rather that skirt
                  the questions and give non-answers.</strong></span></span><br> <br> Soon Juan</p>

                  formal."</span><br> <br> If Dr Chee thinks that I have a valid point, I would like him to
                  ask George this question on my behalf.<br> <br> Yes, George. You may suggest <em>anything</em> you want.<br> <br> But one constituent of mine wants to know this: Is there currently
                  a structural arrangement within the PAP that would guarantee that
                  if I wrote to them, I would a receive a positive response to my
                  'formal' proposals (ie. a meeting can be set up to for the purposes
                  of my questions being answered)?<br> <br> If so, what are those structural arrangements? Is there a specific
                  unit within the PAP that will accede to my requests for the
                  questions that I have raised? And if so, which unit might that
                  be?<br> <br> And may I quote you as having reccomended that avenue as a recourse

              <p>Pity that people in Singapore are extremely apathetic about such issues because its so removed from their daily existence.</p>

              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, if there are,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On behalf of the Singapore foreign Ministry, we shall present the following formal statements with no debate intended.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Ministers in Singapore are qualified peoples, they can anytime be a CEO or Board directors and be paid more than a Minister's pay. But because of the patriotism and need to serve and contribute, they are willing to take on a lower paid structure as a Minister in comparing with a Directors paid, which can be double or triple it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Singapore is a peaceful country where all can enjoy and build their life here, we condone all violences and protest without proper channel thru the authority concern. The word Public Order, serve all of us orderly for the benefit of peace and harmony. The Act had serves us well for the past years and it should be merited instead of condemned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3 Temasek and GIC deals with investments for the benefits of the country wealth, and investment come with risk and loses, however, it also come with wins and gains, the govt had been transparent to the public by sharing its loses. Ironically, nobody seems to bother about the years of Winning. In view of an experience investor, it is part and parcel of a capital market mobility and liquitability.  </p>
