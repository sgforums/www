              <p>If you used to teach at Harvard University afew years back,

              <p>Do you have the intellect to even make a guess
              of Francis Seow's age? He used to teach at Harvard Law, he has
              retired because of age, unlike some cancerous growth in the
              Singapore government which persist in causing death and
              destruction.</p>

              <p>In the Wizard of Oz (your infactuation with Australia), the lion
              didn't have courage, but I guess in your case lionnoisy, you don't
              have courage and brains. You are like the scarecrow and lion all

              <p>A more recent case was in 1988, when a US diplomat interfered in
                                                  Singapore's domestic politics. The diplomat actively cultivated <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr
                                                  Francis Seow.</span> Mr Francis Seow was advised by the diplomat how to
                                                  establish a more effective opposition in Parliament and to set
                                                  about seriously to recruit more young professionals into the
                                                  opposition. This is gross interference in Singapore's domestic

              <p>Been following sgforums but cant help agree with the rest what a MORON Lionnoisy is.  First trying to be garang to claim his post is with facts and figures and the next minutes "Base on memory".  HALO -- TALK COCK ALSO GOT LIMIT LAH.</p>
              <p>As a SG Citizen, compare 5 yrs ago and now, my life is so much tougher and zialat whereas I still stay in the same place and doing the samething.  why? cos of LHL regime lor.  Can you give me another reason? External factor?? moron.  Electricity increase 21% given reason forward fuel pricing.  Ask yourself, as a consumer can you swallow this kind of lame excuse??  I am not paying what I used but base on a system to determine how much to charge me.  Use your brain again lah.  HDB make losses of $500mlm for building flat??? Ask that "Horse" to show the figure lor.  Every new HDB flat cos more then 100% comparing to 10 yrs ago.  you can swallow?? How much your salary is now compare to 10 yrs ago? </p>
              <p>You still dont know how the word die in chinese is written? another 10 + yrs down the road you will be the one picking can and selling tissue paper where all the ppl you pegging at were PRC.  Can anyone dare to say if the present political situation to carry on and all this wont happen?</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Moving to quiet the dispute that followed the American diplomat's
              expulsion last month, Mr. Lee proposed to Parliament that an
              international committee investigate the case.</p>
              <p>Mr. Lee
              emphasized that he considered the United States an important friend,
              but also said that American officials needed to understand Singapore's
              political realities.</p>
              The Prime Minister said the American
              diplomat's meetings with the opposition had been taken as an affront by
              the younger leaders of his ruling People's Action Party.</blockquote>
