R. Leary and others define boredom similarly, and somewhat more succinctly, as “an affective experience associated with cognitive attentional processes.”<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[4]</span></span></a></sup> These definitions make it clear that boredom arises not from a lack of things to do but from the inability to latch onto any specific activity. Nothing engages us, despite an often profound desire for engagement.</p>
              <p>There appear to be three general types of boredom, all of which involve problems of engagement of <a title="Attention" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Attention"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">attention</span></span></a>. These include times when we are prevented from engaging in something, when we are forced to engage in some unwanted activity, or when we are simply unable, for no apparent reason, to maintain engagement in any activity or spectacle.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[5]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>An important psychological construct is that of boredom proneness; a tendency to experience boredom of all types. This is typically assessed by the Boredom Proneness Scale.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-5"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[6]</span></span></a></sup> Consistent with the definition provided above, recent research has found that boredom proneness is clearly and consistently associated with failures of <a title="Attention" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Attention"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">attention</span></span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[7]</span></span></a></sup> Boredom and boredom proneness are both theoretically and empirically linked to <a title="Depression (mood)" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Depression_(mood)"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">depression</span></span></a> and depressive symptoms.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-7"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[8]</span></span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-8"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[9]</span></span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[10]</span></span></a></sup> Nonetheless, boredom proneness has been found to be as strongly correlated with attentional lapses as with depression.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-10"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[11]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Although boredom is often viewed as a trivial and mild irritant, proneness to boredom has been linked to a very diverse range of possible <a class="mw-redirect" title="Psychological" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Psychological"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">psychological</span></span></a>, physical, educational, and social problems.</p>

              <h2><span class="mw-headline">Philosophy</span></h2>
              <p><strong>Boredom</strong> is a condition characterized by <a title="Perception" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Perception"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">perception</span></span></a> of one's environment as dull, tedious, and lacking in <a title="Stimulation" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Stimulation"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">stimulation</span></span></a>. This can result from leisure and a lack of aesthetic interests. <a class="mw-redirect" title="Labor" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Labor"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Labor</span></span></a>, however, and even <a title="Art" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Art"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">art</span></span></a> may be alienated and passive, or immersed in tedium (see <a title="Marx's theory of alienation" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Marx's theory of alienation</span></span></a>). There is an inherent <a title="Anxiety" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Anxiety"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">anxiety</span></span></a> in boredom; people will expend considerable effort to prevent or remedy it, yet in many circumstances, it is accepted as suffering to be endured. Common passive ways to escape boredom are to sleep or to think creative thoughts (<a title="Daydream" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Daydream"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">daydream</span></span></a>). Typical active solutions consist in an intentional activity of some sort, often something new, as familiarity and <a title="Repetition" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Repetition"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">repetition</span></span></a> lead to the tedious.</p>
              <p>Boredom also plays a role in <a class="mw-redirect" title="Existentialist" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Existentialist"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">existentialist</span></span></a> thought. In contexts where one is confined, spatially or otherwise, boredom may be met with various religious activities, not because religion would want to associate itself with tedium, but rather, partly because boredom may be taken as the essential human condition, to which God, wisdom, or morality are the ultimate answers. Boredom is in fact taken in this sense by virtually all <a class="mw-redirect" title="Existentialist" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Existentialist"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">existentialist</span></span></a> philosophers as well as by <a class="mw-redirect" title="Schopenhauer" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Schopenhauer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Schopenhauer</span></span></a>. <a class="mw-redirect" title="Heidegger" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Heidegger"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Heidegger</span></span></a> wrote about boredom in two texts available in English, in the 1929/30 semester lecture course <em>The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics</em>, and again in the essay <em>What is Metaphysics?</em> published in the same year. In the lecture, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Heidegger" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Heidegger"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Heidegger</span></span></a> included about 100 pages on boredom, probably the most extensive philosophical treatment ever of the subject. He focused on waiting at <a title="Train station" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Train_station"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">train stations</span></span></a> in particular as a major context of boredom.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-11"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[12]</span></span></a></sup> In <a class="mw-redirect" title="Kierkegaard" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Kierkegaard"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Kierkegaard</span></span></a>'s remark in <em><a title="Either/Or" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Either/Or"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Either/Or</span></span></a></em>, that "patience cannot be depicted" visually, there is a sense that any immediate moment of life may be fundamentally tedious.</p>

              <p>Above and beyond taste and character, the universal case of boredom consists in any instance of <em>waiting</em>, as <a class="mw-redirect" title="Heidegger" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Heidegger"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Heidegger</span></span></a> noted, such as in line, for someone else to arrive or finish a task, or while one is travelling.</p>
              <p>Boredom, however, may also increase as travel becomes more convenient, as the vehicle may become more like the windowless <a title="Monad" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Monad"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">monad</span></span></a> in <a class="mw-redirect" title="Leibniz" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Leibniz"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Leibniz</span></span></a>'s <a title="Monadology" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Monadology"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">monadology</span></span></a>.

              <p>In a learning environment, a common cause of boredom is lack of understanding; for instance, if one is not following or connecting to the material in a class or lecture, it will usually seem boring. However, the opposite can also be true; something that is too easily understood, simple or transparent, can also be boring. Boredom is often inversely related to <a title="Learning" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Learning"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">learning</span></span></a>, and in school it may be a sign that a student is not challenged enough, or too challenged.

              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Internet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="color: #0066cc;">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>

Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>

              <p>Seow joined the Singapore <a title="Law" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Law"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Legal</span></span></a> Service in 1956 and rose through the ranks to become Solicitor-General in 1969, a position he held until 1971. During his <a title="Career" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Career"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">career</span></span></a> he served under the administration of <a title="Prime Minister of Singapore" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Prime Minister</span></span></a> <a title="Lee Kuan Yew" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lee Kuan Yew</span></span></a> and was appointed senior counsel to a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Commission of Inquiry" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Commission_of_Inquiry"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Commission of Inquiry</span></span></a> in the Secondary IV examination <a title="Boycott" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Boycott"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">boycott</span></span></a> by <a title="China" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/China"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chinese</span></span></a> <a title="Student" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Student"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">students</span></span></a> in 1963 prior to Singapore's entry into <a title="Malaysia" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Malaysia"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Malaysia</span></span></a>. For his work, Seow was awarded the Public Administration (Gold) Medal. He eventually left public service and entered into private law practice in 1972.</p>
              <p>He was later suspended from law practice for 12 months by <a title="Chief Justice" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Chief_Justice"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chief Justice</span></span></a> <a title="Wee Chong Jin" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Wee_Chong_Jin"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Wee Chong Jin</span></span></a> for breach of an undertaking given on behalf of his junior law partner to the <a title="Attorney-General of Singapore" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Attorney-General_of_Singapore"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Attorney-General</span></span></a> while in private practice. Nonetheless, he was later elected a member of the Council of the Law Society in 1976 and eventually became its <a title="President" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/President"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">President</span></span></a> in 1986.</p>
              <p>His new appointment led to a falling out with Lee Kuan Yew after he became embroiled in the politics surrounding the role of the Law Society. He had envisaged a restoration of the role of the Law Society to, inter alia, comment on legislation that the government was then churning out without any meaningful parliamentary debate, a role which Prime Minister Lee took especial exception to. In the result, Prime Minister Lee caused special legislation to be passed depriving the Law Society, inter alia, of any powers to comment on any legislation unless the government specifically asks the Law Society for its comments. He ran for the <a title="Parliament of Singapore" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Parliament of Singapore</span></span></a> as part of the <a title="Workers' Party of Singapore" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Workers%27_Party_of_Singapore"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Workers' Party</span></span></a> team that contested the <a title="Eunos Group Representation Constituency" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Eunos_Group_Representation_Constituency"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Eunos Group Representation Constituency</span></span></a> in the <a class="new" title="Singapore general election, 1988 (page does not exist)" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/w/index.php?title=Singapore_general_election,_1988&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">1988 Singapore general election</span></span></a>. However, his team managed to secure 49.11% of valid votes, "losing marginally" to the PAP stronghold.</p>
              <p>Macabre political intrigues followed the post-election excitement. Just before the election, he was detained without <a class="mw-redirect" title="Trial" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Trial"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">trial</span></span></a> under the <a title="Internal Security Act (Singapore)" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Internal_Security_Act_(Singapore)"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Internal Security Act</span></span></a> for 72 days, accused of having received funds from the United States and advice for the purpose of promoting <a title="Democracy" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Democracy"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">democracy</span></span></a> in Singapore. According to his account, he was subjected to <a title="Torture" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Torture"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">torture</span></span></a>, including <a title="Sleep deprivation" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Sleep_deprivation"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">sleep deprivation</span></span></a> and intense cold <a class="mw-redirect" title="Air-conditioning" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Air-conditioning"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">air-conditioning</span></span></a>. During the elections, he was criticised as being an American stooge. Later, while awaiting trial for alleged <a title="Tax avoidance and tax evasion" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Tax_avoidance_and_tax_evasion"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">tax evasion</span></span></a>, he left the country and was <a class="mw-redirect" title="Conviction (law)" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Conviction_(law)"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">convicted</span></span></a> <em><a title="In absentia" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/In_absentia"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">in absentia</span></span></a></em>. These events are alleged by many to have been politically motivated, and part of a pattern of <a title="Lawsuit" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Lawsuit"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">lawsuits</span></span></a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Criminal Law" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Criminal_Law"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">criminal</span></span></a> proceedings against dissenters in Singapore. Despite his exile he has spoken at events organized by Singapore student societies in universities outside of Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="mw-headline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Writings</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>Francis Seow tells his story in the <a title="Autobiography" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Autobiography"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">semi-autobiographical</span></span></a> <em>To Catch a Tartar: A Dissident in Lee Kuan Yew's prison</em>. In the book, Seow recounts his career in the legal service and his personal experience of being detained by the Internal Security Department. He also accuses the <a title="Government of Singapore" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Government_of_Singapore"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">government of Singapore</span></span></a> of <a title="Authoritarianism" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Authoritarianism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">authoritarianism</span></span></a> and <a title="Human rights" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Human_rights"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">human rights</span></span></a> abuses under Lee Kuan Yew. The book also contains a <a title="Foreword" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Foreword"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">foreword</span></span></a> by former Singapore President <a title="Devan Nair" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Devan_Nair"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Devan Nair</span></span></a> that is equally critical of the Singapore government. Since then Seow has written another book, <em>The Media Enthralled</em>, which describes how he believes the Singapore government undermined <a title="Freedom of the press" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">freedom of the media</span></span></a> and turned them into pro-government mouthpieces.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>In 1959, a Government Commission of Inquiry revealed that two sums of
                  money totalling $700,000 were transferred from New York to Mr Chew Swee
                  Kee, then Education Minister from the Singapore People's Alliance, the
                  ruling party led by Mr Lim Yew Hock, then Chief Minister.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>2.</p>
              <blockquote>Then in 1976, the Secretary-General of the People's Front, Mr Leong Mun
                  Kwai, who is still around today, revealed during Police's
                  investigations on the misappropriation of the People's Front's funds,
                  that he was given financial assistance and made use of by a
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;">neighbouring intelligence service</span> in a "black operation" against the
                  interests of Singapore.</blockquote>
              <p>3.</p>
              <blockquote>A more recent case was in 1988, when a US diplomat interfered in
                  Singapore's domestic politics. The diplomat actively cultivated Mr
                  Francis Seow. Mr Francis Seow was advised by the diplomat how to
                  establish a more effective opposition in Parliament and to set about
                  seriously to recruit more young professionals into the opposition. This
                  is gross interference in Singapore's domestic politics.</blockquote>
              <p>In the recent ISD 60th anniversary closed door dinner,Sept 2008,</p>
              <p>PM LHL  reminded SG people the incident of</p>

                                          contest the 1988 elections.</span></p>

              <p>I am interested to note the lifes of Subhas Anandan,Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>The later 2 left SG after ''politics'' incidents.</p>

              <p>in jail!!</p>
              <p>I respected Anandan.He claimed he was assused wrongly.</p>

              <blockquote>Legal eagle Subhas Anandan, 60, may not lace up in a literal fashion,
              but he does have first-hand knowledge of the remand system: In 1976,
              when he was a young lawyer, he was accused of being the leader of a
              secret society called the Black Eagles, and was subsequently thrown
              into Queenstown Remand Prison without trial.</blockquote><blockquote>,,,,,,,,<br></blockquote><blockquote>
              <p><strong>From prisoner to defender</strong><br> RECALLING his stint in remand prison in 1976, Mr Anandan says that his
              accusers were 'enemies' jealous of the fact that he was at the time the
              youngest president ever elected by his temple, Holy Tree Sri
              Balasubramaniam Temple in Yishun. They used the fact that he often
              mediated between warring gangsters to finger him as a secret society
              kingpin.</p>
              <p>'It was all twisted to show that I was a top gangster. The Corrupt
              Practices Investigation Bureau got involved to investigate, and it
              cleared me, of course. If it had not cleared me, I could not practise
              law now,' says Mr Anandan, who was defended by the late <span style="color: #ff0000;">David Marshall
              and Leo Fernando</span>, who represented him for free after hearing about his
              case through mutual acquaintances.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;">The 1987 detentions</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Most people familiar with the ISA
                      detentions of 1987 – of Francis Seow, Vincent Cheng and others –
                      would have grave reservations as to how credible the charges were.
                      Francis Seow, the former Solicitor General, has written about his
                      experiences and what he thinks were the government's motives: that of
                      intimidating political challengers. It is noteworthy that Seow's books
                      are not available in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">In them, he has described the Internal
                      Security Department's methods of interrogation: sleep deprivation,
                      extreme cold and information deprivation. The aim was to extract
                      confessions and incriminations of others. One could guess that the US is
                      probably doing likewise with their al Qaeda detainees, and when one is
                      trying to crack a shadowy network, this kind of information gathering,
                      rather than looking for hard evidence, may be all we have to go by. But
                      if the authority's motive is to "frame" others, it's all too
                      easy to fabricate incriminating confessions by these same coercive
                      means.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Malaysia too has an Internal Security Act
                      very similar to ours. In 1999, it was used by Prime Minister Mahathir to
                      detain Deputy PM Anwar Ibrahim. Most Malaysians, except diehard Mahathir
                      loyalists, are convinced that this was intended to eliminate Anwar as a
                      political rival.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">The other equally troubling aspect of
                      preventive detention, in Singapore's case, is that it can be indefinite.
                      <a name="return1"> Chia Thye Poh</a> <a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2002/yax-297.htm#foot1">[1]</a> was detained for 23 years till released in 1989. He had
                      been accused of being a communist agent. 23 years is virtually a
                      lifetime. What if the accusations had been ill-founded? <br></span></p>

              the PAP government came into power in 1959, the main threat was
              communism. That threat persisted till the end of the Cold War. In the
              articles by </span><span class="style381"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Rerceretnam</span></span><span lang="EN-AU"> and Cheong in this volume, we see that as late as 1987, Singaporeans
              were arrested on allegations of being communists. Without a trial
              brought against the supposed perpetrators of a ?Marxist conspiracy?,
              the plot was never judicially proven by the authorities. The Internal
              Security Act (ISA) is another highly undemocratic instrument that can
              be used to control legitimate political opposition - the ISA assumes
              that the arrested person is guilty even before they are tried. Francis
              Seow and Chia Thye Poh, are two people who have suffered from this kind
              of suppression: they were arrested under the ISA because it was
              supposed that they constituted a<span>  </span>serious threat to Singapore (see </span><span lang="EN-AU">Seow 1994)</span><span lang="EN-AU">. </span></span></p>

              experienced racial riots in the 1950s and 1960s. The Religious Harmony
              Act of 1990 sought to prevent people from spoiling the religious calm of<span>  </span>the city-state. This agenda is reflected in<span>  </span>Singapore?s
              electoral system, where most members of Parliament (MPs) are grouped
              together for election purposes in Group Representative Constituencies
              (GRCs).<span>  </span>Each GRC covers a bigger electoral division and is represented by three to six MPs. </span>At least one of the MPs in the group representing a GRC must belong to a minority racial community, that is a <span lang="EN-AU">non-Chinese </span><span lang="EN-AU">(Ooi 1998)</span><span lang="EN-AU">. Through these means the PAP has seized the high moral ground and any challenge to its<span>  </span>racial
              and religious policies will be attacked as an invitation to racial and
              religious hatred and instability. Opposition members have sometimes
              been framed as racist and<span>  </span>grave threats to Singapore?s
              racial harmony. A popular opposition figure, Tang Liang Hong, for
              instance, was accused of being a ?Chinese chauvinist? in the 1997
              general election </span><span lang="EN-AU">(Jeyaratnam 2003)</span><span lang="EN-AU">. In the run-up to the 2006 general election, the Workers? Party was accused of trying to destabilise Singapore?s
              multi-cultural harmony on the basis of its election manifesto. The
              party had suggested that the racial quota that ensured a particular
              racial mix in public housing estates be removed (Workers? Party 2006).
              This policy suggestion was based on any premise other than destroying
              racial harmony; rather it recognised that people should be free to
              purchase flats where they want and not be restrained by their
              ethnicity. The safe option is for opposition parties to avoid all
              references to any emotive issues about race and religion, even when
              their policy reforms seek to improve racial harmony and equity.<span>  </span>The mere mention of these issues, however, opens them up to attack regardless of their motives.<span>  </span>The result is that typically, Singapore?s
              policies on race and religion are never challenged. It is ironic that
              after more than 45 years of social engineering, the PAP government is
              convinced that it has not been successful in creating a population
              mature enough to freely discuss racial and religious issues in a
              democratic manner.<span>  </span></span></span></p>

Singapore is no exception. Singapore
              has a long history of feeling insecure of itself and in the region, but
              now a new preoccupation with Islamic extremism has emerged,
              strengthened perceptions of threats to stability. Located in the Malay
              World, Singapore is sandwiched between Indonesia - the world?s largest Muslim country - and Malaysia where the ethic Malays or <em>bumiputera</em> represent some 60 per cent of the population. As discussed by Cheong in
              this volume, 9/11 has increased the hand of authoritarianism in Singapore.<span>  </span>The government has acquired more powers to tackle this new threat with little concern for accountability or transparency. </span></span></p>

              2003, the Singaporean economy nose dived, as the country and region
              experienced the negative impact of SARS. The current on-going bird flu
              outbreaks around the world are also threatening Singapore?s
              economy. While these ?natural? threats have been handled well by the
              PAP government, these incidences are also public relations
              opportunities, as the articles by Jin et al. and Woodier in this volume
              show. The PAP has presented itself as the only party that can solve the
              country?s problems, including viral invasions. Given the media?s
              reluctance to report any negative stories about the government, the
              general political atmosphere under the PAP government feels like a

Temasek Holding, an investment vehicle of the Singapore government, has been acquiring assets and companies around the world as part of a diversification strategy to minimise Singapore?s dependence on the domestic economy. Many of Singapore?s biggest companies, such as Singapore Airlines and the DBS Bank, are in Temasek?s portfolio. With the constant reminder of Singapore?s
              economic vulnerability, it is difficult for many Singaporeans to
              conceive of an alternative to PAP?s successful management of the
              economy.<span>  </span></span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="EN-AU">Occasionally,
              the PAP and the government are embroiled in bad news. For instance,
              Choo Wee Khiang resigned as an PAP MP after he was found guilty of
              cheating in 1999. He was sentenced to two week jail and a fine (</span>Agence France-Presse, 7 June 1999)<span lang="EN-AU">. Choo is not the first or last case. PAP minister, Teh Cheang Wan committed suicide in 1987 because he was allegedly corrupt (<em>Sydney Morning Herald</em>,
              27 March 1987). These cases show that the PAP is not above the law, and
              not all their members are honest. Recently, the National Kidney
              Foundation ? a high profile, lauded charity ? was pushed into the news
              by the local newspapers, <em>The Straits Times.</em> The Chief Executive Officer of the charity, T.T. Durai, unsuccessfully sued the newspapers for libel. <em>The Straits Times</em> reported that donated monies were not properly used, and the
              allegations were proven to be true. The wife of former Prime Minister
              and current Senior Minister, Mrs Goh Chok Tong was the patron of the
              charity. The Minister of Health had to diffuse the public outcry by
              introducing more mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability
              in all charities. Bad publicity of this kind is rare for the PAP
              government compared to the large amount of negative publicity some
              opposition figures receive (see Gomez?s article in this volume). </span></span></p>

              fifty years after independence, and as a result of living under a one
              party authoritarian system, any Singaporeans have come to believe that
              the PAP represents the only feasible and workable government for Singapore. Singapore
              has to be vigilant against communist plots, racial and religious
              instability, terrorism, health epidemics and its economic vulnerability.<span>  </span>It
              is assumed that only the PAP is capable of delivering good results
              which underpin domestic stability while simultaneously providing for
              economic growth and increased living standards. The world economy has
              also come to recognise Singapore as one of the most competitive economies and attribute this to the PAP.<span>  </span>In these circumstances, a decrease in support for the PAP could be construed as the start of instability in Singapore.<span>  </span>The bulk of domestic and international opinion seems to be convinced that Singapore?s
              economic successes are directly attributable to the PAP and that the
              safest option is not to mess with a well functioning system. But not
              all Singaporeans are convinced that PAP, and the authoritarianism on
              which it depends, is the only answer.</span></span></p>

              part of the political game, the PAP needs to cripple its political
              challengers ? the opposition. The PAP is using a three-pronged approach
              to frame the opposition as ?risky? in Singaporean politics. With the
              first prong, it offers a successful development model for Singaporeans.
              As the discussion above shows, the PAP has defined the threats that Singapore
              faces and persuaded many that it is the only party that can mount an
              adequate response to them. The PAP argues that opposition parties are a
              risk, that they do not have the capacity to deal with these manifold
              threats, or they even question that such threats exist.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">With
              the second prong, the PAP government attempts to convince Singaporeans
              that they do not need a functioning multi-party democracy.<span>  </span>Despite this it is ironic to note that Singapore
              has more than twenty registered political parties. Most of these
              parties, however, do not represent genuine sectional interests - many
              of them are formed simply at election times. Any suggestion that Singapore
              should head in the direction of a genuinely more vibrant multi-party
              democracy continues to be rejected by the PAP on the pretext that Singapore has established its own, unique political system. It is said that a multi-party democracy is untenable in<span>  </span>a small country like Singapore. In contrasting to other Asian countries that are experimenting with democracy (eg the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia), the PAP government argues that Singapore cannot afford the inconveniences and inefficiencies of democracy. Furthermore, the PAP likes to project Singapore
              as being Asian and conservative. The political system reflects the
              values that Singaporeans hold, it is said; in such an ?Asian values
              system? the conflicts and turmoils of other democratic models are
              neither necessary nor desirable. And under the pretext of maintaining
              good political order, the Singapore opposition faces structural impediments to communicating with its potential electorate.<span>  </span>In
              his article in this volume, Gomez shows how the ruling party has tried
              to block free speech options to opposition parties. The lack of fair
              access to voters makes it difficult for opponents to convincingly
              challenge the PAP government. Instead, the opposition parties suffer
              from a large amount of negative publicity that they cannot overcome
              unless alternative communication avenues are opened up. For instance in
              the run up to the 2006 general elections, the PAP government announced
              that podcasting and vodcasting will not be allowed for campaigning.<span>  </span>These
              are both new technologies that several opposition parties and
              individual politicians had begun to develop and use to good effect (<em>The</em> <em>Straits Times</em>, 4 April 2006).
              Such barriers to communication are not healthy for the growth of a
              multi-party democracy but according to the PAP, Singaporeans do not
              need such as system. </span></span></p>

              the third prong, the PAP tries to convince Singaporeans that the
              Opposition is not capable of playing even the role of a good
              opposition, instead the PAP claims that it can function as its own
              opposition. In the 2006 general election, the PAP attempted to win back
              the only two opposition wards (out of a total of 83 wards). Senior
              Minister Goh Chok Tong suggested that if the PAP?s candidates should
              win back the Potong Pasir and Hougang constituencies, the candidates
              could ?play opposition? in Parliament. Goh suggested that the PAP party
              whip could be lifted specially for them, that is they would be allowed
              to go against party-line in Parliament</span><span class="font18b"> (<em>The Straits Times</em>, 27 March 2006). In another incident, a <em>Straits Times</em> journalist Peh Shing Huei was bemused that new PAP candidates for the
              2006 general election constantly highlighted their willingness to
              challenge the official party line,<span>  </span>as they tried to prove their ?rebel credentials? (<em>The Straits Times</em>, 29 March 2006).</span> The PAP is essentially trying to convince the electorate that the opposition is irrelevant in Singapore; the PAP can do the job of the opposition itself, in addition to acting as a wise government<span>  </span></span></p>

              sum up, the PAP is offering Singaporeans a no-risk approach to
              parliamentary democracy by arguing that it alone can represent all
              Singaporeans as both the government and opposition and in a manner that
              poses no risk to the country. Such a view, however, is controversial,
              unwise and unsustainable to people who believe that the best way of
              ensuring the effective functioning of a democracy is to set up
              appropriate institutions for it. . Such institutions need to include
              the full complement of democratic mechanisms and processes:<span>  </span>the
              separation of the legislative from the executive and judiciary, the
              countervailing powers of lobbies and opposition parties, and

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The politics of judicial institutions
              in Singapore</span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span>BY Francis T. Seow, former solicitor general of Singapore.
              <br> This is the text of a lecture given in Sydney, Australia in early 1997.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span>IN the past decade Singapore, along with the other newly
              industrialising countries of Asia, has been touted as an alternative model
              of economic development. Its high standard of living, measured in economic
              terms, and freedom from foreign debt, among other aspects, has been envied
              by less fortunate nations. More recently, features of Singapore society
              have been cited with approval by overseas commentators -- its law and order
              regime, compulsory savings, maintenance of parents legislation to compel
              children to look after their aged parents, to name a few. While these may
              be desirable, the manner of their implementation depends on certain anti-democratic
              and authoritarian structures and institutions. Today, I intend to look
              at one of these - the judicial institutions.</span></p>
              <p><span>I was astounded when my attention was first drawn to an
              October 1993 <em>Straits Times </em>banner-headlines,<em> Singapore's legal
              system rated best in world: Full confidence that justice will be fast and
              fair</em>. It was, the newspaper crowed, "the most authoritative report
              on competitiveness of selected developed and developing economies."</span></p>
              <p><span>The survey was purportedly carried out worldwide among
              18,000 business executives, who had expressed "full confidence in
              the ability of Singapore's judicial system to mete out justice in society."
              Out of 37 named countries, Singapore scored top place, Australia shared
              seventh place with Ireland, Malaysia fifteenth place, while the United
              States scored seventeenth place, and the United Kingdom, a sad and distant
              nineteenth place. The authority for this conclusion was the 1993 World
              Competitiveness Report, published by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum.
              This was the first time Singapore had scored top marks. Hence, the delirious
              headlines. As it seemed probable the World Economic Forum (WEF) knew something,
              which I did not, I wrote to it.</span></p>
              <p><span>I inquired the criteria used, and of the 18,000 persons
              purportedly surveyed, how many have had personal experience with Singapore's
              judicial system? And, if so, in what capacity and over what matter? Were
              they represented by any local and/or foreign lawyers? Whether the survey
              included any English QCs, especially those who had appeared before the
              Singapore courts?... Any American lawyers or academics who had observed
              legal proceedings in Singapore? And whether the survey included newspapermen.</span></p>
              <p><span>WEF explained that "... three criteria ... [had]
              been used to assess the ranking of the countries for ‘Justice and Security.’"<br> The three criteria were:<br> (1) serious crime: number of murders, violent crimes or armed robberies
              reported per 100,000 inhabitants; <br> (2) security, and <br> (3) justice. </span></p>
              <p><span>Of the three criteria, the third is germane to our discussion.
              I found its methodology flawed. Respondents were simply asked a bald question
              whether they had or had not full confidence in the fair administration
              of justice in Singapore -- Answer: Yes or No. No Singapore lawyers or litigants
              were apparently surveyed. How could these international business executives,
              ensconced in their air-conditioned executive suites, with little or no
              personal experience of Singapore's legal system, possibly give valued conclusions
              on the administration of justice in Singapore?</span></p>
              <p><strong>True picture:<br> <br> </strong><span>NOW to draw aside the curtain, to show you the true picture.
              Some history is needed to show how the legal system was systematically
              undermined by the prime minister after the People’s Action Party (PAP),
              came into power in June 1959. The senior crown counsel, Ahmad Ibrahim,
              was promoted over the solicitor general, A.V. Winslow, to the top office
              of attorney general. Ahmad Ibrahim was a Muslim, and his presence was useful
              to the prime minister, whose political objectives included merger with
              Malaya. A.V. Winslow, on the other hand, was a Ceylon Tamil, the first
              Singaporean in the colonial legal service to reach its topmost rung. The
              prime minister, however, saw him as too closely tied to the old colonial
              administration, and therefore politically unreliable. Several years later,
              Winslow was elevated to the high court bench but, significantly, was never
              assigned to try sensitive cases.</span></p>
              <p><span>Meanwhile, Ahmad Ibrahim -- who had become a political
              liability but whose tenure of office was protected under the constitution
              -- was sent overseas as ambassador to the United Arab Republic. This lateral
              promotion is reminiscent of the practice of Chinese emperors getting rid
              of awkward officials by sending them out to govern the far-flung provinces.</span></p>
              <p><span>Another significant move was the designation of Justice
              Wee Chong Jin -- a relatively recent recruit from the bar -- as chief justice
              over the more experienced acting incumbent. Like Winslow, he was also identified
              with the old order. Wee's political acuity and industry had recommended
              themselves to the prime minister, who once again ignored the claims of
              seniority and experience to further his political agenda.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Sudden transfer:<br> <br> </strong><span>THE sudden transfer in 1986 of senior district judge,
              Michael Khoo -- one of the ablest judges to grace the subordinate court
              bench -- to the attorney general's chambers following his acquittal of
              <a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/jeyapage.htm">Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam,</a> an opposition
              MP, and, more significantly, the prime minister's political <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bêtre
              noire</span>, (Among the many colourful epithets were: "hustler",
              "skunk", "mangy dog", "charlatan", and "political
              riff-raff". Hansard, Parliamentary debates, March 19, 1986, cols.
              688-689, 720.) on all politically-inspired charges, save one, of financial
              impropriety, engendered much controversy. From being the respected head
              of the subordinate judiciary, Khoo overnight became a mere digit within
              the attorney general's chambers. </span></p>
              <p><span>The prosecution appealed the acquittal. The chief justice
              allowed the appeal with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unusual</span> instruction for it to be retried
              before another district judge. Jeyaretnam's application for the retrial
              to be heard before a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">high court</span> judge to enable him to appeal to
              the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council -- Singapore’s ultimate court
              of appeal in London -- was refused. At the re-trial, he was predictably
              found guilty, and convicted. His appeal against the conviction and sentence
              was heard by Justice Lai Kew Chai, who dismissed his appeal, and varied
              the sentence to month’s imprisonment, plus a fine, which was high enough
              to disqualify him from sitting in parliament.</span></p>
              <p><span>Meanwhile, Jeyaretnam alleged in parliament that Khoo's
              transfer had caused "public disquiet," implying that it had been
              motivated by political considerations, which he expanded to include both
              the chief justice and the attorney general, as being "beholden"
              to the prime minister for having extended their respective appointments
              beyond their legal retirement age. In a rancorous parliamentary debate,
              it emerged that Khoo's transfer was not a "routine departmental transfer,"
              as claimed by the prime minister. In the result, Jeyaretnam was expelled
              from parliament, and disbarred from law practice.</span></p>
              <p><span>Jeyaretnam appealed the disbarment to the privy council,
              which, in allowing the appeal, roundly castigated the chief justice and
              the Singapore courts for their legal reasoning. It was a telling indictment
              of Singapore’s courts. The privy council held that two innocent persons
              had suffered a grievous injustice -- fined, imprisoned and publicly disgraced
              for offences of which they were not guilty.</span></p>
              <p><span>This was the same privy council, which the prime minister
              had earlier praised as the acme of Singapore's judicial independence, when
              he cautioned future PAP governments against interfering with its status
              in the judicial infrastructure:</span></p>
              <p><span> "I can only express the hope that faith in
              the judicial system will never be diminished, and I am sure it will not,
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">so long as we allow a review of the judicial processes that takes place
              here in some other tribunal where obviously undue influence cannot be brought
              to bear. As long as governments are wise enough to leave alone the rights
              of appeal to some superior body outside Singapore, then there must be a
              higher degree of confidence in the integrity of our judicial process. This
              is most important. (Author's underlining)"</span> Lee Kuan Yew in parliament,
              March 15, 1967.</span></p>
              <p><span> This sentiment was also echoed by the minister for
              law, S. Jayakumar, who -- in a blunt reference to Jeyaretnam's series of
              legal failures, dismissed his remarks as the "jaundiced view of a
              person who has not had satisfaction in the courts as he would have liked"
              -- asked: "How many countries are there in the world that he can refer
              to where there are appeals to the privy council in criminal and civil cases
              ... other than Singapore? That is the litmus test of our judicial system's
              independence."</span></p>
              <p><span>The judgment of the privy council reflected severely on
              the integrity of the Singapore judiciary -- and was seen by many as solemn
              confirmation of their own unspoken misgivings about its independence. Any
              other government -- to use an Americanism -- would have rolled with the
              punch but this was a government whose sensitivity to criticism was proverbial.
              As long as the privy council handed down judgments supportive of the prime
              minister and his government, its status at the apex of Singapore’s judicial
              infrastructure was inviolable. With that crucial decision, the privy council
              sealed its own doom. The minister for law, ignoring his previous rhetoric,
              moved in parliament for the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council decrying
              it as being "interventionist" and "out of touch" with
              local conditions -- a decrial questionable both in law and in taste.</span></p>
              <p><span>Asked about the abolition of the privy council, Goh Chok
              Tong -- who had succeeded to the premiership in 1990 -- responded that,
              in allowing Jeyaretnam's appeal against his disbarment, the privy council
              had "gone outside its prescribed role" and was "playing
              politics." It was a disgraceful statement, as well as wilful contempt
              of Singapore's own superior court, but as Juvenal -- the Roman satirist
              -- once said: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? </span>(Who will guard the
              guards themselves?) Implicit in Goh's contemptible statement was that the
              PAP government could no longer afford the hard political currency of a
              free and independent court. The Jeyaretnam case is unsurpassed for the
              pathetic attempts by the Singapore courts to stretch the law to fit the
              facts. It highlights the grotesque contortions the politically corrupt
              judiciary went through to rid a political irritant to the prime minister
              and his government. It demonstrates the misuse of the law in advancing
              the agenda and interests of the ruling political party.<br> <br> </span><strong>Government spin:</strong></p>
              <p><span>THE Singapore government often puts a spin on the Jeyaretnam
              judgment claiming that the privy council had no jurisdiction over the convictions
              insinuating that it was out of line in making that statement, as the ‘party
              most affected -- Singapore’s public prosecutor -- was not heard on the
              matter.’ That is only half of the truth. What it failed to disclose is
              that the public prosecutor was asked whether he wished to be heard. But
              the public prosecutor chose not to appear. An <span style="text-decoration: underline;">obiter dicta</span> -- and,
              more especially that of the privy council -- would normally have been sufficient
              to propel a government to correct an obvious injustice -- but this was
              no ordinary case.</span></p>
              <p><span>To counter public perception that the judiciary was inclined
              towards the executive, the chief justice was perforce to publicly address
              this matter:</span></p>
              <p><span> It is our responsibility to let there be no shadow
              of doubt whatsoever that we are committed to these two principles -- the
              total commitment of the judiciary in Singapore to dispensing justice according
              to law, and to upholding the independence of the judiciary -- and to dispel
              as forcefully as lies within our power any attempt from any quarter to
              cast doubt that these two principles are being adhered to here.</span></p>
              <p><span> There was, alas, a vast chasm separating the precept
              from the practice.</span></p>
              <p><span> The attorney general also sought to show that the
              administration of justice was impartial by stressing the supervisory jurisdiction
              of the courts, thus:</span></p>
              <p><span> [The] impartial and unbiased administration of the
              law in all matters, particularly in respect of those matters requiring
              strict observance of the rules of natural justice, and in respect of matters
              where the exercise of administrative discretion has been challenged, is
              the cornerstone upon which our system of justice has been constructed.
              Those charged with the functions of the government, in all their wide diversity,
              know full well that ultimately there can be recourse to these courts to
              correct irregularities and injustices in governmental administration. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">As
              in all countries where the rule of law prevails, it is [the] exercise of
              the court's supervisory jurisdiction that provides one of the most important
              safeguards against the arbitrary exercise of power</span>. [Author's underlining]<br>  </span></p>
              <p><span>In stressing the supervisory powers of the courts as the
              capstone of democracy, the attorney general overlooked the egregious fact
              that he had argued in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">habeas corpus</span> applications that orders of
              detention under the Internal Security Act, Cap. 143 -- a law which allows
              preventive detention on grounds of national security -- were not justiciable.
              Notwithstanding the inconsistencies and contradictions in the official
              statements, he argued the court could "not look behind the orders,"
              and "inquire into the reasons why and wherefore a detention order
              is made. This is an executive act." The court for its part willingly
              abdicated its judicial responsibility in favour of officialdom rather than
              the cause of justice.</span></p>
              <p><span>The attorney general later drafted the amending legislation
              depriving the courts of their supervisory jurisdiction, which was -- in
              his own words -- "one of the most important safeguards against the
              exercise of arbitrary power." But there was not a squeak of protest
              from the complaisant judiciary or the legal profession. In the result,
              applications against administrative actions, like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">habeas corpus,</span> are now largely legal history.<br> <br> </span><strong>Judicial accommodation:</strong></p>
              <p><span>ANOTHER instance of judicial accommodation may be seen
              in this case. In 1987, twenty-two young Roman Catholic and social activists
              were arrested under the Internal Security Act (ISA), accused of being Marxists
              involved in a dangerous conspiracy to subvert the PAP government through
              violence, and replace it with a Marxist state. They were released only
              after they had made the ritualistic television confessions. But eight of
              them were re-arrested when they disclosed those confessions had been coerced
              out of them. In the ensuing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">habeas corpus</span> proceedings, the court
              of appeal had perforce to allow the appeal, but it did so on technical
              rather than on substantive grounds, thus enabling the government to hurriedly
              amend the constitution and the relevant laws, and order their re-arrest.</span></p>
              <p><span>Another egregious example of judicial accommodation is
              the case of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Re Dow Jones Publishing Company (Asia) Inc Application</span>,
              where the court of appeal deliberately delayed giving its decision, which
              had the effect of denying the appellant the opportunity of pursuing its
              appeal to the Privy Council. Queen’s Counsel for the appellant flew down
              specially from England to plead with the court to rule on its application,
              and give its decision later, but in neither one nor the other would the
              court be hurried. In the result, the appellant lost its right to appeal
              to the Privy Council. The appellant desperately tried to petition the privy
              council for special leave to appeal, which said:</span></p>
              <p><span>Their lordships understand the petitioner's sense of grievance
              that, after the appeal from the judgment of Sinnathuray, J., had been argued
              and at a time when it was known that the [Judicial Committee of the Privy
              Council Amendment] Act of 1989 would shortly come into operation, the court
              of appeal in Singapore did not accede to an invitation to give their decision
              promptly, if necessary giving their reasons later, which would have enabled
              the petitioner to take advantage of the transitional provisions in the
              Act of 1989. ...</span></p>
              <p><span>Those gentle words of reproach spoke volumes for a free
              and independent judiciary.<br> <br> </span><strong>Consequential role:<br> <br> </strong><span>THE judiciary -- a bulwark between citizen and state
              -- plays a consequential role in the affairs of a nation, and often sets
              the ultimate seal of legitimacy on controversial policies and actions of
              the state by its decisions. Governments, therefore, try to ensure those
              persons, who are called upon to make these weighty decisions, understand
              the purpose of controverted legislative acts and policies. The PAP government
              is no exception. It also tries to ensure that judicial aspirants are screened
              for loyalty and political correctness. Although the PAP government recognizes
              the role of the judiciary in the body politic, it no longer sees it as
              a check on the balance of power in the traditional sense but rather as
              an important instrument for the prolongation of its political longevity.</span></p>
              <p><span>High court judges are appointed from within the legal
              and judicial service and among qualified members of the bar by the president
              on the advice of the prime minister after consultation with the chief justice.
              Judges hold their appointment until the age of 65 years and thereafter
              at the will of the president. For many years, retiring high court judges
              have had their appointments extended on contract for short periods at a
              time and, in some cases, from month to month. Judicial commissioners are
              employed on time contract. Some do, indeed, make the grade to the high
              court bench. Needless to say, judges on contract, renewable at the will
              of the prime minister, is not conducive to judicial independence. </span></p>
              <p><span>Judgments of the appellate court have to be unanimous,
              and are delivered by a single judge detailed by the chief justice beforehand.
              No dissension is countenanced lest a perception is created of disunity
              within the judicial ranks. Cases are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">allocated</span> to judges by the
              registrar of the supreme court, on chief justice’s instructions, and not
              rotated, or drawn by lots, or channelled to special divisions of the court.
              Thus, it is not uncommon to find a particular judge, like T.S. Sinnathuray,
              being commonly assigned sensitive cases with predictable results. Judges
              known for impartiality, independence and strength of character are never
              assigned them. </span></p>
              <p><strong>Banker friend:<br> <br> </strong><span>THE then prime minister Lee appointed his banker-friend,
              Yong Pung How, as chief justice, who had not practised law for 20 years,
              whose superior claim to this illustrious position was that he is a loyal
              crony. His hour-long defence of the appointment in parliament -- during
              which he delved into bathetic nostalgia, from his student's days at Cambridge
              University, to the way his friend, the future chief justice, kept meticulous
              lecture notes enabling him, a late arrival at Cambridge, to borrow his
              notes to catch up with his law studies; to his personal wealth and magnitude
              of annual income as banker; to his personal attributes, including a fine
              judicial temperament; and to his inquiries of his judges to name the three
              best persons, excluding themselves, all of whom, in a remarkable coincidence,
              named his friend, as "the best of the possibles" -- rang somewhat
              hollow and contrived.</span></p>
              <p><span>Adequate economic monthly salaries payable to judges have
              long been recognized as a condition conducive to a free and independent
              judiciary. The Judges’ Remuneration Act, 1994, provides that ‘pensionable
              salaries of the chief justice, every judge of appeal and every other judge
              of the supreme court’ shall be paid as the minister of finance may from
              time to time direct.’ This radical but retrogressive change in the law
              ensures that such payments no longer rests with parliament, making the
              judiciary dependent on the executive of the day for their paychecks.</span></p>
              <p><span>The salaries, which the PAP government pays its judges,
              have much method in its generosity. High court judges receive A$630,000
              per annum plus a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">minimum</span> bonus of three months' salary or A$205,020
              at A$68,340 per month, totalling A$835,020, besides other perks and privileges,
              like a motor car, a government bungalow at economic rent. The chief justice
              receives A$1,260,000 per annum, besides an official residence (or an housing
              allowance in lieu thereof), a chauffeur-driven car, among other handsome
              perks and privileges of office. Indeed, he receives more than the combined
              stipends of the Lord Chancellor of England, the Chief Justices of the United
              States, Canada and Australia. As a Queen’s Counsel pointedly queried: "Is
              this kind of money a salary or an income of permanent bribery?</span></p>
              <p><span>Supremely confident in the reliability of his judiciary,
              the prime minister uses the courts as a legal weapon to intimidate, bankrupt
              or cripple the political opposition, and ventilate his political agenda.
              He has distinguished himself in numerous legal suits against dissidents
              and detractors for alleged defamation in Singapore courts, and has won
              them all. The idea that he could possibly lose is so fanciful that it could
              be dismissed out of mind. Which judge would be so reckless or foolhardy
              to award a decision against him? Judges know on which side their bread
              is buttered.<br> <br> </span><strong>'Compliant judiciary':</strong></p>
              <p><span>CONTRAST the case of former NUS senior lecturer, Christopher
              Lingle, who wrote an op-ed essay entitled,<a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/1028ling"> </a><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/1028ling.htm"><em>The
              Smoke over Parts of Asia Obscures Some Profound Concerns</em>,</a> in the
              <em>International Herald Tribune,</em> with that of columnist Bernard Levin,
              who published a hard-hitting essay, <em>The law grossly misused</em>, in
              <em>The Times</em> of London. Lingle had referred to ‘intolerant regimes’
              in the region relying upon a ‘compliant judiciary to bankrupt opposition
              politicians in suppressing dissent.’ No country was named. Nonetheless,
              he was sued for defamation. The prime minister went out of his way to prove
              that it was Singapore that Lingle had referred to, by citing a litany of
              legal cases which he had brought against opposition politicians and dissidents.
              Lingle fled Singapore. Even his NUS pensions savings were attached to pay
              towards the prime minister’s damages and costs.</span></p>
              <p><span>Bernard Levin’s case, on the other hand, shows that no
              matter how grave the provocation, the prime minister does not easily embark
              on litigation outside his own bailiwick. Levin, a highly-respected columnist
              with<em> The Times</em>, had published two other hard-hitting op-ed essays
              on Singapore, regarding which the prime minister complained in a letter
              to the editor of <em>The Times </em>as "`unrestrained indictment' of
              my premiership ... and is false in so many respects ... so unfair, and
              indeed irresponsible as a piece of journalism ... Just as he [Levin] makes
              the outrageous allegation that judges in Singapore are `bent or cowed',
              ..."</span></p>
              <p><span>In spite of all this, the prime minister did not see it
              fit to sue nor even threaten to sue Levin or <em>The Times</em> for defamation.
              Instead, he offered to "discuss" those allegations with Levin
              in a debate on British television. Levin refused the proposed discussion.
              It does not require any great leap of imagination to realise that the prime
              minister knew that he could not influence their lordships at the Royal
              Courts of Justice in the Strand. Like Sun Tzu, the celebrated Chinese military
              strategist, he knows his ground, and chooses it with care.</span></p>
              <p><span>The notorious case of Public Prosecutor v Tan Wah Piow
              demonstrates the parlous state of the judiciary in Singapore. Tan -- a
              third-year architectural student, and president of the University of Singapore
              Students Union (USSU) -- was charged, together with two others, with rioting
              inside the premises of the Pioneer Industries Employees' Union (PIEU),
              a government-controlled trade union, whose general secretary was Phey Yew
              Kok, a member of parliament and rising star on the PAP firmament. Phey
              was also president of the National Trades Union Congress, which has strong
              symbiotic ties with the PAP government.</span></p>
              <p><span>The trial was partisan justice at its ugliest before the
              ambitious district court judge T.S. Sinnathuray, who kept Tan and his co-accused
              on a choke-leash. Tan's application for an adjournment to enable his counsel,
              John Platts-Mills, QC -- who had already been specially admitted to the
              Singapore bar -- to travel to Singapore for the purpose was twice denied
              by the trial judge. Vital defence witnesses were arrested on the morning
              of the trial, and deported.</span></p>
              <p><span>The defendants claimed the riot within, and damage to,
              the premises had been fabricated by Phey Yew Kok, but they were not allowed
              to produce evidence of it at the trial, as indeed other matters they considered
              crucial to their case. Concerned at the judge's selective recordings of
              the proceedings, Tan applied for the trial to be tape-recorded, which was
              denied. The judge for his part made no bones of what the outcome of the
              proceedings would be. His periodic ejaculations, "Forget about public
              interest!", "Forget about justice!", and "Forget about
              a fair trial!" -- albeit vented in exasperation to Tan's urgent applications
              or protestations to his rulings -- punctuated the proceedings, setting
              a leitmotif, which became a grim reality. All three accused were found
              guilty, and convicted. Tan was sentenced to one year's imprisonment, and
              his co-accused to one month's imprisonment each. Shortly afterwards, Sinnathuray
              was promoted to the high court. </span></p>
              <p><span>An Australian Queen's Counsel, Frank Galbally, who observed
              the trial for the Australian Union of Students, said: "In Australia,
              the case would be laughed out of court ... the evidence and procedure ...
              would, in my opinion, have aborted any trial in Australia ... [The three
              accused] did not get a fair trial. ... In my opinion, it is just a political
              trial." </span></p>
              <p><span>The experience of an English silk in a criminal trial
              in Singapore provides another perspective. Alun Jones, QC, discharged himself
              "for the first time in 23 years' practice," describing the judicial
              proceedings as "a travesty of a trial" and a "perversion
              of a judicial process." The trial judge displayed a "craven attitude"
              towards the prosecution.<br> <br> </span><strong>Political interests</strong><span>:</span></p>
              <p><span>THE New York City Bar Association, after a fact-finding
              mission to Singapore led by the late Robert B. McKay, then dean of the
              New York University Law School, observed:</span></p>
              <p><span> What emerges ... is a government that has been willing
              to decimate the rule of law for the benefit of its political interests.
              Lawyers have been cowed to passivity, judges are kept on a short leash,
              and the law has been manipulated so that gaping holes exist in the system
              of restraints on government action toward the individual. ... Any US venture
              contemplating business in Singapore or with a Singapore company is likely
              to encounter a wide variety of enterprises in which the government has
              an economic interest. If a dispute arises with such an enterprise, the
              US company faces the prospect of a law suit before Singapore's judiciary.
              The same forces which have led that judiciary to be sensitive to the PAP
              government's political interests would lead it to take account of its economic
              interests. ... The only check on the Singapore judiciary is the prospect
              of ultimate appeal to the Privy Council in London.</span></p>
              <p><span> That report was published in October 1990. Since
              then, appeals to the privy council have been abolished. The supervisory
              powers of the courts have been removed.<br> <br> </span><strong>HPL issue:</strong></p>
              <p><span>LAST but one. The recent barrage of defamation actions
              by senior minister Lee Kuan Yew and other PAP leaders against lawyer and
              opposition Workers’ Party candidate, Tang Liang Hong, reveals further the
              politics of the Singapore judiciary.</span></p>
              <p><span>HPL -- Hotels and Properties Limited -- is a public company
              listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore. One of its directors, Dr Lee
              Suan Yew -- a younger brother of Harry Lee Kuan Yew, the senior minister
              -- and one other bought a luxury condominium unit in an HPL development.
              As they were ‘connected persons and associates,’ HPL was enjoined under
              the rules of the Stock Exchange to seek shareholders’ approval for sales
              of the units to them. It did not do so. Some 11 months elapsed. Several
              disgruntled shareholders served notice of their intention to call a shareholders’
              meeting. To thwart unpleasant publicity, HPL sought waiver of the rule
              from the Stock Exchange, which, on April 22, 1996, censured the directors
              and reminded them of their duty to ‘maximise the return to shareholders.’
              It was, therefore, only a matter of time before the identities of any other
              purchasers, who had also been given similar discounts, became known to
              all and sundry.</span></p>
              <p><span>On April 23, 1996, the following day -- to pre-empt the
              inevitable adverse publicity -- senior minister Lee Kuan Yew and his son
              and deputy prime minister Brig Gen Lee Hsien Loong disclosed that they,
              too, had each purchased a unit in NassimJade/Scotts Road No. 28, at discounted
              prices, and paid the discounts they had received into government Treasury.</span></p>
              <p><span>An informal inquiry, conducted by the minister for finance,
              assisted by a MAS -- Monetary Authority of Singapore -- deputy managing
              director, at the behest of Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, purported to clear
              them of any impropriety. Prime Minister Goh ordered Treasury to return
              the difference to father and son, which they gave to charity instead. It
              is not impertinent to ask why did the senior minister and his son, the
              deputy prime minister, consider it necessary to divest themselves of the
              proceeds, if the purchase was above board!</span></p>
              <p><span>Parliament was convened to enable members to ask questions
              of the senior minister, whose rambling defence of those controversial purchases
              has to be seen, heard and read to be believed for sheer arrogance and obfuscation.
              Even so, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong introduced new rules requiring ministers
              to declare all property purchases, including prices, discounts and preferential
              terms received. There, the matter rested, until Tang was interviewed by
              the Hongkong-based Chinese weekly magazine, Yazhou Zhoukan. In that fateful
              interview, Tang observed: </span></p>
              <p><span>"Why wasn’t this matter handed over to a professional
              body like Commercial Affairs Department or Corrupt Practice Investigation
              Bureau? They are government departments not only rich in experience, but
              are also well-known for being iron-faced with selflessness" [a Chinese
              phrase meaning firm and impartial]. They would be more detached and their
              reports would have been more convincing to the people. Koh Beng Seng and
              Finance Minister Richard Hu are after all not experts in this field." </span></p>
              <p><span> Lee and his son took offence at those remarks, and
              commenced a libel action. The presiding judge was Justice Lai Kew Chai,
              a former partner of the prime minister’s law firm of Lee and Lee.<br> <br> </span><strong>Defamation writs:</strong></p>
              <p><span>PENDING the hearing,<a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/tangbck.htm"> Tang Liang
              Hong</a> stood as an opposition Workers’ Party (WP) candidate in the January
              1997 general election, during which Lee and his PAP colleagues accused
              him of being an ‘anti-Christian and anti-English-educated Chinese chauvinist.’
              Tang retorted they were lies. And made a cardinal error in announcing that,
              if elected, he would raise the HPL matter in parliament. Lee and his colleagues
              responded by filing defamation writs against Tang for calling them liars.
              Tang made a police report against them alleging a conspiracy to defame
              and cause him harm only to be met with further defamation suits totalling
              12 in all. On December 31, 1996, they filed their writs which were served
              on him the same day. It was not a season for good will among men. Significantly,
              only Tang was sued. None of the mass media, which reported the alleged
              libel, was sued at all. Justice Lai presided over all those cases, and
              issued several orders touching the suits, including on Lee’s application,
              a Mareva injunction freezing Tang’s and his wife’s assets in Singapore
              and elsewhere.</span></p>
              <p><span>Tang applied to have Lai disqualified as the presiding
              judge and the several orders in the various suits, including the Mareva
              injunction, be set aside. It transpired that Justice Lai had also purchased
              a unit in the same HPL Nassim Jade development together with his wife,
              at even deeper discount than the Lees. It was contended that one of the
              issues for determination at the trial would be the propriety of HPL giving
              large discounts to persons holding high positions in government and other
              public institutions, and whether HPL, as a public-listed company, had discharged
              its duty to its shareholders to obtain the best price for its property
              development in the circumstances. And, therefore, Justice Lai’s purchase
              of the HPL unit could be in issue.</span></p>
              <p><span>Conceding that ‘some people might question if he should
              be ruling on a matter which concerned himself,’ Justice Lai observed that
              Tang could ‘have recourse to a court of appeal if he disagreed with the
              ruling.’ Thus, he did not recuse himself from the case, but cleared the
              court, heard the application in camera, and ordered Tang to appear before
              him at the adjourned hearing because of ‘factual errors,’ chiding him for
              not ‘hav[ing] the courage or decency to face him in court ...’</span></p>
              <p><span>As for the Mareva injunction, there was no evidence that
              Tang had done anything in regard to them, which could be construed as attempts
              to defeat any possible judgment against him, save for his temporary presence
              in Malaysia, and Lee’s bare allegations: "I was baffled. He [Tang]
              claimed that his life was under threat. But of all places he went to Johor.
              That place is notorious for shootings, muggings and car-jackings."
              It was -- to put it kindly -- sheer hyperbole. When it was revealed what
              Lee had deposed to in his supporting affidavit, it<a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/malaysia.htm"> upset the Malaysian government</a> and its people. Lee apologised ‘unreservedly’
              through his press secretary, but made no retraction, pleading that it was
              not meant to be made public. In any event, no reasonable judge, it is submitted,
              would have allowed such a sweeping scandalous assertion to ground the application.
              Under increasing Malaysian pressure, Lee finally retracted the offending
              paragraph -- and, in the process, opened a Pandora box as to the legal
              effects of the several orders and the judgments. The effects of this case
              are still rippling beyond the shores of Singapore. </span></p>

              (1.76 per 100,000) is in fact lower than that of Singapore (1.77 per 100,000).
              But the rate for total assaults in Singapore (34.12 per 100,000) is more
              than twice that of Malaysia (14.54 per 100,000), while the rate for robberies
              is almost twice as high in Singapore as in Malaysia (56.30 for Singapore
              against 32.75 for Malaysia).</span></p>
              <p><span>On March 10 -- two months and eleven days -- Lee and his
              colleagues obtained judgments against him in the 12 suits estimated at
              S$12 million in damages, excluding costs. In an unprecedented move, two
              high court judges sat in succession to determine the matter -- Justice
              Lai from 2.30 pm until 8 pm on Tang’s application to recuse himself, immediately
              after which the case was assigned to Justice Goh Joon Seng, who sat till
              well past 9 pm, struck out all Tang’s defences, and awarded judgments to
              Lee and his colleagues. The 13th suit filed by Prime Minister Goh Chok
              Tong was heard the next day. <br> <br> </span>'<strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Instant justice':<br> <br> </span></strong><span>JUSTICE was swift but was it fair? Lee and his
              political colleagues had no difficulty in filing any application in court,
              their papers were served and heard the same day -- a privilege and sense
              of urgency, however, denied to Tang and his wife, who had been dragged
              into the proceedings. Tang described it as PAP’s ‘instant justice.’ ‘They
              can easily get instant judgment on pre-set terms.’ When his wife applied
              to set aside what Tang termed the ‘absurd’ order making her a co-defendant
              to the suits against him, her application was set down for hearing one
              month away. In all my years at the bar, I have rarely seen such purposeful
              judicial industry. Tang’s complaint of selective justice is by no means
              an isolated case. There are others. I have recounted similar experiences
              in my book, <em><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/books.html">To Catch a Tartar: A Dissident in
              Lee Kuan Yew’s Prison.</a></em></span></p>
              <p><span>In a 40-page impassioned judgment Justice Lai dismissed
              Tang’s application, describing his allegations as ‘false,’ and ‘a move
              calculated to delay the proceedings. ... In the process, he muddied the
              waters and spread a lot of poison against me, senior minister Lee and deputy
              prime minister Lee Hsien Loong. He was so mendacious that he did not care
              at all if the reputations of a judge, senior minister Lee and deputy prime
              minister Lee were unjustifiably attacked and sullied. It was a vicious,
              collateral and totally unwarranted attack on my integrity. ... [Tang] appeared
              to be speaking from two ends of his mouth at the same time. ... In his
              absence from court, there was no opportunity to test his veracity.’</span></p>
              <p><span>[Editor's note: See: <a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/tangpage.htm">Tang's
              appeal</a>]</span></p>
              <p><span>Let me recall to mind the dreadful words of Dr Joseph
              Goebbels, Hitler’s notorious minister of propaganda: "Justice must
              not become the mistress of the state, but must be the servant of state
              policy". Those words could just as well have been spoken by Harry
              Lee Kuan Yew or by any one of the PAP ministers. For Singapore’s judiciary
              is well on its way to this Goebbelsian utopia.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Superb illustration:</strong></p>
              <p><span>THE situation is replicated in the subordinate courts.
              My case provides a superb illustration. After a date for mention had been
              fixed in open court, and counsel departed the court building, an embarrassed
              registrar cancelled it on higher instructions, and, ignoring the congested
              court calendar, brought the case forward over strenuous objections of counsel
              -- who had been summoned to return to court -- to dovetail the new date
              with the forthcoming general election -- which the prime minister had secretly
              fixed, but had not yet announced. As it originally stood, the trial would
              have taken place long after the general election was over. The fact of
              the trial was critical as election fodder to the PAP government, and as
              damper on the growing groundswell of support for me. Indeed, during the
              election, voters were warned it was "useless" to vote for me,
              for, if elected, I would have to vacate my seat since I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would be</span> convicted. This was exactly what happened! You may think it was an amazing
              display of the PAP government's faith in the infallibility of its judges!</span></p>
              <p><span>Be that as it may, counsel applied to the high court for
              an urgent revision of the registrar's decision, after prevailing upon a
              reluctant supreme court registry to accept the requisite motion papers.
              By a strange coincidence, the emergency judge for that day was the ineluctable
              Sinnathuray, who was not available. After a long wait, it became painfully
              obvious that he was not overly anxious to hear the motion. Counsel was
              advised to leave the registry and await word of the judge's availability.
              No word came through that whole day. Upon inquiry the next morning, counsel
              was tersely informed that the ever-reliable judge Sinnathuray had dismissed
              the application. It illustrates the obstacles which beset dissidents who
              seek justice in the courts. The manipulation of court calendars to suit
              the prosecution's hidden agenda is well-known in the profession.</span></p>

              go away, but I heard it again, and some noises outside the house. I woke
              Peter and he went to the door. </em></p>
              <p><em>I saw flashing lights and some people outside. One of them said that
              they were searching for illegal immigrants and showed his badge. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He also
              said that he was from Joo Chiat Police Station. I felt fear and knew that
              they were Internal Security Department (ISD) officers.</span> </em></p>
              <p><em>Peter opened the door and let in the four officers, three Chinese males
              and one female. He carried a sack. Once inside, a Chinese in his early
              40s asked whether I was Tang Fong Har. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I nodded yes, and he told me that
