              <p>MORE than one in five of the top students from the 1996-1999 A
                                  level graduating cohorts are not working in Singapore today. And of
                                  those from the same batches who went on to universities overseas
                                  without a scholarship bond, more than one in three are today carving
                                  out careers outside the country.</p>
              <p>Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong gave these statistics on Saturday to
                                  illustrate the urgency of getting young Singaporeans to sink roots here
                                  even as they become more entrepreneurial and break out into the global
                                  economy.</p>
              <p>'If more and more of our bright students do not return, this begs
                                  the question whether our success in giving them wings to fly far and
                                  high will result in our eventual decline as a nation, especially as we
                                  are not even reproducing ourselves.</p>
              <p>'No nation will be able to sustain its growth and prosperity
                                  without sufficient talent, much less a small country like Singapore
                                  without natural resources,' said Mr Goh.</p>
              <p>He was speaking to more than 1,000 guests at the 70th anniversary
                                  dinner of Chung Cheng High School last night.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> He urged schools to help
                                  students retain their emotional bonds to Singapore, 'so that they think
                                  of Singapore as the home which nurtured them, and want to contribute in
                                  some ways to the country of their birth'.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>To do this, he suggested that schools inculcate in the young
                                  certain values, such as being appreciative of those who help them
                                  advance in life; and not taking for granted the academic, sports and
                                  arts programmes they can enjoy here and abroad, when many children
                                  elsewhere cannot.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Mr Goh hoped that the end result of such teaching would be students
                                  who have strong links with their schools, close ties with their friends
                                  and a strong sense of responsibility to their families - even if they
                                  choose to live, work and even settle down overseas.</p>
              <p>Switching to Mandarin, Mr Goh said: 'I hope Chung Cheng and our
                                  schools will give two lasting bequests to our children. One is strong
                                  wings; the other, deep roots.</p>
              <p>'Like wild geese that migrate each fall, young Singaporeans should
                                  be equipped with the courage, strength and adaptability to venture to
                                  distant lands in search of opportunities. But when spring returns, they
                                  will come back, as this is their home.'</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Indeed, Mr Goh further argued in English, helping young
                                  Singaporeans stay rooted here was the most important challenge facing
                                  the Education Ministry. </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">T</span></span>his is because the number of young
                                  Singaporeans working overseas will grow, given that the education
                                  system is producing more and more students equipped with the right
                                  skills to go global.</p>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Goh Chock Tong's fear is real.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Yesterday,
              I had written about Goh Chock Tong's disappointment over the serious
              brain drain of young educated Singaporeans to Western Countries.</p>
              <p>In
              fact the numbers that leave are not just every 2 out of 3 graduates of
              Singapore high schools going abroad to study. There is ten fold
              multiplier effect which causes the relatives, families and friends of
              the overseas Singaporean to join him abroad, thereby swelling the
              figures that leave ten fold.<br><br>This huge brain drain of the talented from Singapore must be quite obvious to Goh Chock Tong and his friend Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>Students
              born brought up and educated in Singapore would know nothing other than
              Singapore, a place where they have to cram for their studies, where
              they fear to speak openly against the government, where their Asian
              culture of submission to authority makes them incapable of questioning
              authority and where on the whole they live a cowardly introverted
              fearful submissive lives. <br><br>But when they go to Australia for
              instance, they suddenly begin breathing a whiff of fresh air. The
              country is open, the people speak openly without fear of anyone, the
              newspapers are free to publish the truth, they are free to publicly
              protest and criticize and where the people are generally happier and
              more contented.</p>
              <p>Suddenly, the Singaporean export, falls in love with
              Australia. If only he had known earlier, he says, he would have left
              Singapore long ago. But, sadly, he did not know.</p>
              <p>But better late than
              never, now he knows. And he begins to hate Singapore for what it is, he
              begins to hate the tyrant Lee Kuan Yew who made him live like the dummy
              all these years, and he is glad he is free of that steamy intolerant
              crowded island. <br><br>And he transmits this message to all his
              relative and friends in Singapore. He tells his parents in Singapore to
              join him in Australia, he tells this to his brothers and sisters, to
              his relatives and friends. And then the family, the relatives, their
              friends tell it to theirs and so on, and the chain cumulative effect
              gets under way.<br><br>From the initial student who had gone abroad to
              study, you now have scores of others who have similarly left Singapore
              thanks to him.<br><br>This is what we call the multiplier effect. And
              this is what is happening. And this is draining Singapore of it's
              talent. And this is something Goh Chock Tong or his master Lee Kuan Yew
              can do nothing to stop.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew can of course turn
              Singapore into another Cuba or North Korea sealing it's borders to
              prevent escape. Unfortunately for him if were to do that, it will only
              precipitate the calamity even further.<br><br>He did appear dejected in
              the picture in the Straits Times. It is quite clear that he has reason
              to be. This is what happens to all dictatorships. Their arrogance
              catches up to them.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>
