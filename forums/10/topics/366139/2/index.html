              <h3>Goh Chock Tong's fear is real.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
              <p>Yesterday, I had written about Goh Chock Tong's disappointment over the serious brain drain of young educated Singaporeans to Western Countries.</p>
              <p>In fact the numbers that leave are not just every 2 out of 3 graduates of Singapore high schools going abroad to study. There is ten fold multiplier effect which causes the relatives, families and friends of the overseas Singaporean to join him abroad, thereby swelling the figures that leave ten fold.<br><br>This huge brain drain of the talented from Singapore must be quite obvious to Goh Chock Tong and his friend Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>Students born brought up and educated in Singapore would know nothing other than Singapore, a place where they have to cram for their studies, where they fear to speak openly against the government, where their Asian culture of submission to authority makes them incapable of questioning authority and where on the whole they live a cowardly introverted fearful submissive lives.<br><br>But when they go to Australia for instance, they suddenly begin breathing a whiff of fresh air. The country is open, the people speak openly without fear of anyone, the newspapers are free to publish the truth, they are free to publicly protest and criticize and where the people are generally happier and more contented.</p>
              <p>Suddenly, the Singaporean export, falls in love with Australia. If only he had known earlier, he says, he would have left Singapore long ago. But, sadly, he did not know.</p>
              <p>But better late than never, now he knows. And he begins to hate Singapore for what it is, he begins to hate the tyrant Lee Kuan Yew who made him live like the dummy all these years, and he is glad he is free of that steamy intolerant crowded island.<br><br>And he transmits this message to all his relative and friends in Singapore. He tells his parents in Singapore to join him in Australia, he tells this to his brothers and sisters, to his relatives and friends. And then the family, the relatives, their friends tell it to theirs and so on, and the chain cumulative effect gets under way.<br><br>From the initial student who had gone abroad to study, you now have scores of others who have similarly left Singapore thanks to him.<br><br>This is what we call the multiplier effect. And this is what is happening. And this is draining Singapore of it's talent. And this is something Goh Chock Tong or his master Lee Kuan Yew can do nothing to stop.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew can of course turn Singapore into another Cuba or North Korea sealing it's borders to prevent escape. Unfortunately for him if were to do that, it will only precipitate the calamity even further.<br><br>He did appear dejected in the picture in the Straits Times. It is quite clear that he has reason to be. This is what happens to all dictatorships. Their arrogance catches up to them.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>From: Goopalan Nair's convoluted mind</p>
              <p><strong>Goopalan Nair's fear is real.</strong></p>
              <p><br>Ladies and Gentleman,</p>
              <p>Today and yesterday, I posted about Goh Chock Tong's disappointment over the serious brain drain of young educated Singaporeans to Western Countries.</p>
              <p>I hope that it would be enough to damage and sour the trust that had build up over the years by citizens with the govt whom were elected in a free election.</p>
              <p>As you know, I am an american citizen now, free from the wrath of any of you singaporeans whom I detest from the bottom of my heart for not seeing and agreeing with my point of view.</p>
              <p>You whole lot deserve to die and perish, while I shake leg in US, the land of fools whom can be easily taken advantage of by telling them Singapore is ruled like NOrth Korea. These proud and silly americans cannot believe or accept any other country can be better democratically ruled than their own state, (please disregard the homeless and crime situation here ).</p>
              <p>I am glad I am a foriegner now, pissing on you stupid citizens who remain behind to patiently build up a better Singapore without me. I am thankful for Uncle Chia who helps me trememdously ( but stupidly ) to post my fantastic blogs to subjugate your minds, so easily done as long as when one allows emotion to rule over logic, self centredness ruling over social responsibility.</p>
              <p>It goes to show singaporeans like Uncle Chia, including the few young quitter immatured Uni graduates, still do not know how to think, and need me to think for them, in the way I want them to think.</p>
              <p>My real fear is that one day you whole stupid lot will wake up and know I am lying, providing no real facts or figures, just plain bullshitting with half truths all the way.</p>
              <p>My plans for vengence and destruction of your tiny little red dot island that should be exterminated long ago would come to nought, as nought as my legal work here and having to resort to bloggin to earn advert revenue, which is equally nought, but will change once the fool Uncle Chia links more to my blog.</p>
              <p>May more believe me and allow me to lead you to the promise land of your doom, like the pied piper who led the children to their deaths.</p>
              <p>Regards,<br>Goopalan Niar.</p>
              <p>http://www.imh.com.us/blogs/goopalan-is-a-clown/</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(PS: This is a spoof by me on the regular diatribe and rants from the ex IMH patient wannabe Gopalan Nair. I bear full responsibility and am resposible for what I say and write. So sue me, american goo-pak lan.)</p>

              <p>First of all this news isn't New news lah. </p>
              <p>They have been frantic for the last 4 years. They have asked overseas Singaporean to provide them feedback why they left SG. They have set up various meetings with Singaporean overseas. </p>
              <p>They invited successful profession Singaporean to speak to oversea singaporean students trying to paint a great image of back home so that when they graduate they return. .....for audience like Vito..... :  )</p>
              <p>For the other generation that is outside of singapore already, they simply said well don;t forget Singapore......bye bye.   </p>
              <p>They have no solutions for anything.  </p>
              <p>This is like the Movie Matrix;  for years they use their citizens, and are trying to paint a picture for Singapore to be something. Civil Govt look for quick fix.</p>
              <p>The Govt over the years never thought about for a nation to survive what are the character of a nation should be. How <strong>Govt Should NOT RUN LIKE A BUSINESS, as Business entity employees move out for better prospect. </strong></p>
              <p>The by product of Singapore Govt works as shown below:    </p>
              <p>As a result they produce folks like Ah Chia who is totally Crap. Who respect Kim Jong IL, but too coward to jump ship to joint Kim Jong IL ,  And the other discontent generation blaming all foreigners to be FT?  unable to distinct FT vs walk in farmer from china and Tom dick and harry from overseas.</p>

              <p><br>You hit the nail on the head. Congrats.</p>
              <p>Too late.</p>
              <p>Social darwinism had failed, and failed miserably. Only the smartest survives. Our education system was successful, too successful. It created monsters - not even frankensteins - he at least had a heart - out of our youths.</p>
              <p>So smart, they behaved like animals, without a care for the society that had nurtured them, and fled to greener pastures for better moolahs.</p>
              <p>We this adult generation will have to pay the price for someone else's blunder. "We need engineers and scientists" was the battle cry, but such education only lead to them going into the financial sectors or their own self interests.</p>
              <p>They were only behaving as they were taught - only the best survives and would be greatly rewarded. The ultimate price is materialism. TO HELL WITH SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY!!! </p>
              <p>Greed is the fuel for achievement, legal, respected and even admired. Societies can die for all they care. The financial crisis had proven such attitudes. Workers and employers adopted such attitudes.</p>
              <p>Numbers, stats, figures all lied. Some were even cooked. </p>
              <p>Social darwinism had failed.</p>
              <p>Govts plead now for more responsibility from bosses and MNC giants.</p>
              <p>Too late.</p>
              <p>Darwin's theories are for animals. We are intelligent and thinking beings, capable of change and do not live in jungles. We are all humans.</p>
              <p>We this adult generation will have to pay the price by working harder with lesser. BUT may it not be too late for the next generation. Everyone matters and should be given the chance to develope to their fullest potential and talents for our society, young or old, rich or poor, not just the best,with materialism as reward, if it is not already in the works. My plea. For a better tomorrow.</p>

              <p id="firstpara"><span class="location">BAKER CITY, Ore. —</span> Bill Fulton doesn't remember losing his wallet, but its return helped him remember the past. The leather stayed smooth and the cowboy design unblemished. The zipper moved with ease. And when he looked inside, the contents brought back memories from 1946, when he apparently dropped the wallet behind the balcony bleachers in the Baker Middle School gym.</p>
              <p>Fulton's Social Security card and bicycle license, bearing the address where he lived during his teenage years, were positioned in their respective compartments, apparently untouched since the year after World War II ended.</p>
              <p>"After that long, my gosh, it stayed in good shape," Fulton told the Baker City Herald. "It's hard to believe."</p>
              <p>Worker Nathan Osborne found the wallet — along with old homework, lost library books and a 1964 talent show program — while removing the bleachers for renovations on June 17. It was brought to Fulton's door the following day by Melanie Trindle, the Baker Middle School secretary.</p>
              <p>"He was pretty much amazed," Trindle said. "He just kept saying, 'Thank you. Thank you so much.' "</p>
              <p>Middle School Principal Mindi Vaughan said the brown pine bleachers were connected to the gym balcony's brick wall and had remained in the same place since the school, known as the Helen M. Stack Building, opened in 1936.</p>
              <p>Fulton, 78, said he probably lost the wallet while cheering for the Baker High basketball team with a group of friends. Though a high school team, the Bulldogs played at the middle school gym back then.</p>
              <p>Fulton said he returned to the gym in the 1960s to watch a basketball game. It's likely he was within a dozen or so feet from his old billfold that night. Both of his children attended the school, so they also must have come near it.</p>
              <p>Fulton said the bicycle ID was needed because he delivered medicine for Rodamar Drug. He was surprised, however, that his student ID wasn't inside. He said he always kept it there.</p>
              <p>But rather than focus on what was inside the wallet, Fulton said the recovery has led him to reflect on his life — one that took him to the Korean War and Berlin before a return to Baker City. He worked at Ellingson Lumber Company for 30 years, from March 1964 to April 1994.</p>
              <p>Since his retirement, Fulton has enjoyed spending time with his 11-year-old black lab, Smokey. The two often hike the nearby mountains.</p>
              <p>Trindle's knock on the door, wallet in hand, induced a slight ripple in his life, prompting him to consider times he hadn't thought about in many years. Fulton said he's "covered a lot of country" since 1946.</p>
              <p>"Where did all the time go?" Fulton said with a deep sigh. "It's hard to believe that the times have gone so fast."</p>
