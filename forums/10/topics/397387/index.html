              <p style="line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"><br>Quite a few critics of the American system of education are kept busy seeking "A City Upon a Hill" on foreign shores. One such country is </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">. After all, Singaporean students rank 1st in the world in mathematics on the latest TIMSS (</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">U.S.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> students rank 16th) and </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> boasts a nation of high performing students and excellent schools. Could </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> be the City Upon a Hill that Puritan leader John Winthrop described while giving a speech aboard the ship<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> Arbelle</span></em> en route to the Massachusetts Bat Colony? Maybe. But </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Winthrop</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> was careful to remind his fellow pilgrims that such a city would be carefully watched by "the eyes of all people" and warned of the accusation of hypocrisy should his weary and seasick flock not practice what was taught in the Good Book.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> will be hosting a major education conference in September and has invited distinguished scholars and teachers from throughout the world to share ideas and presentations. One such distinguished teacher is Susan Elliot, the 2009 Colorado State Teacher of the Year and one of four finalists for the 2009 National Teacher of the Year (I may have pulled the sword from the stone but Susan will always best me as Lancelot did Arthur).</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Susan Elliot has spent three decades in education and taught thousands of students. She is bright, articulate, and has a great sense of humor. She teaches social studies and history to mainstream and hearing-impaired students-all in the same classroom. Her unique ability to teach social studies and history to both "regular" and hearing-impaired students in the same classroom is a remarkable display of master teaching. Susan is the perfect educator to help represent </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">America</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">'s teachers and deserves a key to this Asian City Upon a Hill.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Susan was excited about traveling to </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> and sharing her ideas and experiences about methods that could develop the potential of all students to become independent, self-supporting and contributing members of society. And then came her dismissal.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Once the </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> education officials discovered that Susan was hearing-impaired, they retracted her invitation. The so-called discovery and subsequent retraction of her invitation was an act of disingenuous statesmanship because the </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> education officials knew all along that Susan was deaf. The official in charge of inviting and then disinviting Susan attributes the mistake to miscommunication. Wait a minute. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> is renowned for its academic prowess; surely the highly educated official could read a simple biography that very clearly noted Susan was hearing-impaired. The </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> education system may be perched on a higher hill than the American system but something is not quite right. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Susan Elliot sent a few emails to Singaporean education officials, hoping the "miscommunication" was itself a miscommunication and the whole matter an innocent mistake. She had to defend her disability and remind conference officials that </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">America</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">'s teachers and children are a diverse lot.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">How did the </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> officials respond? Susan was wished a successful future but remains persona non grata at the conference.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">The </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> system of education may be the envy of TIMSS groupies, and from a distance the city appears brightly lit in the night sky. But a peek behind the city walls reveals a flawed and ignorant culture of education. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Maybe, just maybe, Americans came in 16th place on the TIMSS because we are willing to carry a much heavier load. A weight gladly held by teachers such as Susan Elliot. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">As I glance out at the cold </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Atlantic Ocean</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> I think about the pilgrims huddled on a small ship, listening to John Winthrop preach about what it takes to create a City Upon a Hill. Singaporean education officials should heed </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Winthrop</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">'s warning, lest their country be viewed as hypocrites in "the eyes of all people."</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Oh, by the way, if any teacher would like to email the education official who disinvited one of </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">America</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">'s top teachers, please send a message to Ms. Lynn Koh. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">

              <p><img src="http://www.indiajournal.com/images/1271979985-leehsienloong.jpg" alt="" align="left"> CHICAGO, IL - Asian countries, led by India and China, are emerging “strongly” from the economic downturn, Singapore’s Prime Minister said here, but emphasized that India needs to be more “open” to foreign investments for sustained growth.<br><br>Addressing the Chicago Council on Global Affairs here, Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong said economies across the globe are rebounding and the world is no longer staring into an “abyss”.<br><br>“In Asia, the countries are emerging strongly led by China and India. Asia is on the move and barring a conflict or war, for at least several more decades Asia will continue to grow and develop and uplift the lives of billions of people,” Loong said April 15.<br><br>Pointing out that India is growing rapidly, Loong said for a sustained growth, the country will require “difficult liberalization and reforms” as well as massive infrastructure investments.<br><br>“India is well placed to be another major growth engine, provided it progressively frees up its economy. <br><br>It needs to become more transparent, open and more welcoming of foreign investments and of business in general,” he said, adding the country has an environment many Western firms are more comfortable with.<br><br>Loong termed China “a big part of the Asia story” but said it is in Beijing’s interest to show flexibility in its exchange rate.<br><br>“Now that the crisis is over, it is really in China’s own interest to have more flexibility in its exchange rate to avoid a showdown not only with America but with all its global partners,” he added. <br><br>While China is “assiduous and skillful in making friends”, it is “firm in defending its national interests,” Loong said, adding that China is still finding the “right tone” to engage the international community.<br><br>Terming America’s relation with China “the most important bilateral relation” in the world, Loong said currently the two nations are facing problems, particularly in regard to the exchange rate.<br><br>He further added that for Asia’s growth, it is vital that America has an active trade policy despite the protectionism mood and “lack of appetite in the Congress for free trade”.         (PTI)</p>

              <p><img src="http://www.indiajournal.com/images/1271979985-leehsienloong.jpg" alt=""> CHICAGO, IL - Asian countries, led by India and China, are emerging “strongly” from the economic downturn, Singapore’s Prime Minister said here, but emphasized that India needs to be more “open” to foreign investments for sustained growth.<br><br>Addressing the Chicago Council on Global Affairs here, Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong said economies across the globe are rebounding and the world is no longer staring into an “abyss”.<br><br>“In Asia, the countries are emerging strongly led by China and India. Asia is on the move and barring a conflict or war, for at least several more decades Asia will continue to grow and develop and uplift the lives of billions of people,” Loong said April 15.<br><br>Pointing out that India is growing rapidly, Loong said for a sustained growth, the country will require “difficult liberalization and reforms” as well as massive infrastructure investments.<br><br>“India is well placed to be another major growth engine, provided it progressively frees up its economy.<br><br>It needs to become more transparent, open and more welcoming of foreign investments and of business in general,” he said, adding the country has an environment many Western firms are more comfortable with.<br><br>Loong termed China “a big part of the Asia story” but said it is in Beijing’s interest to show flexibility in its exchange rate.<br><br>“Now that the crisis is over, it is really in China’s own interest to have more flexibility in its exchange rate to avoid a showdown not only with America but with all its global partners,” he added.<br><br>While China is “assiduous and skillful in making friends”, it is “firm in defending its national interests,” Loong said, adding that China is still finding the “right tone” to engage the international community.<br><br>Terming America’s relation with China “the most important bilateral relation” in the world, Loong said currently the two nations are facing problems, particularly in regard to the exchange rate.<br><br>He further added that for Asia’s growth, it is vital that America has an active trade policy despite the protectionism mood and “lack of appetite in the Congress for free trade”.         (PTI)</p>

              <p><br>Anyway, here is my comment/contribution</p>
              <p>As i said earlier, Chinese and Indian are more calculative people, and also more conservative in their approach to business. Basically, if you look at the recent US or the West financial crisis leading to today situation, do you still trust them?? as i said earlier, even the West citizens are not trusting their banks?? How on earth is India and china going to invest and be open to the west?? when the result already show, a big cheater is at play, and the recently Goldman Sach default further strenghten their distrust in the western markets.</p>
              <p>Bearing in mind that China and India can self sustain themselve within their domestic market, and yet with a distrust in foreign banking, you think they are so stupid like our govt temasek and GIC who had invested so much and lost so much to the west. Ah Loong is there as an agent for the west, he, being Chinese (baba), an asian and a western trained banana skin guy who have invested so much in the west and worry that the west will further collapse is seeking India and China to put more funds into western economy and banks, and to the west, he is the right person.</p>
              <p>But do you think China and India is going to listen to a loser who had put so much stake into the western hands and called them God of Capitalism? You got to be smart ya</p>

              <p>Errm... anyone bothered to follow the link to see that there is a part II of the story now? Singaporeans wrote to the organising committee and had the Chairman call up Susan and apologised to her personally. Still a mistake nevertheless, but at least we had the guts to own up and correct it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Great news! The many caring and compassionate teachers and parents of
               Singapore's children have made their voice heard. Susan will be going 
              to Singapore!</p>
              <p>I would like to thank all the people who wrote to the education 
              officials and helped to get Susan invited to Singapore. Teachers and 
              parents share a universal understanding of right and wrong and have 
              helped right a bad decision. Below is a very sincere email from the 
              conference committee. I thank them for inviting Susan back to their 
              wonderful country.<br> <br> <br> Dear Dr Lim</p>
              <p>Thank you for your feedback.</p>
              <p>The withdrawal of our invitation to Ms Susan Elliot was a mistake on 
              our part.  It arose from our misunderstanding about the need for 
              interpreters and her professional experience.  The chairman of the 
              Organising Committee has since contacted Ms Elliot and spoken to her 
              personally to convey our sincere apologies. We should have clarified 
              these matters before making the decision. Ms Elliot has accepted our 
              apology and the Organising Committee is delighted that she will 
              participate at the Teachers' Conference in September. We look forward to
               her contributions in making the Conference a success.</p>
