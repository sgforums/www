              <p>SINGAPORE, March 21, 2009 (AFP) - Singapore, which is facing its
                  worst recession in history, needs foreigners to survive in the
                  long-term, founding father Lee Kuan Yew said.</p>
              <p>The city-state is not reproducing itself fast enough and the
                  government has in recent years opened its doors to attract more
                  talented migrants to avert a serious population shortage.</p>
              <p>"Without new citizens and permanent residents, we are going to be
                  'The Last of the Mohicans'. We will disappear," Lee, 85, told an
                  audience at a local university late Friday.</p>

                  is the country's first prime minister and remains an influential
                  figure. He is an adviser in his son Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's
                  cabinet with the title minister mentor.</p>
              <p>Singapore needs a fertility rate of 2.1 babies per woman to maintain
                  its population naturally but a string of incentives including monetary
                  ones to encourage Singaporeans to have babies has failed to make an
                  impact.</p>
              <p>A report released this month by the Department of Statistics showed
                  39,935 babies were born in 2008, well short of the 60,000 births the
                  country needs each year.</p>
              <p>Singapore has a population of 4.84 million, including about one million foreigners who work in the country and their families.</p>
              <p>The local economy is projected to shrink by up to 5.0 percent in
                  2009 and the elder Lee told the audience at the university it may take
                  up to six years to recover in a worse-case scenario.</p>
              <p>In a sign of how tough times are, Singaporeans trained as engineers
                  are looking for jobs such as bus drivers once shunned by locals, The
                  Straits Times reported Saturday.</p>

              <p>There's this paper titled: The Functional Prerequisites of a Society.</p>
              <p>A main point in the paper is that we need 'new' people to replace those who will eventually die in order for a society to NOT become extinct. These 'new' people can be gotten either by reproduction, or the 'recruiting' of 'new' members.</p>
              <p>The issue with 'new' members is that prior to becoming members of your society, they were members of another society. Where they (very likely) had a different set of 'rules', 'regulations' and 'norms'...</p>

              <p>Is it not obvious that MM needs more immigrants for HIS Singapore to survive ?</p>
              <p>After having lost US$100 Billion PLUS from our National Reserves - that took almost his entire life time to accumulate - how much time has he got left to recover this amount that has been lost ?</p>
              <p>The fastest way is to open the floodgates to foreigners willing to settle in Singapore and take up Citizenship - and begin PAYING into the CPF and into the Singapore Government Revenue Collecting Systems that covers the full spectrum of essential services provided by the various Government Linked Corporations.</p>

              <p>No matter what happens, MRT will be packed. Less people around, less train service around too, and less frequency. Making sure that MRT is pack and making maximum money, is the way MRT is meant to run.</p>
              <p>If the MRT is relatively empty, than the head of the company is wasting resource, and will be sacked...</p>
