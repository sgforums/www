              <p>Even without the stop at 2 policy, all we get is a bigger population than now. The birth replacement rate would still be at the same dismal rate.</p>
              <p>The end result would be worse without the policy in fact.Considering then we would have a much bigger aging baby boomer population, with future generations having to fork out more to support them.</p>
