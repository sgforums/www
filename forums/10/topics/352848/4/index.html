              <p>SINGAPORE, March 21, 2009 (AFP) - Singapore, which is facing its
              worst recession in history, needs foreigners to survive in the
              long-term, founding father Lee Kuan Yew said.</p>
              <p>The city-state is not reproducing itself fast enough and the
              government has in recent years opened its doors to attract more
              talented migrants to avert a serious population shortage.</p>
              <p>"Without new citizens and permanent residents, we are going to
              be 'The Last of the Mohicans'. We will disappear," Lee, 85, told an
              audience at a local university late Friday.</p>

              </div>
              <p>e is the country's first prime minister and remains an
              influential figure. He is an adviser in his son Prime Minister Lee
              Hsien Loong's cabinet with the title minister mentor.</p>
              <p>Singapore needs a fertility rate of 2.1 babies per woman to
              maintain its population naturally but a string of incentives
              including monetary ones to encourage Singaporeans to have babies
              has failed to make an impact.</p>
              <p>A report released this month by the Department of Statistics
              showed 39,935 babies were born in 2008, well short of the 60,000
              births the country needs each year.</p>
              <p>Singapore has a population of 4.84 million, including about one
              million foreigners who work in the country and their families.</p>
              <p>The local economy is projected to shrink by up to 5.0 percent in
              2009 and the elder Lee told the audience at the university it may
              take up to six years to recover in a worse-case scenario.</p>
              <p>In a sign of how tough times are, Singaporeans trained as
              engineers are looking for jobs such as bus drivers once shunned by
              locals, The Straits Times reported Saturday.</p>

              <p>Reading this thread i have been particularly put off by almost all of Ah Chia's posts. Call it personal choice or whatever, but his biased and extremist criticisms towards our founding father is akin to biting the hand that fed you. Do remember that his contributions have given you so much comfort such that you can hide behind your computer and type so much complaints and unhappiness bout this country and him. And its ludicrous that you can actually say that immigrants come here and mess up our social fabric when Singapore has been literally been grown over the years with an immigrant population. Unless you can trace your family tree and tell me your ancestors are natives of some sort then dude look in the mirror - you are a descendant of immigrants.</p>
              <p>There is a need to view the influx of immigrants in a more positive light. Firstly to address the number of jobs being taken up by locals, it is necessary to realize that the quality of the job taken up is more important than quality. Also the time frame at the which the sample was taken. If lower end jobs were the majority available at that time, then it is but a reflection of the government's policy to bring in more low wage workers to take the lower end jobs in the spectrum to encourage our people towards developing themselves into skilled labour and work further up in the hierachy. If to you this is a bad thing then perhaps you would like your own people to be the construction workers or roadsweepers. Expats on the other hand are necessary in both improving the standard of our workforce and for sharing of work experience. It is necessary to realize such labour movement is not uni-directional but rather multi-directional and is all part of a globalization effort. Perhaps what would be more alarming is the phenomenon of 'brain-drain' whereby we lose our talents to overseas job markets without attracting much of our own. For Singapore to progress into a truly developed nation with economic muscle and for a better standard of living, weaving ourselves into the globalized network is crucial for our little island. The effort to bring in more immigrants is but a part of a greater effort for prosperity and growth in the long term.</p>

              Please do not ignore the hardwork and contributions of the older generation of singaporeans and PAP old guards.  They had contributed selflessly to the country's success but are often ignored and forgotten by many singaporeans.

                                                <p>Reading this thread i have been particularly put off by almost
                                all of Ah Chia's posts. Call it personal choice or whatever, but
                                his biased and extremist criticisms towards our founding father is
                                akin to biting the hand that fed you. Do remember that his
                                contributions have given you so much comfort such that you can hide
                                behind your computer and type so much complaints and unhappiness
                                bout this country and him. And its ludicrous that you can actually
                                say that immigrants come here and mess up our social fabric when
                                Singapore has been literally been grown over the years with an
                                immigrant population. Unless you can trace your family tree and
                                tell me your ancestors are natives of some sort then dude look in
                                the mirror - you are a descendant of immigrants.</p>
                                <p>There is a need to view the influx of immigrants in a more
                                positive light. Firstly to address the number of jobs being taken
                                up by locals, it is necessary to realize that the quality of the
                                job taken up is more important than quality. Also the time frame at
                                the which the sample was taken. If lower end jobs were the majority
                                available at that time, then it is but a reflection of the
                                government's policy to bring in more low wage workers to take the
                                lower end jobs in the spectrum to encourage our people towards
                                developing themselves into skilled labour and work further up in
                                the hierachy. If to you this is a bad thing then perhaps you would
                                like your own people to be the construction workers or
                                roadsweepers. Expats on the other hand are necessary in both
                                improving the standard of our workforce and for sharing of work
                                experience. It is necessary to realize such labour movement is not
                                uni-directional but rather multi-directional and is all part of a
                                globalization effort. Perhaps what would be more alarming is the
                                phenomenon of 'brain-drain' whereby we lose our talents to overseas
                                job markets without attracting much of our own. For Singapore to
                                progress into a truly developed nation with economic muscle and for
                                a better standard of living, weaving ourselves into the globalized
                                network is crucial for our little island. The effort to bring in
                                more immigrants is but a part of a greater effort for prosperity
                                and growth in the long term.</p>

              <p>I think singapore can house 6.5 million population provided there is enough infrastructure and well planned  to support this number. As of current belief, to the naysayer, this figure will not be possible because all he sees is overcrowded trains, buses and public places giving the impression that there is no more room left.</p>

              <p>Yes i will take note of the paragraph. PAP mouthpiece or not i think i know best im just being objective here. I agree with <em>wordlybusinessman</em> that our public transport system gives the feeling of being overloaded due to the fact that trains and buses are crowded and places like Orchard Road and City Hall are bustling with people. This maybe my perception but i feel this is but a phenomena brought about by progress and development into a metropolitan city. Just look at the neighbouring Shanghai and Tokyo and even increasingly Mumbai. When cities grow it would inevitably lead to concentration of people in the concrete jungle we live in. Perhaps this can be percieved as a small price to pay for progress rather than a sign of overload.</p>
              <p>And honestly i think its unfair to accuse the government of 'relaxing' laws on foreign employment as i certainly think that is not the case. Regular 'cleanups' and hefty penalties for employment and housing of foreign workers are efforts on the part of the authorities to ensure we live in a safe community and foreigners amongst us are of credible moral standards.</p>
              <p>Lastly the concentration of PRC workers in places such as hawker centres serving food or cleaning up is not a sign that there is an overload of immigrants, neither is it that employment ratio regulations are failing. It is merely that Singaporeans are moving away from such low end jobs to pursuit better and higher employment for a better life. The foreigners are brought in not to steal the people's jobs, but do what our people do not want to do at lower wage-rates and maintaining our competitiveness. Perhaps what is more pressing would be that these workers coming in would depress the wages of unskilled labour so much so that existing Singaporeans in these jobs who are unable to upgrade themselves or find better jobs due to their educational shortfall would suffer. This is a more pertinent issue as compared to the idea of overpopulation.</p>

              <p>I think Singapore can support a population of 10-15 million people.</p>
              <p>This can help support a domestic consumption economy.</p>
              <p>We need to import another 8-10 million PRC foreigners in next 10 years to achieve the target.</p>

              <p>Singapore does need immigrants to survive because our birth rates are indeed low. But.... things to ponder:</p>
              <p>First: <br>Easy availability of cheaper foreign workers depress salaries.<br>Salaries low then leads to stress cuz need money to pay this pay that.<br>Birth rates low because of high stress and money not enough, etc. <br>High stress because work stress.<br>Work stress because money not enough.<br>Money not enough because salary rise is slower than rise in taxes, inflation, property prices, etc, combined.<br>Salary low because of easy availability of cheaper foreign workers.<br><br>Vicious cycle, never ending.<br><br><br>Second:<br>If there aren't any distinct advantages in employing foreign workers, why would there be a need to limit companies on the ratio of foreign workers to Singaporeans?</p>
