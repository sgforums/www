              <p>A main point in the paper is that we need 'new' people to replace those who will eventually die in order for a society to NOT become extinct. These 'new' people can be gotten either by reproduction, or the 'recruiting' of 'new' members.</p>

              <p>one- for Singapore to sustain itself, it has to have a birthrate that can cover those who are approaching the 'retirement age' and to replace the mortality rate. Doing so would require extra-ordinary 'pro baby' policies, which I feel the present bonuses aren't sufficient enough to beckon married ladies into motherhood.</p>
              <p>Surprisingly though, when i was having a conversation with my Vietnamese friends about birthrates and stuff, their country has not rolled out 'pro-family' policies to incentivize engaged couples into forming families. On the contrary, the government is warning against creating a family too large a size in other words,limiting families to 1 or 2 children. Funny that they are taking the same route which we did in the 1970's.</p>

              same route which we did in the 1970's.</p>
              <p>So far, there seem to be no universal solution to tackle
              population crisis.</p>

              <p>Think it is because it hints too heavily of foreign intervention to the countries that are experiencing the highest population growth.(Middle east, Africa).</p>
              <p>For these countries a high population growth is neccessary for economy growth and also related to a country strength, both military and industrial.  Asking them to control it is akin to telling an Olympic runner to go slower and let the others catch up.</p>
              <p>It's also against the teachings of Christianity (Or at least the Roman Catholic Church) to use contraception.</p>
              <p>The logical choice would be to introduce birth control and stop our population from furthur exploding. However, the main obstacles are probably going to be political and religious.</p>
              <p>It's funny how our government is trying to encouraging population growth while some crazy single woman is actually the mother of fourteen kids.</p>

              <p>Toh Chin Chye on how the dog turned Singapore into a cultureless, soulless society:</p>
              <p>I would say the generation of the ‘50s and ‘60s took the plunge into
                  politics without ever calculating the costs of the risk and the
                  benefits to be gained. They were driven by ideology. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Today’s generation
                  has no culture </strong></span>and averse to taking political risk.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Really, an interest
                  in politics is very necessary for the future.</strong></span> But I cannot blame the
                  present generations, because they see the heavy-handed response by the
                  government to dissenting views, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>even though they know that these
                  matters involve their daily lives.</strong></span><br><br>So the result is that we have
                  produced <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a younger generation who are meek and therefore very
                  calculating. They are less independent-thinking and lack in initiative. </strong></span>It does<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> not bode well for the emergence of future leaders in politics
                  and business.</strong></span> Robots and computers can be programmed or if you like,
                  can be trained. But the trouble, of course, is that computers lack soul
                  and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>what we need in Singapore is soul. Because it is soul that makes
                  society.</strong></span></p>

              <p> </p>
