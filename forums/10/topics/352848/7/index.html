                  singaporeans now got no jobs, just that there is a structural
                  unemployment going on due to the economic crisis.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">A talent person from another country actually do not wish to
                  come here, he/she will prefer his/her own country, however, because
                  of his/her country poor system to provide them a decent job, they
                  left their home in search for better pasture. And here in
                  Singapore, being multi cultural, peaceful and harmony, they choosed
                  here to be part of their life if not forever.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The issue is that most </span><span style="color: #000000;">singaporeans pick on them to be a job
                  snatcher and that the govt immigration policy is a total
                  disadvantage to them. But I see it as an opportunity for me to use
                  them to the advantage of Singaporeans. </span><span style="color: #000000;">There are many foreign
                  business and firms here with foreign talents that created many jobs
                  for singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The fact that i got PRC and thai gals here earning money for us
                  is a gift, you simply cannot find singaporeans doing it.</span> If you
                  cannot make in life, dun blame here and there, ask yourself, what
                  fxxk had you been doing all these years?? </span><span style="color: #000000;">To me, all Singaporeans

                                                <p>Hi starexcalibur i really appreciate your post its really quite
                                enlightening for me. I especially found the last 2 paragrahs really
                                thought provoking. I think its true that afterall everyone is in it
                                for the money and that is way we have to try to preserve our social
                                fabric at large. We welcome foreigners and we allow them into our
                                community but we do have to bear in mind that we, the true
                                Singaporeans are afterall what makes up this country and it is
                                important to keep the core of our population together.</p>
                                <p>Nonetheless Im still not thoroughly convinced that the problem
                                of foreigners being able to fight with our own people at almost
                                every level of skilled and unskilled labour is really that
                                prevalent. I mean unemployment rates havent been shooting up in the
                                last few years and people's main complaints have been in the lower
                                tiers of employment. Perhaps you can refer me to some articles so I
                                can get a clearer picture on these aspects.</p>
                                
                                <p>I agree with you that getting more 'skilled' is not an instant
                                solution. But what I do believe is that getting 'multi-skilled' can
                                solve the problem. I may be wrong to assume this, but the skilled
                                labour from the neighbouring ASEAN countries where the chief source
                                of foreigners are coming are more 'mono-skilled'. Perhaps it is
                                because their country's development and education has just taken
                                flight. Hence I actually hold strongly to the idea that being more
                                versed in more than one skill may actually increase one's
                                employability.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I understand your example and i thoroughly agree with your conclusion. However it is insufficient to show on a larger scale whether this has been happening on a large scale and if so why are Singaporeans still preferred. And honestly if the new requirements of today is to be able to do the job of 3 persons to earn your keep then i guess its just all about adaptation. Its not something we can change. If we were to suggest protectionistic policies in terms of labour flows, then our own entrepreneurs would suffer when they go to countries like China and India who will retaliate with policies of their own as we choose to shun their cheap labour. Protectionism is a beggar-thy-neighbour policy and is always harmful for globalisation. Singapore's urgent need to be part of the global economy just means that we have to be ever-adapting and ever-changing to meet the needs of the new global economy.</p></div>

              <p>I understand your example and i thoroughly agree with your
              conclusion. However it is insufficient to show on a larger scale
              whether this has been happening on a large scale and if so why are
              Singaporeans still preferred. And honestly if the new requirements
              of today is to be able to do the job of 3 persons to earn your keep
              then i guess its just all about adaptation. Its not something we
              can change. If we were to suggest protectionistic policies in terms
              of labour flows, then our own entrepreneurs would suffer when they
              go to countries like China and India who will retaliate with
              policies of their own as we choose to shun their cheap labour.
              Protectionism is a beggar-thy-neighbour policy and is always
              harmful for globalisation. Singapore's urgent need to be part of
              the global economy just means that we have to be ever-adapting and
              ever-changing to meet the needs of the new global economy.</p>

              <p>Honestly speaking, you will kill yourself by working harder and making yourself able to do the job of 3 persons just to earn your keep.</p>
              <p>When you are over 40, and anything happens, or another recession appears, you will be over qualified. Your bills will pile up... etc... Because we will have more and more people being able to do the same, including foreigners. And if we keep this up, one day, you will need to be able to do the job of 5 persons just to earn your keep.</p>
              <p>Instead, one should aim to be able to do the job that few people (and especially foreigners) can do, and that few can do it well. Be different. Be unique. That's the key.</p>

              <p>And then there's the ability to understand and articulate information in a non-IT domain and use that information to drive IT solutions that match what the customer needs. This is something Indians, Filipinos, and all other so-called IT foreign experts out there lack greatly. We use most of these people for contract work, ie, coding coding coding.

              <p>Yes eagle I agree having unique talents or a niche is extremely important, which is why footballers among other sportsmen and celebrities such as Will Smith are paid atrocious salaries. They have a niche, and scarcity breeds bargaining power, which is crucial to commanding good wages and remain employable. But how many people have such special talents to command that kind of wages? Especially as a lay worker, things like engineering and stuff, its hard to engineer a niche for yourself or have some special talent that makes you employable. What can distinguish you from another is probably just work experience and good recommendations by previous employers and stuff. Thats why when i say being able to do the job of 3 or 5 i dont actually mean quite literally but rather back to my point of being value-added. No two workers are the same no matter how qualified they may seem. At the end of the day it may come down to things like integrity and your socializing skills.</p>

              <p>I think the problem is not under population, it is low <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>population growth</strong></span> </p>
              <p>Meaning not enough young people being created to fill in the gaps of the retirees and also to provide services/production to support a greying population because the elderly requires more services(medical, logistics) to sustain and they do not provide anything tangible back to the society since they no longer work.</p>
              <p>I would even argue that stopping at 2 actually stop the problem from worsening.</p>
              <p>China may have obtain its super power status by virtue of its 1.3 billion population. But because of its 1 child policy, they would face a demographic bomb a few decades from now.</p>

              <p>there is a total paradigm shift in the era of stopping at 2 and now, nobody what the future lies.  On the other hand, if we dun stop at 2, now we may have more old peoples around.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The problem with decline of birthrate today most people dun wan to get marry, or even get married, they are still childless, not to mention stopping at 2, as LKY said, if we can reproduce ourselves as two peoples producing two peoples, we are still ok, but we are producing less than 2 or none per couple. So that is the worrying part.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The decline of birthrate is mainly due to education where many  believe in self sustain and forget that as a human, in term of science, we are also need to produce to maintain equilibrium in the homo saipan context. Secondly, most women are educated and they tends not to marry down but rather look toward freedom of life, sometime i told my galfrens and my aunties who is not marry as selfish people, then kenna scolding by them. Nobody wants to be like Mrs Piggy giving lots of childrens anymore. And our opposite gender are more worst, they tends to look for lower educated woman so that they can hv a chance to show their male chauvinism juice. And in the end they get those foreign wifeys or someone who dunno about their work and lifestyles. Furthermore, most look for fun before deciding to get marry, and as they aged, they just get a third world gal to be their wife cum maid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Where ants can bite for their eggs, bird can die for their birdies and some fishes can die just to give birth and carry on the nature of decendants, we humans purposely stopped our producing and worst, throw our babies down rustbin or put in park or airport</p>

              <p><br>me get it, it is you who dun get it? so what if population increase to 6 millions, it is beyong our control, the govt can do it utmost, but birthrate depends on you and many of us to produce, dun expect LKY to do it, he is old liao. And since we are not producing, we are just killing ourselves, there is no way out, even with foreigners here or not, we will still be perished in now time. In the meantime, enjoy what you have now and maybe another generation, the future is bleak, good luck.</p>
