              <p>For those who claim that there is an overdosage of immigrants
              perhaps you can enlighten me on the various sources that gave you
              that idea. I particularly like charlize's analogy as i think it
              brings across the potential problem quite succinctly. However to a
              certain extent the problem has been oversimplified. Unlike a boat,
              countries can be grown and developed to accomodate a growing
              population. Its productive capacity can be expanded, housing and
              amenities be developed and in the long run to achieve greater
              economic growth. By saying that too much immigrants may overload
              the boat is akin to saying we should reproduce less beccause our
              population is inflating beyond what our infrastructure can take. It
              is not true on 2 counts and firstly is what most of us today has
              recognized as an ageing population phenomena that probably requires
              us to bring in more foreigners to bridge the shortfall between
              birth and death rates. Secondly as Prof. Edward Glazer an economist
              in Harvard pointed out in a recent ST article the country is more
              than capable of housing a 6.5m population.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>To charlize, i applaud your intellect for actually bringing up the issue of diminishing marginal returns, something i definitely agree with. The problem of an overly large population and landmass etc is especially pertinent in China today showing regions of uneven growth and uneven income distribution. Nonetheless i believe that bringing in foreigners in the long run is to supplement our workforce rather than aimlessly increasing the population. At least in the short run the influx of immigrants would help to make the numbers in terms of achieving a healthy replacement rate i.e. birth to death ratios in our population. I definitely share the same view that every city and especially Singapore has an optimal size and population density. However if future progress demands, perhaps our leaders and people would be innovative enough to accomodate the future challenges of a population even greater than 6.5m. As man has always shown in history, we are highly adaptable haha.</p></div>

              <p>Dun worry, the last few days, i was given a tour of far end changi, OMG!!! the reclaimed land was so huge that it can anytime take over 4 big towns in the inland. So most probably, some of our older folks may move there when it is fully developed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Talking about diminishing, the govt too calculated to factor it in their plans, the targeted population was pre planned to increase to 6.5 millions in about one generation time, as some will be migrating out and some who take here as stepping stone only, the calculate population by 2030 will be around 5.5 to 6 millions which can last for another generation of about 50 years before another generation come into place,..and that will last for another 50 years to and so on. The govt also noted the replacement of old ages and the longervility of life here, but then who cares what happen in 100 years time. That is a century from now we are talking about,  whether there will be diminishing or progressing thru some technology or increasing of land, no much of us give a damn, cos by then, we long long become dust already. And the LEE or PAP may not be in power liao.</p>

              <p>U all dont realise one thing : <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">competitive wage will not work without a minimum wage system because of the availability of cheap workers who will drive down wages further!! it will only go lower as seen all along in from the past decade.Instead of becoming a competitive wage, it will become a low wage!</span></strong></p>
              <p>Whether there are foreign workers or not, the wages will still go down</p>

              <p>Talking about diminishing, the govt too calculated to

              as some will be migrating out and some who take here as stepping
              stone only, the calculate population by 2030 will be around 5.5 to
              6 millions which can last for another generation of about 50 years
              before another generation come into place,..and that will last for
              another 50 years to and so on. The govt also noted the replacement
              of old ages and the longervility of life here, but then who cares
              what happen in 100 years time. That is a century from now we are
              talking about,  whether there will be diminishing or
              progressing thru some technology or increasing of land, no much of

              <p><br>Our country in the early stages is also very much at stake in term of security. But then, nobody can predict that it can what it is now today, the world being globlised is changing at a faster pace than we knew, peoples are good in evolution and adaption, they will find a way out in the future, in the meantime we will do all our best to bring a better tomorrow if situation allow us, but then the current situation is without foreigners, we simply cannot function. So, instead of going back to farm land and rice snatching, we put in the foreign talents to help us continue our prosperity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are tacked to the global economy, of course when the global goes into a spiral downturn, we are the first to hit, but when the global economy pick up, most likely we will be the first one there to grab the opportunities, the most important is to prepare ourselve now, learn new skill and knowledge, wait for the time to come.</p>

              <p>To charlize, i applaud your intellect for actually bringing up the issue of diminishing marginal returns, something i definitely agree with. The problem of an overly large population and landmass etc is especially pertinent in China today showing regions of uneven growth and uneven income distribution. Nonetheless i believe that bringing in foreigners in the long run is to supplement our workforce rather than aimlessly increasing the population. At least in the short run the influx of immigrants would help to make the numbers in terms of achieving a healthy replacement rate i.e. birth to death ratios in our population. I definitely share the same view that every city and especially Singapore has an optimal size and population density. However if future progress demands, perhaps our leaders and people would be innovative enough to accomodate the future challenges of a population even greater than 6.5m. As man has always shown in history, we are highly adaptable haha.</p>

              <p>In the aspect of politics, Ah Chia, i believe that is one avenue which we would be more sensitive towards the recruitment of foreigners. I wouldnt say it is impossible that we have foreigners in our cabinet but the problem being that it is still best for a country's own people to run their own country as it would be more logical for their policies to stem from their own concern to their nation's well-being than treating the appointment as a mere job.</p>
              <p>And no Charlize, if that were really the case Singapore would have died long ago. Its about creating a value-added workforce, working towards being multi-talented and well-versed into multiple disciplines. What you are trying to say is that to a certain extend each tier of employees throughout the world is homogenous which is not actually true. By value-adding your skills, you may be able to perform jobs across many disciplines which is an asset to any organisation in difficult times as you are helping them cut costs. For now the main low wage competition exists at the very end of the job spectrum i.e. unskilled labour. By upgrading and retraining you alienate yourself from that job sector and can command better jobs further up the ladder.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>U all dont realise one thing : <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">competitive wage will not work
                                      without a minimum wage system because of the availability of cheap
                                      workers who will drive down wages further!! it will only go lower
                                      as seen all along in from the past decade.Instead of becoming a
                                      competitive wage, it will become a low wage!</span></strong></p>
              <p>Whether there are foreign workers or not, the wages will still
                                      go down</p>
              <p>It will result in some undesirable consequences like eg domestic
                                      spending will decrease and will lead to inflation in prices.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If you arent aware a minimum wage system is not really prevalent in our world today mainly in the EU such as France whereby bolshy trade unions often pressure the president to maintain minimum wage standards for the people. The most efficient solution towards the wage issue is sadly to abolish such a system while simultaneously upgrading your workforce to ensure your own people are not those trap in the lower end of the job spectrum. Yes in the short run it may look like the minimum wage system protects the jobs and livelihood of people. However this leads to great economic efficiency which is why progress in the EU this few years are not quite significant. Besides, by setting a minimum wage, it is akin to rising the costs of productions in less rosy times such as today and further contribute to rising inflation. The advantage of a competitive wage system is such that firms are fighting to trim costs and maintaining competitiveness and wages are paid out in line with worker productivity which gives them a further incentive to work and upgrade themself to command higher wages. The inefficiencies brought about by the minimum wage system can be written into an essay but for simplification thats all i can mention for now.</p>
              <p>To fishbuff, im not government worker lol. Im not even working yet and
              maybe thats why there are sentiments that I am unsympathetic to the
              plight of the common man based on my posts. My perspectives are not based on what the government says and come on how often do you see in the ST that which minister is saying this and that. I read relatively widely with my weekly issues of The Economist and Newsweek. As an economics student i staunchly believe in the value of globalisation and free labour and factor flows throughout the world. My opinions stem from my studies and also my exposure to articles by various writers in these magazines and not of PAP propaganda. The advantages of foreign labour flow is not only a policy promoted and embraced by our government but many governments around the world. The rejection of foreigners is a rejection of globalisation, akin to protectionism, which is something that the last G20 meeting is trying to address and avoid in light of our economic crisis.</p>
