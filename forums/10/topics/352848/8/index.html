              <p>The decline of birthrate is mainly due to education where many  believe in self sustain and forget that as a human, in term of science, we are also need to produce to maintain equilibrium in the homo saipan context. Secondly, most women are educated and they tends not to marry down but rather look toward freedom of life, sometime i told my galfrens and my aunties who is not marry as selfish people, then kenna scolding by them. Nobody wants to be like Mrs Piggy giving lots of childrens anymore. And our opposite gender are more worst, they tends to look for lower educated woman so that they can hv a chance to show their male chauvinism juice. And in the end they get those foreign wifeys or someone who dunno about their work and lifestyles. Furthermore, most look for fun before deciding to get marry, and as they aged, they just get a third world gal to be their wife cum maid.</p>

              <p>That's a bit of a whacking all males attitude you have there. For starters, I like my lady to be stronger than me, because my perspective is that ladies are by nature, stronger in potential than men, in terms of the ability to succeed in many aspects of life. I encourage my lady to debate intensively with me, and to continue to grow so that she and I continue to develop our abilities together.</p>
              <p>On the homo-sapien context, I would disagree with what you say. The human race is still growing at an explosive pace, and given the way we consume the planet's resources, scientists believe it's actually better to reduce our population in the next few decades. This issue about us not producing, is more a country-specific concern, rather than a human race concern. Countries are just worried that they do not have enough reproduction to replace their manpower, and not about whether the human race should continue to reproduce.</p>
