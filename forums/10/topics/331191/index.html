              <div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';"><strong>LOSS OF CONFIDENCE</strong><br><br> 1. I was reading the comments on my blog on 'Mengingati
              Pejuang-Pejuang', when I came across a comment which respectfully
              disagreed with me that the defeat of BN in the General Election was not
              due to support for the opposition but disaffection with BN.<br><br> 2.	He said if that was the case they could have voted for the third candidate who actually lost his deposit.<br><br> 3. I had lost in the Election of 1969 in a constituency with 35,000
              voters of whom 30,000 were Malays. I had won in this constituency in
              1964 with more than 4,000 votes majority. I figured that in 1969 that
              even if the non-Malay voters did not vote for me I would still win
              because support for me amongst the Malays had increased by almost 3,000.<br><br></span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">4.
              But what happened shocked me because Chinese voters not only refused to
              vote for me, which meant a loss of 3,000 votes but they voted for PAS.
              I needed 6,000 more votes to replace 3,000 voters who did not vote for
              me and another 3,000 because they voted for PAS.<br><br> 5. I lost by 900 votes. If the voters who were dissatisfied with UMNO
              and BN voted for a third party or refuse to vote, the BN would lose
              these votes but may still win if the margin previously was big and the
              opposition did not get additional votes. But when votes were taken away
              from BN there would be a decrease in BN votes. Then when the votes are
              given to the opposition there would be an increase in votes for the
              opposition and so the gap is widened and the opposition would win.<br><br> 6. Experience has shown that independent third parties hardly ever win.
              Supporting them would reduce BN votes but that would not be enough to
              ensure the opposition wins. <br><br> 7. The rakyat are right in being fed-up with corruption by UMNO
              "plutocrats". But that had not always been so. It is the corrupt
              practises of UMNO leaders of today, especially the topmost leader,
              which has caused deep anger against the party.<br><br> 8. Actually the present leader's involvement with graft, his support
              for his son's business, the power he gives to his son-in-law, his
              well-known sleeping habits, indecision, lack of ability to handle
              problems, sudden withdrawal of oil subsidy, cancellation of the bridge
              to Singapore, wasting money on the unused RM800 million (Johor Baru)
              Customs, Immigration and Quarantine building, cancellation of the
              railway double tracking and electrification project, the monsoon cup
              and lots more are what turned the voters against BN.<br><br> 9. The kampung folks and the ordinary Chinese by and large are not too
              concerned about human rights or more liberal Government. Even the ISA
              did not bother them as shown by their strong backing for the Government
              party, before.<br><br> 10. The talks in the kampungs and the ordinary Chinese and Indians were
              about the increase in cost of living, few business opportunities and of
              course the behaviour of the PM's family.<br><br> 11. In 2004 they gave wholehearted support for the BN so that the party
              won 90% of the seats in parliament and recaptured Terengganu. Could it
              be possible that the voters who were so greatly enchanted with the BN
              in 2004 but in a space of just four years have changed their collective
              minds so radically?<br><br> 12. As for rejection of race based politics, why did the voters vote
              for PAS, a 100 percent Malay party and DAP, a predominantly Chinese
              party.<br><br> 13. I know many who admire the West tend to support their values. They
              would like to interpret the disastrous performance of the BN based on
              Western thinking. But we are Asians and in Malaysia our basic racial
              differences are extreme. All we can do to avoid confrontation between
              the races is to allow them to form race based parties and to have them
              cooperate with each other. This was the BN policy and practise. And it
              worked for almost half a century. <br><br> 14.	We cannot fault the BN concept and governance.  We have to look elsewhere for the loss of confidence in the party.</span></p>

              <p><strong>THE BARISAN NASIONAL II</strong></p>
              <div class="asset-content entry-content">
              <div class="asset-body">
              <div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">1.
              When the Barisan Nasional did very badly in the March 2008 general
              elections, all the component parties except those in Sabah and Sarawak
              experienced losses as they had never done before.<br><br> 2. In the aftermath of the elections, the component parties pointed
              accusing fingers at each other. Very quickly they were at each other's
              throats.<br><br> 3.	There were talks about leaving the BN.  And now we are seeing the first party to do so and to become an independent party.  <br><br></span></div>

              Where before all parties avoided raising sensitive issues in public,
              now in the name of democracy and liberalism sensitive issues are
              brought up in which the component parties of the BN make known the
              differences in their view. The result is to widen the divide separating
              the BN component parties.<br><br> 5. When Ahmad Ismail made unpalatable remarks about the Chinese, it was
              made out that it was the view of UMNO itself. Far from denying it, the
              UMNO leadership accepted the blame and apologised. This solved nothing
              as the Chinese parties refused to accept the apology but demanded the
              culprit himself should apologise.<br><br> 6. He refused and UMNO whose president heads the Government suspended
              Ahmad for three years. This may satisfy some Chinese but almost
              immediately the Government arrested a Chinese MP under ISA. The effects
              of Ahmad's suspension have been nullified.<br><br> 7. Now the Malays are angry with the Chinese and the Chinese are angry
              with the Malays. Party-wise UMNO is angry with Gerakan and MCA and
              Gerakan/MCA are angry with UMNO.<br><br> 8. Threats to leave the BN are made by the Chinese parties, not just
              because of Ahmad's refusal to apologise but also because of the
              impression that they are subservient to UMNO. They believe that the
              failure of Chinese voters to vote for them was due to this junior
              position they hold in BN. To correct this impression they found it
              necessary to take pot shots at UMNO and defy the BN leadership.<br><br> 9. Privately UMNO, MCA Gerakan and MIC express their dislike of Dato
              Seri Abdullah and his Premiership. But none seem willing to acknowledge
              that it was dislike for Abdullah which caused the BN to lose the
              support of the people. Instead they picked on the parties and blame
              each other.<br><br> 10. At the rate things are going the BN might split asunder. If each
              party go their separate ways, none would become a force in Malaysian
              politics and certainly none, not even UMNO, can aspire to form the
              Government of Malaysia. Of course they can all join the Opposition
              under Anwar, but they would still play a subservient role in the
              Opposition. In any case the Opposition withi its ideological
              incompatibility would not make a good Government, capable of handling
              Malaysia's multi-racial population. It is difficult to think that the
              hodge-podge collection of incompatible parties can handle oncoming
              economic and financial problems that are inevitable.<br><br> 11. The stability of this country has been undermined by the weakness
              and incompetence of the current Government and the harsh bickering
              between the Government parties. A Government by the Opposition is not
              going to be any better and probably would be worse.<br><br> 12. Currently we are seeing the loss of confidence in the ability of
              the Government to deal with economic problems. Foreign investors are
              not coming and together with locals are pulling out their investments
              in the stock market. From a high of almost 1500 the index is now below
              1000. God knows how much market capital has been wiped out.<br><br> 13. The Ringgit is depreciating and may shrink further. The cost of
              living has shot up. Businesses are having a hard time already. The
              recent decision to tax excess profits of the Independent Power
              Producers has caused foreign investors and locals too to lose
              confidence. The tax has now been withdrawn but not for the first year.
              This alone would put the IPPs in trouble with their banks.<br><br> 14. In at least one case a foreign investor has been given back his
              deposit of almost 100 million Ringgit because allegedly there was some
              technical error.<br><br> 15. I once said Malaysia as a multi-racial country needs a strong
              government. Multi-racial countries have to face race relation problems.
              With the need to handle racial problems, the managment of the economy
              becomes extremely difficult.<br><br> 16.	I cannot see the Opposition with its loose organisation being able to handle Malaysia's racial and economic problems.<br><br> 17. In the past, the BN Government had managed to keep Malaysia stable
              and to develop the country as well. If it seems not to be able to do so
              now it is not because the BN as a party is no longer suitable for this
              country. It is simply due to very poor and incompetent leadership.<br><br> 18. The component parties of the BN should not think that their best
              hope is to see the demise of the BN. Rather they should all come
              together to resuscitate it. If it is necessary to dump the leader than
              they should do so. But destroying the BN will neither be good for the
              component parties nor for the nation.<br><br> 19. I am not an UMNO member even but I would like to suggest the
              component parties should stop blaming each other, stop taking pot-shots
              at each other. Instead they should all come together and review the
              structure of BN. They should try for a win-win or lose-lose solution in
              dealing with inter-party relations. They should listen to the people
              and to their own members and find ways to satisfy their needs; to
              overcome their dissatisfaction.<br><br> 20. There must be some new thinking on the BN concept. But the basic
              premises about close collaboration between the parties, about the need
              to help each other, to accommodate and deal with grouses together
              should be maintained.<br><br> 21. I believe that for this multi-racial, multi-lingual,
              multi-religious and multi-cultural country with extreme economic
              disparities, the BN is still the best political solution provider. It
              is still the best way for the different races to cooperate to govern
              this country.<br><br> 22.	As the Malays say "Because of one drop of indigo, a whole pot of milk is spoilt."<br><br> 23.	We must not throw out the baby with the bath water.<br><br> 24.	The BN is still relevant.  It is still the ideal coalition for Malaysia's multi-racial population.<br><br> </span></div>

              <div><strong>Pegging<br></strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">1.
              I am not in the business of advising the Government. When I mentioned
              the advisability of pegging the Ringgit, it was in answer to a question
              posed by a reporter. If the Government noticed the report I would feel
              flattered.
              <br><br>2. Pegging currencies is not as easy as it sounds. The whole
              thing must be studied very carefully. Even getting agreement by a
              select panel is not easy. A decision made on the spur of the moment
              that pegging is not possible cannot really reflect the assessment made
              together with experts in consultation.
              <br><br>3. Pegging need not be always with the US Dollar. But the fact
              that the US Dollar is currently not stable is no reason why the idea
              should be summarily dismissed.
              <br><br> </span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">4.
              There can be other options. Other more stable currencies can be used or
              a basket of currencies may be used to reduce extreme volatility.
              <br><br>5. The US Dollar is backed by nothing, not even reserves in
              foreign currencies and gold which other countries hold in order to back
              their own currencies. The US is a bankrupt nation which means it is not
              in a position to provide foreign currency backing for its money.
              <br><br>6. The gold in Fort Knox has been depleted long ago and the
              pegging to gold of a certain amount as agreed to at the Bretton Woods
              has been done away with by President Nixon. No more gold standards. Yet
              the US Dollar still commands a certain value in the market. It is still
              being used for trade payments. This in fact gives the US Dollar a
              certain value even though the value, in exchange rate terms may change.
              <br><br>7. If the US Dollar is not used in international trading, it
              will have no value at all. This will of course hurt a lot of countries
              including Malaysia which carry substantial sums of US Dollar as
              reserves. Countries like China, Saudi Arabia and tiny Singapore would
              want to support trade payments made in US Dollar. They do not want
              their huge reserves of US Dollar to become worthless.
              <br><br> 8.	What we see here is the importance of international trade payments in sustaining the value of a currency.
              <br><br>9. Long, long ago I suggested the use of a special currency for
              trade. The currency should be equal in value to a fixed amount of gold.
              It should not be used domestically as each country would have its own
              currency pegged to the special trading currency.
              <br><br>10. The price of gold may go up and down but we know that the
              price of gold today is more than, say, 30 years ago. If we keep gold
              long enough we will eventually see it appreciating. It is not as
              volatile as currency notes.
              <br><br>11. So gold is an ideal standard for a trade currency.
              Effectively we would be going back to the Gold Standard, both for the
              trading currency and the domestic currency. For the domestic currency
              the rate against gold can change in keeping with inflation.
              <br><br>12. It was suggested that we call this trading currency the
              "dinar". Transactions would of course not be in solid gold dinars but
              with equivalent papers. It is not practical to carry around so much
              gold dinars but this will not be necessary if a country's export to
              another country and its import from that country is fairly balanced and
              only the difference need to be paid.
              <br><br>13. I am not an expert in this area but we can get experts to
              study whether pegging or the gold dinar are feasible. I would not
              dismiss the eficacy of these so easily.
              <br><br> 14.	Perhaps I can make a ridiculous suggestion. Why not make all Malaysian trade payments in Malaysian Ringgit?
              <br><br>15. We are a big trading nation. We export more than 200
              billion Ringgit worth of raw material and manufactured goods and we
              import slightly less than that. Traders cannot just ignore us or
              boycott us. They need our exports and they need to sell their products
              to us. <br><br> 16. All we need to do is to demand payment in Malaysian Ringgit for our
              exports. We can require payment for our imports in Ringgit according to
              the current value in an international trading currency or gold.
              <br><br>17. If we do this there will be a constant demand for Ringgit
              and this will keep the value of the Ringgit at a certain level which we
              can fix, taking into consideration factors which influence its value.
              <br><br>18. This may sound like a ridiculous suggestion. But not being
              a trained economist or financier I can allow myself the privilege of
              unorthodox thinking.</span></p>

              <p><strong>THE UNITED STATES</strong></p>
              <div class="asset-body">
              <div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">1.
              I wonder what is happening to the United States of America. It used to
              lay down the laws and rules which the whole world must abide. If any
              country refuses then blacklisting, sanctions and even invasions by the
              US forces might ensue.<br><br> 2. It set the forms and standards for everything; systems of
              Government, human rights, economic transparency etc etc. Now it seems
              to be breaking or ignoring its own rules, regulations and laws.<br><br> 3. It had condemned the Internal Security Act as unjust and a violation
              of human rights. Following the shock and awe invasion of Iraq, it has
              detained alleged terrorists without trial and without rights and habeas
              corpus proceeings. Some detainees have been there for five years.
              <br><br> </span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">4.
              Then in Abu Ghraib detention camp detainees have been tortured and
              humiliated. They were treated like animals. If it had happened in some
              weak Asian country, the US would demand for all kinds of punishment
              which the US is ever ready to inflict. But no one can drag Americans to
              court and punish them. If at all American courts would try these
              miscreants and the punishment would be very light.<br><br> 5. Because of the extraordinary greed of American financiers and
              businessmen, they invent all kinds of ways to make huge sums of money.
              We cannot forget how in 1997-98 American hedge funds destroyed the
              economies of poor countries by manipulating their national currencies.<br><br> 6. When as a result of the so-called trade in currencies the companies
              in the poor countries faced bankruptcy, the Governments were told not
              to bail out any company or bank which was in deep trouble. The
              Americans claimed that these companies or banks were inefficient and
              they should be allowed to go bankrupt and perish. Better still they
              should be sold at fire-sale price to American investors.<br><br> 7. Yet today we see the US Government readying US700 billion to
              brazenly bail out banks, mortgage companies and insurance companies.<br><br> 8. Where does the money come from? From thin air as no real money in
              cash or bullion or anything tangible are moved into the bankrupt banks.
              The money is just in the form of loan papers and entries in the books
              of the banks or companies.<br><br> 9. The US 700 billion has no backing whatsoever. No gold reserves, no
              foreign currency reserves as required for other countries. Without such
              backing the US Dollar is actually useless. Only the military power of
              the US is forcing the world to give value to the US Dollar.<br><br> 10. Desperate to avoid a serious recession the US has abandoned all its
              principles. It has now banned short selling, limited currency trading
              and insist that the accounts of hedge funds and currency traders to be
              open for inspection and be published.<br><br> 11. In the final spasm of fear, the Government has given itself the
              right to resolve the problem of bankrupt banks and companies by the
              Government taking over i.e. the great capitalist country has accepted
              what is nothing more than nationalisation which it had condemned so
              much before.<br><br> 12. The US now owes the world US 14 trillion. There is no way it can
              ever settle this debt. If other countries fail to repay or service
              their debts, the US would demand that they be made bankrupt. Now the US
              is literally bankrupt but it still insists that the pieces of paper,
              the famous or infamous greenbacks have some value. It actually has no
              value. Certainly it cannot be used to finance wars of aggression
              against Iraq and Afghanistan, to finance the CIA (Central Intelligence
              Agency) activities in undermining Governments and countries. But still
              the US' ability to threaten countries is undiminished.<br><br> 13. An attempt is being made even in Malaysia to achieve a regime
              change. Money has been funnelled to certain individuals and parties to
              ensure that a well-known candidate with extensive connection to the US
              Jewish lobby would somehow become the Prime Minister of Malaysia.<br><br> 14. US intervention in the politics of Malaysia is clear. I may not
              agree with the leadership of the present Government but I resent and
              object to US manipulations to make a satellite of this nation. </span></p>

              <div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">1.	In a previous article I said that a multiracial country needs a strong Government.<br><br> 2. A weak Government would not be able to deal with the quarrelling
              between the races, which is the natural tendency of most multiracial
              societies. Indeed in some multiracial countries violence and fighting
              are common. Witness the countries around us.<br><br> 3. For the slightest reason the races would be at each other's throats.
              One incident was the reaction in some countries because of the currency
              crisis. <br><br></span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">4.
              Even religious differences can lead to conflict and violence. We see
              this in Northern Ireland, Lebanon, India, Indonesia and elsewhere. It
              is important to remember that in Malaysia racial differences are
              associated with religious differences. We are already seeing incidents
              involving religious differences.<br><br> 5. We now have a weak Government and clearly it is incapable of dealing
              with the tendency towards conflicts because of race and religion.
              Because of its weakness it commands little respect and even the weakest
              parties would thumb its collective noses at the Government. The
              Government apparently has no idea how to handle these problems. We see
              it apologising only to have it's apologies rejected.<br><br> 6. The worst part is to find its apologies causing anger among the race
              for whom it is apologising. It has managed to displease everyone; to
              please no one.<br><br> 7. Admittedly even a powerful Government, if it is incompetent and
              badly led would not manage to govern a multiracial country well. We see
              this happening with the present Government. In 2004 the people gave it
              almost unlimited power. But it was not able to use the power well and
              the people decided to reduce drastically its power. Now we see it
              floundering about, unable to deal with the sensitivities of a
              multiracial country.<br><br> 8. The BN was a 14-party coalition of big and small parties. Because it
              was powerful the component parties did not challenge it. They know if
              they left the coalition they would be unable to exert any pressure on
              anyone.<br><br> 9. Even if they join the opposition they would not be able to reduce
              the coalition's two-third majority enough to bring it down. For that
              reason none of the component parties would want to leave the coalition.<br><br> 10. On the other hand a coalition of two parties would be very weak.
              This is because the bigger party need the smaller partner in order to
              achieve majority to form the Government.<br><br> 11. Such a Government would be unstable as the smaller party could
              always threaten to leave and thus bring down the Government. On the
              other hand the smaller party can join the opposition giving it the
              majority to form a new Government.<br><br> 12. The reason the BN was able to create political stability before was
              because it could not be threatened by any one of its component parties.
              If any one left the Coalition would not collapse. The party quitting
              would be out in the wilderness.<br><br> 13. Presently because the Government coalition is weak every little
              party can thumb its nose at the Government. The Coalition Government
              could not afford to lose any component party's support. It is also not
              in a position to discipline its component parties.<br><br> 14. The weak Government lives in fear of being toppled by its
              components switching side to support the opposition. That is why we see
              such silly things as sending members of Parliament to a foreign country
              ostensibly to study agriculture.<br><br> 15. What does it mean to a multiracial country to have weak Government?
              The Government would not be able to concentrate on governing because it
              has to deal with continuous threats by its components of different
              races.<br><br> 16. The stability of the country would be undermined. This would be bad
              for the economy. We are seeing today investors pulling out their money
              by the billions from the stock market; we are seeing little investment
              either by locals or foreign investors.<br><br> 17. The trade balance is in our favour not because of anything smart
              done by this weak Government, but because the prices of oil, palm oil
              and rubber on the world market are very high (although now the prices
              are declining).<br><br> 18. Generally the economy is bad, as bad as the race politics that we
              are seeing. The people are the ones to pay the price. They are
              suffering from high prices with no compensating increase in income.<br><br> 19. We have had strong Governments for almost 50 years. When we gained
              independence few gave us any chance. They foresaw racial clashes and
              political instability.<br><br> 20. But they are wrong. With strong Governments in place, the bickering
              between races was reduced. The country was stabilised and with that the
              economy grew. The objective of becoming a developed country by 2020
              seems possible.<br><br> 21.	Now with this weak Government, with incompetent leadership the country is not developing as fast as it used to.<br><br> 22. In a single ethnic country it does not matter if the Government is
              weak because it will not have to deal with the heavy pressure of racial
              conflicts even if the Government is less competent.<br><br> 23. My observation of Malaysian politics over the last 50 years has
              convinced that a powerful Government lead by competent leaders is
              necessary for multi-racial Malaysia.</span></p>

              <p><strong>THE FINANCIAL TURMOIL AND MALAYSIA</strong></p>
              <div class="asset-body">
              <div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">1.
              I am glad to hear that Malaysia will be spared from the fallout of the
              systemic collapse of the whole world's financial system. This ability
              to isolate Malaysia and Malaysian banks from the effect of the
              bankruptcies of all the biggest banks in the world must be regarded as
              a miracle. Our ability to manage our financial system better than
              others must earn us the admiration of the world.<br><br> 2. I hope we are right in forecasting the effect on us of the collapse
              of the world's financial system. But I have a sneaking feeling that all
              is not well.<br><br> 3. We are a trading nation which trades with all countries of the
              world. The United States and Europe are among the biggest of our
              trading partners. Roughly 40 per cent of our total trade is with them.
              I may be wrong but I believe that if our buyers cannot pay for what
              they import from us, we would not make the profit we had expected. In
              fact we would lose a lot of money as we will not recover the cost of
              the goods we sell even.<br><br></span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">4.
              Now the common practise is for importers to open Letters of Credit
              (LCs) with banks to ensure that when they receive the goods the
              corresponding banks will release the money. However, if the importers'
              banks go bankrupt they would not be able to transmit the payment.<br><br> 5. They may be bailed out by the US Government. But they may not
              consider paying Malaysian exporters as a priority. In which case we
              will not be paid. Worse still we can no longer entertain orders coming
              from this market. Our trade must shrink.<br><br> 6. We are not talking about one company. We are talking about hundreds
              of companies trading with America and Europe and other countries not
              getting paid for their exports. We are talking about tens of millions,
              even hundreds of millions of Ringgit worth of goods not being paid for.<br><br> 7. These companies all borrow from banks to finance their operations.
              They hope to pay the banks from the proceeds of their export. When they
              cannot pay the banks, the banks in turn would have a lot of
              non-performing loans.<br><br> 8. The banks would be wary of lending money to not only the exporting
              companies but to others as well. There will be a credit squeeze which
              would hurt other businesses. There will be margin calls. When the
              borrowers cannot meet this there may be foreclosures.<br><br> 9. We see a lot of construction in Kuala Lumpur, all dependent on
              borrowed money. If these buildings are not sold or rented, payment by
              the developer to the banks would not be forthcoming. Again there will
              be a lot of non-performing loans.<br><br> 10. When the Government withdrew the subsidy for oil the pump price
              increased by 40 per cent. The immediate result was to increase the
              prices of a wide range of food, goods and services commonly needed by
              the people. In other words the purchasing power of the people had been
              reduced.<br><br> 11.	Since then the price of oil had been reduced three times. But the prices of food, goods and services have stayed up.<br><br> 12. Some cranks estimated that every citizen had lost purchasing power
              by RM300 a year. Since we have a population of 27million, the country's
              loss of purchasing power amounts to RM8.1 billion. That is a lot money
              which is lost by food suppliers, cooked and uncooked, goods and service
              providers at various levels. A lot of small businesses would just fold
              up.<br><br> 13.	The Government has given back some money but not enough to reduce the losses sustained by the economy.<br><br> 14. Now the corridors cannot be fully implemented. But this is fine
              because nothing had been implemented anyway. Unfortunately the
              anticipated earnings by contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers,
              workers, teh tarik and nasi lemak sellers would not materialise.<br><br> 15. Maybe we will not need several hundred billions to bail out our
              banks. But the banks will also face the problem of unpaid loans
              incurred by their credit card users. They have been rather lax in
              providing credit card facilities to their customers, many of whom have
              no accounts with them. It is believed that unpaid credit card loans is
              in excess of RM20 billion. <br><br> 16. Will the Government guarantee depositors will not lose their
              deposits when the banks which had in the past made huge profits now go
              bankrupt because of their mismanagement?<br><br> 17. This is what the peoples of America and Europe are asking. Their
              money is used to bail out the banks whose profits had enriched their
              Chief Executive Officers and their share holders so much in the past.
              The people did not get a share of the profit, but they must pay for the
              losses.<br><br> 18. We are told that six billion Ringgit in Foreign Direct Investment
              would flow into the country. But what about the RM30 billion outflow as
              foreign investors pulled out of the stock market?<br><br> 19. I pray that I am wrong. I pray that the Government is right in
              declaring that the whole world may collapse but we would be the only
              country which won't. We will sail calmly through the seas of shattered
              economies.<br><br> 20. What is happening in the world today is the total collapse of the
              international financial system. This has been brought about by greedy
              people abusing the system. Instead of doing business in goods and
              services they now do business in money, in fictitious money.<br><br> 21. We had experienced the effects of the trade in our currency in
              1997-98. For no very good reason, our Ringgit was devalued so that its
              purchasing power was halved. And we became poor.<br><br> 22. Fortunately for us we succeeded in stopping the trade in Ringgit
              and restoring its value. But the system is still in place. And now it
              is the US Dollar which is devalued.<br><br> 23. But trading in currencies is only one of the abuses. The banks are
              lending more money than they have. They actually go to the people to
              persuade them to borrow.<br><br> 24.	Their clients can borrow 100 per cent of the money to buy a house for example.<br><br> 25. They need not worry about paying or servicing the loan. The price
              of the house would appreciate. You may even have a second mortgage. You
              may even sell at a profit.<br><br> 26. In the meantime the bank would register the loan and add the
              projected earnings from interest maybe over 20 years. That done the
              bank can put all the loans together and sell it to the hedge funds at a
              discount after adding potential interest.<br><br> 27. The more risky the loan the higher would be the interest and the
              higher would be the profit. The hedge funds which buy the loans can
              basically sell the mortgages to investors in the fund or to the huge
              Government financed Federal National Mortgage Association, nicknamed
              Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Mortgage Corporation, nicknamed
              Freddie Mac. <br><br> 28.	Now the hedge funds and the banks would feel safe and enjoy the huge profits that they have made.<br><br> 29. But when hundreds of thousands of house buyers find themselves
              unable to pay simply because they have no money, and could not sell the
              houses and could not borrow from banks, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae
              would not be able to pay the hedge funds. Then the hedge funds would
              collapse and drag down the banks with them.<br><br> 30. This simply is what happened. The same applies to credit cards.
              People with little or no money would be given credit cards. They would
              spend more than they can afford and the banks would be faced with huge
              amounts of non-performing loans. The banks cannot pay the bills
              submitted by the sellers of goods or suppliers of services. The banks
              would collapse and there would be a run on the banks and on other banks
              which had lent the money to the affected banks. And so we see one after
              another of the giant banks of America and Europe going bankrupt.<br><br> 31.	The Government may try to bail them out. But the confidence does not last long. Soon the bailout would be seen to  fail.<br><br> 32. Actually I am giving a very simplified version of what is
              happening. All these shuffling of papers and figures cannot but
              encourage cheating. The bigger the amount of money involved the bigger
              would be the returns. The tendency is therefore to play with very large
              sums of money.<br><br> 33. But where does the money come from? From nowhere. The Government
              and the banks, including the Federal Reserve Bank conjured up the money
              from nothing. If you ask yourself where do the US700 billion Dollars
              come from when you know the United States' Government has to borrow
              US1.5 billion every day, you will find no answer. Is the US Government
              holding US700 billion Dollars in its treasury just in case it has to
              bail out the banks? Not likely when it cannot even make ends meet, when
              it has twin deficits.<br><br> 34. So money can be conjured up out of thin air. And this must be the
              money the banks lent, the money the hedge funds and currency traders
              play with, the payments for expensive wars etc.<br><br> 35. Basically the international financial system and the market economy
              has failed. Unless and until a new system is introduced and Governments
              regulate with the running and operation of national and international
              finance and the so-called free market we are going to see the financial
              turmoil and collapse repeated over and over again.</span></p>

              <div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';"><strong>LITIGATION</strong><br><br> 1.	Malaysian politicians seem to be resorting to litigation in order to gag their critics and detractors.<br><br> 2. When I was PM and Anwar Ibrahim was being tried, he sued me for 100
              million Ringgit for some statements that I made. I had to find lawyers
              to take up my case. Fortunately I won. Otherwise I would have been
              bankrupted.<br><br> 3. When the press asked me about Anwar's acquittal I pointed out that
              though the two judges in the Appeals Court cleared Anwar on the basis
              that the complainant was not a reliable witness and that the "event"
              did not take place on the date as reported in the charge, but they
              still said they believed that Anwar did indulge in sodomy.<br><br></span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">4.	Of course the third judge concluded that Anwar was indeed guilty of sodomy.<br><br> 5. The press reported my answer. Following that Anwar sued me again for
              100 million Ringgit and again I had to employ lawyers to defend me.<br><br> 6. It is now three years since the suit and I don't know whether it is
              sub-judice or not but I am scared to talk about it. Effectively the
              suit has gagged me. It is no different from being censored by the
              Government.<br><br> 7. If eventually the court decides that I am not guilty I suppose I am
              entitled to be compensated for the cost incurred. But I don't think I
              would be paid.<br><br> 8.	On the other hand if I lose I would be made a bankrupt.<br><br> 9. The amount that the litigants sue for is usually extremely big,
              running into one hundred million even. The litigant knows the person he
              sues would not be able to pay. But that doesn't matter. It would deter
              him and others too from exposing his (litigant's) misdeeds in the
              future.<br><br> 10. I get a feeling that the court is being made use of by these
              politicians to hide their misdeeds and to prevent them from being made
              political issues.<br><br> 11.	I feel sure we will be seeing more suits by politicians in the future.<br><br> <em>Viva Malaysian politics!!</em></span></p>

I was interviewed by the BBC on the current financial turmoil and over management of the currency crisis in 1997 - 98.<br><br> 2. I was amused when he attributed the pegging and the elimination of
              CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) to Dato Seri Anwar Ibrahim. I asked him
              whether he was given this information by Anwar. He did not answer. <br><br> 3. Of course I did not do everything by myself. I had a lot of help
              from others. But Anwar was not one of them. He, many will remember, was
              the Minister of Finance who implemented the IMF strategy without the
              IMF with disastrous results. </span></div>

              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';"><strong>COMMENTS </strong><br><br> 1.	When I started my blog I expected many criticisms to be levelled at me when I wrote articles against the Government. <br><br> 2. I am disappointed that those who made critical comments never argued
              their cases against me. All they could say is that I was worse when I
              was Prime Minister or that all the problems began during my time. No
              supporting evidence at all. And obviously not even true. <br><br> 3.	Clearly the quality of these carping commentors leaves much to be desired.<br><br> RUBBISH <br><br> 1. We are great producers of rubbish - not the verbal kind, although
              that also - but real solid waste. But we are not keen on their disposal.<br><br> 2. Rubbish dumps, legal and illegal are everywhere. Land fills which
              seem to be the preferred method are really hazardous to health. When
              rain falls and leaches the waste, the water would seep into the ground
              and pollute ground water. This water flows into the land around and may
              get into the water supply. At least New Water in Singapore is
              thoroughly filtered and rendered safe though not aesthetically
              acceptable. But our ground water is not filtered and can poison the
              soil and ourstreams and rivers.<br><br> 3. The Government had wanted to build a modern incinerator like the
              ones in Japan. These Japanese incinerators are located in the
              residential area. They produce hardly any smoke from their very tall
              chimneys. The incinerator is so clean that the locals use them as their
              recreation area. I have never heard of the Japanese complaining against
              incinerators being located in their residential areas. <br><br> 4. But we in Malaysia have higher standards of cleanliness. We do not
              want even the cleanest incinerators to be located anywhere near where
              we live. We prefer to dump the rubbish untreated on land. Soon we will
              be having rubbish mountains like in a neighbouring country where
              scavengers can recover discarded items which can be washed and sold to
              the not so rich. <br><br> 5. Incidentally I am told that in the United Kingdom every household
              has to have three rubbish bins; one each for plastics, glass and
              perishables. If the rubbish inspectors finds that there is nothing in
              the bins the householder will be fined for throwing his rubbish
              elsewhere. Will we accept sorting our rubbish and dumping them into the
              correct bin! I think not. That is for the Government to do, as we pay
              taxes precisely for sorting our rubbish.</span></p>

              <div><strong>CONGRATULATIONS OBAMA</strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">1.
              I would like to add my congratulations to the millions that Barack
              Obama must have received for his great victory for the Presidency of
              the United States of America.<br><br> 2. Only a few years ago I thought it was impossible for a black man to
              become President of white United States, the country where the blacks
              used to be the slaves of the whites.<br><br> 3.	But attitudes have certainly changed radically among the white people.  Their support for Obama is overwhelming.<br><br></span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';"> 4. There are many reasons why Obama managed to break through white
              prejudice. But President Bush has contributed much towards the
              acceptance of black Obama.<br><br> 5. The Presidency of George Bush Junior must go down in American
              history as the worse ever. Arrogant, narrow-minded, autocratic,
              inconsiderate and totally uncaring for the views of others and even of
              his own countrymen, Bush created a demand for change as no other US
              President had ever created.<br><br> 6. There was a lot about wanting to have Obama come in but there was
              more about wanting to have Bush and his ilk out. And McCain as the
              Republican candidate simply increased the desire of the Americans to
              have nothing to do with anyone even remotely identified with Bush. <br><br> 7.	Obama made such a contrast from Bush that the voters must have felt they were voting against Bush as much as for Obama.<br><br> 8. But Obama is also unfortunate. To be different from Bush in attitude
              and foreign policy is not going to be too difficult. But Obama is
              coming in at a time when the US and the World are experiencing the
              worst of economic and financial crises. While he might succeed in
              changing foreign policy he is not likely to be able to solve the
              economic and financial crises, not in the near future certainly.<br><br> 9. Bail-outs are not going to work. We have seen that already. Even
              partial or complete nationalization of banks and other financial
              institutions will not really help in turning things around.<br><br> 10. Obama will be hard put to find a solution. He has five years. If he
              fails it is not going to be good for the new President. Certainly it
              will not be good for the first black President.<br><br> 11.	The world will be watching.  It is easier to say change than to actually change.<br><br> 12.	I wish him the best of luck.</span></p>

              know very well should have been found guilty of CBT etc. I knew him as
              a good officer who was conscientous when doing his work. I also
              remember the Minister involved telling me how profitable was the "koi"
              breeding and orchid ventures. But suddenly there was this accusation
              against Aziz. Apparently the ventures were not profitable at all. I
              wonder why!<br><br> 3. I am sorry for the sufferings Aziz went through. Miscarriages of

              <div><strong>PAYOUT FOR JUDGES</strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">1.	Now we know how much has been paid out to the judges.<br><br> 2. It is not bad at all. The Government must have plenty of money to
              give away for something that the Government says is not an admission of
              guilt and does not merit an apology. This generous act is unprecedented
              but must now be taken as a precedence. We should see more money being
              doled out every time a Minister feels a need to be popular with the
              Opposition. I wonder whether the amount of ex-gratia is based on how
              much the ex-de facto Minister of Justice considers would please the Bar
              Council.<br><br> 3. The Minister informs us that the judges had been drawing full
              pension for the last 20 years. The highest pension is RM6,548.59 per
              month. Roughly this adds up to RM1,600,000 for 20 years.<br><br></span></div>
              </div>

              <div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">4.
              Judges in Malaysia are paid two pensions - one at 55 years and one at
              65 years. As I pointed out before one judge actually draws three
              pensions. Is the sum mentioned the total or just one?<br><br> 5.
              Assuming that the highest pension is paid to the most senior of the
              judges, then he would have done extremely well to get RM5,000,000.00
              (Five million Ringgit). He would have to draw pension for another 60
              years to get RM5 million. Truly the Government is generous.<br><br> 6. Were the judges sacked or suspended? I think they were sacked. The
              records say so. Now the Minister says "No", the judges were not sacked
              or suspended. <br><br> 7.	Why pay them compensation if they are not sacked or suspended and they did not even lose their pension rights?<br><br> 8.	Were they allowed to continue being judges, to preside over cases brought before them? I cannot remember them doing this.<br><br> 9.	Really the Salleh saga gets curiouser and curiouser.</span></div>

              <div><strong> RACISM AND 2008 ELECTIONS</strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">1.
              When the Barisan Nasional did badly in the March 2008 General Election,
              foreign observers and many in this country were jubilant because they
              claim that it marked the demise of racial politics and racial parties
              in Malaysia.<br><br> 2. I did not agree with this simplistic view and I had put my thoughts
              on this blog. I believed that it was rather protest against the
              failures of the Abdullah Government that caused many Barisan Nasional
              members and supporters to vote for the opposition. But many still
              insist that race based politics is no longer relevant in Malaysia. Is
              it?<br><br> 3. If it is because the Malaysian electorate had rejected racial
              politics, why did they vote for such parties as PAS, a very Malay
              Muslim party, and DAP, a Chinese dominated party. Even the Keadilan is
              made up of violently racist Hindraf Indians, Chinese dissatisfied with
              the MCA's representation of the Chinese in BN and self-serving Malays
              who could not find a place in the other Malay parties.<br><br></span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">4.
              These three parties did not campaign for human rights or open
              Governments or even against the Internal Security Act. PAS had made no
              secret of their Islamic State pretensions. DAP talked of Malaysian
              Malaysia which was the battle cry of its very Chinese PAP antecedents
              of Singapore (no non-Chinese PM) and Keadilan talked about reforms
              etc., but the stress was on Hindu Rights and anti-Malay racism.<br><br> 5. Their accredited supporters who may really subscribe to their creeds
              had never been big enough to make them strong opposition parties in the
              past. They were never able to deny the BN a 2/3rd majority. It should
              be remembered that Keadilan won only one seat in the 2004 elections.
              The other two, DAP and PAS did not do much better either.<br><br> 6. It was the defection by the BN party members which resulted in the
              opposition parties, regardless of the quality of their candidate
              getting the large number of votes to win so many more seats than they
              or anybody else expected.<br><br> 7. Apart from the voters supporting the essentially race based
              opposition parties, the claim that it was the rejection of racial
              politics which led to the poor results by the BN has also not been
              borne out by the attitudes and debates by Malaysians post 2008
              elections.<br><br> 8. What we are witnessing today is an explosion of racial politics that
              is more bitter and blatant than ever before. Even the least observant
              cannot fail to notice how Malaysian politics now is more about racial
              inequities than about liberalism, human rights, openness etc.<br><br> 9. True there has been quite a lot of discussion on the ISA. But most
              of the angry and bitter discussion is about Malay "privileges", about
              the Social Contract, about the Deputy Prime Minister and Prime Minister
              being Malays, about UMNO bullying, about being or not being immigrants,
              about Malay dominance. Even the criticisms regarding the way judges are
              appointed or promoted have elements of race that is hardly disguised.<br><br> 10. Truly Malaysian politics have not been decoupled from racial
              sentiments and loyalties. And it is going to remain so for as long as
              the different races prefer to be separated and divided, prefer to
              strongly uphold their languages, cultures and their historical origins
              and links. All that is said about reforms and liberalism is mere lip
              service.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Zaid Ibrahim and UMNO</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">1.	UMNO has now sacked Zaid Ibrahim from the party. <br><br> 2. This is the man who was held in high esteem by UMNO President Dato
              Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi so that from among hundreds of UMNO leaders
              of sorts, he chose Zaid Ibrahim, a dubious character who could not be
              accepted even by his own Kota Bahru division and was not made a
              candidate in the 2008 Election. It is known that Zaid was in Perth,
              Australia during the elections. <br><br> 3. Seeing Zaid's behaviour toward UMNO lately, the rumours that he was
              supporting the opposition against the UMNO/Barisan Nasional candidate
              in the March 2008 Elections must have been true. <br><br> 4. Now Zaid has left his benefactor with controversial issues which can
              only undermine the support for UMNO / Barisan Nasional whatever his
              benefactor may try to do. And Najib will inherit these headaches when
              he takes over. <br><br> 5.	Seems that I am not the only one to make wrong choices.</span></p>

              <p><strong>ABDULLAH'S MARCH</strong></p>
              <div class="asset-body">
              <div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">1.
              When Dato Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi announced that he would be
              stepping down in March 2009 he said he needed the extra three months to
              complete certain missions he had set out to do.<br><br> 2. These initiatives, he said, are needed "to regain the country's
              competitiveness, to face the challenges that the world has in store for
              us".<br><br> 3. Among the initiatives are the reform of the judiciary, the setting
              up of an Anti-Corruption Commission, Special Complaints Commission,
              equitable distribution of the fruits of growth, strengthening and
              enlarging the social safety net, development of corridor initiatives
              etc etc.<br><br></span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">4.
              It is now December 2008. So far we have seen no progress at all in any
              of these glorious initiatives. Instead the Prime Minister is busy
              visiting foreign countries with his family in the beatiful, big and new
              Airbus A320.<br><br> 5. After announcing that there is no money to build the second Penang
              Bridge, the contract was signed during the PM's China visit to build
              the bridge after all. There is a lot of money involved here.<br><br> 6. In Uzbekistan, Petronas is to invest a few hundred million Ringgit.
              Trips are also scheduled for Iran and Turkmenistan. No doubt more
              contracts and more money would be involved. Some contractors will
              benefit.<br><br> 7. After failing to implement any of the promises made in the 2004 or
              2008 elections, it looks like nothing is being done either with regards
              to the promise to carry out a variety of so-called reforms as mentioned
              in the press statement on why the PM would step down in March 2009 -
              three months after the scheduled UMNO General Assembly.<br><br> 8. But the visits to foreign countries to sign contracts which were not
              mentioned in the statement are being assiduously carried out.<br><br> 9.	I wonder why.<br><br> 10. On the political front Abdullah has been busy campaigning for his
              chosen candidates for the posts of Deputy President, Wanita chief and
              Pemuda chief and other posts which will lead to appointments as
              Ministers.<br><br> 11.	Najib is going to be surrounded by Abdullah's people and through these people Abdullah will control the Government of Najib.<br><br> 12. Najib has already abandoned Muhyiddin, the fierce critic of
              Abdullah. He does not want to incur the displeasure of his boss. Would
              he refuse to appoint Abdullah's nominees? Would he dare go against them?</span></p>
