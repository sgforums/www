            <div class='col-md body'>Our gov constantly laude and claim we are a Medical Hub, World Class in this or that. But are they at all aware of the level of arrogance and incompetence in terms of HR with patients - especially locals??<br><br>Systems here in place are perhaps efficient, but are they intentionally made to be VOID of any human touch?<br><br>======================================================<br>WE DIDN'T SEND HER HOME<br>HOSPITAL APOLOGISES, BUT DENIES REFUSING WOMAN ADMITTANCE<br>By Tay Shi An<br><br>September 11, 2006<br><br>SORRY if the conduct of the nurse hurt you, the hospital told Madam Rahimah.<br><br>A KKH spokesman said: 'We apologise if our nurse's remarks caused Madam Rahimah and her family any distress.<br><br>--Jonathan Choo<br>'We have since reminded our staff to be more sensitive in their communication with our patients and their family members, and to be more attentive to their needs.'<br><br>Madam Rahimah was upset because she felt she was not properly counselled or given enough explanation on what was happening to her and her baby.<br><br>'This had never happened to us before. We didn't know what to do,' she said.<br><br>She said a medical social worker saw her only three days later.<br><br>'I just lost my baby - it was a big blow to me,' she said.<br><br>The day after she was discharged, she called KKH to ask for an explanation over the way she was treated during her hospital stay.<br><br>The hospital said it would get back to her within two weeks. It was almost three weeks after her call that she received a letter from the hospital. It said it needed another two weeks to investigate.<br><br>KKH apologised for the delay.<br><br>The spokesman said the hospital has since tightened its procedures to ensure that patients' feedback is promptly attended to.<br><br>She added: 'We empathise with Madam Rahimah's loss and extend our deepest condolences to Madam Rahimah and her family.'<br><br>KKH noted that it had provided her with 'appropriate treatment and medical management'.<br><br>According to its own checks, its spokesman said she had not been 'sent home' on 10 Aug but was actually offered immediate admission.<br><br>The spokesman said Madam Rahimah and her husband turned down the offer as they had to make childcare arrangements for their other children.<br><br>However, even if she had been admitted straight away, KKH said the C-section would still have taken place only the next morning.<br><br>NOT EMERGENCY CASE<br><br>Madam Rahimah was not operated on immediately as her condition was deemed stable and she didn't need an emergency C-section, the spokesman said.<br><br>She could not have the operation when she returned later that night to 'ensure that more resources would be readily available should any complication arise during the operation'.<br><br>The spokesman said: 'At the ward level, our doctors and nurses also provided Madam Rahimah with the necessary emotional support and when additional help was deemed to be necessary, our medical social worker stepped in to help (her) cope.'<br><br>All patients in the hospital are accorded the same level of medical care, she added.<br><br></div>
