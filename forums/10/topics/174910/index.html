            <div class='col-md body'>According to the Straits Times today parliment increased the Presidents salary by $100k to a new annual salary of $2.5million .

            <div class='col-md body'>A US President gets paid annualy US$400,000 (S$672,000). Everyone knows that. So how is it that our Mr. Nathan gets paid $2,507,000 (US$1,500,000) for cutting ribbons? By the way I'm sure this S$2.5million does not even include Mr. Nathans healthcare benefits, pension pot when he retires etc. What is the value of his benefits package in total? How come NO MP objects to the size of the Presidents salary during any parliment sittings?<br><br>Check out CNN Report below<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Bushes pay $268,719 in federal taxes<br>Cheneys report $945,051 in income<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush and first lady Laura Bush earned $771,940 in taxable income this past year and paid $268,719 in federal income taxes, the White House said Friday.<br><br>Both figures are up from 2001, when the first family reported $711,453 and paid $250,221 in federal taxes.<br><br>This past year's earnings included the president's $400,000 annual salary and income from trusts, the White House said.<br><br>The Bushes donated $82,700 to churches and charitable organizations, ranging from donations to September 11 charitable funds, and to the Tarrytown United Methodist Church in Austin, Texas, and Southern Methodist University, Mrs. Bush's alma mater.<br><br>Vice President Dick Cheney and Lynne Cheney made $945,051 in 2002 and got a tax refund of $95,858. The Cheneys had paid $436,972 in taxes through withholding and estimated tax payments, when it turned out they owed $341,114, his office said.<br><br>The income included the vice president's $190,134 salary. In addition, Cheney earned $162,392 as a result of deferred compensation from when he headed Halliburton Company. In December 1998, Cheney deferred his 1999 salary as Halliburton chief executive, electing instead for it to be paid over five years, his office said.<br><br>The Cheneys' income also included Lynne Cheney's earnings for her work at American Enterprise Institute, Reader's Digest and American Express Mutual Funds.<br><br>The Cheneys donated $121,983 to charity in 2002, most of it from donating Mrs. Cheney's royalties from her book "America: A Patriotic Primer" and her forthcoming book "A is for Abigail."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With the latest salary raise of President Nathan, citizens have every right to ask :<br><br>What are the criteria for giving salaries increments or bonuses to our leaders, e.g. president, speaker of the house, prime minister, minister mentor, senior minister, senior ministers of state, ..and senior civil servants etc.<br><br>Is there any objective and independent yardstick such as posted at Government Performance Benchmark in this forum to assess the effectiveness, efficiency or abilities of president. ministers and government's officers?<br><br>In assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of the government, will consideration be given to the prolonged recessions during 1997-2002 when hundreds and thousands of jobs were lost and ministers are putting the blames on external forces. If their effectivenss or efficiency is discovered or reported only after and long after other Asian Tiger economies have recovered, could the GDP growths of 5.5 % in 2005 be fairly and accountably attributed to our ministers' efforts and abilities to let them quote the GDP to give them the salaries increments and exceptional self-approved rewards in the manner is being done in President Nathan's raise.<br><br>Finally, the government has based its ministers' salaries and bonuses and retirement annuities on some talents equated formula. Are they now saying that President Nathan has to be given more monies to be more talented in his works or to avoid or prevent corruptions?<br><br>If we are to accept the government's recommendation of ministers' salaries and use president Nathan's case as a test for such rationale e.g. talent base, corruption prevention or implementation results, can we have some figures to show in fact there is a correlated relationship of these 3 variables.</div>

So they are like serving not because they truly want to serve singapore ? Who gets to say in the cap of the ministers wage ? There are singaporeans out there who are jobless or get paid very little barely enough to support their family.  There should be more transparency on the wage of the nation's leaders, the ministers. Singapore has been on the move to towards an open society so why shouldn't we know how much out leaders earn ? Since we contribute by paying CPF and other taxes.</div>
