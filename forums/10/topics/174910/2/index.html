Not bad for a guy who spends most of the time cutting ribbions and entertains guest at the Istana Plus he is 'supposed' to keep an eye on the government machinery. Even George Bush does not get paid that much when he has the entire worlds problems on his shoulders!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello....<br><br>Maybe I could say something a little?<br><br>I think, the high salary is to compensate for his high role. He is a head of state. When you say he only cuts ribbons, it doesn't matter, he cuts ribbons in his capacity as a head of state.<br><br>Therefore, his salary must be commensurate with his position.<br><br>Secondly, when considering renumeration package, an important element must be a perception of 'equity' across the hirearchy and rank-and-file. When MPs, ministers, PM are already earning a lot, the salary of the president must rise in accordance with his higher hirearchy. This principle applies in any organization. You can't imagine a president earning less than a minister, can u?<br><br>So if you were to lower that salary of that president, u have to revamp the entire pay scale structure of the civil servant system.<br><br>Basically, I think the high renumeration in Singapore civil service is a plus, not a minus instead. It is one of the main tenets of why Singapore can be like it is today.<br><br>Regarding 'cutting of ribbon' , this phrase implies a lookdown on his ceremonial roles. Please remember ceremonies and symbolism and national figurehead, these are important part of the overall nation building, as important as the work of a minister or a general.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our leaders copy the private sector of a smaller country to pay themselves $2,000,000.00 per annum for the prime minister and $2,500,000.00 p a for the president.<br><br>If US President is to apply this same  reasoning, he would probably be worth US$25,000,000.00 per annum or more and could easily cite Singapore's ministers and President pay as precedents.<br><br>He can also use the excuse or justification that higher salaries would prevent or avoid corruptions.<br><br>Our leaders have from time to time advise the citizens "not to open the Pandora Box" when it comes to welfarism or settings of bad precedents in policy decision.<br><br>By making making the salary comparison with the bosses' pays (some are drawing from their own monies in the company investment profits) they are in fact setting bad precedents or "opening up the Pandora Box". There will now be endless comparisons from one sector to the next from public sector to private and private to public sector.<br><br>It is very easy to see why the government needs to pay NKF CEO %600,000 per annum as he is copying benchmark salaries artificially pushed up and wrongfully set to the investment profitability pays of bosses by the civil servant and ministers.<br><br>The list of salary snowballing to keep up with the ministers' own highly inflated pays goes on and on for all in the civil service and GLC employees some of whom are rewarded for loyalty or connections without competition or assessments of performance by accountable and transparent system.<br><br>No wonder SBS with all the civil servants seconded there carrying all the highly inflated pays cannot be competitive and cannot lower their costs and SIA Pilots refused to accept advice to take pay cuts during the recent spat with MM Lee.<br><br>Government leaders have always said that they are prepared to debate their polices and problems with robustness or debunk them so to speak. So far when it comes to ministers' salary issue, I don't see that they are able to enter into any robust debates or reply to forumers' posts on such issues.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore Ministers Pay, Legitimised Corruption<br>Singapore Review, 2 May 2003 (updated May 2005)<br>By Mellanie Hewlitt<br><br>The headlines blared loudly in the 2 May 2003 issues of the Straits Times and Business Times "Pay cut? Ministers ready to lead by example: DPM", announcing to the entire world this selfless act of leadership by Singapore's Ruling Elite.<br><br>In what appeared to be an initial move to reduce severely inflated salaries, to more reasonable industry standards, Singapore's Ruling Elite have bowed to public pressure and hinted at accepting a pay cut.<br><br>Or have they?<br><br>What exactly does "Leading By Example" mean? Lets try to put some substance behind those brave words. As of last count, average take home pay of a Singapore minister was well in excess of SGD100,000/- a month.<br><br>The below table puts things back in proper perspective: (these are basic figures as of July 2000 and did not include last year's pay hikes or other benefits. Otherwise the updated numbers may well be much larger)<br><br>1. Singapore President's Basic Salary US$1,483,000 (SGD$2,373,100)*a year<br>Singapore Prime Minister's Basic Salary US$1,100,000 (SGD1,958,000) a year<br>Minister's Basic: US$655,530 to US$819,124 (SGD1,166,844 to SGD1,458,040) a year<br><br>2. United States of America President: US$200,000 Vice President: US$181,400 Cabinet Secretaries: US$157,000<br><br>3. United Kingdom Prime Minister: US$170,556 Ministers: US$146,299 Senior Civil Servants: US$262,438<br><br>4. Australia Prime Minister: US$137,060 Deputy Prime Minister: US$111,439 Treasurer: US$102,682<br><br>5. Hong Kong Chief Executive : US$416,615 Top Civil Servant: US$278,538 Financial Sec: US$315,077<br><br>Source: Asian Wall Street Journal July 10 2000 *Singapore President's salary which was updated in 2005 from the Singapore Straits Times<br><br>In relative terms, less then 20% of Singaporeans here have take home salaries<br>exceeding SGD100,000/- A YEAR.<br><br>In stark contrast, BASIC SALARY FOR A MINISTER STARTS AT SGD1,166,844 A YEAR,OR JUST UNDER SGD100,000 A MONTH.<br><br>What these ministers earns in just ONE MONTH exceeds the ANNUAL TAKE HOME<br>salary of 80% of Singapore's income earning population. Lets not even begin to compare annual packages which will exceed SGD1 million easily.<br><br>With the above numbers and figures now in perspective, it is easier to give substance to the words "leading by example". Several facts are noteworthy here;<br><br>a) That the ministerial salaries are grossly out of proportion, even when compared with their counterparts in much larger countries (US and UK) who have far heavier responsibilities.<br><br>b) That these salary reductions were long overdue. In the past, such handsome  remuneration were "justified" on the back of resounding performance. However,  Singapore's economy has been in the doldrums of a recession for several years  now (with beginnings reaching as far back as the 1997 Asian economic crisis).  This economic barometer is a rough measure of performance and implies that  ministerial salaries were due for review at least 3-4 years ago.<br><br>c) That adjustments should be made to bring them back within the industry  benchmarks. Taking the salary of US vice president as a rule of thumb, the  percentage for reductions should start at 50% of current pay. Even if a Singapore minister takes a 50% pay-cut, he would still be earning much more then the US vice president.<br><br>d) The percentage reductions should greater then 50% if the intent is to bring  the salaries within the perspective of Singapore's domestic scene.<br><br>With such inflated figures, it is understandable why the local government controlled media (Singapore Press Holdings) have taken pains to exclude mention of actual numbers for the world to see. The numbers would be too glaring and no amount of window dressing or creative writing could have reconciled these numbers with a sane figure and restored credibility.<br><br>Also relevant is the question whether such highly paid million dollar ministers can ever relate to the plight of the average man on the street. The remarks of Mrs Goh Chok Tong, that a SGD600,000/- per annum salary (of NKF CEO) is PEANUTS, is a harsh reflection of the real mind-sets, priorities and values of Singapore's million dollar ministers. And it is these same million dollar elitist bureucrats who will shape and determine public policies which will touch on the daily lifelihoods of every Singaporean.<br><br>It is unlikely that Singapore's Ruling Elite will accept such huge salary cuts. Exactly How much and when the ministerial pay-cuts takes effect is not revealed. Ask any man on the street and 9 out of 10 responses indicate many agree the current ministerial salaries are grossly inflated, especially in these lean and difficult times.<br><br>Said a long time forumer from an internet political chat group:<br>"First of all the Ministers are NOT leading on pay cut. Workers' salaries have been drastically reduced since the beginning of the recession while thousands have been unemployed. so the Ministers are NOT LEADING. they are only CATCHING UP. And they have several decades to catch up on."<br><br>"Secondly, how much of a pay cut will Ministers take? 10%? 20%? unless its a cut that will affect their lifestyles, it is merely symbolic and they would still not know what it feels like to be a normal worker. as such, this is not Leading by Example. Its just another bogus political propaganda stunt"<br><br>A 29 yr old executive who requested to remain anonymous admitted sheepishly ; "The numbers (ministerial salaries) are a national embarrassment really, because it reflects the underlying materialistic value systems of Singapore Ministers. No matter how you look at it, the fact remains that our ministers are money faced, and these are supposed to be Singapore's leaders, with value systems that Singaporeans should follow." "It (the ministerial salaries) puts Singapore in a bad light in the eyes of the world. The rest of Singaporeans really put in an honest days work for every penny they earn. And the process for review and approval of the ministerial salaries is also a joke. Imagine sitting on the board and approving (on White Paper)your own salary increments! Its all a wayang show".<br><br>This also raises the question as to the authenticity of the actual process for review and approval of cabinet minister's salaries. Who decides on these numbers? Is there independence and transparency?<br><br>Veteran opposition figure J.B. Jeyaretnam on Wednesday, Nov 20, 2002 challenged Singapore government ministers to take a pay cut to show they understand the economic hardships faced by the public. And the over-riding concern is that Singapore's Ruling Elite are unable to appreciate the economic hardship that the masses face in these tough times.<br><br>The growing public resentment comes afew months after PM Goh's careless comments that "lay-offs were not all bad", drew a backlash from the public with a flood of e-mails being sent to the foreign press to register public indignation.<br><br>It is a revelation that when the "paycuts" were finally effected they amounted to a miniscule 10% haircut from the massively bloated ministerial salaries.<br><br>It is also a revelation that barely a year later (in June 2004) the bloated ministerial salaries were restored and increased beyond their original levels even as the rest of Singapore was still struggling in the throes of a recession. (There were no CPF restorations for the rest of working Singaporeans).<br><br>Source Sg_Review group<br><br>Singapore Review welcomes honest feedback on this hotly debated topic.

            <div class='col-md body'>From: Julie Rogers<br>To: Singapore Review<br>27 October 2004<br><br>Does Inequality Make You Sick? S'pore ministers salaries<br><br>Hi, I pondered over Catherine Lim's article "PAP and the people: A return of<br>disaffection?"<br>(see: http://www.singapore21.org.sg/art_disaffection.html#debate1)<br><br>Until recently I knew next to nothing about Singapore so it is a revelation<br>that my first introduction to this little speck is through various discussions<br>on the internet about Ministerial Salaries.<br><br>Quite frankly I am rather appalled by the fact that ministers in your country<br>can earn upwards of USD 1 million. Any officer of the state is a<br>public servant and this was a once noble and honourable calling. In the<br>civilised world, persons assume this office because they want personally to<br>contribute to the well being of the country. Self sacrifice and altruism are<br>essential hallmarks for a public office holder and the minister must be ready<br>and willing to make these personal sacrifices.<br><br>If the heart is not in this noble service, then it will be wasted effort.<br>Money should not be an issue at all and if it is, then your "elected leaders"<br>have very ill-placed priorities and are obviously in it for the wrong reasons.<br><br>Even if we were to overlook the misplaced financial motives of your ministers,<br>the sheer gulf in income disparity between ministerial salaries and those of<br>the working class will create a huge irreconcilable dichord and disenchantment<br>with any normal voting public. (A valid point in Catherine Lim's article)<br><br>But I am told that Singapore is a democracy with elected leaders! So I have to<br>assume that Singapore must have a very unique "voting public" which is able to<br>silently and willingly take all this in their stride. Singaporeans should take<br>note here that Who they vote for and who they elect is a reflection of their<br>own core value systems and the undeniable fact remains that Singaporeans have<br>elected a group of Leaders who are eminently pre-occupied with escalating their<br>on salaries.<br><br>I for one will never be able to accept this unequal state of affairs if ever it<br>was my lot. And thank goodness it isn't for I will never be able to sleep<br>soundly at nights knowing that the fate, future and well being of my country<br>are in the hands of a bunch of financially motivated hired mercenaries.<br><br>Below is a further write-up of some of the social ills that a huge income<br>disparity can create. There is an old saying that the most efficient form of<br>governance is a Monarchy, but this assumes the Monarch has the same priorities<br>and agenda as the people he rules. Is this the case with Singapore's Monarchy?<br><br>I repeat that who you elect is a mirror image of your own core values and<br>Singaporeans have to ask themselves whether their current leaders who require<br>million dollar salaries to be in office, have the same value systems as the<br>voters who elected them.<br><br>Lastly, I have also copied in Guniess World of Records to see if this unique<br>feature of your country will earn it a place in the world record books.<br><br>Julie Rogers<br></div>
