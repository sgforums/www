            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Kind families adopt care for orphans<br>Then allowances for kids disappear</strong><br><br>By Zubaidah Nazeer<br><br>October 18, 2005<br><br>YET another charity is under investigation. And this time, it involves an orphanage.<br>The New Paper has learnt that the police are investigating possible 'financial irregularities' at the Darul Ihsan orphanage on Mattar Road in Aljunied.<br><br>The investigations involve monthly allowances meant for non-residential orphans.<br><br>It is believed that the amount involved could be in the thousands.<br><br>Auditors have been hired to review its financial processes.<br><br>The Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS), which oversees the charity running the orphanage, confirmed that it has been informed of the 'irregularities'.<br><br>INVESTIGATION<br><br>A council member of the Muslimin Trust Fund Association (MTFA), a charity organisation which runs Darul Ihsan, told The New Paper that the amount involved could be in the thousands.<br><br>The officials in charge of the orphanage are not clear about the nature of the irregularities, but a spokesman told The New Paper that the money may not have reached the intended recipients.<br><br>It is understood that some of the non-residential orphans who have been getting $50 to $100 a month, failed to get the money at least once between January and May.<br><br>An MTFA council member said three or four of the families caring for these orphans had called Darul Ihsan.<br><br>The orphanage supports hundreds of non-residential orphans.<br><br>'Some of these families were puzzled when they received a letter informing them of a new date to collect the allowance,' he said.<br><br>They were not given any reasons for the change.<br><br>Staff handling the calls told the management about this and it was then decided to lodge a police report, he said.<br><br>MTFA started Darul Ihsan in 1904 to help Muslim orphans and needy children. It conducts fund-raising activities regularly.<br><br>The main Mattar Road building houses boys. It also runs a home for girls at Potong Pasir called Darul Ihsan Lilbanat.<br><br>It gives allowances of $50 to $100 a month to 743 non-residential orphans - children who have been adopted or put in the care of foster families.<br><br>Last year, it spent $658,000 to help such orphans, who live with guardians or relatives.<br><br>The council member explained that this money is paid in cash, as only small sums are involved and most families find it more convenient this way.<br><br>The families would be given letters to come and collect their cash every month or once in two months, depending on the arrangements. That is until the 'irregularities' occurred.<br><br>The council member, who declined to be named, told The New Paper that the amount involved could be in the thousands and that MTFA is now trying to determine how many orphans have been affected.<br><br>'We want to be transparent and we feel that it is prudent to leave it to the police, instead of ourselves, to investigate.<br><br>'We do not want to point fingers at anyone but if there is any wrong-doing, then he or she will have to face the music,' he said.<br><br>The New Paper also contacted Darul Ihsan's president, Mr Yahya Shaik Mohamed Aljaru, 64, who was appointed in early August.<br><br>Mr Yahya said: 'We have left it to the police and in the meantime, we are doing what what we can to try to help the affected families get the allowances.'<br><br>A police spokesman confirmed that the report was lodged in August but declined to give details of the investigation.<br><br>As a registered charity, MTFA qualifies for funding from MCYS.<br><br>Responding to queries, an MCYS spokesman told The New Paper that it was aware of the issue.<br><br>In an e-mail statement, she said: 'The President of MTFA informed MCYS on 29 Sep of some financial irregularities in the Financial Aid scheme for orphans living in the community, for which it has lodged a police report.<br><br>'In addition, with a view to better manage its cash payment system, MTFA has commissioned an auditor to review the system.<br><br>'The Financial Aid scheme in question is an MTFA scheme that does not involve Government funding. The scheme is not related to the running of the two orphanages.<br><br>'As the police have started investigations on this issue, we should let the investigation take its course.'<br><br>Some in the Malay Muslim community have expressed concern about what is happening at the charity.<br><br>PUBLIC'S CONCERN<br><br>Tuition teacher Sharifa Aisah, 32, said: 'Darul Ihsan is a well-known orphanage, providing a lot of welfare for the needy. I am disappointed that it has not thought about managing its money more carefully and efficiently.'<br><br>Housewife Yati A Rahman, 57, said: 'Darul Ihsan has been around for a long time. Maybe this is a sign it should not get complacent about financial management.'<br><br>But businessman Farouk Mohd, 34, thinks the orphanage has handled the issue well.<br><br>He said: 'It seems to be on top of the matter. But it has to keep the public updated because it is easy for the public to lose confidence when it comes to money management.<br><br>'During this holy fasting month, money issues are all the more sensitive because Muslims feel the need to donate even more to the needy.'<br><br></div>
