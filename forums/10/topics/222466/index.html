            <div class='col-md body'>Nov 7, 2006<br>Singapore Power's tariffs don't reflect market forces<br><br>I REFER to the recent drop in crude oil prices, weakening of the US dollar and the increase in electricity tariffs from Oct 1 by Singapore Power.<br><br>I do not see why it has to review its prices quarterly, instead of matching market fluctuations in oil prices and the US dollar.<br><br>=&gt; Cos Sporns are prone to amnesia, so that they'll get used to high prices a few months down the road?<br><br>Lower crude oil prices and a weaker US dollar had resulted in petrol companies reducing their pump prices and SIA is revising its fuel surcharge. These companies are adapting to market forces but not Singapore Power. By charging consumers a three- month fixed tariff, how much would it have gained?<br><br>I think the reason why Singapore Power can hold on to its quarterly pricing is that it has a monopoly of the energy market.<br><br>=&gt; Where's CASE? And do well to remember that *almost all* of Peesai's power stations are fired by natural gas, which has been on a year-long down trend!<br><br>Petrol companies in an oligopolistic situation are sensitive to consumers' need. If one firm cuts the petrol price, the rest have to follow suit to retain market share. As for SIA, though it is a national carrier, there are other airlines in the aviation market and it needs to keep up with the competitors in reducing the fuel surcharge.<br><br>I had written earlier that Singapore Power is not flexible in its electricity tariff's savings over the years when the tariff rates are not a reflection of the prices in the oil market and the US dollar.<br><br>It should be transparent to show how much is the cost of fuel oil in the pricing of the electricity tariff.<br><br>It should also be flexible to review and adjust the electricity tariff monthly or regularly according to market forces to shed the image that it monopolises the energy market.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>I remember quite well that SPS and one of the minister said in Sinkapore 50% of electricity were generated by fuel.<br><br>Recently, our president mr nathan said in TV....80% of electricity were generated with natural gas...SO....who is telling lies</strong></span>.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>STI Home &gt; ST Forum &gt; Online Story &gt; Print &gt;&gt; Back to the article<br><br>Nov 27, 2006<br>S'pore Power, as people's asset, should consider lowering its profit margin<br><br>I refer to Yow Wai Mun's letter "Singapore Power's tariffs don't reflect market forces" (ST, Nov 7) and Singapore Power Limited's (SPL) reply 'Singapore Power results boosted by international ops' (ST, Oct 27) to my letter 'Why delay opening up electricity retail market ?' (ST, Oct 16).<br><br>SPL's reply states that 'the improvement in the results of the group from 2004 to 2006 is due mainly to our international operations...The number of accounts in arrears exceeding $500 for three months and longer is about 3,600 and the number of Pay-As-You Use (PAYU) meters installed todate is about 12,500'.<br><br>Does 'due mainly to our international operations' mean that more than 50 per cent of its profits were due to international operations?<br><br>As it is the subsidiary of SPL, SP Services (SPS) is the sole provider of electricity to consumers in Singapore. I would like to ask what was SPS's profits and profit growth from 2004 to 2006.<br><br>If the majority of SPL's 53 per cent profit growth last year was due to international operations, I suggest that it considers reducing the profit margin of its local operations.<br><br>SPL's assets were built up over the years by being the monopolistic supplier of electricity and these were derived from the earnings and profits that came from the monies paid by Singaporeans.<br><br>SPL is the asset of the people of Singapore, and it is not privatised as a listed company yet. So none of its profits are being returned to Singaporeans by way of dividends.<br><br>Its overseas expansion would not have been possible without the revenues generated by the electricity bills of Singaporeans over the decades.<br><br>In the past, statistics on arrears were given for those of more than three months, and the highest figure ever reported was about 10,000 ("Pay-as-you-use meters to help poor households", ST, April 22, 2005).<br><br>Now, by changing the benchmark for the statistic to 'arrears exceeding $500 for three months or longer', the number has dropped dramatically to about 3,600 in just over a year. Does it mean that almost 71 per cent of PAYU households have paid off their arrears?<br><br>Why not go back to the old statistical measure for arrears, and just tell us how many are in arrears for more than three months, in addition to those exceeding $500?<br><br>Leong Sze Hian<br><br></div>
