(Sorry if he didn't understand English, but claiming ignorance has never been pardonable.)<br><br>So what if the 400g he carried didn't reach the victims? So if people get caught before the harm is done, they should all be pardoned? So, must wait until the bomb explode (in Bali) then can sentence? If nobody dies in the explosion=less sentence, if more people die=more sentence? No logic at all, how else should the power of deterrence work? The yardstick here is 15g for death penalty, fair and square.<br><br>If it is not meant for Singapore, we should let them go? And just because this individual has a name and face, you overlook the end-user victims of the 400g? 400g confiscated is 400g less to do harm to people.

Why are the Aussies not petitioning or complaining about the Bali bombers on death row? Perhaps Singapore should to the Aussies, and Aussie supporters a favour by releasing Nguyen, give him another identity to protect his privacy, give him back his drugs, and send him to Victoria. And the next time around in Singapore, God forbids! We should encourage him, no... help him instead, to take more drugs to Victoria.</div>
