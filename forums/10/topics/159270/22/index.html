Her black hair is short and spiky, her eyes shrouded beneath a thick, black, theatrical smear of eyeliner. Her voice is high and quiet, girlish. She could still pass as the runaway teenager she once was.<br><br>Her drugs cost her $300 or $400 a day. To pay for them, she works the downtown eastside hooker stroll, a bleak, dark industrial district next to Vancouver's harbour.<br><br>"Sometimes," Mary says, "if I'm really hurting (for drugs) I do a date for $30 or $20." Like all prostitutes, Mary tries to develop regular customers and stick with them. "I do $20 with them sometimes but it's just a hand job or something. It's not like sex or something. And then when they get paid they come back and give me a hundred bucks or two hundred bucks, right? And that's how you keep the same guys all the time. And it's better that way. Safer."<br><br>Until recently, Jason, who has been a crack addict for three years, managed to pay for drugs by working at regular jobs. Now, "welfare helps out about one day a month. And the rest of it winds up being crime." He nods his head slowly and adds, "Shoplifting and things like that. I'm not a violent man. I never have been." He recently pawned a Gore-Tex jacket for a few dollars that vanished up a crack pipe, leaving him to endure the cold drizzle in only a sweater.<br><br>Jason, Mary and Brook are all homeless but in a sad twist, heavy crack use eases their need for shelter and other basics. Food isn't so important because cocaine suppresses appetite: "You get really skinny. Plus dehydrated, and sometimes eating makes me sick," says Jason.</blockquote><img src="http://missingpeople.net/images/SkidRowHooker.jpg"><br>Many of the women who work Skid Row's hooker<br>stroll ignore the dangers to support costly drug<br>addictions.<br><br>2.U change Vancouver to Sydney,LA,New York,London,.......They<br>tell u the same stories.<br><br>Do u want Vancouver changed  to Toa Payah,Jurong,Woodlands,Orchard Rd..?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Educate and warn people of the danger of drugs and drug trafficking by all means. Everyone will support such actions.<br><br>BUT, it may be highly presumptuous to assume that just because of death penalty, the drug problem will end or be put to a halt. If by imposing death penalty, we can only hang the desperados or immature and not stop the drug lords or the syndicate, why go on killing the underlings or end lives.<br><br>Think in such a circumstance what use will death penalty bring? Only unrest among nations due to disparity of drug punishments? Why not impose heavy sentence as heavy sentence in many many cases will be sufficient to deter and reduce crimes. Do not be overly concerned with exceptions. "Bu yong kan chin sa chei"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><a href="http://cousincreep.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">PUBLIC PROSECUTOR<br>vs<br>Nguyen Tuong Van<br>Suit No: CC 43/2003<br>Decision Date:: 20 Mar 2004<br>Court:Singapore  High Court-----the transcripts</a></strong><br><br><blockquote>92 However, there is simply not sufficient State practice to justify the next part of the appellant counselÂ’s argument as to the content of this customary international rule. The appellant was unable to show a specific customary international law prohibition against hanging as a mode of execution. Indeed, the passage quoted above shows that there is not enough evidence at this time to show a customary international law prohibition against the death penalty generally. According to a report from the UN Commission on Human Rights, Question of the Death Penalty: Report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to Commission resolution 2002/77 UN ESCOR, 59th Sess, UN Doc E/CN.4/2003/106 (2003), as at 1 December 2002, the status of the death penalty worldwide was as follows:<br><br>Number of retentionist countries<br>71<br><br>Number of completely abolitionist countries<br>77<br><br>Number of countries abolitionist for ordinary crimes only<br>15<br><br>Number of countries that can be considered de facto abolitionist<br>33<br><br>The number of States retaining the death penalty was almost equal to the number of States that had abolished it. In most States retaining the death penalty, the mode of execution is by hanging or shooting.<br><br>93 The appellant relied on the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Campbell v Wood 18 F 3d 662 (1994) for their information as to the risk of asphyxiation or decapitation inherent in the procedure of hanging. However, it is worth pointing out that the majority of the Court of Appeals convened en banc decided that hanging did not amount to cruel and inhuman treatment or punishment. The trial judge rightly observed this in his judgment.</blockquote></div>
