            <div class='col-md body'>It is time for government when it is opening up to more foreigners to take up PR or citizenship to avoid unfairness in the laws across the borders.<br><br>Government has passed many harsh laws to solve certain problems or presumably to solve certain problems. When laws on our own citizens are too strict involving death penalty, it will from time to time lead to discrimination either against its own citiznes as against foreigners who might be working among our citizens. When such a situation arises, government either has to be more lenient to foreigners or discriminate against its own citizens with heavier sentence for the same offence in the same court.<br><br>In the age of internet, if government still passses the laws solely for its own considerations of getting tough on certain offences it will lead to more serious restrictions or punishments against its own citizens e.g. posting of views critical of government in the email or blogs by citizens may be punished but not the foreigners for the same offence or presumed offence. This will be pure discrimination where our citizens may be subject to punishments where other citizens are not.<br><br>Why be harsh in any penalty on citizens and be lenient or not taking actions on the same offence on Foreigners ?<br><br>What is government going to do to avoid double standard. Punish the foreigners to the same extent as local citizens, foreigners are not happy.<br><br>Punish local citizens with less severity as foreigners the local will be heppier and foreigners are not against us.<br><br>Punish local more than foreigners, locals are being discriminated as against foreigners - but for what purpose? Who is at fault ? What problems do we solve any way in many cases? Are we solving them at all even with all the harsher laws? Many harsh laws of the past have been discovered in recent amendments to existing laws. If government has talents, it should see to more balanced approach in laws and enforcements and not be more harsh against its own citizens to serve no particular purpose except to look more firm and resolute or for political purpose. Let there be more balance in the laws across borders.</div>
