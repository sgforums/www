            <div class='col-md body'>"...<strong>The obtuseness of Â“progressiveÂ” thinking amongst the political class in Australia, and its insensitivity to the particular problems of other countries, is notorious.</strong> It seems a general principle that any dictatorship, no matter how vile, which can be considered Â“progressiveÂ” or critical of America will have excuses made for it, while the lesser sins of democratic countries are the object of perpetual vilification and lying. Now the death sentence pronounced by the Indonesian court on Bali bomber Amrozi has stirred up a renewed debate in Australia on the acceptability of the death penalty. It is clear that <strong>most of the relatives of the Australian victims, with the exception of one or two whose hard-wired political prejudices have led them to try to make political capital out of personal tragedies, favour the verdict.</strong><br><br>The Prime Minister has taken a more nuanced position. He has said simply that he will not try to interfere with Indonesian law Â– if that includes the death penalty for grave offences, so be it. In this case the convicted felon is an Indonesian; Mr Howard might well have made a plea for clemency if he had been an Australian. The PM might yet decide to suggest to President Megawati that there are good reasons for commuting the sentence if it is confirmed on appeal. <strong>But he is not going to, nor should he, pick up on the practice so common amongst the morally vain in Australia of condemning Indonesia for not being governed to suit their prejudices. </strong>It is pointless to denigrate the Indonesian government because it has not yet abandoned capital punishment.<br><br><strong>It is clear that the majority of Australian public opinion is in favour of the death penalty,</strong> as is American, and especially so in this case. ..."<br><br>(Foreign policy in theory and practice by PP McGuinness)<br><br>http://www.the-rathouse.com/quadedit57.html<br><br>Australians are happy enough for the death penalty to be imposed on a man who killed tens of Australians but consider it barbaric to impose it on an Australian who can destroy thousands of lives and their families. The amount of heroin Nguyen trafficked was sufficient for 26,000 doses!<br><br></div>

In a society, the views of the majority are taken much to the dislike of the minority.<br><br>Yes, money is useful but it is not as important as one's life. Money can't bring a man from his death. The death penalty has it's usefulness in the deterence it had on people who see/hear/experience situations where persons who commit death penalty-crimes, pay for it with their lives. To me, this is freedom of choice with it's accompanying consequences.

Such attempts cannot be policed and can sometimes be impromptu.<br><br>These people are only of ages where their brain is still growing. These people were then misled, and then had their control and growth restricted by these drugs.<br><br>We cannot eliminated these problems, but we can limit their occurrence by lowering the opportunities for such incidents to surface. Forcefully by law, and then reinforced by deterrent and education. When the country matures, it's understandable that we should remove these shackles slowly.<br><br>Yes these events can be in smaller scale, but in countries like Australia, England and many European countries, we see that these events take place almost all the times. No doubt the measure taken locally was extremely harsh, and practising mandatory terms leave no grounds for clemency, laws must be reviewed before changes can be made. There must be an attempt to reconcile the justice system and the overall opinion from the public. So there must be a review and these changes cannot take place overnight. These changes cannot be implemented immediately. Yet those barbaric Australians who felt they were superior in being 'humane' in these situations had not understood that the law must represent the people of the country, NOT their country. If they feel it's wrong, it's their right to inform us, and not demand that we should follow.<br><br>Their reaction was understandable, but their harsh criticism, racial abuse and insult stinging when the incident was blown up by the press was unnecessary. They do not perceive our ways as an alternative but insisted we were barbaric, they made insults to the nation and the people as a whole and naturally, majority of the people rooted for the Government. Alienated thoughts were usually greeted in strong offence, as were theirs on our laws.<br><br>The hangman is looked upon as a permanent devasting destruction to one person but I would like to reiterate that a punishment must be meted out such that an equally strong message is being conveyed that we do not condone acts that is offending in public opinion. The punishment level at least be satisfying to the masses until they can feel at ease should such offending act be taken.<br><br>Thus, the lawmakers must appease the general opinion that the current law is effectively minimising offending acts and the punishment acts as an solace to the public welfare. And public opinion, changes from time to time.<br><br>There is no justification to any punishment making it universally right regardless of the events occurred as there are too many different perspectives to one event. And the lawmakers are equally adequate to govern the nation if the majority approves of any law. The Government would be barbaric, if the majority disapproves of the law and refuses to amend it. However, everyone should be given the opportunity to address the issue as a citizen and advocate their beliefs.<br><br>My view is that the death penalty is a very strong deterrent due to how nature creates the survival will in our mentality. I disapprove of mandatory punishments, but approves of death penalty should there be a need to deter others from committing a similar offending act.<br><br>(I refused initially to really write my strong arguments on this but then enough is enough, we had enough idiots diluting this topic)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
