            <div class='col-md body'>Read this..from a writer to the Arizona Republic newspaper..<br><br><blockquote>Singapore is not a bloodthirsty city<br><br>Dec. 13, 2005 12:00 AM<br><br>A recent letter to the editor suggested we should "immediately" execute anyone "having anything to do with drugs" in public "like they do in Singapore" ("Use extreme prejudice on drug dealers," Letters, Wednesday).<br><br>Almost nothing in that letter is accurate. I worked in Singapore and I can tell you this:<br><br>Â• The death penalty is imposed there for exceeding a weight limit on the drugs in your possession. If you are a user, you would get jail. If you have enough to sell, you get the noose.<br><br>Â• Their court system works much the same as here. There is an appeals process, and nobody is executed immediately. The Australian who was executed there last week was arrested three years ago. They are not bloodthirsty. While I was there, they went to a lot of trouble (separating out seeds and stems) to get under the limit to avoid hanging a 20-year-old girl.<br><br>Â• There are no public executions in Singapore. They are even more private than here. There are no witnesses.<br><br>That being said, it is one of the safest places I have ever been. You can walk down the street in the middle of the night anywhere on the island counting your money. If someone is robbed, it is news.<br><br>So, the writer is not completely off base, but Singapore is not China, where executions take place the same day as the trial. - Jeff Bock, Goodyear<br></blockquote></div>

[b]I respect the jurisdiction of the Indonesian court and I do not intend to make any representations that it not be carried out. If it's the view of the Indonesian court that it be carried out, then it should be carried out. These crimes were committed in Indonesia and the law of that country must prevail</strong>."<br><br>The next day, August 8, Howard told 3AW's Neil Mitchell: "And <strong>I find it extraordinary that anybody can use the word 'barbarism' in relation to this man. I just find that extraordinary</strong>."<br><br>(Morals in the Mirror by Paul Kelly, Nov 26 2005, The Australian)<br><br>And I find it just as extraordinary that people with brains can take the Australians' side to castigate Singapore's decision...[/b]</blockquote>Hypocrisy is not the same as outright dishonesty.
