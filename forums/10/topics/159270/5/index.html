            <div class='col-md body'>To the (adolescent) pikamaster,<br><br><strong>Do you rmb how old I am? (HINT: I'm not even in NS yet.) Â….and I wish to WIP too, for the moment. </strong><br>Well, not really interested in how old u r. If u r young, u have much to learn, if u r old u have not seen much of life.<br><br>Yr posts do not convince me a little wee pit, so may be I do not understand 100%.<br>Forbes does not agree with u, so his letter Â“contains absolutely no substance at allÂ”.<br>Ariels does not agree with u, so his letter is also Â“lacking in substanceÂ”.<br><br><strong>Laughably and shockingly, Â…..It's shocking not because Singapore is not civilized, but because of the callous disregard Ariel shows the other Southeast Asian nations of Malaysia, Indonesia, Phillippines, Brunei, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos. His statement implies that all these societies are far less civilized than Australia.</strong><br><br>How does ArielÂ’s Â“arguably our most civilized neighbouring stateÂ” be implying Â“that all these societies are far less civilized than Australia.Â” What did he say that with Â“wider implication to what he says was used as a justification for the mass torture at Guantanamo BayÂ”?<br><br>We are all worthless because we do not agree with you.<br><br><strong>4) Foreign counsels are prohibited from beign involved in local cases. </strong>Do they have to be involved in local cases to be of any use?<br><br><strong>7) Refer to the Case Study on Poon Yuen Yang. But read the rest of the report too, when you have the time, so that you can understand the abolitionist-human-rights stand better, and get the facts fo the argument straight. </strong><br>Between the report fr AI and the rebuttal from GCTÂ’s office, I choose to believe in our ppl doing their job.<br>With America, the champion of human rights still implementing death penalty, I cannot help but when there is a conflict in human rights, the rights of the victims and the innocent citizens come before the right of the criminal.<br><br><strong>9) Please read up on the opium farming industry and have you heard of something called "international exports"? </strong><br><br>What has ecstasy pills got to do with opium farming? Do you really know what you are talking about?<br><br><strong>11) wth. This is the most nonsensical thing I have seen written on a discussion on the Death Penalty!!!  :X  If you want to deal with a problem, you look at all perceptions so that you can see which perceptions need to be changed to solve the problem. That is elementary psycholgy and human relations for you. OMG, which planet do you live on?  </strong><br>why do you need the perceptions of the drug lords? To be more sympathetic to them? To change their perceptions or change your perceptions in solving the problem? I am living on planet earth in a country called Singapore. I donÂ’t need human relationship with the drug lords in Myanmar. Are you in Burmese jungle?<br><br><strong>12) Let's put it this way ... I'm not going to buy a drug even if it was shoved in my face. And I'm pretty much a child, or a teenager anyway, so where goes your argument? </strong><br>You need to show IC to watch NC16, can smoke only in the toilet and it is illegal for the hawker a peh to sell you a beer, or do you have the money for anything?<br><br><strong>13) I'm not a parent. And please don't keep misquoting me. </strong><br>At least learn to respect what yr parents are doing for you.<br><br><strong>14) Because you are teaching him that finding someone else to blame and dealing violently with that person is the best way to solve a problem. (And IMHO, private arms possession is illegal in Singapore. Breaking a law to stop the breaking of another law is still breaking the law.) </strong><br>HmmÂ…..y r too young to know how an adult can shoot a drug trafficker. DonÂ’t waste time thinking about this.<br><br><strong>1) Taking away the life of a man is much more serious than taking away his youth - at least in the latter situation, the man still has the chance of living out the remainder of his life as a useful and law-abiding citizen. </strong><br>There are countless evidences of criminals repeating the crimes after jail. You can argue till cows come home between giving the criminal the chance to live out the remainder of his life as useful (?) and law-abiding citizen, and protecting the would-be victims of the criminals committing the same crime after release.<br><br><strong>3) America and Singapore are not the only countries in the world. Of course, there are other countries which still retain the death penalty in practice. But overall, there is an international trend of abolishing the death penalty in law and abolishing it in practice (2 different things). </strong><br>I donÂ’t follow trend, especially when it comes to protecting the life of innocent citizens.<br><br><strong>I think you retentionists are confused about what respect of the law is. It means to adhere to the law when it is fair and just, not refraining from criticizing the law even when it is unjust. After all, Respect for the Law also entails respect for the principle of Law itself, and by criticizing unjust or unfair laws, one is adhering to that principle. </strong><br>I am no retentionist, and am not confused. Our laws and judicial system  are not perfect but certainly not unjust and unfair.<br><br><strong>Oh haha   your words sound so empty - what if another party comes into power and overturns the law? Will you support it then? And IMHO, most Singaporeans are apathetic, and hence do not bother about retentionism or abolitionism, or are afraid to speak up against the government, so don't try and commit a fallacy of Gross Generalization here, ok?</strong><br>HmmmÂ…what makes you think the majority of Singaporean are not fully aware of the need and therefore endorse the death sentence? Singaporean may be apathetic to many political issues but isnÂ’t it an assumption that they are also apathetic and are afraid to speak up on this issue? Talk about Fallacy of Gross Generalization?<br><br>And may I ask when did you ever speak up against the government about abolitionism? Hypocrite!! Oops, I forgot, you are still hiding under yr momÂ’s apron.<br><br><strong>6) Please look deeper, and realize that you are trying to promote Singapore's model, or at least are supporting the government's promotion of the model, as the best in the world. Please don't retreat into Ad Misericordiam arguments. </strong><br>I am only trying to protect my own way of life. I promote SingaporeÂ’s model to whom? ArenÂ’t you the one promoting an outside model, approved by AI, into Singapore? HmmÂ….this is called retreating into Ad Misericordiams arguments.<br><br><strong>What I notice about retentionists - and the government worst of all - is that they adopt a very insular world-view, where what they do or wish to do is right. They refuse to accept criticism from other people, or even see what other people do. They fail to understand that their society and culture is not as unique (remember this?) as they think it is, and stubbornly refuse to learn from others. </strong><br>Did the government of Singapore send rebuttal to AI to clearly state its position. Our society is indeed unique (which two countries are similar?), and we, the ppl decide what we want to do, and we choose not to follow your way. Stubbornly refuse to learn? ThatÂ’s arrogant accusation.<br><br><strong>Simply to say, even if abolitionists provided evidence directly relevant to personal situations, retentionists will reject it with the most spurious arguments e.g. "let the murderer/trafficker go free" (sound familiar?)  </strong><br>So try harder.<br><br></div>

I am quite happy to stay where I am, accepting the current system as it is till I see a good alternative. It is whether YOU, not we, the abolitionist can inform and educate from the abolitionist point of view.

He received a letter from the country's Foreign Minister confirming that the execution of Melbourne salesman Nguyen Tuong Van, 25, would go ahead despite pleas for clemency from the Australian government.<br><br>But Mr Downer said the Government would continue to press for his life to be spared.<br><br>"All we can realistically do is work through what we tend to call the legal issues," he said.<br><br>Mr Downer said Nguyen's family would receive two weeks notice of his execution.<br><br>Nguyen was caught with 396 g of heroin strapped to his body and in his hand luggage at Changi in 2002.<br><br>He faces execution within weeks after losing an appeal for clemency last month.<br><br>Government and opposition MPs this week presented Singapore High Commissioner Joseph Koh with petitions from more than 100 parliamentarians and 300 parliamentary staff calling for his life to be spared.<br><br>His lawyer Lex Lasry, QC, argued that his client's co-operation with police and remorse should have been counted when his clemency application was considered.</div>
