            <div class='col-md body'>Sgdiehard,<br><br>1) Rmb, I'm only arguing agaisnt the Death penalty, not against criminal punishment. i.e.: I'm saying that teh guy should be given a lighter sentence if he had a genuine altruistic motive in committing the crime. That deosn't excuse the fact that teh crime is a crime though. period.<br><br>2) By our laws, he is a "presumed" trafficker. period.<br><br>3) He was caught because he possessed a large amount of drugs, and the large amount of drugs in his possession could have been due to him being a serious abuser himself. IMHO, I never argue for the sake of argument.:X<br><br>4) Fallacy of the false analogy. (n FYI, bear in mind you're talking to a teenager.) In a case of an affair, the nudeness is proof enough, not to mention the bed-sharing. A more accurate analogy would be the wife accusing her husband of an affair just because it happens that he is carrying some roses on valentine's day that came from the neighbour's wife. As you would realize, this isn't very hard evidence at all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>5) They feel the need to stand up for their own citizens - go google for the Australian Government's official release. They are pleading for their own citizens not because they think that the laws of other coutnries do not apply to their nationals, but because the Australian Government has a strong ideological stand agaisnt the death penalty. Of course, die-hards like you might not be able to understand properly the phrase "ideological stand". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>6) My common sense and arrogance have not blinded me. Yours has blinded yourself. The drug lords in Myanmar and Afghanistan do not leave their countries just like Osama does not leave wherever he is hiding now. They run international syndicates. By logic, you can't just have local syndicates, since they need to be tied to suppliers. For a smuggling ring to be effective, it needs to be at least on the regional scale i.e. smuggling drugs from a drug-producing country (e.g Myanmar) to a non-drug-producing country (e.g. M'sia or Singapore).<br><br>7) Nope, it's not a theory. It was on the news. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>8 ) Another fallacy of association. Drug traffickers do not kill. They merely sell drugs. The drug-addicts who consume exorbitant amounts of drugs kill themselves, call it a form of second-degree suicide or "manslaughter suicide" (ya, i coined the term). Drug traffickers are not serial killers. They are like any other door-todoor or street-to-street salesmen, it's just that their merchandise is undesirable. They are like the tobacco companies. Smoking is bad for your health, but if you smoke, you can't blame the tobacco corporations for <span style="font-style: italic;">making</span> you smoke. You have to blame yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>9) No.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>10) Technichally, this para is irrelevant to the para you're making reference to, but anyway...<br><br>I don't see any form of disrespect that Foreigners have shown us. You seem to be applying the MIW's logic - if you speak out against our policies, youa re disrespecting us. (IMHO, that's fallacy of false-cause.)<br><br>11) Now, you're the one disrespecting Australian law. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Smuggling plants and animals into Australia might destroy Australian crops and livestock, because the foreign plants may have germs and bacteria that they are immune against, but which the Australian organisms have not adapted to. And of course, crops and livestock are a food-source. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> But even then, it's just the items which will be siezed; the smuggler will not be jailed at all. S/he may be fined, but not jailed or caned, and certainly not hanged. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>the (dissappointed) pikamaster<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>pikamaster,<br><br>1) We discussed Death penalty before. My position remains that a person who is charged for committing a crime, must be given a chance and the necessary assistance to defend himself in a fair and just court trial, and if he were found guilty as charged, and if his further appeals to higher court or the president of Singapore fail, he will have to be punished accordingly. Period.<br><br>Whether the punishment should be death by hanging, life imprisonment, cane or do social work, is not the point for discussion now. I am in no position to discuss if 400kg or heroin is life imprisonment, 401 kg then is death, 1 kg of marijuana is 10 yrsÂ…..<br><br>2) The second point, especially in the case of drug trafficking, is whether sufficient warning or notices against such offences was given and received. I would be more sympathetic to those who do not read or understand English and those who have not heard of Singapore before the crime was committed. Do the OZs qualify here?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>A person found in possession of drug, in quantity way in excess for personal consumption is a Â“presumedÂ” trafficker. Did the court subsequently bring him to trial, give a fair chance to explain, gave necessary legal assistance, his Â“illnessÂ” or Â“madnessÂ” and motive taken in consideration, before convicting him? Once convicted, he is a convicted trafficker, no more assumption. period.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>3) Is he a drug abuser himself?? Did he say that? or is it your assumption? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>4) YouÂ’re a teenager? HmmÂ….uncle tell you hor, donÂ’t mess around with drugs, when ppl ask you to help carry something on plane, donÂ’t just listen ok. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>5)	Was the teh guy found with 400 kg of panadol, or 400 bottles of cough mixture? or simply talcon powder? What hard evidence do you need?<br><br>6) Ya, I know, many ppl got their ideological stand, the communists, the religious fanatics all have their ideological stand. I have only one question Â“ what good does your ideological stand bring to our ppl? Who are you protecting?Â” Whatever it is, your ideology cannot be above our law, for the crime was committed in singapore, period.<br><br>7) So it was the Burmese drug lords who run the local syndicates in the streets of Australian cities from the mountains in Myanmar?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> If there is no demand, there is no supply; if there is no profits, there is no supply chain; Why are the drugs not smuggled directly from a drug-producing country to a drug consuming country (e.g. Australia), and why does it have to transit through a country like singapore, that hang drug traffickers? What is your logic?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Ya, osama does not kill, he only trains the bombers and he supplies the bombs, and the merchandise just happen to be undesirable.!!! Is smoking the same as drug abuses?? Drug traffickers are door to door or street- to- street salesmen, working for the Burmese drug lords? If this is what you do for your pocket money during vacation, you should be making big money but your parents will be very sad.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I do not claim to have high moral standard but drug abuse is a definite NO for me and my children and I will SHOOT the drug peddlers who try to sell drug to my children. You will gain better respect if you go sell your body for money, at least you donÂ’t harm others.<br></div>

Singapore has been known to have many funny laws, first it was fine for littering, then it was ban of chewing gum, then fine for not flushing toilets, and there was canning for vandalism. Ridiculous those may be, they serve the purposes. Death penalty is more serious as it involved taking lives, but the debate can continue, the lives of those convicted of serious crime vs those who would be savedÂ…Â…no end.
