Let him live,' declared a front-page banner headline in the weekend edition of the Sydney Morning Herald.<br><br>Newspaper columnists, letter writers and callers to radio shows have also been vocal in criticising Singapore's decision to proceed with the death sentence for Nguyen Tuong Van, describing it as 'inhumane' and 'barbaric'.<br><br>Nguyen, who admitted acting as a drug courier, was sentenced to death last year after being found guilty of trafficking in almost 400g of heroin, found on him at Changi Airport in December 2002.<br><br>Public anger over Nguyen's execution has intensified recently, with calls for trade sanctions against Singapore, a boycott of Singapore commercial interests in Australia and a referral to the International Court of Justice.<br><br>In a commentary yesterday, the Australian's editor-at-large Paul Kelly yesterday argued that while Singapore had the 'most intimate ties with Australia of any Asian nation', the execution would 'inflict grave damage on its reputation in this country'.<br><br>'The hanging of Nguyen will shock many Australians; it will be seen as a punishment out of proportion with the crime. It will highlight Singapore's authoritarian nature, its denial of civil liberties and the flaws in its awesome record of success,' he wrote.<br><br>(article continues....)<br><br>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br><br>If you are as disgusted as I am over Australia's boorish attitude and bullying antics, join me in a show of solidarity and loyalty - sign the PETITION featured below!

While all these smack of (Western?) imperialism, it is made especially more pertinent since the citizens of Singapore live under the very same laws that convicted Nguyen.

Do you see drugs as a major and prevalent problem in our society today?<br><br>A2. That is not a valid argument as there's no international consensus on death penalty for drug offences or any other form of crime for the matter. Singapore, being a sovereign nation, is not bound to follow the ideals and conventions set by any other nation, great or miniscule.<br><br>A3. Myanmar is a sovereign nation too, and we must respect that. What would you think if Australia or the US land their troops on Singapore shores to counter terrorists without our consent?<br><br>A4. Why should harsh laws cause "aberration of justice"? The form of punishment and the due process of law are two different issues. One can be found guilty in a fair trial, and yet be submitted to what's deemed as an excessively harsh punishment. For example, a Muslim may be found guilty of adultery in a fair trial in a syariah court, and yet be sentenced to be stoned to death. The punishment might be what some people deem as excessive, but the due process of law was not impeded.</div>
