The only way to stop them from taking any more drugs is to stop the supply.<br><br>If we already have so many drug traffickers now, can you imagine the situation where we don't have the death penalty for drug trafficking? At that time even those people who are afraid to die will turn to trafficking drugs when they need money... you'll soon encounter people bumping into you or your children on the streets and trying to sell you heroin, like how some people are peddling smuggled cigarettes to students now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is a very small country and a young population. therefore everything we do, we have to calculate our risks. Enforcing strict laws and punishment are crucial to acheive stability required in our society. Singapore's economy and social status is at stake here. We cannot afford big mistakes to happen to our society, because it will take even greater efforts to repair it. We are less than 10% of land mass and population of any SEA countries, but we are the richest and most sucessful of all of them. We are competing on a global scale with only 4 million people, compare to 400 milion in US, 1 billion in china and anohter billion in india. We are nothing to them, peanuts. We are not even a speck on their GDP. But yet we are noticed, and we have their trust!<br><br>We have to ask ourselves what is more important, individual pleasures or the continued sucess for our nation. There are many other countries that would take in Singaporeans as their citizens because we come from a society that is known to be hardworking, law abiding, trustworthy and intelligent. and would be a great asset to their country.<br><br>But yet, we are here in this forum agruing about civil liberties which can potentially create chaos and tear the fabric of our nation. We should stand behind our government as the choice they have made is the right one. Have you guys read the patriot act? how about Europe and their current riot and terrorist problems. Do we wait for problems to evolve into something much more terrible and drastic, or would you belive in the pervention of such events.<br><br>We do not have oil, land or other resources that we can use to help us gain money for our country. Only our ports, economical stability and human resources that drive this country. if we lose that we would have nothing, and we will just be like the rest of SEA, but much worst off.<br><br>What our government has done for Singapore has been unbelievable in just 40 over years. They have put us on the map and given every singapore the tools to be sucessful and compete in a global scale. Can you imagine if we were a part of malaysia speaking malay? where would we be now? It is the choices we have to make and the sacrifies (which are not that many or important unless you are a druggie or a street bum) we have to give up to acheive sucess.  The government has already changed for the better, and it has been slowly evolving. you have to understand these changes cannot happen overnight, also there are some things that cannot change.<br><br>We live in a country where the population is better off than 90% of the rest of the world, the rest of the world that's a lot of people. would you want to give that up just for a death penalty of a person that is not even from singapore?<br><br>As JFK puts it;"ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country"<br><br>I love singapore, there is no place like it, it is my home and my family. I hope you love your country too.<br></div>
