The hooo-hah in this case seems to be more about preserving SIngapore's reputation of the Death Penalty rather than criminal justice. Our local press is enjoying spending time printing out misguided letters arguing that if we let go of the Death Penalty we would start losing our sovereignty; and fallacious letters.

How do you know what he is saying is false? Anybody, even the one least likely, can tell the truth? Anyway, in Ngyuen's case, he volunteered to supply info to the Australian police, showing that he was desperate enough for anything to reduce the severity of his sentence. "sob stories" is an ad hominem. To be serious, how much do you think the prisoners' meals and lodging cost compared to your restaurant meal or condo, or even HDB flat? Our prisons are far from USA's "prison hotels"!!!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>3) I fail to see the relevance...<br><br>4) It is not about changing our laws to suit another country; it's about changing our laws to make them more humane, to suit humanity if u like, in fact it's even about changing our laws to suit outselves: we want to be a gracious society, don't we? Wouldn't this be the greatest test of our level of social grace? There is absolutely no sovereignty at stake here, unless you apply slippery-slope fallacy. The only "sovereignty" that exists is our govt's benighted propaganda. AUS isn't asking us to give up our army or our territory or surrender our education system for them to control; those would be breaches of sovereignty. IMHO, they didn't even ASK us to change our law as in scrap the Death Penalty or anything. In fact, they were making use of a provision in our own law, which our govt has apparently neglected in its "extensive consideration" of the issue.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>5) By showing vindictiveness against these drug-mules, we are making the druglords laugh until their sides ache. We are making them think: "Let those 'strong' countries kill off their own or their allies' people whilst we reap brilliant profits from LEGAL business tenders with these blind fools, as well as the Burmese and Afghan governments. Muahahahaha! Long live ourselves!" The issue is far more complicated than Ngyuen. That is why we should have let him cooperate more fully with the Australian government instead of executing him.<br><br>the (still abolitionist) pikamaster</div>

Really don't like it.<br><br>Remember, just because you are older doesn't necessarily mean that you know more than I do.<br><br>1) I agree with the statement, but I don't get what you're replying to. To the section of my post you quoted, the statement is irrelevant.<br><br>2) In Singapore, there are 3 groups of people: Those for the DP at all costs, Those against the DP at all costs (like me) and those against the DP in specific cases because they feel that those cases were judged unfairly. Huang Na was a rather emotional issue for Singaporeans, if you remember. So many people sent letters of condolences and teddy bears and hello kitty dolls etc. to ehr grieving family. Hence, I would admit that Singaporeans wouldn't be able to think clearly about the Death Penalty -&gt; most probably just had the heart for vengeance. So those who protest about Took's conviction (if any) are those who beleive that he was framed. In Ngyuen's case however, there is more scope since Singaporeans don't have (much) personal emotional attachment with him, so it is most likely that those people against his conviction are those most strongly against the DP at any cost.<br><br>3) I know that. You don't need to "enlighten" me.<br><br>4) I know the meaning of brainwash.
