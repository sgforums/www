            <div class='col-md body'>The mandatory death penalties are only reserved for extraordinary crimes. You won't get mandatory death for stealing a computer.<br><br>Drug trafficking is an extraordinary crime. Mandatory death is the penalty.<br>It doesn't mean the quality of justice has decreased. Because for cases like stealing a computer, a judge can consider mitigating factors, like u must pay your brother's debts. But when u become a drug trafficker, it's an extraordinary crime and u are immediately given the capital punishment even though u did it to pay ur brother's debt.<br><br>Herein lies the difference. That for extraordinary crimes, no mitigating factors are mitigating enough for you to commit that extraordinary crime. And this is what strong message the mandatory death penalty is there for. Once you take this away, you step back a little and soften it. People will know that there are actually mitigating factors and discretionary judgements in an extraordinary crime. You reserve mandatory death penalties for extraordinary crimes for a reason. Don't take it away.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Li Ka Shing:</div><div class="quote_body">The mandatory death penalties are only reserved for extraordinary crimes. You won't get mandatory death for stealing a computer.<br><br>Drug trafficking is an extraordinary crime. Mandatory death is the penalty.<br>It doesn't mean the quality of justice has decreased. Because for cases like stealing a computer, a judge can consider mitigating factors, like u must pay your brother's debts. But when u become a drug trafficker, it's an extraordinary crime and u are immediately given the capital punishment even though u did it to pay ur brother's debt.<br><br>Herein lies the difference. That for extraordinary crimes, no mitigating factors are mitigating enough for you to commit that extraordinary crime. And this is what strong message the mandatory death penalty is there for. Once you take this away, you step back a little and soften it. People will know that there are actually mitigating factors and discretionary judgements in an extraordinary crime. You reserve mandatory death penalties for extraordinary crimes for a reason. Don't take it away.<br><br></div></blockquote>Cannot agree more. There should be no room for opportunists.<br><br></div>
