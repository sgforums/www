Having a law and having the desire to carry out the law are two different things. Politically speaking, our neighbours' government are all mired by the political agendas of each party. In some cases, one single part cannot even form the majority of the government. This is compounded by the issue that their police forces are inept. Malaysia cannot even solve their murder cases, Filipino and Thai forces are underpaid, Indonesia police has to combat the religious elements. Many of such individuals are corrupted to say the least.<br><br>Leaving the drug issue aside, these countries cannot even deal with the petty crime, because of the corruption at the various levels of the government.<br><br>Cross section of druggie Americans? My point is merely to state that affluence has NOTHING to do with the drug problem. To conclude that because a country is poor therefore the drug problem is rampant is wrong. Drug problem is rampant because a government's inability to contain it, either because of lack of power, or lack of resource, or in some cases because it is socially acceptable to do drugs.</div>

There is nothing to prove that the death penalty is THE reason why we don't have a big drug problem.  The drug problem is a social problem.  Education, affluence, social and cultural norms have a part to play.  I think we are pretty secure on those fronts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sabaisabai:</div><div class="quote_body">The reason there isn't a large drug problem in Singapore is the personal penalty for drug use: strong sentences in rehabilitation/prisons, the difficulty of finding work after going to prison, and the lack of social security to support a non-productive lifestyle if you get yourself in a mess.  Playing with drugs in Singapore is a serious risk to your whole way of living.  People know that, and it works.<br><br></div></blockquote>Yes, thanks for putting it much better than I did.  There are social constructs embedded within our system that heavily penalises or discourages drug addiction.  That is a far better deterrent than the death penalty could ever prove to be.  Cut the demand and there won't be a supply.<br></div>

If we impose the death penalty for littering tomorrow, I'm pretty sure our streets will be squeaky clean.  But is that the only way or the best way?  And where is our sense of proportionality?<br><br>By the way, my view is that the death penalty for murder, unlike drug trafficking, is retributive rather than deterrent.  So there are different considerations in that regard.<br></div>
