            <div class='col-md body'>the UN is addressing the mandatory portion of the statute..hmm.<br><br>----------<br>UN Official Urges Singapore Not To Execute Australian<br><br>SINGAPORE (AP)--A United Nations human rights expert urged the Singapore government not to hang a convicted Australian heroin trafficker, saying the execution violated international legal standards.<br><br>Singapore has turned down clemency requests from Australia and the Roman Catholic Church for Nguyen Tuong Van, who received a mandatory death sentence after being caught with 396 grams of heroin at the city-state's Changi Airport in 2002.<br><br>Singapore's government says the death penalty is a deterrent against serious crimes such as murder and firearm use, and that it helps keep crime and drug abuse rates low.<br><br>Philip Alston, special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions for the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, said the city-state's use of a mandatory death sentence for certain drug trafficking convictions was inappropriate.<br><br>"Making such a penalty mandatory - thereby eliminating the discretion of the court - makes it impossible to take into account mitigating or extenuating circumstances and eliminates any individual determination of an appropriate sentence in a particular case," Alston said in a statement dated Tuesday.<br><br>"The adoption of such a black and white approach is entirely inappropriate where the life of the accused is at stake," Alston said. "Once the sentence has been carried out it is irreversible."<br><br>Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Tuesday he met his Singaporean counterpart, George Yeo, on the sidelines of ministerial meetings of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Busan, South Korea. Downer said he urged Singapore to reconsider the planned execution, but was told the decision was irreversible.<br><br>Nguyen, an ethnic Vietnamese, is expected to go to the gallows within a month.<br><br>Singaporean lawyer M. Ravi, who has campaigned to save Nguyen's life, said last week he had lodged a complaint with Alston against the Singapore government in a bid to halt the execution.<br><br>-Edited by Paul Baylis<br><br>(END) Dow Jones Newswires<br><br>11-15-052207ET<br><br>Copyright (c) 2005 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.<br><br><a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/aspxcontent/NewsStory.aspx?cpath=20051115%5CACQDJON200511152207DOWJONESDJONLINE001087.htm&amp;selected=9999&amp;selecteddisplaysymbol=9999&amp;StoryTargetFrame=_top&amp;mkt=WORLD&amp;chk=unchecked&amp;lang=&amp;link=&amp;headlinereturnpage=http://www.international.na" rel="nofollow">http://www.nasdaq.com/aspxcontent/NewsStory.aspx?cpath=20051115\ACQDJON200511152207DOWJONESDJONLINE001087.htm&amp;selected=9999&amp;selecteddisplaysymbol=9999&amp;StoryTargetFrame=_top&amp;mkt=WORLD&amp;chk=unchecked&amp;lang=&amp;link=&amp;headlinereturnpage=http://www.international.na</a></div>

The Law is the law. U are caught with the amount stated that will bring u to the gallows , u go to the gallows.  U give way once.. u will be seeing more of these appeals. The law has to be black n white in these circumstances or those who have money or political power can sway the judicial system and hence the judicial system will be flawed and the loop holes exploited.<br><br>Some say the drug lords benefit and the little fishes gets the chair, but that is the way. That is what the LAW is there.

To the section of my post you quoted, the statement is irrelevant.<br><br>2) In Singapore, there are 3 groups of people: Those for the DP at all costs, Those against the DP at all costs (like me) and those against the DP in specific cases because they feel that those cases were judged unfairly. Huang Na was a rather emotional issue for Singaporeans, if you remember. So many people sent letters of condolences and teddy bears and hello kitty dolls etc. to ehr grieving family. Hence, I would admit that Singaporeans wouldn't be able to think clearly about the Death Penalty -&gt; most probably just had the heart for vengeance. So those who protest about Took's conviction (if any) are those who beleive that he was framed. In Ngyuen's case however, there is more scope since Singaporeans don't have (much) personal emotional attachment with him, so it is most likely that those people against his conviction are those most strongly against the DP at any cost.<br><br>3) I know that. You don't need to "enlighten" me.<br><br>4) I know the meaning of brainwash.

            <div class='col-md body'>If Singapore wants to maintain better relations with its own citizens and outside world, it should balance its criminal and civil laws and regulations so as to be in greater harmony with all the people's expectations and the world as a whole.<br><br>Penalties against offences should be more befitting the seriousness of offences based on effectiveness of punishment as against assumptions of deterrence.<br><br>If it carries its own isolationist laws and regulations it may have to keep correcting any injustices in punishments with one set of severe laws against the citizens and another set being more liberal or subjected to international adjustments among countries. For whatever reasons our government adopts more severe punishments like death penalty against drug trafficking etc, it will still be unjust to punish human beings unequally with own citizens being more severely punished whereas foreigners subjected to appeal and interventions by outside sovereignty due to appeal by their respective governments.<br><br>Our government needs to overhaul its harsh laws of the past where our citizens are more severely punished or controlled where others are less severely treated.<br><br>There is a need for government to consider maintaining of punishments or laws in greater harmony and balance, with people's expectations and not based on its own judgmental processes or assumptions of the past.<br><br>Otherwise our laws will become increasingly at odds with the citizens and the rest of the world.<br><br>The following harsh laws should be reviewed:-<br><br>(1)   ISA, (limits its applications only to treason; and prevent its abuse by government executives against dissidents or political threats)<br><br>(2)    Sedition Act (limits its application to specific and defined cases of seditions and prevents its use for political control purposes)<br><br>(3)    GRC laws and increased election deposits,<br><br>(4)   Press licensing act and regulations,<br><br>(5)    Laws of defamation (limits its application to civil suits and politically inspired suits)<br><br>(6)    Constitutions (to assure basic freedoms of speech and expressions and political rights of participation in election without any coercions or suppressions or persecutions)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This year,all the murder cases involving Indonesian or Philipino maids were amended to manslaughter which doesn't carry death penalty.Possibley the govt was afraid hanging those murderers would affect realtionsips with these 2 countries.<strong>Those actions were of course not the law run its course.</strong><br><br>However,I can understand the govt had to resort to such action dureto national interest.For Nguyen case, there has not been much pressure from Austrialia.He didn't kill anyone.<strong>PM,is it to say govt can't act humanely by granting clemency (which is according to law) because there is little pressure form Austialia?It seems to me:  reasons don't work,only pressure works.<br></strong></div>
