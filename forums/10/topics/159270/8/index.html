Secondly, there's nothing with asking the question whether the criminal/murderer should be hung or given a second chance, but it is rather haphazard (sry, can't think of a better word) to denounce him as "smiling evil-doer" immediately, regardless of what our (extremely sensationalist) local press (especially ST) might reveal about the case.
