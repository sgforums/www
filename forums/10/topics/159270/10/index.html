They acknowledge that justice has run its due course in Nguyen's case, and their appeals are in the form of civilised letters and emails.<br><br>Indonesians and Filipinas on the other hand, tend to be an emotional lot, who are easily manipulated by certain interest groups.. they are people who can resort to burning Singapore flags, or maybe even the Singapore embassy. Just look at how the Philippines responded when we hanged the filipino maid double-murderer back in 1997. They took to the streets, burning our flag, and their government recalled their ambassador to Singapore, downgrading bilateral relations between the two countries.  <strong>And also notice that for the trials involving the maid murderers, the Indonesian ambassador always attends the court as a spectator</strong>... isn't that exerting great pressure on the judge and our government?<br><br>Hence we can understand our different responses to demands from these 2 countries.<br><br></div>

Like in southeast countries... u will just get shut down indiscriminately. So its veyr hard to look at all these situations because the governming body of the particular countries are different , hence i think the best way to avoid walking on the grew area is by either going hardline..or not.

People should start killing n then getting out of country so they wont get extradited because if they are sent back they will end up in the gallows.
