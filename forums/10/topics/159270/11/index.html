The sign on the wall is very clear, Â“HIGHT VOLTAGE! Touch and You Will Be Electrocuted!Â” You can't argue whether if you have technically touched the wire or if you really deserve to be electrocuted.

Anyway, Adrian Lim and Anthony Ler were shown to be evil to the core, so many wanted them dead at all costs. Opposing views were drowned out. </blockquote>Expediency, then. In other words, the abolishionists chose the fight they could win (i.e. Shanmugam) and ignored the ones where public support was less assured (Ler, Took, Lim, etc.) Unlike Shanmugam, there were certainly no concerts held to mourn the latter three.<br><br>What kind of message does this send to the people? That abolishionists who would protest the hanging of a drug smuggler are otherwise fine with letting convicted murderers hang? Doesn't this contradict their stand that the application of the death penalty for all crimes is inhumane, facist, and so on? Why were no efforts made to save Ler? Where are the appeals for president's clemency for Took?<br><br>Opposing views drowned out? Were there even any attempts on the part of the abolishionists to make their opposition to the dealth penalty known in these cases? Or did they keep quiet, knowing that a hostile reception from the public awaited them?<br><br>How do you reconcile this inconsistency?</div>
