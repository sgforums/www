            <div class='col-md body'>The thing is, Singapore is famous (or infamous) for its tough, merciless drug laws.. such that as far as other countries are concerned, as long as the inbound flight to their country originated from Singapore, the customs there will tend not to be so strict as far as checking for drugs are concerned.<br><br>This provides the perfect setting for drug traffickers to utilise Singapore as a 'transit hub' for drugs. Anyway, what's the risk of having your belongings frisked while in transit at Changi Airport? This is probably the reason why some drug traffickers deliberately transit at Changi Airport rather than head directly to their destination country.<br>Otherwise it beats me why didn't Nguyen Tuong Van fly directly to Melbourne from Phnom Penh, or transit via a country which does not have such strict drug laws (maybe thailand) as ours?<br><br>The Singapore government has the duty to stop Singapore from deteriorating into a 'Drug Transit Hub', hence the need to impose the death penalty even on drug traffickers in transit. Cos basically, we have a reputation to protect.</div>

He had joined the ruling party in seeking clemency for Nguyen. Nguyen was arrested in December 2002 at Changi Airport while on transit from Cambodia to Melbourne.<br><br>He was found guilty of smuggling 396g of heroin and sentenced to death last Marchin the High Court.<br><br>Nguyen, a salesman of Vietnamese descent from Melbourne, admitted he acted as a drug courier to help his twin brother pay off debts to loan sharks.<br><br>Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, the penalty for the illegal traffic, import or export of more than 15g of heroin is death.<br><br><span style="color: red;">According to foreign media reports, Mr Downer said he was still seeking advice from the Australian Federal Police and other authorities on the sort of evidence Nguyen might be able to provide in future drug cases in a bid to mount another appeal.</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SGdiehard,<br><br>I am not unrreasonable.<br><br>2-4) I say Forbes' and Ariel's posts are lacking in substance not because they disagree with me - FYI, I'm perfectly willing to engage or even accept another point of view, and I make that clear in this forum when I answer people's posts with "I see" or "I agree" or "yes" or "I see your point" - but because the weakness of their argument can easily be proved from reference to linguistic material on logical fallacies provided by secondary school or University. I have spent quite a sizeable portion of my post discussing Ariel's inaccuracies, and I have said, in fashion,  that Forbes' letter is so short that it would probably score a 2 in an SAT exam (which I am taking on Dec 3). :mregreen:<br><br>IMHO, if my character was that which you assume me to possess, then I would be calling *your* posts insubstantial and refusing to answer them, rather than providing you detailed, if unclear, analyses to each section of your post.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>6) I'll reply to this paragraph later, because I need to look for Ariel's letter.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>7) Please don't put words into my mouth. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>10) Saying that a student didn't do his CME homework properly is not the same as saying that he didn't do his CME homework peroid.<br><br>11) America is a federation of states which is less united than u think. Half of the USA is retentionist; the other half is abolitionist. In many ways, in fact, the USA appears to be a microcosm of the UN.<br><br>13) I was using Heroin as an example, not ecstasy. Nonetheless, even for ecstasy, if companies like GSM started to market new medicinal products that had the same effects, but not the same side-effects and addictive capability, as the constituents of (illegal) ecstasy pills (i.e. amphetamine, ketamine, FXM, ephedrine etc.), then probably we wouldn't have to worry about ecstasy pills as a problem, since there would be no more demand for them.<br><br>15)<br><br>17) And the relevance of this to your quote is... ??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>19) I do respect what they are doing for me. You seem to have misunderstood the section you quoted.<br><br>21)   Jeez, I hate the condescension of "y r too young". Why don't you just explain to me, if you want to make a point. But anyway, however an adult can shoot a drug traffficker, nonetheless it is unhealthy for his / her child to in/directly experience the violence.  So anyway ...<br><br>23) Well, giving them the right to survive is only one part of the larger picture. Clearly, if we do not find a way to integrate them back into society, they will be compelled to re-commit their crimes, and social integration also happens to be an essential requirement of helping ex-convicts live out their lives as useful and law-abiding citizens. But then of coruse, it takes 2 hands to clap - having one without the other is fully useless. There is no point in helping a dead man re-integrate into society, or to spare a man's life in the barest sense but isolate him from the community such that s/he has no alternative except to seek social security (which IS NOT available in Singapore since the govt likes ruggedness so much)  or commot crime, than blame him/ her for being lazy or using his/her example to apparently prove that "many criminals repeating crimes after jail". Kind of like the pot calling the cattle black, eh?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>25) That's the problem with retentionists: the victims are always innocent, true, but isn't there a possibility that the convicted accused is innocent too, say framed or whatever? After all, police are also human beings; tehy may misinterpret information or come to incorrect conclusions based on extrapolations from incomplete information. Judges are also not perfect: Seriously, does YPH look like a saint to you? Judges are people too, and they can make mistakes in judgement; experience reduces the chance of making mistakes, but it does not eliminate that possibility.<br><br>Blindly following a trend is indeed unhealthy, but so is blindly rejecting to follow all trends per se. At the end of the day, we need to appreciate the fact that a trend means the presence of a huge mass of people, and that there must be a certain strong attractive force to bind so many people to one cause. In the Death Penalty's case, unlike in the case of teenage idols, the cause is a moral cause, and moral causes are seldom incorrect because they base themselves on caring for the welfare of others.<br><br>IMHO, abolitionists recognize that the attitude is just as important as the physical legislation itself, thus they define 2 forms of abolitionism : totally abolitionist and abolitionist in practice. A totally abolitionist country has scrapped laws for the Death Penalty, whilst a country which is abolitionist in practice has not scrapped the Penalty, but nonetheless has ceased performing executions for a relatively long number of years (eg. 25 yrs) , thus signalling a change in mindset and attitudes of the government officials, and sometimes even the people of those countries.<br><br>27) Well, you certainly aren't abolitionist.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Can you prove that the following laws are just: Sedition Act, Land Acquisition Act, Newspaper and Printing Presses Act, just to name a few? (This is not a rhetorical question, jic u think it is.) I have no doubts that our laws are fair in that they dole out equal punnishment to all those convicted, but fair laws are not necessarily just laws.<br><br>29) Don't try and twist my words. Needs are excessively strong desires in the case of abstract principles: justice (supported by the retentionist camp) as as abstract a concept as human dignity (supported by the abolitionist camp). When I say or imply lack of awareness, I mean lack of awareness of facts. Facts in this case doesn't just mean statistics proving the presence or absence of the DP's effect, or the financial costs or savings incurred by it, but also means knowing and understanding and empathising with convicts on the Death Row, the executioner who apparently can't find a suitable replacement, and the CJ, who to his personal credit, did feel moral uneasiness at sentencing Vignes Mourthi to the DP. Our press and local media do not cover such perspectives enough. It is through the set of facts provided to the person that makes the person see the need or lack thereof for the action or policy to be implemented. In such respect, I have to say that AI officials have more experience than you, me or even perhaps the government in such awareness, since they take part in prison inspections and full court hearings with other international organizations. Sometimes, they even interview the various people involved.<br><br>I am not conducting a fallacy of gross generalization, because I acknowledge that it is the majority, and not the entire, population which is politically apathetic. And anyway, we can prove that. Even looking at SGForums alone, there are many more forumnites in the other forums combined than in this one.<br><br>(continued below)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(continued from above)<br><br>31) Oh please, don't go so low as to start a chain of personal insults.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> IMHO, ad hominems are usually conducted by people who realize that their case doesn't really stand up to scrutiny, but who still wish to impose their case on a moral high ground to others' cases. Moderate abolitionists like AI do not conduct Ad Hominems in their reports, speeches or other documents. In contrast, our government and its supporters enjoy performing Ad hominems on those who refuse to agree with them: "western-influenced liberals", "confrontational press", "degrade the credibility of her office", "quitters", "politically-motivated".<br><br>Ad hominems all share a similar facet: ALL without fail commit the fallacy of Gross Generalization or the Fallacy of Composition.<br><br>For example, "confrontational press" neglects the fact that Western presses do praise their governments for jobs well done, or that they do give appraisal in their commentaries. For example, when the IHT or the BBC assess the life or reign of a political ruler such as Margaret Thatcher, they do provide acknowledgement for the contributions made whilst criticising the ruler as well. When commenting on the policies, frequently these newspapers will make comparisons between different administrations; the NYT for example might compare Kennedy's administration with Bush's, and will mention the strengths and weaknesses of each. In editorials, the newspapers will try to give as objective an analysis as possible. Op-eds are usually more partisan, but better writers such as David Brooks and Thomas Friedman, will be pretty moderate in their comments. You will also tend to see counter-arguments laid out in progression. For example, if on Monday, there is an article criticising Senate for slow decision-making, on Thursday or Friday, the NYT will publish an Op-ed staunchly defending the slowness of the Senate. American and other Western papers are open to comments from all sections of the political spectrum; they are not like say Al Jeezera, which only focuses on Pro-muslim, anti-Western propaganda. The Western Press is not merely confrontational.<br><br>"politically-motivated", likewise, fails to recognize that not all politically-active citizens or foreigners are here to overthrow the government or create riots. Calling international organizations like UNCHR and AI that is simply disgraceful, since it neglects the fact that these organizations are usually those who protest the loudest against any form of violence; It's just that they do not discriminate like governments do: they criticize abuse of governmental powers and violence of governmental actions as much as they criticize the violence of the bombings of Al Quaeda. When riots or genocide occurs, AI will usually pretty quickly call for investigation by the international community and the local government, especially if the organization suspects that it is the work of terrorists. It will urge ,in its Urgent Actions Appeals, the involved government to bring the perpetrators to justice as quickly as possible. True, AI oraganizes protest marches, but protest marches are not analogous to riots, and that is a mistake MHA frequently makes.<br><br>2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> You obviously don't understand fallacies. Ad Misericordiam refers to an appeal to pity. I have not used such an appeal. Have you seen these phrases in any of my posts: Oh, we abolitionists are tortured by worldwide govenrments, denied funding by the IMF, threatened to be expelled from countries, short on money, forced to sink into endless depths of depression, such that some of us have even committed suicide, ruthlessly mocked whilst we watch country after country turn a blind eye to our appeals for justice, and have our hearts broken by loved ones who choose to dissociate from us and remain retentionist? This is Ad Misericordiam for you. A person or institution using Ad Misericordiam will focus pity upon himself/herself or itself. I, or any other abolitionist for the matter, have not performed any such argument.<br><br>On the other hand, objectively compare the retentionists' underlying arguments in summary: We are the <span style="color: red;">poor innocent folk</span> (sound at least vaguely familiar?) who are being imposed upon by the cruel, thoughtless abolitionists who wish to ensure that <span style="color: green;">if one of our loved ones was murdered, we would be forced to spread out tears over his/her grave with yet the fear that another of our loved ones or even ourselves might be killed </span>by this <span style="color: darkred;"> demon </span> which has been allowed to go scot-free. <span style="color: orange;">we have already shown enough mercy by letting them go on trial. </span>Those horrid abolitionists wish our societies to descend into anarchy, where <span style="color: violet;">everybody will die from drug addiction, gun usage and serial murder</span>. <span style="color: yellow;">Then, they wish us to spend our life savings </span> on<br>furnishing prisons for <span style="color: brown;">twisted hearts who should burn in the Eternal Fire or be denied Nirvana or be destroyed by the Wrath of Yu Huang Da Di and be forsaken by Guanyin Pusa.</span> Doesn't all these show that <span style="color: indigo;">the abolitionists are evil beings who do not care for us </span>, their fellow humans on this planet?<br><br>If the previous prargraph sounds exaggerative to you, I provide the relevant paraphrases (in the appropriate colours):-<br><br><span style="color: red;"> innocent victims</span><br><br><span style="color: green;"> deterrent effect (of the death penalty) OR deters crime OR accounts for a lower crime rate OR our children will die from the [poisons] the drug-traffickers sell</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;"> unrepentant criminals OR criminals who commit crimes after release from prison OR dangerous megalomaniacs OR people with a taste for blood OR psychos</span><br><br><span style="color: orange;"> Hanging is more humane than the Electric Chair OR Lethal injections offer painless deaths (something which these murderers do not deserve)</span><br><br><span style="color: violet;"> Without the Death Penalty, crime rates would escalate OR we will become the drug-trafficking regional centre if there is no control imposed OR The high level of public safety is due to the existence of the Death Penalty OR do you want us to become like the USA, where 1 American dies every hour from a gunshot wound?</span><br><br><span style="color: yellow;"> It costs more to incarcerate than to execute a person OR why should we waste taxpayers' money on them</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;"> they should not even have been born OR they ought to fry in Hell OR an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;"> These westerners who seek to impose their values on us do not understand our unique and delicate circumstances OR the over-generalizing western liberals</span><br><br>If you look around at govt press releases, this forum and other sites, you are sure to find these arguments presented for the retentionist case.
