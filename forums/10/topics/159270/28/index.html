I understand and respect your view, even though I don't support it.<br><br>4) There is the proverb "necessity is the mother of invention". Where there is demand, suppliers will always find a way to meet it. It is true that suppliers can initially generate demand for their products due to freshness e.g. Ford in the 1920s, but the supply alone doesn't sustain the demand. The demand either sustains itself or dies rapidly. Thus, I still believe that if there is no demand, there will be no supply.<br><br>5) I would question as to why our family members are taking drugs in the first place. After all, if they are taking drugs, executing 10000 traffickers won't solve the problem.<br><br>the pikamaster<br><br>P.S.: Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think the law should be fixed according to one motion without considering every other factor. A law may be a law, but throughout history, how many times have the court need to adjust their laws upon understanding of a changing situation. Were the laws of countries of the past really right???<br>Were the laws back in England in history in killing people they called "witches" really right???<br>The stir up motion here is that: Are the authorities really aware of the situation as in what is really happening on the grounds, rather than thinking of the "Nation's Security" all the time. Does anyone really believe that handing over one man to the Australian government will really affect the country, and next moment the country is filled with druggies all over the place?<br>When implementing laws so strict, people are unhappy. The question is, does creating unhappiness really solve anything???<br>The only thing everyone knows here is that they can't do this or that or else they get sentence here or sentence there. How is that cause and effect due to the law actually making a difference now, rather it's making people feel they need to follow guidelines in life to live life properly? How much difference is that when Mao Zedong burn all books of education in order to restrict China's understanding of the world and close it's market??<br>How does denial and deprivation really help anything or anyone in particular???<br><br>What i believe these laws have not perceive is that Singapore should not be just a place to live in, but rather also a place to grow in...<br>And growing up includes mistakes and viewpoint differences that is always subjective whether it is right or wrong. If those mistakes cannot be forgiven, then we might as well forget about the "Yellow Ribbon" or anything else, cause why do we have to advertise it on TV and next moment kill someone like that???<br>And the worse case of it all is that we are so centralise about we Singaporeans that we forgot that foreigners are also human, be it killing a Singaporean or killing a foreigner, it is a life that we are killing. Why the different clauses to these terms???<br>In US, the case to legalise Marijuana is still pending as more investigations are found that the "drug" is actually good for health in certain ways and previous acclamations of it's "harmful effects" have since recently been proven wrong and found the result as base on previous test were in fact bias. Now, if this "drug" is actually proven helpful to health rather than harmful, then what is actually right and what is actually wrong???<br>Moreover, Singapore law has already sentence anyone who consumes drugs here, but why sentence those who consume abroad??? And if people are taking it for fun and entertainment, isn't the penalty too high and unjustified?? Why are laws made to set examples to restrict other causes, why can't laws be more justified according to the actual crime done? If punishing one man can really help others from commiting crimes, then it's really a "lowly" viewpoint coming from the government about Singaporeans that Singaporeans are not independent mentally and we cannot think for ourselves...<br>In fact, all the restrictions are aimed upon us with all the TV ads, but obviously, many people are already aware of the "harmful" effects of things, but still choose to smoke, drink etc.... Why must there be those constant education anymore???<br>It is this little point in life called life choosing, like choosing our own roads and having our own choices that is in fact necessary for life growth, so why must the government take all these away with implementing more harsh laws???<br>I believe if they take away these laws, Singaporeans can still think for themselves, some mistakes made but they will learn from it, and in result, they truly achieve something within in terms of maturity more than following rules.<br><br></div>
