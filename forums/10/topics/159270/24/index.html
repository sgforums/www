SPF is corrupted? Go look at the Philippines or our immediate neighbour....<br><br>Who said that Singapore do not have pple taking drugs? It is just that the tough laws that is keeping everything in check. Without SPF or CNB working round the clock to keep Singapore drug-free, do u think u and ur kids are safe? Dun understand your anti-police sentiments and paranoia that they send the wrong man to the gallows, mebbe too much HK movies....<br><br>Drug addicts and traffickers are the worst criminals I have encountered.<br><br></div></blockquote>I aint the blind one, and i do under the situation, of course SPF is corrupted, i know other PF in other countries, every single country. Just because you were in the PF, you dont have to back up for them, that is exactly what corruption is, hiding it from the public. If singapore have people taking drugs, catch them and hang them, do something about it. The drug problem is always going to be around, no matter how many people you hang. The best way is a life sentence without bail or paroll. What is the sentence for murder in sinapore?</div>
