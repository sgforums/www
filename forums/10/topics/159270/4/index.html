Why didnÂ’t they bring in some top notch OZ lawyers here, if they canÂ’t defend him in court, they could give advice to the defense lawyer, or at least they could follow the whole court proceeding and highlight anything ambiguous or biased, and anything that were hidden from them. IsnÂ’t this a good opportunity to scrutinize and put the Singapore judicial system to a test? What were the positive actions taken to help this man, by the OZ and ppl like you?? just write something and expect ppl to believe that our Judges are biased, they donÂ’t know how to make analysis, the police can be wrong?

Tobacco is not illegal and it takes prolonged direct inhaling to be addictive and it may or may not kill. Illegal drugs such as Ecstasy pills, methamphetamines and don know what else are highly addictive, take one and you canÂ’t live without it, and without treatment, death is guaranteed. Death is an unpleasant side-effect??

            <div class='col-md body'>The campaign to save the life of Melbourne man Nguyen Tuong Van has gathered pace, with a local priest to seek papal intervention and friends calling on Prime Minister John Howard to help save him.<br><br>Kelly Ng and Bronwyn Lew, flanked by friends of Nguyen's from high school, today launched the ``Reach Out'' campaign, based on a trace of Nguyen's hand that he sent to his mother while in prison in Singapore on drug trafficking charges.<br><br>"We would like the Prime Minister to ask all Australians to reach into their hearts and reach out to help Van by tracing their hands on a piece of paper and sending it to us so that we can show the President how much support we have here,'' Ms Lew said.<br><br>"We would also like Prime Minister John Howard to also trace his own hand on a piece of coloured paper because every hand counts,'' Ms Ng added.<br><br>The young women are asking members of the public to trace their own hands, write a message of support inside the trace and send it to them at a secure address. The tracings will be collected and displayed as a mural before being forwarded to the Singaporean government.<br><br>They said they chose hands as a symbol of Nguyen's desire to touch his friends and family while in prison. The picture of his own hand arrived last week, the day his mother returned from visiting him in Singapore's Changi prison.<br><br>"Everytime his mother goes over to visit him they are physically separated by a piece of glass and it hurts her so much to not be able to physically comfort her son,'' Ms Ng said.<br><br>"The last time she saw him Van actually held his hand up to the glass, trying to reach out to his mum and said 'Mum, hold my hand' and she in return put her hand up and said `I'll hold you forever'.<br><br>"And that to us is very significant because it says so much about how much he wants to be held and to be able to physically comfort him is all that we want to do.''<br><br>Nguyen, 25, was arrested in Singapore on December 12, 2002 as he was preparing to board a flight from Singapore to Melbourne. He was found with two packets of heroin, totalling 396 grams, and was sentenced to hang under Singapore's strict mandatory sentencing laws.<br><br>His appeal for clemency was rejected by Singapore's president S.R. Nathan last week.<br><br>His Melbourne-based lawyers Lex Lasry QC and Julian McMahon said all legal avenues to commute Nguyen's sentence have now been exhausted.<br><br>Ms Ng and Ms Lew asked people to send in hands of support to: The Reach Out Campaign, c/o Howells, 205 William Street, Melbourne 3000.<br><br>http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/community-unites-to-save-nguyen/2005/10/28/1130400338533.html</div>

I am pretty certain that the common Australian may have agreed with the essence of what Mr Howard said, but not the details. And IMHO, many Australians do not really like Mr Howard. Mr Howard represents the Australian GOVERNMENT and only a section btw. Mr Downer and the Governor of Victoria, when pleading for clemency for Ngyuen,  repesent the Aussie PEOPLE. Unlike down here, where people are forced to think like the government, in Australia and the West, Citizens tend to disagree with their government on many counts and display their disagreement.<br><br></div>

But hmm... maybe I was thinking of another letter by some guy in NZ, also sent to one of our local newspapers. (Think that guy was from Masse Uni.) Or perhaps a more complete version was printed in the newspapers than is visble online. Anyway, since I'm referring to the online version, I can't find anything to say about Forbes' letter, because there is absolutely nothing to say about it. OMG, it contains absolutely no substance at all. What am I supposed to hear that is of any value?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Ariel's letter looks more substantial than Forbes', but if one looks carefully, is just as lacking in substance. The only piece of evidence Ariel uses to support his stand that many Australians have tarnished their country's name is a single quote from LKY. And that quote is pretty much what I would call flimsy evidence in an argumentative essay. The rest of the letter is a bunch of unjustified ad-hominems. Plus, he makes three factual errors:-<br><br>First, he claims that AI is "saying sweet little about the genocide in North Korea".  In fact, AI devotes many Urgent Actions and reports to DPRK and joins the UN and other human rights organizations in issuing many condemnations of North Korea and appeals to teh international community for action. And all these are found on its website. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>Next, he calls Australian politicians "poor students". He makes the same mistake as you did: mixing up the POLITICIANS with the PEOPLE. It was his fellow Australians, after all, who pressured The Foreign Office into making its statement. Plus, a bishop a sydney wrote a letter to the Pope urging the Pope to condemn our government. A bishop is certainly no politician.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Finally, note how the scope of disgraceful foreigners is reduced from "countless Australians" to "our politicians". That is quite inconsistent, isn't it?<br><br>He labels people without justifying the labels: "spewed invective",  "no shame", "do-gooders", "rent-a-crowd".<br><br>Laughably and shockingly, (depending on how you wish to look at it), Singapore is praised as Australia's most civilized Asian neighbour. It's shocking not because Singapore is not civilized, but because of the callous disregard Ariel shows the other Southeast Asian nations of Malaysia, Indonesia, Phillippines, Brunei, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos. His statement implies that all these societies are far less civilized than Australia.<br><br>Then, there is the issue of "not having a word for the potential victims". In both their official statements, Amnesty International and the Government of Australia expressed recognition that drug-trafficking was a serious problem which needed to be dealt with, and that drug-traffickers should not be expected to go free. In fact, the Government of Australia got Ngyuen to reveal information on teh syndicate he was working for. Why should the Australian government do this if it was not concerned about drug-trafficking. For its part, AI has published quite a number of reports calling for an end to drug production and that international parties should look into reducing the drug-trade.<br><br>Of course, I could comment that the line "any way they see fit" shows Ariel's ignorance of the presence of international humans rights laws and perhaps even the Geneva Convention, because the wider implication to what he says was used as a justification for the mass torture at Guantanamo Bay. But by now, I think you should have read enough evidence to convince you that Ariel's letter is quite worthless.<br><br>In fact, I am rather ashamed that the Straits Times would print such a letter in place of many other more substantial, rejected letters. To go this low for the sake of national interest is very sad indeed.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>4) Foreign counsels are prohibited from beign involved in local cases.<br><br>5) ok, I think I may have lost my grammar here...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>6) Alright, for your benefit, I shall elaborate out fully what is in the aprentheses, although I wish that next time you will be more subtle in your analytical skills:-<br><br>(Say honkee Poon Yen Yang, whose case is mentioned in Amnesty International's report "Singapore: a Hidden Toll of Executions")<br><br>I said your statement was a tautology because you would see the non-necessity of putting it down if you had known that there was a paragraph further down in my post that mentioned/described Amnesty International's report.<br><br>(continued on next post)</div>

If you have to peddle, stay away from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>2) Again, if you look at death penalty as a whole, it is not just singapore, many states of america have death penalty. Whether it is the ppl or the government, a law is a law. With democracy (as in america) or no democracy (as in singapore), the ppl elected the government and death penalty is not the reason why the ppl should do otherwise. Foreigners who don't respect the law, do not respect the government and do not respect the ppl. period. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>3) We, the ordinary citizens of Singapore, including me, listen and respect what you, the abolitionists, said about death penalty, but do not consider the information you quoted fully relevant to our society and culture, nor are we convinced of your argument and justifications; we will continue to speak up against the abolition of death penalty and will support our government of Singapore, regardless of the parties in power, in enforcing this law with justice and equity to all who are living, visiting or in transit in the territory of Singapore.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Ppl like Forbes, Ariel, the guy from Massey Uni, are non Singaporean and are adopting the thy Â–law- is-holier- than- mine, and how can they be considered arrogant?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>And we, the citizens of Singaporean, am only speaking out to retain the law of my country, to protect our present way of life and my children (if you have no children, then respect what your father is doing to protect you). For that, how can we be considered arrogant?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>4) You have said yr point.<br><br>5) Indeed, Â“it is every citizen's responsibility to ensure that our state is functioning to the nation's benefit, and not merely for the benefits of the Ruling Party, ideologically or otherwise.Â” Abolitionists is a group of ideologists, are you not?<br><br>6) that is why I said a Â“legal procedure with no face attached (everybody is the same regardless of yr skin color, yr nationality, Â….) a fairer and unbiased trial.Â”<br><br>will respond to the other long post when I have the time.<br><br></div>

Do we have to wait for the sentencing of an innocent before legal reform takes place?"<br><br>2) I wonder... the ppl of Singapore or the Government of Singapore who forces its will upon the people with the "Right" conferred upon it by the "Public Mandate"?<br><br>3) Me, LaserLordz, and other abolitonists here in these forums, are not asking Singapore to change its laws because "some foreigner" says so; we are asking Singapore to change its laws because we feel that it needs to be changed. We, especially me, are quoting the information found by these other parties, and using it to justify our stand. We are being humble in accepting others' criticisms<br><br>In contrast, no offence, but it is the retentionists like Forbes, Ariel, the guy from Massey Uni, and you, who are the arrogant ones adopting the our-law-is-holier-than-thou attitude.<br><br>4)  We are not ignoring the plight of the victims. We are merely contending that whatever the severity of the victims' plight - even if it is death - it does not justify state killing through the Death Penalty.<br><br>5) Ya, by all means, put effort into educating people about teh dangers of drug abuse. But let's at the same time not be hypocritical - if we want to say that our courts practice presumption of innocent till proven guilty, let's make sure that that is indeed true.  It is every citizen's responsibility to ensure that our state is functioning to the nation's benefit, and not merely for the benfit of the Ruling Party, ideologically or otherwise.<br><br>6) Whenever there is mandatory sentencing in place, the judge is deprived of the power to decide upon a suitable punishment. CJ himself admitted this fact after the conviction of Vignes Mourthi earlier in the year (before Ngyuen).<br><br>the (still abolitionist) pikamaster</div></blockquote>The one argument that has no clear-cut answer is #6.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sgdiehard,<br><br>*sigh*<br><br>(replying to your reply to my reply to your reply to LaserLordz)<br><br>1) Taking away the life of a man is much more serious than taking away his youth - at least in the latter situation, the man still has the chance of living out the remainder of his life as a useful and law-abiding citizen.<br><br>2) I know that.<br><br>3) America and Singapore are not the only countries in the world. Of course, there are other countries which still retain the death penalty in practice. But overall, there is an international trend of abolishing the death penalty in law and abolishing it in practice (2 different things).<br><br>I think you retentionists are confused about what respect of the law is. It means to adhere to the law when it is fair and just, not refraining from criticizing the law even when it is unjust. After all, Respect for the Law also entails respect for the principle of Law itself, and by criticizing unjust or unfair laws, one is adhering to that principle.<br><br>4) FYI, I am a local too.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Oh haha<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> your words sound so empty - what if another party comes into power and overturns the law? Will you support it then? And IMHO, most Singaporeans are apathetic, and hence do not bother about retentionism or abolitionism, or are afraid to speak up against the government, so don't try and commit a fallacy of Gross Generalization here, ok?<br><br>5) People like Forbes, Ariel and the Massey Uni guy adopt the Singapore POV, although they write in third-person (omniscient). Thus, they can be considered pseudo-Singaporeans with regards to this issue.<br><br>6) Please look deeper, and realize that you are trying to promote Singapore's model, or at least are supporting the government's promotion of the model, as the best in the world. Please don't retreat into Ad Misericordiam arguments.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>7) good.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>8 ) Well, I am certainly no member of the Ruling Party, and I doubt LaserLordz is...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>9) Unbiased yes, but fairness is as much fairness of the law to the crime and the person standing accused as it is to teh many perpetrators of the same crime.  This sentence may sound a little vague, so I shall illustrate with an example:-<br><br>Capital Punnishment's less serious counterpart is Corporal Punnishment, which by the way is considered internationally as cruel and degrading punishment, absenting a few detractors of course e.g. China, DPRK, M'sia, S'pore.  But anyway, let's take Corporal Punishment, which is caning, as our example.<br><br>Let's say, a school legislates mandatory 6-stroke caning for thieves (unlikely to happen in real life, but for the purpose of this example, assume it happens). Now, we have 2 students brought before the discipline master/mistress for theft. One student has stolen things thrice and this third time, he has attempted to steal a teacher's laptop. The second student has only stolen things this once, and what he stole was a poker card from his classmate's wallet. How fair do you think it is for the school to "fairly" (in your usage of the word in your previous post) administer 6 strokes on both students?<br><br>aft) What I notice about retentionists - and the government worst of all -  is that they adopt a very insular world-view, where what they do or wish to do is right. They refuse to accept criticism from other people, or even see what other people do. They fail to understand that their society and culture is not as unique (remember this?) as they think it is, and stubbornly refuse to learn from others.<br><br>Simply to say, even if abolitionists provided evidence directly relevant to personal situations, retentionists will reject it with the most spurious arguments e.g. "let the murderer/trafficker go free" (sound familiar?)<br><br>Ah well, I wait to see what reply you'll give next.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>the pikamaster</div>
