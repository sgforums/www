            <div class='col-md body'>Canberra calls in a favour on Nguyen<br>From: By Michael McKenna<br>October 27, 2005<br><br>AUSTRALIA'S extradition of an accused killer to Singapore last month will be used in a last-ditch bid to save Melbourne drug-trafficker Van Tuong Nguyen from execution.<br><br>A local civil rights group will today hold a press conference in Singapore, detailing its legal case and accuse leaders of the island nation of imposing a "disproportionate and cruel" punishment on the 25-year-old salesman.<br>It marks only the second time in Singapore's 40-year history that a death penalty case has led to a public outcry.<br><br>The first case involved champion athlete Shanmugan Murugesu, described as a "Death Row confidant" of Nguyen. He was convicted of smuggling marijuana and hanged in May.<br><br>Civil rights group Think Centre will today detail the eleventh-hour legal effort as well as launch a public petition to spare him from the gallows.<br><br>The public protest is understood to have been delayed until a decision was announced by the Singapore Government over his plea for clemency, which was rejected last week despite appeals from the Howard Government. Nguyen is to be hanged within the next six weeks.<br><br>He was caught in transit at Singapore's Changi International Airport in December 2002 while flying from Cambodia to Melbourne with 393g of heroin strapped to his back and in his hand luggage.<br>Think Centre president Sinapan Samydori said the death penalty - mandatory for convicted murderers, traitors and drug-traffickers caught possessing more than 15g of heroin or 500g of marijuana - should not be applied to Nguyen.<br><br>"Death is disproportionate given the nature of his crime, his youth, lack of criminal history and his opportunity for rehabilitation," he said.<br><br>High-profile Singaporean lawyer M. Shavi, who will spearhead the new legal team for Nguyen, said a brief to President SR Nathan would rest heavily on the extradition from Australia of Michael McCrea.<br><br>The British businessman, originally from Nottingham, England, has been charged with killing his chauffeur Kho Nai Guan and the driver's girlfriend, Lan Ya Ming in January 2002.<br><br>The Howard Government agreed to extradite Mr McCrea after the Singapore Government pledged not to execute him.<br><br>Mr Shavi said he would argue a breach of the Singaporean constitution in extending clemency to one person, charged with a capital offence, while not showing the same sort of consideration to Nguyen.<br><br>"The Constitution guarantees equal treatment before the law and clearly that is not happening with these two people, one extradited from Australia and one an Australian national," he said.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore government position in death penalty for drug runners is not convincing ih the face of international drug situation and drug control.<br><br>Death internationally is an extreme and barbaric penalty to be justified on exceptionally strong ground. As society civilises, it can be expected too that Death is imposed only as a sentence of last resort as is now seen happening in most countries with some countries abolishing death penalty except for the most serious crimes like murder or treason.<br><br>Many people got into drug running or trafficking out of desparations. Anyone can make a mistake as well. Usually the runners who are caught are not the perpetrators who are the real culprits deserving death penalty. It is quite unimaginably barbaric to punish anyone with death penalty just because he has been used or he was drawn into drug trafficking by his own vulnerability or weakness.<br><br>Do such people deserve death. Yes, they deserve serious punishment for even minor trafficking. Isn't this deterrent ? If not deterrent enough does it follow that only death is deterrent and there is no more drug trafficking today. We simply cannot reduce drug trafficking even if we impose death sentences on drug trafficking. The only way to prevent or eradicate drug trafficking is to go after the masterminds or perpetrators.<br><br>I feel that with death penalty many weaker or vulnerable people are still unwittingly falling into the death traps not for wilfulness but due to circumstances of weakness or vulnerability.  If we cannot stop or substantially reduce drug trafficking even with death penalty then we are only being paranoid about drug trafficking to the extent of being barbaric - like killing whole family of the guilty in ancient China to please emperor's rage.<br><br>We should ask whether it is possible to substantially reduce drug trafficking by going after the runners who are mostly people falling into death trap due to circumstances not for wilful perpetration of drugs.<br><br>If there has been harshness in our drug laws, we should be prepared and open-minded to want to review it. When it comes a point of time we cannot change anything with continuing death penalty continuing death penalty for drug traffickers is simply paranoid.<br><br>Go and catch the drug kings and masterminds not all the runners. In any crimes of seriousness, they are best dealt with by punishing the masterminds behind not try to get more unwitting people or fall guys. For example if we want to stop copyright infringements, the best way to do it is to crack the mastermind not the minor copying by some students.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SGdiehard,<br><br>1) ok, I get your position, and I agree with that in principle. But of course alot of the points u mentioned could be called into question in practice.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>2) Ermm, r u in the correct thread?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>3) My impression seems to be that you are mixing up 2 different issues here. And also rmb, the Ozs are quite a diverse population, even within a single state. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">So some may understadn Singapore's laws, whilst others may not. It is worng to blanket-assume that al OZs are highly-educated and rich and so on.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>4) what is "necessary legal assistance"? The man convicted before him was refused the legal assistance he requested. The motive was clearly ignored, despite pleas from both the Australian Counsel and the accused's family. Your last sentence is a very callous sentence, especially sicne we neglect to consider that the Judges, including CJ (who is not known for being very fair), might have made mistakes in their judgement or analysis of evidence; even the police might have made mistakes; after all, everybody is human. Not to mention that the evidence of possession provided to convict for the mandatory sentence would be considered  extremely flimsy evidence if used in the presence of a foreign court. Remember my analogy of the valentines' day gift in my previous post?<br><br>5) I'm talking about traffickers as a whole here, not just this particular case.<br><br>6) thx, I noe tt already. But I have an interesting question to ask you: if the latter happens to someone who is extremely gullible, (say a honkee), then do you think it just to take that person as guilty?<br><br>7) evidence of business calls, signed agreements, mysterious swiss bank accounts etc. But anyway, I just read a letter of clemency from ACADP which sorta mentioned he did have links with smuggling gangs.<br><br>But nonetheless, the fairness of the punishment can still be called into question, given his motive and the fact that he helped Australian police uncover captains of the drug smuggling ring he was working for. Refer to Think Centre for more details.<br><br>8 ) Law itself is determined by ideology of the government, so I don't see your logic. Btw, I believe robertteh discusses Democracy's relevance to Singapore in another thread, and many other threads do so besides. So you shouldn't be asking that question.<br><br>9) Why not? Think in terms of an MNC for drug-trafficking; Corporate politics IS very dirty indeed.<br><br>10)  I believe we have discussed this point before. We should be dealing with the demand, not the supply; the nice piece of logic wou have written here proves that. As for why it had to transit through Singapore - well, erpz, blame it on the flightplan of the individual airlines; note that Ngyuen did not take a private jet.<br><br>11) Osama directly instigates people to kill because he wants certain people to be killed. The druglords on the other hand have the same excuse as the tobacco companies (n IMHO btw, it is suspected that many of them orignate from legal corporations in their host country e.g. Myanmar) : The death resulting from drug consumption is just an unpleasant side-effect, and they cannot be held responsible for it. Drug traffickers are emrely MLMs.<br><br>Osama, however, does not necessarily supply the bombs; he doesn't sell them. He teachess people how to make them, or gives them the bombs for free. He is not a corporate boss; he is a general (of a twisted sort, anw) of an Islamic Army. "Al Quaeda" means something like "People for Islam". Osama hence does not provide merchandise. What his followers do with teh bombs he supplies them - i.e. whether the bombs are sold or not - is irrelevant to this issue. On the other hand, the druglords are recruiting people merely to sell produced goods - they do not have fanatical followers the same way Al Quaeda has.<br><br>12) Why don't you shoot your own child instead, sicne after all s/he has the choice whether to buy the drug or not. After all, the peddler is not the one who consumes the drug; it is your child who does. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>the (humoured) pikamaster</div>
