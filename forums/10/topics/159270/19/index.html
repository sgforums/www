I wouldn't see it as a signal from the Government, more a signal from the intelligentsia."<br><br>He cautioned against reading too much into the story, saying the article showed the death penalty was a safe topic for discussion, rather than signalling a shift in government policy.<br><br>"Who is going to sue you, bankrupt you, for demanding an end to the death penalty?" he said. "There is some latitude [on raising issues] as long as you don't discuss the Lee family or racial issues."<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew was the founding father and long-serving prime minister of Singapore. His son, Lee Hsien Loong, became Prime Minister in 2004.<br><br>The population is made up of Chinese (76 per cent), Malays (13 per cent) and Indians (7 per cent), and since race riots in 1964, all discussion of racial matters has been tightly controlled.<br><br>Samydorai Sinapan, the president of ThinkCentre, a Singaporean human rights group, said Nguyen's case had shown Singaporeans how the world viewed the mandatory death penalty.<br><br>"After five years of campaigning, we have got the press to discuss the issue," he said.<br><br>"It's important to have more dialogue and debate, to see the Government's reasons set out so they can be questioned."<br><br>Senior defence counsel Subhas Anandan, who has represented more than 50 prisoners on death, also expected a review of the mandatory nature of the death penalty at some point. </blockquote></div>
