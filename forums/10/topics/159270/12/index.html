            <div class='col-md body'>I personally believe that Sinagpore should go ahead and hang the guy. There is no reason why the government should bend its law simply because an external country tries to intervene. What about the dozens of previously hanged criminals who did not have the privilege of another country intervening on their behalf? Would it be fair for them or their family if this Australian citizen is spared the gallows when his situation does not warrant a clemency?<br><br>Death penalty must remain because it will serve as an effective deterrent for egregious crimes like murder and of course drug trafficking as well. Even hardened criminals will think twice if he is aware that what he is doing could lead to death.<br><br>However, I disagree with the way criminals are executed. Hanging perhaps is too painful. They should consider injecting certain poison that would lead to painless and instant death.</div>
