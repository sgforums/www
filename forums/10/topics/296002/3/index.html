            <div class='col-md body'><strong> How Singapore Rigs Its Elections</strong><br><br><a href="http://knifetricks.blogspot.com/2007/12/how-singapore-rigs-its-elections.html" rel="nofollow">http://knifetricks.blogspot.com/2007/12/how-singapore-rigs-its-elections.html</a><br><br>Sherman Oaks, California<br><br>When the United States drafted its Constitution, the Framers looked for inspiration to the governments of ancient Athens and Rome. Alternatively, dozens of countries have followed the example of the Â“Mother of ParliamentsÂ” in London. Singapore, however, modeled itself on Djibouti.<br><br>The election laws of Singapore have one purpose: to maintain the power of the PeopleÂ’s Action Party (the PAP) and its predominantly Chinese constituents. To this end, multiple arms of the state are used to guarantee not merely that the PAP always wins but that the PAP always wins by crushing margins.<br><br>As discussed in <a href="http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/bd/bdy/bdy_sg" rel="nofollow">this informative essay by Jeremy Grace</a>, one of the keys to sustained PAP dominance is the use of Group Representative Constituencies (GRCs). In the U.S. and Great Britain, each district in the lower house is represented by one parliamentarian. ThatÂ’s only true for 9 of the 84 seats in SingaporeÂ’s Parliament.<br><br>For the remainder of the seats, a Singaporean votes for a slate of 5 or 6 candidates per GRC. That way, 50.1% of the vote can translate into several seats. Multiply that across 14 GRCs, and you have a machine for running up supermajorities that are grossly unreflective of the way people actually voted. The same system was used in Ecuador, Lebanon, Senegal, Tunisia and the tiny African nation of Djibouti.<br><br>The government makes it difficult for opposition parties to contest the GRCs. The <a href="http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en-commons/thumb/0/04/600px-Singapore_electoral_boundaries_2006.png" rel="nofollow">district boundaries</a> are drawn by an electoral committee appointed by the Prime Minister and composed of civil servants. The district lines are not subject to parliamentary or judicial review, and past practice has been to publish new boundaries in the Government Gazette immediately before the calling of a general election, hampering the ability of the opposition to organize.<br><br>But thatÂ’s not the disturbing part. The vast majority of Singaporeans live in public housing (although the flats can be bought and sold as private property), and, according to Grace's report, the government uses its power over real estate to prevent the formation of rival power centers.<br><br>Singapore is a multi-ethnic nation. About 70% of the population is Chinese, while about 25% is Malay and 5% is Indian (predominantly Tamil). The Chinese form the power base of the PAP, which can do the math. An opposition party which appealed to Malays, Indians and enough disaffected Chinese could win an election.<br><br>To prevent such an unthinkable result, the government prohibits the concentration of Malays or Indians in public housing. The percentage of ethnic minorities in a housing estate cannot exceed that minorityÂ’s percentage of the national population. Title transfers which would exceed the caps are disallowed, so sellers can be forced by the law to discriminate on the basis of race. ThereÂ’s no realistic possibility of a minority group controlling certain districts, one of the hallmarks of a true democracy.<br><br>The rulers of Singapore have other tricks up their sleeve. Protests of 5 or more people can be declared Â“illegal gatherings.Â” Ostensibly legal protests of 4 or fewer people can be physically blocked by a ring of police (pictured). Films with political content are banned. Campaigning by the opposition is limited. The viewpoints of the opposition are not well represented in the state-controlled media, to put it mildly.<br><br>The truly Nixonian aspect of all this legerdemain is that the PAP would almost certainly win a fair election. The city-state is safe and prosperous, and Singaporeans will never be confused with Bolsheviks.<br><br>But, as the elderly Mafioso asked near the end of Casino, Â“Why take a chance?Â”<br><br>Labels: Singapore<br><br>posted by Paul Karl Lukacs at 2:21 PM</div>

Yes, the only third party candidate i ever heard of was Ralf Nader, why? because many democrats argue that he chipped away enough of Gore's Liberal votes to swing the election to Bush. Even though, if you ask me, Gore won the elections. Bush V Gore was a total sham and a product of the political nature of the Supreme Court. (Clarence Thomas literally didn't even utter a single word through the deliberations, because he was a conservative judge and he knew where he was going to cast his lot for.)<br><br>Although there isn't adequate coverage of third party candidates, I don't know if it is right to akin the lack of media coverage to outright political censorship or control of the media. Of course, one can argue that it is such a dominant two party system that other parties are not worth reporting on and as such reflective of the democratic deficiency in what is suppose to be the land of the free. As such, in place of outright censorship, we have an institutional reality - where power is monopolized by two domineering factions. This is reflective of the perennial theme of 'power in the hands of the few'.<br><br>However, that partisanship doesn't extend to just political parties, it is a reality so entrenched in the political culture that even the news media is reflective of that partisan vault. News media groups  like News Corp and Fox are known to be very pro-Republican and the New York Times is like the bastion of the liberal news media. Outrightly, it seems biased and unbalanced. But I believe that it is this contradiction and this constant struggle between factions, that reflects the ideals of the founding fathers. James Madison, for one, advocated the existence of conflicting interest groups, to prevent a single tyrannical entity from dominating the system. In where individuals, and in seeking their self interest are in a constant struggle, however that clash of wills has brought about a system of checks and balances and at the same time, impasse. </div></blockquote>I'm amazed how much some people could go on about the Bush v Gore debacle without even understanding the electoral college system of voting...</div>

If nothing appears to be happening, does it mean that all is fine and dandy? Are there things that are going on without our knowledge?</div>
