              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Recently, Police have received a number of reports by victims who were duped into parting with their money after they received overseas calls or Short Message Service (SMSes) to their handphones informing them of their winning cash prizes in lucky draws conducted by overseas companies. From January 07 to date, Police have received almost 300 such reports, of which 122 victims have parted with amounts ranging from $6 to $353,000. The amount cheated so far exceeds <span style="text-decoration: underline;">S$1.5 million</span>.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">even youths part of crime syndicate only 14 years old!</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Police arrested eight Chinese male subjects, aged between <span style="text-decoration: underline;">14</span> and 27 years old, for unlicensed moneylending related harassment activities in Hougang, Sengkang and Pasir Ris in a 20-hour operation which ended on the morning of 27 December 2007 . Among the items seized during the operation included mobile phones, marker pens, paint cans and bank account books.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #888888;">dead bodies found!</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On 16 December 07, at about 10.45am, Police responded to a call regarding a dead woman’s body found at a construction site along Queensway. </span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Police have classified the case as murder and investigations are ongoing.</span></p>

              <p>kidnap scams?! is yr kid safe or will u get cheated?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #888888;">Following Police advisories on kidnap scams issued in Aug 2007, such calls have resurfaced recently.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #888888;">On 3 Dec 2007, eight kidnap scam calls were reported to the Police. The callers threatened members of the public that their next-of-kin would be harmed unless money was transferred to the callers. In some instances, during the phone conversations, cries of help could be heard from the purported kidnap victim in order to make the threat seem genuine. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">All the allegations were found to be untrue and no one has been kidnapped.</span> </span></p>
