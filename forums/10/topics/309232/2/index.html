              <p>I think the price of petrol in Singapore in June 07 isn't as high as now too.</p>
              <p>The earnings is in euros, yes, but the travelling required by a car is much more than the length of Singapore. They do travel from cities to cities by driving. Their parking is horrendous, but I'm afraid I didn't take any photos of parking fees at that time. Let me show you how to parking is in Paris, and how a traffic police gives a summon:</p>

              <p>i agree with u totally, eagle. i am not saying it is `cheaper' to own cars in europe, particularly in france. i have been to a few places in the EU myself late last year for work and colleagues have confirmed the high cost of car ownership, including usage. i dun envy them altho' car price on its own is still way lower than sinkapore.</p>
              <p>this is the reality of today with regards to owning a car. i will be personally `whacked' in an hour or so later.....m renewing my car insurance and roadtax which will set me back $3k <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/sad.png" alt="sad.png">.....</p>

              <p>No, it is not, if you are a citizen or PR and you know how to get discounts and everything. Imagine travelling from Frankfurt to Munich for 40 euros on an express train. Not to mention that with a Bahncard 50 (costs how much I forgot), you get 50% discount on every ride. Even without buying a weekly or monthly pass, a single trip within a city costs 1.5 euros (without the 50% discount). A monthly pass on regional trains and bus rides costs around 72 euros (without the 50% discount). This monthly price is the price for a main city and the trains to its suburds, not from big cities to big cities.</p>
              <p>And, their bus and trains are very punctual, and with at most 5 mins (5 mins is bad service to them) difference from the stipulated time. You can literally plan your trip down to the last few minutes. If you are late for a few mins for the bus, you will quite likely have missed the bus/train.</p>
