              <p>No, it is not, if you are a citizen or PR and you know how to get discounts and everything. Imagine travelling from Frankfurt to Munich for 40 euros on an express train. Not to mention that with a Bahncard 50 (costs how much I forgot), you get 50% discount on every ride. Even without buying a weekly or monthly pass, a single trip within a city costs 1.5 euros (without the 50% discount). A monthly pass on regional trains and bus rides costs around 72 euros (without the 50% discount). This monthly price is the price for a main city and the trains to its suburds, not from big cities to big cities.</p>
              <p>And, their bus and trains are very punctual, and with at most 5 mins (5 mins is bad service to them) difference from the stipulated time. You can literally plan your trip down to the last few minutes. If you are late for a few mins for the bus, you will quite likely have missed the bus/train.</p>

              <p class="standfirst"><strong style="display: block;">HOMEOWNERS in Sydney's outer suburbs have been losing as much as $450 a week every week since early 2004 on the value of their properties as the real story of mortgage belt misery begins to emerge.</strong></p>
              <p>With the Reserve Bank likely to announce yet another interest rate hike tomorrow, a <em>Daily Telegraph</em> investigation reveals hundreds of streets in Sydney's outer suburbs now have houses that have been bought and sold at a loss - in rare cases more than 40 per cent in value.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since the peak of the boom in early 2004, Sydney's southern suburbs has dipped the most in value, with the median price falling $82,750 over the ensuing 15 quarters, according to Australian Property Monitors figures.</p>
              <p>Other areas where the Australian dream is souring include Canterbury Bankstown which has registered $65,000 in losses, Sydney's south west $44,500 and Sydney's west $25,000.</p>
              <p>On a per week basis, the changes in median prices to late last year equate to $444 a week losses for the south, $349 for the Canterbury-Bankstown area, $239 for the south west and $134 for west.</p>
              <p>The decline in median price values are despite a mini-boom in real estate in the more affluent eastern half of the city.</p>
              <p>But while these changes are based on median movements, a new report by MVS Valuers analysised hundreds of case studies of resold homes to offer more detail on how homeowners are hurting.</p>
              <p>The MVS Valuers analysis shows that anyone who has bought as long ago as January 2002 and resold recently in Sydney's west and south west is likely to have copped a loss.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is today expected to unveil a plan to help families battling housing stress in a move designed to take the heat out of the latest Reserve Bank rate hike.</p>
              <p>Last month, on the day before the central bank increased rates to an 11-year high of 7 per cent, Mr Rudd announced the government's $850 million first-home saver accounts scheme.</p>
              <p>Mr Rudd's annoucement comes after new research shows 1.1 million low to middle income households are now spending more than 30 per cent of their income on housing. </p>
              <p>To present an accurate picture, anomalies such as upgraded homes, sales within families and vacant blocks that have been built on were removed from the analysis.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Among some of the worst losses studied,<span style="color: #888888;"> a home in New Cambridge St, Fairfield West bought for $780,000 in November 2004 sold in July last year for $415,000, a loss of 46.8 per </span><span style="color: #888888;">cent.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At Bond Place, Oxley Park, a unit bought for $455,000 in August 2005 sold last May for $250,000.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At McAndrew Close, Lurnea, a house bought for $420,000 in December, 2004 sold last June for $267,000.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On average houses actually bought over the past five years and then resold have resulted in losses of $20,912 in Sydney's west and $20,435 in the south west for their owners.</span></p>
              <p>MVS Valuers director Peter Raptis said there was little likelihood of a recovery in prices in the short term. He predicted more possible losses ahead, or at best nominal growth.</p>
              <p>He said the succession of interest rate rises had already "spooked" the market.</p>
              <p>"You can now get a house, possibly fibro and maybe nothing special but still on a decent block for under $200,000 if you know where to look," he said.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"It's amazing how cheap properties are in some places in Western Sydney," he said.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"We've seen places go for $160,000 to $180,000. That's astonishingly cheap when you remember this is Sydney."</span></span></p>
              <p>Homes in Sydney's west and south west are now siginificantly cheaper than the estimated average price of a home in every other Australian mainland capital, now all in excess of $400,000.</p>
              <p>Aussie Home Loans chief John Symond said last night that Sydney's mortgage belt was now the nation's "struggle street" and will pay a heavy price for any further increases in interest rates.</p>
              <p>Like other property experts, Mr Symond had few words of short-term hope for embattled homeowners in Sydney's west and southwest with a prediction that their home values would remain "flat, or probably soften" this year.</p>
              <p>"The higher interest rates go up, the more suppressed house prices are going to be," he said.</p>
              <p>His advice to homeowners was to examine their personal finances and credit card debts to find savings to offset the rising rates.</p>
              <p>Other experts were similarly pessimistic.</p>
              <p>RP Data residential research director Tim Lawless said dwelling prices in Sydney's mortgage belt areas "are largely yet to recover back to 2004 levels."</p>
              <p>"The problem is that there is simply a large amount of supply and little demand from purchasers. This problem is exasperated by the fact that prices probably overshot the market during the previous boom which ended in 2003," he said. battling housing stress, in a move designed to take the heat out of the predicted Reserve Bank interest rate rise.</p>

              <p>Just came back from visiting a friend who have been living in Australia for the past 30 years. Here are some things which you might want to know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a) Income tax are very high, you might not feel it when you are young and when salary is low. The tax system doesnt encourage people to work harder because you might just end up poorer by more income tax.

              <p>a) Income tax are very high, you might not feel it when you are
              young and when salary is low. The tax system doesnt encourage
              people to work harder because you might just end up poorer by
              more income tax. Some people choose to work for 6 months and
              take a break for another 6 months just to avoid paying taxes.</p>

              I think if u guys have read the Sunday times yesterday, there is an article on locals migrated to other countries. They complained on the high living standards.
              
              A local lady migrated to US mmentioned despite paying higher taxes, she is still being paid more in US than Spore.

              <p>yup. i think tt is the name of the game. if you are mobile and have marketable skills, u can pretty much end up anywhere and have a great live. i guess singapore gahmen knows it and tt's why they play the game too. for every singaporean they lose, they will make it up with the so called foreign talent.</p>
              <p>unfortunately the social equation of it is singapore will lose, or has its unique identity eroded over time. the gahmen is losing no time in `cosmopolitanizing' this small land mass, and u get a singapore that some cannot identify with.</p>
              <p>this is a social problem not unlike hong kong when it was (i think it still is) a expatriate magnet in the 90s. i have an american-jap expatriate fren who works for an mnc. she is a typical expat, lives in mid-level, takes the cab all the time, hang out in lan kwai fong and frens are all ang moh, or HKgers who dig angmoh, like our sarong party girl.</p>
              <p>when i visited her some time ago, and asked her to go to mongkok to check out some of the sights there, she gave me weird look and told me she has never been there nor is she planning to.</p>
              <p>just like in singapore, ask an expat to go to yew tee and most will be clueless. </p>
              <p>so, we will end up with a 2 tier society, the well to do and the everyday man living in the heartland.</p>

              <p>i see that several people here try to condem those who want to or migrated already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as some of these bashers have said, it takes effort to migrate out of comfort zone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>since they know this, don't they know that those who migrated or thinking of migrating also understand this? are those thinking of migrating not human also? no family, friends, sentimental attachments here?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its obvious those thinking of migrating also aware.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1st of all, skilled migration is not for those who lacks market value.</p>
              <p>2ndly, migration is not a easy decision.</p>
              <p>3rd, there must be strong reasons for them to do so.</p>
              <p>4th, why label migrants as loosers? 1 finger pointing in the wrong hole is many other fingers pointing back. Our FTs are so welcomed and we sing praise of them like our ricebowl and future depend on them like we so reliant on them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Likewise, skilled migrants to ,say, australia, usa, europe , japan are like our FTs.  we should know that they are better than us, able to survive overseas and proven their market value and ability to survive in another environment and making it their new home sweet home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ignorants cannot be helped. no use talking to them or expraining to them. the wise will not be blindly believing the definition of a looser.  Lets not be true loosers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>precisely its not easy to migrate, there must be compelling reasons for migrating.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can you see how compelling the reasons are? so tl until some migrated. that is how compelling the reasons. thus, lets not be so abusive to migrating fellow sg'reans. who knows, u and me may migrate soon. like is never constant. the only constant is change. u know i know and then???</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>seems like you successfully migrated to Australia.</p>
              <p>I congratulate you. If you can migrate and survive in australia i think you also can migrate to usa and europe if need be.</p>
              <p>At least you prove that other this planet sg, it is possible people born in sg to live overseas and not suffer like fish out of water. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for those wanting to migrate to australia, is it melbourne is the best for asians?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Oh dear! Is vices up in clean and green Siggie?</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">DINNER in the Duxton Road area turned out to be an eye-opener for MP Christopher de Souza.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He told Parliament he was surprised to see prostitutes lining the streets.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As this was not a red-light district, he felt something had to be done to protect our heartlands from an invasion of street-walkers.</span></p>
              <div>
              <p>&lt;!-- AdSpace 300X250 A1-News IMU --&gt; &lt;!-- Sniffer Code for Flash version=40 --&gt; <span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mr de Souza, who represents Ulu Pandan, highlighted the problem in Parliament during the Budget debate yesterday and asked if more financial resources would be available to tackle it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He noted that the number of foreign prostitutes arrested in 2006 was 4,310. This was a 34 per cent increase from 2005.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then last year, the number of foreign prostitutes arrested went up to 5,400, a further 25 per cent rise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He said: 'Bids to contain the trade in Geylang have not been successful. An evening drive down Duxton Road and Duxton Hill will prove that prostitutes operate well beyond the artificial borders of Geylang.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">'Prostitution is working itself into our heartlands.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">To laughter, he assured the House that he drove by the area with his wife.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He added that many of these sex workers came on two-week social visit passes, and just before the fortnight was up, they would leave for Johor Baru, only to return to Singapore the same day.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The problem was so bad, he had received feedback that sexual services were being offered at shops claiming to offer massage.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He asked what concrete steps the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) would take to curb this and strengthen the anti-vice squad with additional manpower and intelligence officers to hunt vice syndicates and clamp down on their operations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>OLICE OPERATIONS UP</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Responding to his questions, Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs, Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, said it was impossible to completely eliminate vice.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He said the majority of those arrested for vice activities were social visit pass holders.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Prof Ho said that last year, the police conducted 950 vice-related operations, up from the 890 in 2006.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And they were focused on keeping vice activities within the traditional red-light district.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Speaking to The New Paper, Mrde Souza said residents had voiced their concerns over prostitution in their backyard.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He said: 'We should be careful they don't encroach into the heartland areas.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">'I don't think it makes for a wholesome neighbourhood if your children have to grow up next to women plying their trade.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Turning to the problem of illegal moneylenders, or ah longs, he told Parliament the words 'owe $ pay $' have stained the walls of many common corridors at HDB flats.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He was not the only one to voice his concerns on the issue.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">West Coast GRC's Mr Arthur Fong and Mr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang) also shared his sentiment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In January last year, Prof Ho said there were 10,221 reported cases of unlicensed moneylending in 2006.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">That was a 19 per cent increase over the 8,568 cases in 2005.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">SG is not that safe, at least in Oz you got can get boat, beach and your own management.</span></span></p>

              <p>Police arrested two men and a woman believed to be
              responsible for robbing at least two shops in the Ang Mo Kio area. On
              both occasions, the two men were armed with knives with 32cm blades.</p>
              <p>At
              about 6am yesterday, police received a call from a staff of a
              convenience store located at Blk 407 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10 that he had been
              robbed at knife-point by two men. The two men, together with a woman
              who acted as a lookout, had fled with about $800 in cash and cigarettes
              and phone cards worth about $1200.</p>
              <p>Officers
              from the Ang Mo Kio Police Division swiftly followed up on the CCTV
              footage captured at the store and established a suspect’s identity by
              the afternoon of 14 Feb 2008. At about 6.40pm, Police raided a unit at
              Blk 469 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10 and arrested two Malay men, aged 17 and 21,
              and a Malay woman aged 21. The stolen loot and one of the two knives
              used in the commission of the offence were also seized.</p>
              <p>Investigations revealed
              that the two men were involved in a similar case of armed robbery at a
              store at Blk 437 Ang Mo Kio St 42 on 29 Jan 2008. The staff lost $200
              at knife-point. The 21-year-old man is also believed to be responsible
              for a case of housebreaking on 4 Feb 2008 at Serangoon North Ave 4
              where cash and a laptop with a total value of $4000 were stolen.</p>
              <p>All
              three suspects will be charged in court on 16 February 2008 for the
              offence of Armed Robbery, which carries a maximum jail term of 14 years
              and 24 strokes of the cane.</p>
              <p>Commander
              of Ang Mo Kio Police Division, Superintendent Lee Chin Ek, commended
              his officers for their efficient investigative work that resulted in
