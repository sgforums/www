Otherwise Sitoh and Low would have got some extra votes due to their years of serving the residents good shark fin.<br><br>PAP should also know another basic logic - although they got 66.6 % in other wards that does not mean they have real willing support of 66.6&amp; on the willing-voter basis as many of them voted for PAP out of no choice being cornered into voting for PAP due to preemptive elimination of credible oppositions by means of the unconstitutional GRC, electoral redrawing and election-time defamation suits against oppositions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Glad the election is over now...and being a first time voter, I can clearly see that Election 2006 and other elections are just "elections for the sake of having one".<br><br>The PAP had painted a beautiful picture as such that even opposition dare not talk back against them or risk hefty defamination suits. The media are just another CNA, in net terms "Controlled Network Agency". How many reports you have read on the papers about the opposition during the electioning campaign? Then again, evn beforethe votes are casted, positive reports are made in favour to the men in white.<br><br>Is this what we want as a democratic society? Based on justice and EQUALITY?<br><br>I'm not biase or against the PAP, I do agree they have done a great job for Singapore, but what Singaporeans needs is another voice in parliament and not just a voice but someone to represent us.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth...</div>
