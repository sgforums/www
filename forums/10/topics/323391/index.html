              <p>ERP? Aren't COEs meant to check car population?
              					   I AM confused and annoyed by policies affecting car ownership in
              Singapore. As a motorist, I am of the view that there are more and more
              cars on the roads nowadays, so the Government has to set up more
              Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) gantries and raise ERP rates to control
              traffic.</p>
              <p>My question is simple. What happened to the original purpose of
              the certificate of entitlement (COE)? Isn't it supposed to be the
              ultimate tool to limit the number of cars on the road? If the COE is
              doing its job well, why are the roads so choked that the authorities
              have 'no choice' but to set up ERP gantries everywhere to control
              traffic?</p>
              <p>Let's see what went wrong. First, for the past few years, the
              number of COEs grew, and car prices tumbled to a low five-figure sum.
              Second, car loans stretched to 10 years, with banks and dealers
              offering cash-back deals and zero downpayments. Third, additional
              registration fee taxes were reduced. The road tax has also been
              lowered.</p>
              <p>Simply put, the measures made cars cheaper and many people
              flocked to buy them - and many of those shouldn't own a car at all. I
              estimate at least half the car owners today earn less than $5,000 a
              month. Why are they buying a car? With ever-increasing oil prices and
              inflation, one will soon need to pay more than $1,500 a month for a
              small Japanese car, including loan instalments, petrol, maintenance and
              repair, parking, road tax, insurance and so on.</p>
              <p>And now, the new scheme will allow cash rebates to scrap
              cars, in order to turn drivers back to public transport. This is not
              wrong, but we are not using the system correctly. In the first place,
              we should make it very difficult to own a car, but we are doing the
              exact opposite by making it easy for people to own a car and
              subsequently 'converting' them back to public transport. This is moving
              one step forward and two steps back. Asking a car owner who has been
              driving for a decade to convert back to taking buses is like asking
              someone who is used to getting water from the tap to fetch water from a
              well again.</p>
              <p>A better solution is to limit car loans to five years, with a
              minimum 50 per cent downpayment. This will weed out thousands of people
              who can ill-afford a car. And yes, make the COE useful again by
              releasing fewer of them.</p>

              The extension of loan periods is for the banks to earn more $$. Longer Loan period = More $$ paid by those who take up the loan.
              
              It is possible to have a less congested road with more COE, without ERP. Make more roads. But it looks like some idiots failed to see this. Or maybe they saw it, just that they don't know how to implement it (Or should I said, "CAN'T implement it"?). Still, the fact that they are idiots doesn't change.
              
              OK. Now, let's wait for those idiots' reply.

              <p>The funny thing is..... Knowing how expensive it is to own a car in S'pore, with ERP, COE, parking, fuel price.... etc (and it will only get more expensive). Why oh why would S'porean still die die wants to own a car <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>

              <p>Remember people, we want to be a first class financial hub, first class transportation system. Everything first class. GDP must keep increasing every year, little cars on the road = less consumer spending = lower GDP. If lower GDP, people will say ministars not performing, they don't want a pay cut leh. 5% reduction on 3.7mil is $185,000 lesser income leh. You think they want meh?

              <p>I wonder who are the people who actually created these plans and policies?</p>
              <p>They should be honored for their contributions to their fellow men and women.</p>
              <p>The people should know who they are so that some can tell them how grateful they are for their self-less contributions to enrich the lives of the common people. Enriching their driving experience on the highways and parking.</p>

              <p>i will ask this question about this statement you made..</p>
              <p>why the hell did you blame the gabrament for the actions of irresponsible asswipes who cannot make responsible decisions for themselves?</p>
              <p>you can blame the gabrament for a lot of things.. their greed, their idiocy, their speed in blaming people.. but you cannot and must not blame the gabrament for the decisions made by individuals who refuse to take personal responsibility for their own actions..</p>
              <p>for that, you show yourself to be unwilling to shoulder your own responsibilities... making you... what? the very thing that requires the very "autocratic gabrament" you rail against...</p>
              <p>look into the mirror and think about your own responsibilities before you rant against the gabrament...</p>
              <p>and if you want to rant against the gabrament, please rant against the correct things.. here, it's the flooding of COE, the duplicity of COEs/ERPs, the lies told, their arrogance in not even bothering with a believable lie... the lot...</p>
              <p>don't undermine everything said by being so stupid that you blame the gabrament for decisions made by the people...</p>
              <p>that's the same as blaming the gabrament for the way people voted.. and they did...</p>

              <p>both coe and erp are very successful policies in sucking dry commoners money.</p>
              <p>coe implemented to make sure 1stly(legitimate) less people can afford to buy cars thus going green.2ndly(Rumors) make sure those that can afford to buy cars will pay heavily to the govt thus the ability to upkeep million dollars salaries for useless bums..</p>
              <p>this generated an effect for car sellers in order to survive thats to decrease upfront payment and rebates to attract buyers and up sales.</p>
              <p>Our incredibly effective(read unbelievably ridiculous) govt saw more cars on the road and results in traffic congestions. They saw ERP as a solution 1stly(legitimate) to cut unnecessary car flows into usually busy areas.(people need to wake in the morning to go work,thus driving to city area is somehow saw as unnecessary car flow). 2ndly(rumors) another great way to generate money to upkeep already too high salaries for useless bums.</p>
              <p>it yet again generated another 2 effects..one is a vicious cycle of the above. the other is the govt saw that to catch big fishes(more money), one has to loose more fishing line(lower COE so more people can buy cars). so people who saw the short term benefits of lowered COE,rebates yada yada yada starts to think hey im rich enough to buy car.thats where the govt moves in to suck our money away..</p>

              <p><br>COE and ERP do work. Without the COE, there will be more cars in Singapore, without the ERP there will be more movement in certain areas.</p>
              <p>However the current situation of yet so many cars in Singapore and so many movement in certain areas means that the system is not working well enough. That means, we need higher rates for the COE and ERP. Some of the suggestions like 50% down payment etc do work also...</p>
              <p>Then again, pple will blame some pple for the rising cost of things in Singapore. Things including cars.</p>

              <p>Gahment don't wanna look bad by restricting COE from the start so they make excuse by saying they reduce up front cost of cars so that car become more 'accessible' to the masses.... but later when buy liao, found out that fuel and ERP etc... are super chor, but they cannot blame gahment.. Cuz its your own choice to buy.</p>
              <p>Must do you sums properly, plan ahead... blah blah blah... basically shifting the responsibility to us. That's true in some sense though; its our own responsibility to decide if we can afford it.</p>
              <p>I rather have a choice to decide whether I want to buy car or not then to have so few COE that even if I want to buy, I might not be able to get.</p>
              <p>I think I have the best solution; leave COE as it is and leave ERP as it is, but make getting driving/taxi license sibeh hard and only for good drivers, not like all those kayu crap out there. Confirm traffic immediately lessen by 60-70% :D</p>
              <p>In this way, ppl cant complain about price and availability of ERP/COE etc... its because of their own poor skill! :D Good idea?</p>
