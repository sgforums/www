              <p>Oslo decision isn't that dumb....they're using obama star power to gather people to listen. At least Oslo know how to use its influence to get the message across with maximum impact. Obama is using the platform to talks about nuclear proliferation and reduction of tension globally.</p>
              <p>So before you tanish the award or cynical about the award look at the means rather than the end.</p>

              <p>Returning to the idea of Peace, its interesting to see that the same group of people who voiced strong support for Bush Jr's unilateral (and self defeating) military policies, Israeli warcrimes (in the Occupied Territories) and adventurism (in Lebanon) and human rights abuses of muslims worldwide are the same people who are against the Nobel Peace Prize award to Obama.</p>
              <p>There is a certain political trend that unifies these viewpoints and I find is disgusting that so called educated people can support it since it is rooted a very narrow and self serving interest that is so clearly destructive. In the US and abroad, those who support this trend can now be seen to be very clearly in opposition to the activities that entails Peaceful (and profitable) coexistence (tolerance and understanding, facts based opinions, diplomacy etc).</p>
              <p>This group now is so bankrupt in progressive ideas that they need to rely on misdirection, character assassination, threats of violence, sweeping remarks, falsification of facts and perpetuation of ignorant propaganda in order to bolster popular support for their worldview. Everywhere people are doing a double take and going "with friends like these, who needs enemies".</p>

              <p>I won't compare the maturity of Signapore politics with that of america. Singapore is less than 60 years old while america is over 200. If we talk about why the american voted for Obama, you should be looking at why Singaporean are not voting for the opposition. the immaturity of Singapore politics may reflect much on how conservative the general electorate and the supporters of the ruling party, but more so on the naivety of the opposition critics, no?</p>
              <p>People are looking for a change from the usual hawkish attitude of the american government brought about by the Bush administration.

              <p>this sentence is right, the US president does what he sees fit in the interest of the US, that is why there is so much disagreement about him getting the peace award, for he hasn't done anything in the interest of the peace of the world. Afterall, it is the american people who elected him.</p>

              <p>Singaporean are not going anywhere if PAP are siting there without any opposition party to loud mouth...so just because you are blinded by censorship news. doesn;t mean that there are no voice.....perharps it is not in your TV remote control.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span>Oslo wanted to stick it to President Bush....</span></strong><strong><span>But Oslo is also saying that it agreed with Obama administration of reducing unilateral policies but more diplomacy thru negotiation.

              <p>The criticism is that Obama has done nothing deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize and is directed at the Nobel Foundation.</p>
              <p>Whether he wants it or made an attempt at it is not related to the argument at hand.</p>
              <p>It should be given to people who geninuely made a contribution to Peace such as Ghandi and Mother Theresa, not given out as a tool to as you put it "stick it to President Bush".</p>

              <p>Healthcare reform? Maybe by watching all the news and rightwing politics you think he got no support? perharps it is until now that you get to understanding the process of American politics to move agenda thru this of course it is a far cry from the PAP parliment. Because there are no debates. There are no people voice in Singapore!!!</p>
              <p>Singaporean are not going anywhere if PAP are siting there without any opposition party to loud mouth...so just because you are blinded by censorship news. doesn;t mean that there are no voice.....perharps it is not in your TV remote control.</p>
              <p>So until you have an idea how to move Singapore politics forward you are stuck with your own remote control.</p>
              <p>Nuclear proliferation issued is a global issued. Why would Iran and NK only be a US interest? The US could simply sit back and let Israeli take care of the threat. Do you honestly think the Israeli will sit and wait if negociation are going no where?</p>
              <p>On the other hand lets not turn the eyes away from others partners such as  Russia and China who has great oil contract with Iran and its profit from US war.</p>
              <p style="clear: both;"><strong>The Chinese workers – several hundred technicians – are part of a multibillion-dollar Chinese investment in Afghanistan’s largest-ever infrastructure project, the Aynak copper mine.</strong></p>
              <p> <strong>America fights, China profits? <br>In making the case for converging U.S. and Chinese interests in Afghanistan, Robert Kaplan wrote last week in a</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/opinion/07kaplan.html?_r=2&amp;amp;scp=1&amp;amp;sq=Robert%20Kaplan&amp;amp;st=cse"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>New York Times opinion piece</strong></span></span></a> <strong>that, "The problem is that while America is sacrificing its blood and treasure, the Chinese will reap the benefits.

              <p>To Assume that it is only Obama has the responsibilities to negociat iran nuclear weapon intention....maybe that is why he Deserve the Noble Peace Award.....</p>

              <p>no people's voice in Singapore, or no voice that agree with you? you watch CNN or also CNA? you read LHZB or just New York Times? you subscribe YZZK or just economics? you think the rest who don't agree with you were born yesterday? if you choose to understand only what comes out of your finger on your remote control and the keyboard, your brain remains empty.</p>
              <p>but what has the parliamentary process in Singapore got to do with Obama and the Nobel peace prize?</p>
              <p>The israelis WILL NOT strike, using the US made warplanes and bombs, without a yes from the US. They did it on the Iraqi nuclear facilities. So Obama deserves the prize because he stops the israelis from striking the Iranian nuclear facilities?</p>
              <p>If the US were not kicked out of Iran by ayatolah they would still be there profiting from the oil and gas resources, the US continue to stay in saudi arabia despite its violation of human rights, and you think European companies are not profiting from Iran and Iraq, ask TOTAL S A.</p>
              <p>If the New York twin towers were not taken down, do you think the US would be fighting in afganistan? in fact, they were there supporting the taliban, and osama. </p>
              <p>remember the american went to war in iraqi by telling lie to the UN, today the US remains the largest arms suppliers in the world. Dont take the morale high ground and put gold on your face about how great american is.</p>
              <p> glad you agree or you now know that one american rambo cannot win a global war and you need the world, including China and Russia. When obama recognises the contribution of the rest of the world, including China and Russia, and work TOGETHER to rid the world of the threat for nuclear war, then he deserves the prize. In the mean time, if you think the people in singapore is afraid of the government, many americans parents are still praying that their kids would come home safely from schools everyday, for there may be shot by nut case GUN man lerking around, which happens every now and then.</p>
