              President Obama winning the 2009 Nobel peace prize.   He is barely 9 months in service and was nominated before 1 Feb 2009, just 2 weeks in office.  Is it justifiable to win the Nobel Peace Prize.   What has he done on world peace?  So far, nothing.  War in Iraq, Afghanisatan, Middle East, etc are ongoing.

              <p>Premature and hasty, to say the least. The 2009 Nobel Peace Prize HAS NOT been awarded in the spirit of Alfred Nobel and it's a sad thing such a prestigious prize is being devalued. </p>
              <p>Obama may be the President of currently the world's most powerful nation, but there are surely more deserving nominees. Besides, the Nobel Peace Prize should not be a given simply because Obama "brought hope". It should be a recognition of successful peace efforts. </p>
              <p>___________________________________________________________________</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">By awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Obama, the Nobel Peace Prize Committee has done nothing but to cheapen the prestige of a Nobel Prize. Talk about "encouraging" Obama to move on? I'm sure as apparently as the name of the prize suggests, the prize is not a "wish", nor is it an "encouragement" for people to continue pursuing peace. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Otherwise, it would be the "Nobel Peace Wish" instead. The prize should be an acknowledgment  of successful peace efforts and not "promised actions" which does not seem to have taken shape to any extent. Yes, the Iraq war has been greatly toned down, but it is a fact that the US is still at war and possibly hundreds of civilians are dying each day in Iraq and Afghanistan. I don't see peace in either. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Past Nobel Peace Prizes have been awarded to people like Mother Teresa, Martin Luther King Jr., Al Gore and the ilk, and these people have changed the world, shaped the world for the good of humanity. Obama? He hasn't even passed healthcare reform in HIS country, and how can we count on him to further promote international peace? </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Besides, I'd like to add that the Peace Prize has been hastily handed out to Obama. It sure wouldn't be too late to give him the prize after concrete results are seen, right? The Norwegian Nobel Peace Price Committee should probably adopt the approach of the other Nobel Prize Committees, by handed out the prestigious awards to only people who have promoted peace significantly, and these "efforts" should withstand the test of time. A time lag would not matter if the efforts are eventually recognised, and it has after all been clearly stated in the will of Alfred Nobel that "<span style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; border-collapse: collapse;   ">one part (of the Nobel Prize shall be awarded) to the person who shall <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">have done</span></strong> the <strong>most or the best work</strong> for fraternity among nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses".</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">On a final note, may I mention that Barack Obama was nominated for the prize just a single DAY after his inauguration, and this should underscore the fact that the prize has been based purely on hope.

              <h3>Bizarro Peace Prize Awarded to Obama</h3>
              <p>By Justin Raimondo</p>
              <p>Let’s say you’re the President of the United States — okay? And
              you’re on the brink of escalating what promises to be a wider, more
              intense war than that which George W. Bush launched in Iraq. You’ve
              already <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/17/obama.troops/index.html">sent in</a> reinforcements, but you’re undecided about just how many more troops you’re going to send to Afghanistan – could be <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/us-wants-20000-more-troops-to-fight-taliban-1778947.html">20,000</a>, could be <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/1009/p02s16-usmi.html">40,000, or even 60,000</a>. But, in any case, you’ve <a href="http://www.kfdm.com/news/obama-34515-war-decision.html">ruled out</a> withdrawal and diplomacy: the only option you have left is more war.</p>
              <p>In addition, you’re moving – slowly but <a href="http://upiasia.com/Security/2009/06/12/pakistani_refugees_3_million_and_counting/6728/">surely</a> – toward full-scale involvement in Pakistan, where <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5575883.ece">your drones</a> are daily wreaking death and destruction on innocent civilians, and
              destabilizing a government that is increasingly hostile to your
              machinations – even though you’re bribing them with billions that never
              reach their ostensible beneficiaries and only serve to fatten the
              purses of your Pakistani sock-puppets.</p>
              <p>On top of that, you’ve just told the Palestinians that they must <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1109504.html">live with</a> Israeli “settlements” and <a href="http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/10/02/deep_sixing_the_goldstone_report">forced</a> the UN to ignore an <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/UNFFMGC_Report.pdf">official report</a> detailing the killing of thousands of innocent men, women, and children by IDF forces armed by the US.</p>
              <p>On top of <em>that</em>, you’re pushing  through Congress a record military spending <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S1390:">bill</a> that keeps the US <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures">spending</a> more than the <a href="http://www.globalissues.org/article/75/world-military-spending">top 45</a> nations on earth combined on weapons and methods of war.</p>
              <p>So, naturally, as a reward for all your strenuous efforts on behalf
              of keeping the world a place that is less safe, less stable, and less
              worth living in than at any time since the outbreak of World War II,
              you are bestowed with – yes, that’s right, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/world/10nobel.html?_r=1&amp;hp">the Nobel Peace Prize</a>.
              This, however, isn’t just any Nobel Peace Prize – oh no It’s a Bizarro
              Peace Prize – the natural result of us having slipped through a crack
              in the space-time continuum, and landed in a world where up is down,
              right is left, and war is peace – Bizarro World!</p>
              <p>For years – ever since the 9/11 terrorist attacks – I’ve been saying
              that the sheer force of the explosions that sent us hurtling into a
              nightmare world of color-coded terrorist alerts and hunts for “weapons
              of mass destruction,” must have ripped a hole in the very fabric of
              reality. So that, today, we’re living in an alternate universe, where
              the laws of logic and reason are repealed – <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/justin/j021302.html">Bizarro World</a>.</p>
              <p>For a while there I thought we might be heading back toward reality,
              or at least some more rational version of it, and that what I call the
              Bizarro Effect might be wearing off. However, this morning’s shocker –
              the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to an American president about to
              launch a decades-long military occupation, even as he promises (so far
              to <a href="http://www.starbulletin.com/news/breaking/63776347.html">little effect</a>) to bring another occupation to an end — has dashed that hope beyond redemption.</p>
              <p>And as if to underscore the fact that we are still living in the
              world we woke up to on September 11, 2001, a top official of the
              Democratic National Committee – communications director Brad Woodhouse
              – has issued the following <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1009/DNC_official_GOP_siding_with_terrorists.html">statement</a> in response to guffaws from the peanut gallery:</p>
              <p><em>“The Republican Party has thrown in its lot with the terrorists
              – the Taliban and Hamas this morning – in criticizing the President for
              receiving the Nobel Peace prize.”</em></p>
              <p>As Obama prepares for war, and yet more war, anyone who questions this is a <em>terrorist</em> – and peace be with you, my son.</p>
