              <h3>Bizarro Peace Prize Awarded to Obama</h3>
              <p>By Justin Raimondo</p>
              <p>Let’s say you’re the President of the United States — okay? And
              you’re on the brink of escalating what promises to be a wider, more
              intense war than that which George W. Bush launched in Iraq. You’ve
              already <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/17/obama.troops/index.html">sent in</a> reinforcements, but you’re undecided
              about just how many more troops you’re going to send to Afghanistan
              – could be <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/us-wants-20000-more-troops-to-fight-taliban-1778947.html">20,000</a>, could be <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/1009/p02s16-usmi.html">40,000, or even 60,000</a>. But, in any case, you’ve
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.kfdm.com/news/obama-34515-war-decision.html">ruled out</a> withdrawal and diplomacy: the only
              option you have left is more war.</p>
              <p>In addition, you’re moving – slowly but <a rel="nofollow" href="http://upiasia.com/Security/2009/06/12/pakistani_refugees_3_million_and_counting/6728/">surely</a> – toward full-scale involvement in
              Pakistan, where <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5575883.ece">your drones</a> are daily wreaking death and
              destruction on innocent civilians, and destabilizing a government
              that is increasingly hostile to your machinations – even though
              you’re bribing them with billions that never reach their ostensible
              beneficiaries and only serve to fatten the purses of your Pakistani
              sock-puppets.</p>
              <p>On top of that, you’ve just told the Palestinians that they must
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1109504.html">live with</a> Israeli “settlements” and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/10/02/deep_sixing_the_goldstone_report">forced</a> the UN to ignore an <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/UNFFMGC_Report.pdf">official report</a> detailing the killing of
              thousands of innocent men, women, and children by IDF forces armed
              by the US.</p>
              <p>On top of <em>that</em>, you’re pushing through Congress a
              record military spending <a rel="nofollow" href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S1390:">bill</a> that keeps the US <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures">spending</a> more than the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.globalissues.org/article/75/world-military-spending">top 45</a> nations on earth combined on weapons and
              methods of war.</p>
              <p>So, naturally, as a reward for all your strenuous efforts on
              behalf of keeping the world a place that is less safe, less stable,
              and less worth living in than at any time since the outbreak of
              World War II, you are bestowed with – yes, that’s right, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/world/10nobel.html?_r=1&amp;amp;hp">the Nobel Peace Prize</a>. This, however, isn’t just
              any Nobel Peace Prize – oh no It’s a Bizarro Peace Prize – the
              natural result of us having slipped through a crack in the
              space-time continuum, and landed in a world where up is down, right
              is left, and war is peace – Bizarro World!</p>
              <p>For years – ever since the 9/11 terrorist attacks – I’ve been
              saying that the sheer force of the explosions that sent us hurtling
              into a nightmare world of color-coded terrorist alerts and hunts
              for “weapons of mass destruction,” must have ripped a hole in the
              very fabric of reality. So that, today, we’re living in an
              alternate universe, where the laws of logic and reason are repealed
              – <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.antiwar.com/justin/j021302.html">Bizarro World</a>.</p>
              <p>For a while there I thought we might be heading back toward
              reality, or at least some more rational version of it, and that
              what I call the Bizarro Effect might be wearing off. However, this
              morning’s shocker – the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to an
              American president about to launch a decades-long military
              occupation, even as he promises (so far to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.starbulletin.com/news/breaking/63776347.html">little effect</a>) to bring another occupation to an end
              — has dashed that hope beyond redemption.</p>
              <p>And as if to underscore the fact that we are still living in the
              world we woke up to on September 11, 2001, a top official of the
              Democratic National Committee – communications director Brad
              Woodhouse – has issued the following <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1009/DNC_official_GOP_siding_with_terrorists.html">statement</a> in response to guffaws from the peanut
              gallery:</p>
              <p><em>“The Republican Party has thrown in its lot with the
              terrorists – the Taliban and Hamas this morning – in criticizing
              the President for receiving the Nobel Peace prize.”</em></p>
              <p>As Obama prepares for war, and yet more war, anyone who
              questions this is a <em>terrorist</em> – and peace be with you, my
              son.</p>

              <p>Must also mention that one of the bloodiest wars after 1945 was the Iran-Iraq war lah - one million casualties</p>
              <p>90% of world conflicts involved muslims. 11 million muslims died in those conflicts.</p>
              <p>The statistics of muslims killing muslims is staggering - approximately  90% of 11 million dead muslims were slaughtered by fellow muslims.</p>

               Accepting something that you do not deserve yet especially an award is a shameful act of self worship and selfishness. Glad to know from you that he declined. He should have. The world is smart enough to eventually judge Obama administration even without a Nobel tag on the man himself in the end or yet. The decision to give the award to him is clearly political as certain people hope the award would put pressure on the president to do what they hoped for. Come to think of it then it's actually quite disgusting for the Noble prize committee to even consider giving Obama the award much like a canine trainer would give reward to a dog in order to train it do a certain act. It's an insult to the president. They should have waited a few years down the road.
                                                  <br><br>
              Mr. President just be yourself and may God bless you and your nation.
              Don't make some stupid award put you down. Obama is above that.

              the Nobel Prize will allow Obama to go to his divided Democratic caucus

              Extract from Independent newspaper by Robert Fisk for your reading.
              
              "His Middle East policy is collapsing. The Israelis have taunted him by ignoring his demand for an end to settlement-building and by continuing to build their colonies on Arab land. His special envoy is bluntly told by the Israelis that an Arab-Israel peace will take "many years". Now he wants the Palestinians to talk peace to Israel without conditions. He put pressure on the Palestinian leader to throw away the opportunity of international scrutiny of UN Judge Goldstone's damning indictment of Israeli war crimes in Gaza while his Assistant Secretary of State said that the Goldstone report was "seriously flawed". After breaking his pre-election promise to call the 1915 Armenian massacres by Ottoman Turkey a genocide, he has urged the Armenians to sign a treaty with Turkey, again "without pre-conditions". His army is still facing an insurgency in Iraq. He cannot decide how to win "his" war in Afghanistan. I shall not mention Iran.
              And now President Barack Obama has just won the Nobel Peace Prize. After only eight months in office. Not bad. No wonder he said he was "humbled" when told the news. He should have felt humiliated. But perhaps weakness becomes a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Shimon Peres won it, too, and he never won an Israeli election. Yasser Arafat won it. And look what happened to him. For the first time in history, the Norwegian Nobel committee awarded its peace prize to a man who has achieved nothing â€“ in the faint hope that he will do something good in the future. That's how bad things are. That's how explosive the Middle East has become.
              Isn't there anyone in the White House to remind Mr Obama that the Israelis have never obliged a US president who asked for an end to the building of colonies for Jews â€“ and Jews only â€“ on Arab land? Bill Clinton demanded this â€“ it was written into the Oslo accords â€“ and the Israelis ignored him. George W Bush demanded an end to the fighting in Jenin nine years ago. The Israelis ignored him. Mr Obama demands a total end to all settlement construction. "They just don't get it, do they?" an Israeli minister â€“ apparently Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu â€“ was reported to have said when the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, reiterated her president's words. That's what Avigdor Lieberman, Israel's crackpot foreign minister â€“ he's not as much a crackpot as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but he's getting close â€“ said again on Thursday. "Whoever says it's possible to reach in the coming years a comprehensive agreement," he announced before meeting Mr Obama's benighted and elderly envoy George Mitchell, "... simply doesn't understand the reality."

              <p><br>In that case, USA should start first by including itself in its own State Department human rights report.</p>
              <p> It has no rights complaining about the authoritarian societies of other countries when it has the largest percentage of its own citizens imprisoned.</p>
              <p>It has no rights insisting that other countries let their banks fail when it did not.  </p>
              <p>It has no rights complaining about Iran supporting terrorisms in the Middle East when it did the same against the Soviet Union.</p>
              <p>It wants Iran's nuclear facilities to be opened to international weapons inspectors but does not allow the same thing in its own country.</p>

              <p>Arafat was dying of Aids. Why assassinate him?</p>
              <p>Wouldn't it be better to have had Arafat discredited as a homosexual?</p>
              <p>Lt.-Gen. Ion Pacepa was the deputy chief of Romania's intelligence service under Communist dictator Nicola Ceausescu.</p>
              <p>In his memoir "Red Horizons", Pacepa relates a 1978 conversation with the general assigned to teach
              Arafat and the PLO techniques to deceive the West into granting the
              organization recognition. The general told him about Arafat’s nightly
              relations with his young male bodyguards and multiple partners.
              “Beginning with his teacher when he was a teen-ager and ending with his
              current bodyguards. After reading the report, I felt a compulsion to
              take a shower whenever I had been kissed by Arafat, or even just shaken
              his hand," Pacepa wrote.</p>
              <p><strong>Excerpts from the memoir' Red Horizons':</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"I just called the microphone monitoring center to ask about the
              'Fedayee,'" Arafat's code name, explained Munteaunu. "After the meeting
              with the Comrade, he went directly to the guest house and had dinner.
              At this very moment, the 'Fedayee' is in his bedroom making love to his
              bodyguard. The one I knew was his latest lover. He's playing tiger
              again. The officer monitoring his microphones connected me live with
              the bedroom, and the squawling almost broke my eardrums. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arafat was
              roaring like a tiger, and his lover yelping like a hyena." hee...</span></strong></p>
