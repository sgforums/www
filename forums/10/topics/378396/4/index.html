              <p>The criticism is that Obama has done nothing deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize and is directed at the Nobel Foundation.</p>
              <p>Whether he wants it or made an attempt at it is not related to the argument at hand.</p>
              <p>It should be given to people who geninuely made a contribution to Peace such as Ghandi and Mother Theresa, not given out as a tool to as you put it "stick it to President Bush".</p>

              <p>Even if opposition is nuts as you put it. You expect opposition parties without learning curve be in the job in Day 1 ? At least the nut opposition asking question that the young PAP dare not question...At least they present themselve with moral courage.</p>
              <p>Your PAP in the job for the last 40 yrs and still make mistake billion dollar mistake....with all the claim elites. So you sure you are not Blind? You sure you are not selectively listen to what you want to hear. (it is human nature)</p>
              <p><strong>The israelis WILL NOT strike -- </strong>I can gurrantee 100% if negociation fail...Israeli will go in alone..with or without US support.Herbrew nation do not look at Gentile.

              <p><br>A hundred responsible people can own guns, and yet it takes only 1 having a bad day to kill the children of the other 100.</p>
              <p>I don't dispute the fact that there are sgforumites that own guns and can use them responsibly but the very nature of guns means that just one person can take down a lot of people.</p>
              <p>If your argument that since some people keep guns and keep them in a responsible manner i could take that logic around and say that the Columbia University tragedy is precisely the reason why guns should not be so easily available.</p>

              <p><strong>The israelis WILL NOT strike --</strong> I can gurrantee 100% if negociation fail...Israeli will go in alone..with or without US support.Herbrew nation do not look at Gentile. They did it with Syria they will do it again. Just put yourself in the shoes of Israeli than ask yourself what do you do?</p>
              <p><strong>When obama recognises the contribution of the rest of the world, including China and Russia, and work TOGETHER to rid the world of the threat for nuclear war, then he deserves the prize.</strong></p>
              <p>How on earth is the UN going to get thru negociation when China and Russia are back dealing with Iran? You can't be that naive to talk about international relation ?</p>

              <p>We are lucky because the real opposition here don't just sit behind the monitor talking c o c k. and Singaporean are not blind when it comes to election.</p>
              <p>When did I say anything about accepting LHL, LKY blah blah blah....? If you can't talk about anything without having the LEE in your mind, then your mind cannot be opened to anything. The Nobel prize is not awarded by the singapore government or the lee family or the PAP. Obama isn't invited to come to singapore to receive the prize.....Running down the singapore government, the lee family, the PAP, does not show how Obama deserves the prize, it shows clearly how little you have up there.</p>
              <p>The hebrews are in the gentile nation, having a significant control in what this gentile nation does.  If negotiation fails, is Israel then justified in striking Iran? What is international relation to you? and if that happened, do you think Obama should give back the peace prize? btw get your facts right, the israelis bombed the Iraqi nuclear facilities, unilaterally, in 1981, not Syria.</p>
              <p>ahh...blame china and russia if the nego fails....then if china and russia enable a successful negotiation, then Jiang and putin should get the peace prize, not Obama.</p>

              <p><strong>But first, he has to get the american people to support his health reform, that is a start to see if there is light from the star</strong></p>
              <p>Comparatively to the lack of debates in Singapore parliment. You are witnessing a democratics process with Debates and Question and public Opinon....that you are watching with all the "foreign news" that you think all to conspired against SG Govt.....Your lacking of understanding the process let you assume that Obama is not gaining support?</p>
              <p>Public opinon there are currently over 50 polls state wide which report did you read?</p>
              <p><strong>but what has the parliamentary process in Singapore got to do with Obama and the Nobel peace prize?</strong></p>
              <p>That is why i said you caught up with right wing news mediaship. the lack of news in parlimentry news in Singapore vs the popularity of news on Obama healthcare debates does not equal to his unpopularity of domestics support on him. Does diminish his creditbility of Nobel Peace Prize...his popularity is still strong and influential globally perharp not in your little eyes only.</p>
              <p><strong>In the mean time, if you think the people in singapore is afraid of the government, many americans parents are still praying that their kids would come home safely from schools everyday, for there may be shot by nut case GUN man lerking around, which happens every now and then.</strong></p>
              <p>Fact -- Singaporean are afraid of being prosecuted by the government for speaking out.</p>
              <p>Guns -- only for Singaporean who stayed in a sterile country that does not know how to learn to defend themselved. is that really Good? There are SG forumners here who own guns they got no problems.   I'll bet that if SG govt allow SG to own Guns. You'll see every family have a gun Rack.</p>

              <p>Hehehe... the whole issue about Obama and the peace prize is that it is too soon to say if Obama has delivered, peace for the world. Not even anything to dow with whatever he promised his people domestically.</p>
              <p>we haven't seen anything concrete leading to world peace and domestically we see him fighting hard to gain support for his health care reform. There are people, media... who support and who are against, what has it got to do with a Singaporean like me. I just sit and watch the final result. If he succeed, at least his popularity enable him to get things done, if he fails, hahaha, don't need to talk so much about a shinning star when nobody is prepared to buy ticket to see the show.</p>
              <p>If he is so influential, then get China and Russia to the table, and don't blame them for his failure, pathetic rambo mentality.</p>
              <p>so what if there are 50 polls state wide? there are many other issues closer home, the earthquake, the flood, the change in weather, damn...the american, still don't cooperate with the world in handling global warming by signing the Kyoto protocol.</p>
              <p>Singaporean don't know how to use guns to defend ourselves? hahaha...we not only use guns, we use very big one, 155mm. But we don't need to use gun to defend ourselves against another fellow citizens, and we watch how the american shoot each others in hollywood movies and in CNN, and we make sure crazy people don't have access to guns, so we don't have to have guns to defend against them.</p>
              <p>If government would allow SG to own tank, I would like to have an AMX 13 in my backyard.</p>

              <p>Haiz this has become too obvious that the Nobel Peace Award has lost its original purpose to honour the truly humble and good.As everybody says, political tool.</p>
              <p>Read newsweek, and the papers and you all will know.</p>
              <p>Watch "the Obama Deception" on youtube. Of course I have to remind everybody to watch it with an open mind because this is what the media wants you to see, its up to you whether you take it anot, although thats what they want lol.</p>

              <p>To everyone out there who'd want to read more about Obama, and not just the one-sided stories of him, I'd suggest "The Case Against Barack Obama" by David Freddoso. </p>
              <p>It may have been written before he was officially elected to be President, but there are some mentions that are worth a read. It really scrutinises Obama not just as a person, but as a possible President of America at that point in time, and explains why Obama may not be a great "reformist" after all. It's not a book for Obama-haters, but it still offers a very refreshing point of view for everyone out there.</p>
              <p>In fact, if you would reread it a few years later, it might in fact come across as a prophecy. </p>
