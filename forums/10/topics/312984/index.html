              <p>There is a long waiting list in the public hospitals because the pay is far better for doctors in private hospitals. Many doctors leave for the private sector, especially the senior ones, resulting in fewer specialists in the public hospitals. Simple demand and supply...of course the waiting list gets longer. If you want a shorter waiting time, you must be prepared to pay doctors in public hospitals far more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You want every patient referred to a public hospital to be seen by a Consultant/Senior Consultant? Sure...as long as you are prepared to pay $150 per consultation. You have to more than double the current consultation fees to mak it worthwhile for Cs and SCs to remain in the public sector. If you pay peanuts...what do you expect? </p>

              <p>For subsidised patients, they still pay $25 per consultation even if the specialist is a senior consultant or consultant.</p>
              <p>The reason for the suggestion that on the first visit is that the patient should be seen by a senior consultant or consultant because they are more experienced and knowledgeable. After their assessments, the patient will then be assigned another specialist (Registrar, Assoc Consultant, Consultant or Senior Consultant) based on the seriousness of his or her conditions on the subsequent consultations.</p>
              <p>My point of argument is that patients do not have to suffer quietly and conditions to deteriorate while waiting for months to see the specialists in the government hospitals.</p>

              <p>For subsidised patients, they still pay $25 per consultation even if the specialist is a senior consultant or consultant.</p>
              <p>The reason for the suggestion that on the first visit is that the patient should be seen by a senior consultant or consultant because they are more experienced and knowledgeable.</p>

              <p>But how is that $25 enough to pay the consultant/senior consultant's salary? Who will meet the difference? Pass it to the taxpayers and raise taxes?</p>

              <p>These consultants have already been employed by the hospitals. Hence, there is not the issue of cost.</p>
              <p>My point is that instead of letting patients who have referral letters from polyclincs (ie the polyclinic doctors considered them to be serious enough to need specialists' care) waiting for months to see a specialist. Some have to wait seven months before they can see the specialists. </p>
              <p>My suggestion is that these patients can be seen by a senior consultant or consultant within a week or two first. After their assessments, the patient will then be assigned another specialist (Registrar, Assoc Consultant, Consultant or Senior Consultant) based on the seriousness of his or her conditions on the subsequent consultations.</p>
              <p>My point of argument is that patients do not have to suffer quietly and conditions to deteriorate while waiting for months to see the specialists in the government hospitals.</p>

              <p><br>when i started this thread, my intention is to see if there's any signal we can draw from GCT's words.</p>
              <p>i do agree he's one of the amicable ministers who really understands the problems that people are facing. i personally think it has got to to with his religious studying of buddhism, though i'm not a buddhist myself.</p>
              <p>as for the point about him being elected, actually he was a former perm sec, brought into parliament under tg pagar (unsinkable ship), given a chance to lead his own constituency later. nevertheless he's got more credentials than people like ng eng hen (2 walkovers).</p>
              <p>GCT's words made me think if he's one to watch.</p>
              <p>who knows, we might get the first malaysian prime minister...</p>

              <p>Mr Khaw is a very competent and diligent minister BUT he is already 56 years old now.</p>
              <p>So he is unlikely to be the next prime minister as he will be 64 or 68 years two or three elections later when PM Lee is going to retire by then.</p>
