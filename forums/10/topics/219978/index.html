But key countries such as China, Russia and the United States have not signed.<br><br>Also absent from the signatories is Israel, which came under scrutiny over cluster bombs after its month-long bombardment of southern Lebanon in July and August when it tried to crush Hezbollah Shiite militants in the country.<br><br>Since the conflict, the clearing of unexploded ordnance has progressed slowly because Israel has refused to give details of the areas targeted by these devices. Unexploded cluster bombs in Lebanon have killed 23 people and wounded 136 since the official end of fighting.<br><br>The ICRC has said that 95 to 98 per cent of cluster munitions are neither reliable nor accurate, while 10 to 40 per cent of the bomblets scattered by a mother bomb fail to explode.<br><br>The start date for the new protocol coincides with a UN conference to review another proposed treaty that would go one step further than a clean-up by banning some types of munitions.
