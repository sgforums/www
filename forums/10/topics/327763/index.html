              <p>this is for the benefit of those don't subcribe to the safe times:</p>
              <p>The world doesn't dislike Singapore<br><br>I REFER to last Saturday's commentary by Ms Chua Lee Hoong, 'Why they hate Singapore'. Singaporeans celebrated National Day last Saturday and deserve the world's congratulations.<br>Trying to describe why Western democracies may 'not like' Singapore is absurd and naï¿½ve, and is probably based on a lack of general understanding and knowledge of how most of the Western world perceives Singapore today.<br><br>Western perception<br>Trying to describe why Western democracies may 'not like' Singapore is absurd and naï¿½ve and is probably based on a lack of general understanding and knowledge of how most of the Western world perceives Singapore today.<br><br>The world has other problems and people elsewhere simply do not care about having Singapore on their radar screen of dislike<br>... more<br>I was born in Belgium, lived in four European countries, the Middle East and Hong Kong.<br><br>I have worked and lived in Singapore for the past 10 years; my wife is Singaporean, and so are my two youngest children. Yes, Singapore is a very good place to live and work in, probably one of the best globally. Singapore is very well 'managed' and that's where its difference from many other countries lies. Singapore is not governed, but managed as a company with 4.7 million shareholders.<br><br>You have a vision and you have good managers who understand how to implement that vision and its strategies.<br><br>You hire the best to ensure you remain competitive and highly profitable in order to secure the future of your citizens.<br><br>Singapore's business model achieves its aim, and I am sure many of its achievements can be 're-packed' into potentially highly successful export products.<br><br>Success is the creation of balance, stability and prosperity between the managers, employees and shareholders or citizens. Western democracies, on the other hand, have their successes too.<br><br>Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, Norway and Finland - as well as some Middle East countries - are all worth studying and emulating.<br><br>Putting China and Singapore on the same page because both are so-called authoritarian states is wrong. There is nothing common to both, except for the ethnic origin of the majority race.<br><br>China is a country of 1.3 billion, pushed into a highly regulated, market-driven economy at lightning speed, causing lots of collateral damage.<br><br>We all know what Singapore is. I am sure Chinese and Russians, and many other nationalities, visit Singapore to study and learn its best traits.<br><br>They also visit many other countries - as do Singaporeans- which do certain things better than the Republic.<br><br>It's naï¿½ve, (or arrogant?), to think that the whole world visits only Singapore.<br><br>The meaning of the word, 'hate' should be carefully weighed before using it. There are two meanings to hate: intense hostility and aversion usually deriving from fear, anger, or sense of injury; or extreme dislike or antipathy.<br><br>I have travelled the world for the past 32 years. I have never encountered or heard a single person or group who hates Singapore - or even dislikes the Republic. At most, Singapore is criticised for banning 'chewing gum' and for its lack of freedom of speech.<br><br>Mostly, however, and especially among Westerners, Singapore is praised for being clean, affordable and secure, and for its wonderful food.<br><br>The world has other problems, and people elsewhere simply do not care about having Singapore on their radar screen of dislike.<br><br><br>Bruno Serrien</p>

              <p>playing with whom? you'd be surprised that folks from many countries are not very well versed with the affairs of the world.</p>
              <p>for example, the more you go away from the coasts, Americans are actually quite sua ku. Some of the folks I'd met have never even left their home state.</p>

              <p>Malaysia and Indonesia politicians definitely dont like Singapore political system because our economic success over the years have made their politicians look incapable.

              <p>The same goes to American who cannot accept the fact that China is progressing so fast without democracy and thats why America has to use dirty tricks like trade barrier and human rights to fight against mighty China.</p>
