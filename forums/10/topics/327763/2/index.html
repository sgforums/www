              <p>Malaysia and Indonesia politicians definitely dont
              like Singapore political
              system because our economic success over the years
              have made their politicians look incapable. Thats also the
              reason why many of the bright and capable indonesians and
              malaysians end up working in Singapore instead of their
              home country.</p>
              <p>The same goes to American who cannot accept the fact that China
              is progressing so fast without democracy and thats why America has
              to use dirty tricks like trade barrier and human rights to
              fight against mighty China.</p>
              <p>China is big, but it is not managed as one country but in
              seperate states and provinces but under the same authoritarian
              communist approach.</p>
              <p>I am just curious which middle east countries are really

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We should note that the original article by chua referred to the western ‘democracy’, not western countries, or westerners in general. Is it not a known fact that those who champion western democracy do not like Singapore’s way of government, and call it an authoritarian state?<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The western countries do not have the same political systems, there are parliamentary democracy headed by a constitutional monarch, federal parliamentarian republic, constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system, just to name a few. Such systems developed through long history, and it is obvious that such systems may not be duplicated for other countries, from the fact that many of their old colonies have not shown much success after independence.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span lang="EN">All systems in the world are worthy of studies, to emulate is another thing. It is the students who decide what is relevant to their countries and what is worthy of emulating, it is not how highly some westerners think of their systems. To think that the western countries such as </span>Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, Norway and Finland are successful and therefore there must be something worth emulating is absurd. Not all systems or model can be 're-packed' into potentially highly successful export products, because each country is different.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">China and Singapore are very different, even between the majority race which are of the same ethnic origin. It is typical of angmoh to think that Chinese is Chinese. No, Singaporean Chinese is very different from the mainland Chinese.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But there is much similarity between the two government, one party rule (Singapore with a small opposition), authoritative decision making…this is despite of the big difference in the size of the countries.<br><br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Much of the damages seen in China were already there, accumulated over the last 100 years, from a weak dynasty, occupation by the western colonial power during the time of opium war, war of independence, WW2, civil war, communists rule and more wars, with South Korea, and Vietnam. These are not the collateral damages due to rapid development. In fact, it is the “highly regulated, market-driven economy at lightning speed” that is giving the government the much needed resources to tackle the damages, with the recent Sichuan earthquake added to the list.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A fair view would be one who look at both sides of argument, a balance view is one that have both argument written down, an intelligent view is what Veneta asked, “I am just curious which middle east countries are really worth emulating if you dont have the oil? “ and humorous view is when an angmoh who live in the developed cities in Asia, such as HK, Singapore, Tokyo, live an expat life, send their children to international school, and think he knows what is Asia. <br><br></span></p>

              <p>The PM is not a leader, he is a follower.   Singapore is run like business, so all is about money making, $$$$.</p>
              <p>Received something from US and addressed it to Singapore, China.    Singapore is not that well known and LKY is not that popular throughout the world. </p>

              <p>Let me put it this way, I have no plan to migrate out of Singapore. I am working towards my happy retirement here.</p>
              <p>When I die I go to where Jesus is.</p>
              <p>My children have their choice where they might want to live. If it ended up my children migrate to USA, Canada, Australia, China... I may end up spending some months of a year with them, there...hehehe..this is a long way from now, but since you use the word "forever", I will just give you the possibilities.</p>
              <p>Of course there is still the remote possibilities that I might consider migrating. Mahathir said he would migrate when Anwar become Malaysia's PM. I will definitely migrate when people like AndrewYPYap, or CSJ, or Fantagf were to become MP of Singapore. hahaha...you think that will happen?</p>

              <p>The world doesn't dislike Singapore<br>
              <br>
              I REFER to last Saturday's commentary by Ms Chua Lee Hoong, 'Why
              they hate Singapore'. Singaporeans celebrated National Day last
              Saturday and deserve the world's congratulations.<br>
              Trying to describe why Western democracies may 'not like' Singapore
              is absurd and naÃ¯Â¿Â½ve, and is probably based on a lack of general
              understanding and knowledge of how most of the Western world
              perceives Singapore today.<br>

              Western perception<br>
              Trying to describe why Western democracies may 'not like' Singapore
              is absurd and naÃ¯Â¿Â½ve and is probably based on a lack of general
              understanding and knowledge of how most of the Western world
              perceives Singapore today.<br>
              <br>
              The world has other problems and people elsewhere simply do not
              care about having Singapore on their radar screen of dislike<br>
              ... more<br>
              I was born in Belgium, lived in four European countries, the Middle
              East and Hong Kong.<br>
              <br>
              I have worked and lived in Singapore for the past 10 years; my wife
              is Singaporean, and so are my two youngest children. Yes, Singapore
              is a very good place to live and work in, probably one of the best
              globally. Singapore is very well 'managed' and that's where its
              difference from many other countries lies. Singapore is not
              governed, but managed as a company with 4.7 million
              shareholders.<br>
              <br>
              You have a vision and you have good managers who understand how to
              implement that vision and its strategies.<br>
              <br>
              You hire the best to ensure you remain competitive and highly
              profitable in order to secure the future of your citizens.<br>
              <br>
              Singapore's business model achieves its aim, and I am sure many of
              its achievements can be 're-packed' into potentially highly
              successful export products.<br>
              <br>
              Success is the creation of balance, stability and prosperity
              between the managers, employees and shareholders or citizens.
              Western democracies, on the other hand, have their successes
              too.<br>
              <br>
              Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, Norway and Finland - as well as
              some Middle East countries - are all worth studying and
              emulating.<br>
              <br>
              Putting China and Singapore on the same page because both are
              so-called authoritarian states is wrong. There is nothing common to
              both, except for the ethnic origin of the majority race.<br>
              <br>
              China is a country of 1.3 billion, pushed into a highly regulated,
              market-driven economy at lightning speed, causing lots of
              collateral damage.<br>
              <br>
              We all know what Singapore is. I am sure Chinese and Russians, and
              many other nationalities, visit Singapore to study and learn its
              best traits.<br>
              <br>
              They also visit many other countries - as do Singaporeans- which do
              certain things better than the Republic.<br>
              <br>
              It's naÃ¯Â¿Â½ve, (or arrogant?), to think that the whole world visits
              only Singapore.<br>
              <br>
              The meaning of the word, 'hate' should be carefully weighed before
              using it. There are two meanings to hate: intense hostility and
              aversion usually deriving from fear, anger, or sense of injury; or
              extreme dislike or antipathy.<br>
              <br>
              I have travelled the world for the past 32 years. I have never
              encountered or heard a single person or group who hates Singapore -
              or even dislikes the Republic. At most, Singapore is criticised for
              banning 'chewing gum' and for its lack of freedom of speech.<br>
              <br>
              Mostly, however, and especially among Westerners, Singapore is
              praised for being clean, affordable and secure, and for its
              wonderful food.<br>
              <br>
              The world has other problems, and people elsewhere simply do not
              care about having Singapore on their radar screen of dislike.<br>

              i wonder if Ms Chua would write a sequel "Why Bruno Serrien Hates Me".
              
              Anyway, i do agree that 'hate' is the wrong word to use.

              <p>For a small country like Singapore, we have attracted more than our fair share of attention in the world, through many international events, the IOC meeting, the World Bank and IMF meeting. We are so small we can't even hold an Olympics game except the youth olympic and we got it. These are the positive ones, the not so positive ones are the canning of young american, hanging the australia drug trafficker.</p>
              <p>If you are in shipping and you don't know Singapore, then your ships are only sailing in the river behind your house. If you are in oil and gas business and you don't know Singapore then gas to you is only what comes out from your body when you have digestion problem. The list can go on with many other international businesses.</p>
              <p>We already have more than what we need and want for our tourism, business, ..and friends.</p>

              <p>I wonder what makes them so independent thinkers ?</p>
              <p>Do they write as they like or where do they derive the ideas, inspiration and motivation to write the great wonderfully nice stuff they keep on writing day and day for years and years? people read and pay for their papers every single day for decades. Any effect? u tell the me.</p>
              <p>Hope the New York Times don't poach her for her independent thinking abilities and unbiasedness and creative writing skills. They must be so highly marketable in the world of journalism which has some ethics to follow.</p>
