            <div class='col-md body'>Come 2009, Singapore Casino will be 44 years behind that of Genting Highland Resort. My first ever survey and educational tour of Genting Highland Casions has yielded some stunning results!<br><br>There are 3 main casinos in the huge hilltop complex, ie Genting Casino for Genting Hotel and the adjoining Highland Hotel, Monte Carlo for the Theme Park Hotel and the main Resort Hotel, The First World Casino for the huge First World Hotel, there may be some smaller setup beside these three dens. The First World is a newer setup and is more sophisticated as compared to the other two. All the gambling dens and hotels are interconnected with covered walkways equipped with escalators which run perpetually except for maintenance. The air outside is cold but  inside the shelter is highly polluted! There is no aircon facilities, the newer Tower Two of the First Wold Hotel is equipped only with exhaust fan which make the hotel a bit more comfortable to stay. The indoor theme park is situated in and beside the First World Hotel Tower One and the outdoor one is facing the  Theme Park and the First World itself.<br><br>If you walk through the carparks of all the hill top complexes, you will be shocked to find that the whole gyration within the complex are triggered by Singaporeans. In Genting Hotel and the Highland Hotel vicinity,out of every 10 cars, there are at least 5-6 Singapore registered cars. In the nearby Resort Hotel-Theme Park vicinity,there are at least 5-7!In and around The First World complex, ther are at least 3-5 Singapore reigstered cars out of every 10 cars. May be the number is high during this school holiday season, but by nature Singaporeans love to gamble as there are bus load of tour buses carrying lots of retired and aged senior citizens from Singapore staying mainly in the First World budget  hotel.<br><br>If you love to glue yourself to the seat facing the banker, your chances of winning is almost 0 in First World Casino,0-4% in Monte Carlo, 0-3% in Genting Casino. The fact is that The First world Casino is modern and well equiped with the latest gadgets to monitor and manipulate the games. Take the card game for example, the main trick is at the automatic shuffling machine(ASM)! Has anyone observed and realised that at the card outlet of the ASM, the are around a dozen of small overlapping leaves for the banker to select any type of cards they wish to dispense?Most will bet that there are none as observant, as most gamblers are so engrossed in the game, in their mind they are in that fantacy to win and win big! The most pitiful ones are those housewives and retirees who glued themselves to the seat and most came out from the casino with their heads down. The bankers are brisk in their finger actions while touching the ASM outlet and they were trained to use psychology like those Sungei Road seed jugglers to lure you into the game. Any new comer will win in the first 1-2 rounds and you know where will you end! Male bankers are doing a better job in that sort of manipulation, so a lady banker normally lose more of the chips and you stand a better chance to win!More seasoned Singaporean gamblers usually go to Monte Carlo where the chances of winning is higher because some of the ASM are sluggish and some even jammed!In First World, to win any money in a card game is almost zero unless you run immediately when you see that your credit is in the positive territory!The bankers are trained to have some business sense, they must let a few gamblers win some so that they will go back and spread the news that they win and bring back more customers. The black monitoring cameras on top of your head have many usages. When you pay your money to exchange for chips, they will spread your money on the table to show the manipulators in the control room how many big kaki are on the game.Those number games have sensitive sensors below the chips you placed and many still never realise why in most occasions, those numbers  without any chips on it usually appear and this phenomena usually happen at night! Most gamblers who won usually  happen in the afternoon and morning happy hours and they know that you usually come back after a good sumptuous dinner!<br><br>Changing of bankers when they continue to lose is just a trick to hookwink and rid your suspicions. Another trick is to change to a new set of cards and it is just another trick to show you that they are fair and open in their game!I have seen how a compulsive gamblers lost thousands in just minutes and I have observed how the tricks unravelled!<br><br>As for those thousands of money consumming machines, the chances of winning are slightly better! There are some seasoned berry pickers going round every machine to harvest some pocket money but the winning usually small unless you hit jackpot! It is time consumming and usually old retirees are there to kill their boredom and most never win!<br><br>Many visitors who book into the hotel room which are meant for their dependents and ironically many Chinese Singaporeans did not even book into any hotel room. Most of them just gather a few kaki and drive up there and they head straight into the casino. As the casinos operate 24 hours a day and the journey from Singapore is just 4-5 hours away!Any Tom Dick and Harry can walk into any casino at any hour of the day. I wonder how Singapore casino is going to survive when they charge $100 entry fee as the RM 230 are almost able to cover the petrol and the road toll. Many Singaoreans also take up free and easy package to Genting and they also never book into any hotel room as they head straight into the den and start their business after a meal or wash up in the toilet.<br><br>Food and retail outlets are controlled items in the resort and most are targeting for gamblers who won! So you know how much it costs to have a meal!Theme park rides are reasonably priced,whether it is indoor or outdoor. Some are so run down that your life may be at risk riding on it!<br><br>Singaporean housewives are pathetic to the last degree! Just stumble on a kid whose father is in hospital in Singapore for an operation and the wife brought  their only child to Genting, the mother is in the casino the whole day and the child is roaming in the theme park on his own taking all the different rides with his annual membership card with unlimited rides!Old folks with Tongkat and wheel chair are common sight in that resort!<br><br>The cigarette smoke in the gambling dens is killing! for every hour you spend in the casino, your life span may be shortened considerably! They never ban smoking in the casino, that tension inside the dens has produced tremendous hazard to your health! So you want to win?You may end up with a hole in your pocket, now or in the near future paying for your medical bill!<br><br></div>
