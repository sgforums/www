That was what I had been led to believe some years ago. But now another study says the later you retire the shorter your life.<br><br>Statistics, including Boeing AerospaceÂ’s, support the second conclusion, i.e. people who are still slogging away at the daily grind after 65 usually die within 18 months of retirement. Those, like I, who retire at 55 or earlier, tend to survive into their 80s (see summary of study below).<br><br>The study of BoeingÂ’s retirees show that an employee loses on average two years of his life span for every year he remains at work beyond 55!<br><br>A report on Optimum Strategies for Creativity and Longevity by Sing Lin, PhD, also quotes Nobel Laureate Dr. Leo Esaki that the most precious, creative and innovative period in a personÂ’s life is during his/her late 20s and early 30s: most Nobel Prize winners did the work that won them their prize at around 32 though it was usually awarded only 10 or 20 years later.<br><br>Read the rest of this entry Â» <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2007/07/07/374/#more-374" rel="nofollow">http://theonlinecitizen.com/2007/07/07/374/#more-374</a><br><br></div>

Not your age.<br>There are people who retire at 45.<br>Therefore retirement age in Singapore is just pyrrhic.</div>
