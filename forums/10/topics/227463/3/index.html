Did 1964Â’s racial riot not exist? In total, the violence killed 36 people and injured another 556. About 3,000 people were arrested. In response to 1964, Singapore implemented policies that made racial discrimination and riots punishable by law including enforcing the ISA.<br><br>Though Singapore now is at peace, we must know that underneath this seemingly calm surface, there are under-currents too. We must not deny this, but instead act on it to prevent a repeat of the 1964Â’s incident.<br><br>I hope this answer your senseless question of whether a change in government policy will immediately change the mindset of the people who strongly believe in and supported that policy. Of course nothing is immediate! People takes time to change, but a change is better than no change at all my dear friend!<br><br>Perhaps under you, GazelleÂ’s governance, nothing would have been done and you will still pretend that the world is a beautiful and lovely place while your citizens are suffering away.<br><br>Please stop your senseless questioning.
