This paper reports on research into the extent and distribution of intolerant attitudes in Australia, as well as data on the reported experience of racism. A telephone survey of residents throughout the states of Queensland and NSW generated a completed sample of 5056. The constructs of racism that were tested included: tolerance of cultural difference, perceptions on the extent of racism, tolerance of specific groups, ideology of nation, perceptions of Anglo-Celt cultural privilege, and racialism, including separatism and hierarchy. Findings suggest a substantive degree of racism in Australia. Anti-Muslim sentiment is very strong. There is a persistence of intolerance against Asian-, Indigenous and Jewish Australians. Most Australians recognise the problem of racism, yet less than half recognise the cultural privileges that racism accords. <span style="color: red;">Racist attitudes are positively associated with age, non-tertiary education, and to a slightly lesser extent with those who do not speak a language other than English, the Australia-born, and with males.</span> About 15 percent of Australians have experienced racism within institutional settings like the workplace and in education. About one-quarter of Australians report the experience of Â‘everyday racismsÂ’. Reporting experiences of racism was higher among indigenous Australians, those speaking a language other than English, those born overseas (excluding UK and NZ), and males. While racism is quite prevalent in Australian society its manifestation is everywhere different. Locally sensitive anti-racism initiatives are required to engage the racisms within Australian society.<br><br>DUNN, Kevin </div></blockquote>Stop dredging out new points when you have yet to defend your old ones. Anyway what are you trying to say by quoting from others? Can you give us a summary and the exact point about what you are saying to tell us?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you cannot summarise, I can summarise what this topic is actually about.<br><br>After experiencing rejection from Australia, you hope to soothe your already inflated ego by telling yourself that you are one lucky guy not to be an Australian PR as you will not be able to be a first-class citizen that you are in Singapore.<br><br>So, on you go on the warpath trying to tell everyone that FYMK has made a horrendous decision. First you ask us to give you opinions.<br><br><blockquote><br>What is your view on racism in Australia?<br><br>High, Medium, Low?</blockquote>When FYMK (now residing in Australia) joined in the discussion, you commented:<br><br><blockquote><br>fymk, I would rather that you dont participate in this thread because we knows that you are not capable to having a discussion on the "dark side" of australia</blockquote>Based on your above statement, you naturally assumed that FYMK will come to the defense of Australia thus is unable to give a neutral point of view. Hence you seek the opinions of fellow Singaporeans. Your agenda from hence on was to expose the "dark side'' of Australia. You will thus ignore everything else that is happening in the world. Only Australia.<br><br>However once you starting losing grip of things, you remarked:<br><br><blockquote>Bangkokboy, you dont live in Australia, you are not an australian and obviously not an Aussie. I am not expecting alot from you. </blockquote>Obviously we are saying things that you do not like to hear. What do you want Gazelle? Please tell us as we are all at a lost. Since you don't want feedback from someone residing in Australia, you don't want it from a Singaporean, I am now wondering whose opinion do you seek?<br></div>
