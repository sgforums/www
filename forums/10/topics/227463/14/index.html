Nobody has these numbers.<br><br><blockquote>Excerpts:<br>On July 13, 1998, the Volunteer Team for Humanity, led by a well-known priest, Father Sandyawan, published a report on sexual violence against ethnic Chinese women. The report listed a total of 168 cases, of which rapes, as opposed to other forms of sexual abuse, reported from Jakarta between May 13 and 15 alone totaled 130 cases. At the time the report was issued, accounts were coming in from many different sources, often by telephone, with several NGOs compiling their own data and providing it to the Volunteer Team for Humanity. There was so much horror over initial reports and concern about protecting the victims that the documentation process was somewhat chaotic, with key details missing or the source not clarified or follow-up questioning lacking as to how precisely the person providing the information had come by her or his facts. In some cases, it was clear a rape had occurred but not clear that it was connected to the May riots; in others, it was clear that a passerby had seen a woman crying uncontrollably but not at all clear that the woman in question had been raped.<br><br>As those working with the team began to realize the extent of the confusion, they began a process of checking and cross-checking, and, as of late August, were beginning to produce credible, verifiable cases. The number of verifiable cases from mid-May was expected to drop below the 130 originally reported, perhaps even substantially below, but questions will always remain as to how many cases went unreported, how many victims fled abroad, and how much a campaign of intimidation and harassment discouraged women from speaking out. It is instructive that women who were raped during military operations in 1990-91 in the province of Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra, are only now, more than seven years later, beginning to come forward. The statements of Indonesian officials that local groups had faked their reports may only have heightened the unwillingness of witnesses to testify.<br></blockquote>The heightened racial (and religious) tension in the Sulawesi region as a result of Government's inter-region effort to repopulate it's citizens has seen numerous deaths that are not classified as murders.</div>
