From what I was told, racism problem in Australia is one of the highest among developed countries. Is that true?<br><br>And how do you deal with the situation when someone insulted you in the public. Do you just look away and pretend you dont hear him or do you defend yourself by getting into some kind of fight or some agressive verbal exchange?<br><br></div></blockquote>It is very true. Many Aussies are extremely racist.<br>They even discriminate against fellow ang mos who are recent immigrants from Europe.</div>

Immigrants would be encouraged to retain their distinct cultural identities on condition that they subscribed to the tenets of Westminster democracy," wrote Brett Mason.<br><br>"But since September 11, multiculturalism has been taking a beating at home and abroad," he said, pointing to what he called the emergence of Islamic extremism in Britain and Australia.<br><br>The spotlight has also fallen on the eastern country town of Tamworth, where the town council has been accused of racism for refusing to accept five Sudanese refugee families.<br><br>Tamworth mayor James Treloar said the Africans were rejected because cultural differences could lead to another "Cronulla riot".<br><br>Under pressure to reverse the decision, the council was due to vote again on the issue later on Tuesday.<br><br>In another black-white confrontation, this time involving the country's original inhabitants, anti-police riots erupted in two Aboriginal communities in Queensland state last week.<br><br>In an opinion page article headed "Riot sets racial time bomb ticking", the Daily Telegraph linked the violence to the refusal to prosecute a police officer blamed for the death of an Aboriginal prisoner.<br><br>After the Cronulla riots, Howard played down charges that racism was rife in Australia, calling it one of the most successful cultural melting pots in the world.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">However, an AC Nielsen poll at the time found that 75 percent of respondents agreed with the statement: "There is an underlying racism in Australia."</span></strong> - AFP/so<br><br></div>
