While Serbs originated from central europe, the origin of the Croates was unclear and there is a theory that says they are of Iranian origin. We should not forget the war in Kosovos and Bosnia where both races went all out to eliminate the other. What happened in Australia shows that hatred remains between the two races.<br><br>There is no question that that was racism.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
