            <div class='col-md body'>In regards to the racial riots that happened in 1964, didnÂ’t our Government introduce and implement policies that made racial discrimination and riots punishable by law including the enforcement of the ISA? Let me recap, in total, the violence killed 36 people and injured another 556. About 3,000 people were arrested. For a small country these numbers are considerable. Did our government policies help? If yes, why canÂ’t you accept that the Australian Government is also trying to do something? If not, wouldnÂ’t it be telling forum readers that you agree the policies are not helping and that Singapore is now not enjoying racial tolerance?<br><br>I know the topic is on Australia, but I remember at some point you asked me regarding the LEVEL OF RACISM in Australia. If I do not bring some other countries into comparison, how do I know for sure?<br><br>Regarding the White Australia Policy, I am sure anyone doing a quick search will know that it effectively ended in 1978 (with the last selective policy removed in 1982). While we must accept that there was such a policy, we also must point out to forum readers that it has since been removed.<br><br>I urge all forum readers to see for yourself hidden agendas of the TS... if there is no hidden agenda, Gazelle, accept the fact that racism is a global issue and let's carry on the discussion from there.<br></div>

Generally, upgrading of HDB does not concern me per se. An interesting note I like to point out about this whole HDB upgrading exercise. HDB leasees do not have strata titles to their flats unlike private 99/freehold condo owners; hence HDB is still the landlord for 99 years of their lease. Shouldn't HDB as landlord be 100\% responsible for upgrading cost of common areas, including lifts for every floor? Shouldn't HDB be responsible for replacing for free all aluminium riverts installed on HDB flat windows, afterall HDB had designed them not with steel reverts in the first place? Why must HDB leasees who paid monthly conservancy fees made to replace them at their own cost under threat of punishment with amended HDB Act? </blockquote>Reference:<br><a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/mod_perl/signed.cgi?merlion1&amp;101" rel="nofollow">http://www.petitiononline.com/mod_perl/signed.cgi?merlion1&amp;101</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe we have racist idiots everywhere in the world.<br><br>I think in Australia it depends on the state you are in though I did face my share of racism in Australia before, both from Asians and from the whites (isolated incidents... actually I can count it as 2 incidents), but at the same time, I know many Australians; Australian born whites and other races who are not outwardly racist.<br><br>The other issue here is what we perceive as racist. You feel it more in Australia (or any other country) because you are not the majority race. We, as Chinese don't feel that Singapore is as racist because what the heck, we are the majority! But with the declining birth rates and influx of FT, I'm not so sure about that in the future  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway is Australia a racist country? I think yes to a certain extent for people who are insecure about their jobs and viewing FTs as a threat. Of course, there are also those with the KKK mentality.<br><br>I have to say I was racist in Australia too. I really detest the Middle Eastern Folks who make an ass of themselves in public and then pull out the race card when the police have to be involved  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Abstract from http://www.anu.edu.au/NEC/dunn_paper.pdf<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">There is a general dearth of concrete evidence as to the extent of racism in<br>Australia. This paper reports on research into the extent and distribution of intolerant attitudes in Australia, as well as data on the reported experience of racism. A telephone survey of residents throughout the states of Queensland and NSW generated a completed sample of 5056. The constructs of racism that were tested included: tolerance of cultural difference, perceptions on the extent of racism, tolerance of specific groups, ideology of nation, perceptions of Anglo-Celt cultural privilege, and racialism, including separatism and hierarchy. Findings suggest a substantive degree of racism in Australia. Anti-Muslim sentiment is very strong. There is a persistence of intolerance against Asian-, Indigenous and Jewish Australians. Most Australians recognise the problem of racism, yet less than half recognise the cultural privileges that racism accords. Racist attitudes are positively associated with age, non-tertiary education, and to a slightly lesser extent with those who do not speak a language other than English, the Australia-born, and with males. About 15 percent of Australians have experienced racism within institutional settings like the workplace and in education. About one-quarter of Australians report the experience of Â‘everyday racismsÂ’. Reporting experiences of racism was higher among indigenous Australians, those speaking a language other than English, those born overseas (excluding UK and NZ), and males. While racism is quite prevalent in Australian society its manifestation is everywhere different. Locally sensitive anti-racism initiatives are required to engage the racisms within Australian society.<br><br>DUNN, Kevin </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes it's not just racism per se, it's the lack of appreciation the cultural diversity of the world; traditional beliefs &amp; practices peculiar to each different races and/or territorial geographical locations hence perhaps due to the 'instant gratification' of 'individualism' mentality there is the 'impatience' to even try to accomodate 'alien discourse' let alone acknowledgement of another's right of presence let alone existence.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
