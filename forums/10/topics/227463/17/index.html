What is worth noting is that they were killing each other during the war of kosovos. I hope when they migrate to a new home, they leave behind the hatred and learn to accept each other. If not, they bring racism into their new land.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>The Hindi and Singh are supposed to be of the same origin, but during the war to protect the Golden Temple in India, there were reports that there were clashes among the Hindi in Singapore and the Singh. If either the Hindi or the Singh believes they are superior than the other and has the right to tell the other what to do, that is racism. Fortunately, this matter did not develop further, my bar yi friends leave the indian alone but very proud to wear turban, especially in front of the Indian.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Take for example nursing in Singapore- 6 day week - 1.5k per month now? In Australia - 5 day week plus 1 day off each month - at least 4.5 k gross net  per month with shift penalties and weekend as well as public holiday penalties . Approx 3.5k per month after taxes. If Christmas season - expect 4-5k after tax . All in all I can tell you that I earnt 2 to 3 times that of Singapore's pay when I did nursing and when I did higher duties - I earnt 4 times the amount of what nursing in Singapore paid me . Go ask Rhonda if you do not believe me.<br><br>Let's even talk about nursing ratios. Victoria has strictly enforced a 4:1 rule on day time nursing - meaning 4 patients to one nurse as well as 8:1 rule which is for night shifts only. When one is sick , bank nurses get called in.  Singapore has 12-18 patients to one nurse with an assistant nurse who can't do much except take temperature and blood pressure and clean up patient. When one nurse is sick ( and this is from my experience in Singapore) , the other nurses have to split her patients up amongst themselves. I actually had to nurse 24 patients with only 2 assistant nurses once in Singapore.<br><br>Oh ya , want to go further into Intensive care? Australian ICU 1:1 depending on acuity - 2:1 if the two patients are going into step down. Singapore ICU 2:1 to 3:1 regardless of severity .That is what my friends who worked in ICU told me .  One of them is working in Australia now.<br><br><strong> So tell me which is better?  Truthfully if you dare , minus the insults. </strong><br><br>Suddenly you don't have an issue. Well , you do not live here so you do not have a good idea of what may be the actual reason of those tensions.<br><br>Even I steer clear when an indigenous australian starts talking about the lost generation and past injustices. I just nod and listen but never add anything to it. I sympathise with them but  I don't want to take any sides because I do not have a very indepth clear understanding of them vs the whites.</div>

He said that most aussies condemned the perpetrators, but did not feel that it was woth that much attention that it should dominate national news for a couple of weeks. the aussie press deemed the act unworthy of attention and did not want to encourage such future acts by focusing on it. but ST pretty much sensationalise it showing pictures of the shop vandalised, interviews with pple who regretted migrating to aussie etc etc ad nauseum.<br><br>his view as an australian gave some context to the entire episode. without it, it is easy to believe that australia hates chinese and if u migrate there, u sure die lah. (if u believe ST during that episode).<br><br>personally, in all my visits there, i met some racist teens who only dare to screem vugarities from their car. 95% of the aussies i met were really polite and kind. there, u could just sit down and talk to almost anyone, from storekeepers to old people. cafe and restaurant owners (angmoh) will chat with u over coffee or dinner. people arent rushed, so u could just say a few words and usually strangers would recipocrate. pple also help u around if u seem a little lost, often coming to u instead of having to go to them.<br><br>overall, a nice place with nice pple.<br><br></div>
