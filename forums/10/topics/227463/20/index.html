You may have well and truly lost your position in this debate but there's no need to make your opponent's positions stronger... really, can't you see how your latest attempt to steer things back to your liking only backfires spectacularly?<br><br>I regret to inform you that the mentioned topic reached its conclusion some pages ago. Unfortunately the consensus reached was not really in your liking, as one can tell from you increasingly erratic and childish behaviour. If you haven't realized, revisiting you same old flawed positions with more heat and vulgarities won't even buldge the inexorable and utter weight of your rather hopeless position here. As I said, we are not angry with you... we really pity you.<br><br>You really got to get more creative with your insults, I would suggest that perhaps you could draw from the more solid realm of taking your mockery from your targetÂ’s behaviour instead of relying on trying to create your rebuttals from your targetÂ’s online nicknameÂ… for that is really childÂ’s play and not to mention completely ineffective on anyone.<br><br>I understand the need for you to pacify your own urges to release the pent up fustration from your inability to influence anybody with your points... but truly, doing this isn't helping your cause.<br><br>Also if you havenÂ’t noticed, the current topic is really now focused rather squarely on your childishness and inability to see even the slightest shred of reason, as well as the hilarity that results from speculating on what is truly behind such an astounding lack of judgement on your part.<br><br><blockquote>I believe Gaz owned himself @ Formula 1 with his arguments about McLaren headed for serious trouble this season.  </blockquote>If only he realized that we don't really care if he listens to, or is even affected by what we say to him... but that our main idea is to draw him out and make him show to others just what the laughable creature that he is.<br><br>And I must say, it is working rather well so far. What's with him anyway? Haven't he realized that throwing a tantrum and shouting one-liner insults actually hurts him more then it hurts us... if it even hurts us at all.</div>
