            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by zenden9:<br><strong><br><br>LOL.. My explanation abt hiring chinese speaking worker is more of business sense. I don't know how u all manage to mingle with racism and unfair. In a business world,making money is most important facotr. I can understand why so some companies insist on [b] Chinese employee </strong>.. If language becomes a barrier business will be affected. Abt yr so call not believe of high percentage of non-english speaking Singaporean. I can easily dig out many of the non-english speaking singaporean from singapore street of mostly above the age of 50. Yr ignorance is appalling..<br><br>I work in a major factory in sg and I can tell u most of the aunties and uncle  work in there cannot speak english. I believe this is also the trend in many other factories in sg. Getting a Chinese speaking staff is more of a business wise decision rather than y so call discrimination as most of the population here is Chinese. Of cos,I don expect a big semi-conductor company to demand a Chinese speaking staff. But I am trying to explain that some of this demand on Chinese speaking staff is more on the business itself. A business more associate more with Chinese cultural. Example, A bak Kwa company, A Chinese medicine factory. Chinese food industries company selling shark fin and abalone.<br><br>U expect no Chinese speaker involved?<br><br>Btw,Sg making english the business medium doesn't mean private company need to strictly follow. In Malaysia, Bahasa Malaysia is the official language but most MNC use english as the official medium. Only the Malaysia gov sector uses Bahasa Malaysia as the medium language...<br>[/b]</blockquote>My ignorance is appalling?  Don't be mistaken: Mandarin is an up and coming language because of China's economy but that does not mean you streamline to Chinese people only in terms of jobs in Singapore. Bilingualism has its advantages.<br><br>When I speak about the business medium - nobody is expecting them to speak perfect english at A level standard - just basic enough to get by in survival .<br><br>Factories in Singapore handle local contracts in English right? Don't tell me that the local contracts are all in Mandarin.  Most of the upper management speaks English - yes or no?<br><br>Take for example: I worked as a student for one chinese computer resaler - he wanted chinese  sales staff - however I notice he did business right with everybody ( he could speak malay to malay customers) . All staff were chinese but communication was in English all the time. Contracts and sales documents were all in English . Most customers were educated Singaporean chinese who can speak English since I did my sales in English all the time. So tell me why the heck did he want a chinese speaker?<br><br>In the japanese departmental stores like Takashimaya or the old sogo, they have a huge bulk of Japanese customers but I notice they don't have problems employing non-japanese speaking staff at all. Yes the top managers are Japanese but the middle and ground staff are mostly a mixture of Singaporeans from all ethnic groups.<br><br>Manufacturing businesses especially relating to chinese culture- I don't think most non-chinese will apply for those . So I don't think we have a problem of people screaming racism.<br><br>But when it comes down to businesses dealing with technology or service industry - is it fair to industries employing chinese under the advertisement of Mandarin speakers only ? My uncles and aunts don't speak mandarin from Post War education in public schools- they speak English, Malay or our dialect. They didn't have a problem holding down jobs in chinese companies despite the lack of mandarin skills. Of course, they managed to picked up shredded mandarin equivalent to one of my Malay's friend's mandarin and my standard Malay.<br><br>Let's not talk about old uncles and aunties in factories - during those post war days , they might have been unfortunate not to have an education but I don't believe they cannot speak <strong> a single shred of english </strong> or even Malay to get by - people will still speak abit of the <span style="font-style: italic;"> lingua franca </span> to survive even if they didn't have formal education in English .</div>

He should be going to Mandarin websites and typing out in mandarin <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> .<br><br>Second , he claims that there are people who are interested to know if Australia is indeed racist. <strong> Yet he won't let me have my say when I actually DO LIVE in Australia </strong><br><br>Thirdly , he claims that it is so racist there that he became racist by using racial slurs such as white a$$ .<br><br><strong> This just stinks of a person who somehow is jealous of others who can make it . He just wants to go on and on about how bad another country is , so that he feels more superior .  And all the time he is using cronulla pictures which I already explained is the failure of integration not racism in the bigger picture .</strong><br><br>Fourth , he likes to show off so much about how he can buy second hand audis and have a 12k holiday . What does that tell you?  <strong> He is just those type of people who have superiority and inferiority complex </strong> . He even shows off his claim that he has some percentage of ownership in Australia when there are others who hold 100% property ownership <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> .<br><br>So this type leh ......you bash his ego , he will just continue to get worse . He just want to show how great he is  mah by insulting you and I  just because he thinks we all are below him. Why so much drama about Australia and racism? <strong> Probably because he failed to get into Australia </strong> . So any country which rejects him must be racist lor.<br><br>Welcome to Gazelle's world except he is only an employee ...not  on the board of directors <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> .

If the country is truly racist - you won't have the police working with the community , the government trying to attract workers and that statement of Mr Parakh.<br><br>What do you want me to say really? Yes, Australia's crime rate is not as low as Singapore, that I am only too aware of.</div>

He just wants to go on and on about how bad another country is , so that he feels more superior .  And all the time he is using cronulla pictures which I already explained is the failure of integration not racism in the bigger picture .</strong><br><br>Fourth , he likes to show off so much about how he can buy second hand audis and have a 12k holiday . What does that tell you?  <strong> He is just those type of people who have superiority and inferiority complex </strong> .
