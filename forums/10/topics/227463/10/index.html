HAHAH Gazelle - slip of your tongue?<br><br>Don't put words in my mouth .<br><br>Those were examples of why you won't want to go into crime infested areas . Another example : Cabramatta in Sydney, huge asian population , High crime rate. Crimes there are perpetuated by asian gangs against other law abiding citizens. And no I am not saying all vietnamese are criminals either.  Blacktown - high crime rate - a house gets broken in at least once per week or so.<br><br>Those are the most notorious places in Sydney . My point being you won't want to venture into places where there is a high crime rate in relation to your news articles.<br><br></div>

I just said long have I learnt about research that comes from <strong> people sitting behind desks - you know the type that comes from the ivory tower </strong>.<br><br>I don't have an issue with researchers who are still involved with the day to day practice and trying to improve things because they are the end users .<br><br>I am actually discrediting Gazelle for taking and pasting a piece of research which admits that it has its own weaknesses. It underrepresented some groups . Anyways , if you read the ANU paper - it is merely a telephone survey of 5056 people compared to over 20 million people in Australia. It has no strong conclusion. It is just a description of what those 5056 people think . No clear conclusions to state how they think the group surveyed are enough to provide a mildly skewed view. It is purely theorectical - no statistical methods on estimating racism at all - it is just purely descriptive summary statistics of  opinions of people whom they surveyed( which is the most basic of all methods )  and it some how does not really link up to their study aims.<br><br>Mind you . Don't take it just as it is because a research says it is good or because the researcher or university has some reputation. I have read a sh!t paper coming out from some Harvard researchers before - one was about immunisation I think . Albeit there are alot of good papers but there are also sh!t papers who count on what you call a brandname of the school or researcher.<br><br>There have been some education systems which institutionalised some to think just because someone with an authority says it is good , it is good. No argument allowed but that breeds stagnancy.<br><br>Going overseas , those who cut and paste failed miserably but those who dared to argued against set theories strongly got flying colors. Dr Barry Marshall was laughed at when he tried telling the medical society about a bacteria causing stomach ulcers - the set belief was that stomach acid will kill everything. He dared to prove it by drinking the whole bacterial culture and now he is a Nobel prize physiology/medicine winner. Helicobacter pylori was the name of that bacteria. Galileo dared to call the world round and he got imprisioned by the Vatican. Now we all know earth is round.<br><br>You can cut and paste out from the textbook but think of it this way- if there is no critical analysis , there is no thought to the argument posed.<br><br></div>
