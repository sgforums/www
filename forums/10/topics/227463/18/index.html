The onus will be on employers to show that lacking a particular language skill in that job will adversely affect the company. A tribunal should be set up to look into complaints and penalties must be harsh enough to deter racism in the workplace.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I had been in perth for 3 years now. I don't see any serious racism here. Occasionally, you will get a few drunken teens shouting some racist remarks, and I believe most of these teens would not do it when they are sober. When white girls hitched a hike, you give them a lift, they would still give u a hug and kiss u at the end of it.<br><br>Trust me on this, the educated ones and those in senior positions(especially the whites) of most companys are all trying their best to make this country free of racism. And that is what all of us should try to do in our own countries. I spoken to most of my aussie friends, and they reveal that they only dislike troublemakers, and most troublemaker comes from a certain enthic group. But overall, given more time I believe, countries whom put in effort into solving racism will gain from it and prosper.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So after 18 pages of talk, have we actually wondered:<br><br>What good does all this talk do? What difference does it make and what are you proving by proving that Australia is, or is not a racist country?<br><br>Are you implying that it's best for Singaporeans to avoid going there? I don't see how given while one might come across a git or two which obviously haven't seen any other culture beyond their own neighbourhood and expect the entire world to be white... by and by there isn't exactly a state of fear going around for the minorities.<br><br>This is not to mention Australia is a huge country... in some areas you get more racism and in others you are pretty much accepted. Is it realistic to tar the entire nation with one brush? Just because main abuse is a problem here does it mean that the entire nation is snobbish high-class racist and looking down on Indonesians and Fillipinos?<br><br>Have we tried asking any foreign workers (not the "FT" class) from other nations if they feel disrespected or looked down upon by some of our number?<br><br>What's with Australia bashing anyway? Singapore and Australia are really better of working with each other if anything, despite their differences they can really trust each other the most to do something in this region. Do you think Indonesia or Malaysia is more reliable when the stuff hits the fan? Thailand?</div>

I don't see any serious racism here. Occasionally, you will get a few drunken teens shouting some racist remarks, and I believe most of these teens would not do it when they are sober. When white girls hitched a hike, you give them a lift, they would still give u a hug and kiss u at the end of it.<br><br>Trust me on this, the educated ones and those in senior positions(especially the whites) of most companys are all trying their best to make this country free of racism. And that is what all of us should try to do in our own countries. I spoken to most of my aussie friends, and they reveal that they only dislike troublemakers, and most troublemaker comes from a certain enthic group. But overall, given more time I believe, countries whom put in effort into solving racism will gain from it and prosper. </div></blockquote>Where are you from? North or south of the River?</div>

The aussies are very direct and verbally open - if they are wrong, don't be afraid to tell them that they are wrong. That is how I dealt with people in Australia and I never had much problems.</div>
