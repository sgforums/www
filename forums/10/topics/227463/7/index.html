What she was doing was simply pointing out <strong>LOOPHOLES</strong> in your <strong>senseless cut and paste jobs</strong>. She did not say that Australians are teaching us how to run our country. You are the one saying all this things.<br><br>Second, if you do not wish to see people discussing about Australia governance, perhaps <strong>YOU</strong> should not have posted this topic at all. By doing so, <strong>EVERYONE</strong> has the right to post his or her views.<br><br>You are downright <strong>DUMB</strong>. I will say it once and I will say it again. Your behavior is downright childish and warrants severe condemnation from us. Your postings are pure inflamatory and does not serve to inform. It is loopsided and biased.<br><br>BTW, you tried searching for "Racism in the Zoo."? Perhaps you should try that instead of using "Australia + Racism" in your search requirements. Australia has it's faults, everyone can see that. But it's happening all over the world, any human being can see that except you...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">I am not sure why you kept saying that I am jealous of your "success" in Australia, because<br><br>1) The reason you got a Australia PR is because you explore the loop hole that Australia is desperately in need of nurse, (Similar to Singapore but we have filipino instead, and they cheaper too). Plus i am sure you are aware that there are plenty of Singaporean nurses who have migrated to australia<br><br>2) You have always wanted to be doctor, have you become one yet?<br><br>3) You have to take up a law degree, something which you have no interest, as a back up plan. do you consider that as success?<br><br>Australia is a beautiful country, but that is just not everybody's cup of tea, because most non-white people just dont enjoy living in a country where white aussie rule.<br><br>I would really appreacite if you could stop glorifying australian gov policy and system, because we are Singaporeans, we are Asian and we dont need some white country to tell us how to run our country, because most of the time they really screw us up.<br><br>Maybe you should consider spending more time in Australian forum talking about Aussie rule, instead of coming to Sgforums to whin about Singapore<br><br></div></blockquote>In what way did I say Australian policies should run in Singapore? There is always room for improvement on both sides. And I have the bigger right to talk about Australia than <strong> someone who has no permanent residency in Australia </strong>. I also have a right to criticise Singapore (*waves the singaporean passport*) in hope that other people will see that improvements have to be made in Singapore for it to become a place for Singaporeans.<br><br>Point 2 and 3 are irrelevant to the topic. Want to attack my personal decisions  in life as well ?  I already have my backups in place which is easy to secure in Australia. I only enjoy studying for the sake of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> gaining knowledge </span>, be it law or medicine, NOT for the sake of securing a job. If it gives me an additional topping on my salary - I don't mind. If it doesn't , I also don't mind.<br><br>Exploit a loophole? I have a skill they want <strong> but sorry that they don't want your talents</strong> . Ever heard of mutual benefits? Australia has a benefit and I have a benefit.<br><br>Do I really care if Singaporean nurses are migrating over? Not really. I am happy for them if they should choose Australia because I think it is a great place to do nursing in . If they are happy, I am happy for them.<br><br>You are clearly jealous when you started a thread attacking Australia. Like I say , too bad <strong> your skills are not good enough so you need not attack Australia </strong>. <strong> SO if you cannot get into Australia , don't attack Australia for your inadequacies . That is the behaviour of a sour grape sore loser </strong><br><br><strong> Prove </strong> your statement that most non-australian asians don't like Australia. Mind you there are Australian born asians who love Australia and there are alot of people who want to come in - I heard that in Singapore, migration agents are popping up everywhere.</div>

No one is denying that! Anyway to point out to forumers, the article was written based on an event in 2001. Singapore has bloggers lashing out at fellow Singaporeans as recent as last year, 3 incidents if I am not wrong. Different representation, but still acts of racism.<br><br>However if you follow the thread carefully, he made several uncalled for personal attacks on FYMK. The TS also refuse to consider racism in other countries. He invited us to share our opinions on the level of racism in Australia, doesn't that require comparisans?<br><br>His views are severely loopsided. The USA can actually be accused of more severe examples of racism. Developed countries like Japan also have their fair share of racism, not to mention Singapore and Australia.</div>

But of course Gazelle has his own brand of racism against whites ...it seems to me that his view are lopsided and influenced by his own agenda because more than likely <strong> he failed to get into Australia </strong>. I have met people who behave that way when they fail to get residency . I call it <strong> consolation syndrome </strong>.<br><br>It's just as shameful as the filipino Vivian Solon who similarly had mental illness but I don't think it is racism . She could not produce her passport neither could she coherently communicate who she was. Cornelia Rau also had that problem due to her mental condition. Gazelle , please note that Miss Rau is <strong> white </strong> by your standards and of germanic descent.  Their mental health system is abit c0ckup at times.<br><br>The Filipino embassy just issued the deportation papers for Ms Solon assuming that she was a citizen of the Philipines. it is a cockup on both sides. Probably both mistakes are probably communication problems and because the mental health system is screwy in Australia. They are trying to fix the mental health system right now. Poor sods, abit late for that.<br><br>Oh ya another thing, Australia has also deported one american WHITE woman because she breached her visa, cancelled a Serbian guy's permanent residency and sent a habitual swede criminal back to Sweden. Deportation happens both ways . Just because a person is non white and deported - doesn't mean that it is racism. Look at the system first before commenting. It's not perfect but it isn't racist either.<br><br>That is probably why my white irish friend who holds dual citizenship as an australian keeps getting yelled at by the australian immigration when she gives them the irish passport instead of the Australian passport.<br><br></div>
