This topic is not about any of my physical assets and besides you know nothing about me . If you cannot out-argue me , don't resort to such a low animalistic and uncivilised hit.  At LEAST if that below remark was made physically in Australia, I can basically take you to court for sexual harassment . In Singapore, you can also be charged for outrage of modesty for that comment.</blockquote>I presume if a white man make comments of your chest it will be seen as sexy and normal, and if a chinaman do the same it will be uncivilised. Are you trying to proof that I am right that some Asians do like to wipe whiteman's arse?<br><br>And if you dont like people looking at your ti.ts, then why wear bikinis? If you only want a white man to appreciate your "asset" maybe you should consider wearing a white man only bikinis?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by fymk:<br><br>You are just attacking a country which REJECTED you to soothe your overinflated ego just because they didn't deem you skilled or rich enough.<br><br>Come on. If you cannot make it in , don't go and hammer those who managed to open the doors to better opportunities and lifestyle. It's your problem of jealousy that overseas some of us are actually doing quite well living in Australia .  </blockquote>All I can say is that the reason you kept insisting that I am so attracted to australia is because you want to glorified your backdoor entry to become an  Australia PR and you want to reassure yourself that your have made the right decision to leave singapore because you are like a typical Singaporeans who weigh the 5Cs above interest and passion.<br><br>Come on, if you cannot make it in Singapore, just admit it lah, why keep coming to Sgforums to glorify Australia and condemmning Singapore. If you like Australia so much, why stop at being a PR, why not give up your Singapore citizenship and become an australian or a "aussie"?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would advise all to stop replying to this thread. It is indeed very apparent that Gazelle has some personal issues with FYMK and Australia. After reading his posts and replies, it reminds me of some juveniles ranting.<br><br>As for Gazelle, please DO continue ranting and contributing to this very entertaining thread. It is indeed very enjoyable to see a grown man behave as such. You have indeed brighten up my day!
