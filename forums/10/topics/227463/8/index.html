Regarding the recency of the articles cited by the TS, most of them are very new. The one titled "Racist White Australia Deports Brown Australian Citizen" was written in May 2005, according to the website. So they may be representative of the current racial tensions exisitng in that country.<br>It is true that raciasm exists everywhere. But there is a difference in terms of degree and the extent of its occurence. Based on what I have learned, from friends who have travelled to Australia and some of the articles I have read on the topic, it may get pretty nasty in Australia. To have some one in a passing car throw egges at you, and shouting for you to go home is not exactly the best way to make your day. One may argue that unpleasant encouters of this nature are sporadic but they seem to happen fairly frequently in that country such that you may come to the conclusion that it is statistically more likely for an Asian to be subject to racism in Australia than some other countries. I admit this might be a lopsided view. Someone living in Australia on a long term basis may be in a better position to comment on this.<br><br></div></blockquote>Well , what I can say about all cause of these racism issues is because of failure to integrate and going by multiculturalism. The europeans have this issue as well . They let minority communities go off on their merry way without considering the real consequences. Some minority communities , like the middle eastern or the certain asian groups , have problems with the linga franca of the county . Hence they are left out of jobs and marginalised. So they blame their situation on racism.<br><br>Now when Australia and the Europeans and the Americans implement a test to see if they can pass basic english to survive in the country. People yell out and call it racism. You cannot win either way . <strong> I am a firm supporter of Australia's decision to make the english test possible because you need a common language to communicate with the mainstream society and to work as well </strong>. My view is that failure to integrate with the general population leads to misunderstandings.<br><br>Of course , you have uneducated idiots sporadically yelling out racially explicit comments in rural communities - that is very rare now tho. That does not happen in the metropolitan cities because everyone knows there is a world out there where people are different in their ethnicity ,religion and beliefs.<br><br><strong> If Australia was truly racist per say, I doubt you have a Chinese Mayor of Melbourne in Victoria and Australian senators of asian descent from Queensland and South Australia , or even a state premier of lebanese descent in Victoria. Those are people whose parents or ancestors made an effort to integrate into the mainstream society. </strong><br><br>My qualification to speak? I lived in Sydney for a year , Melbourne for 4 years and Canberra for almost a year now. Long term enough?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Note: English is the business medium in Singapore. It is not about white supremacy , even in Australia, the whites learn mandarin to do business in China.<br><br>It just depends on where the person wants to go to do business. You speak the <span style="font-style: italic;"> linga franca </span> of that country. You work in China - you speak Mandarin. You work in Geneva, you speak french. You work in Malaysia - you speak malay . The list goes on. Business language mediums are just used to bridge communication between countries.<br><br>Singaporean textbooks are all in English save for Mother tongue - why? Don't forget our fellow eurasian, indian and malay counterparts . Just because Singapore has a chinese majority doesn't mean that the others should be ignored. Singapore needs a bridging language and english is the selected language which is not the mother tongue of most Singaporeans. Go complain to the Government if you are not happy over what you perceive as white supremacy.<br><br>So what language would you suggest to be the business medium of Singapore? You can't use Mandarin as it would seem biased to the other non chinese , you can't use tamil because India has too many languages and it is not commonly used. Your alternative is English or Malay because Singapore's linga franca used to be Malay . I can speak malay enough to survive so it won't be a problem for me.<br><br><strong> Are you just jealous that Australia is doing well because it has a white majority population and yet a bulk of minority like me or rhonda even are doing fairly well? Or are you choosing to hammer Australia because you can't get in? </strong><br><br>If that is so , you are being discriminatory yourself. So don't talk so much from the armchair , you have no right to judge a country when you NEVER stayed in Australia for the <strong> long term </strong> to justify your claims.<br><br>Mr Tan, you seem to have a discriminatory problem against caucasians yourself. White supremacy , white this and white that and not to mention specially your term "white a$$ " seems to come up in your posts here . Those indicate a form of superiority inferiority complex.<br></div>

I don't seem to recall Singapore being a mini-China to use so much mandarin in doing business.<br><br>Singapore have singaporean malays, singaporean indians and singaporean eurasians. Is it fair to them when the national standard operating language agreed upon for business is English and you stem them out of the fair job competition this way?<br><br>Not to mention Singapore has 4 official languages . Why official? To ensure equality for all. Why a business medium ? To bridge the 4 major ethnic groups together.<br><br>Australia has only 1 official language - English . And it is bonded to the history . Majority of the population speaks english but they still speak their mother tongue. In their high school programs alone, you have mandarin, japanese, french, german, russian, italian etc   to choose from . It is also a land of migrants . Even the <strong> german/italian/polish/dutch </strong> migrants learnt english to survive in Australia - and you call that WhITE SUPREMANCY? HAHAH They are whites too but most of the old migrants didn't speak english until they landed on Australian soil. <strong>  If there was truly white supremacy - I think there won't even be an offer of mandarin, japanese, vietnamese, indonesian languages to be taught in high school. </strong><br><br></div>

My explanation abt hiring chinese speaking worker is more of business sense. I don't know how u all manage to mingle with racism and unfair. In a business world,making money is most important facotr. I can understand why so some companies insist on Chinese employee.. If language becomes a barrier business will be affected. Abt yr so call not believe of high percentage of non-english speaking Singaporean. I can easily dig out many of the non-english speaking singaporean from singapore street of mostly above the age of 50. Yr ignorance is appalling..<br><br>I work in a major factory in sg and I can tell u most of the aunties and uncle  work in there cannot speak english. I believe this is also the trend in many other factories in sg. Getting a Chinese speaking staff is more of a business wise decision rather than y so call discrimination as most of the population here is Chinese. Of cos,I don expect a big semi-conductor company to demand a Chinese speaking staff. But I am trying to explain that some of this demand on Chinese speaking staff is more on the business itself. A business more associate more with Chinese cultural. Example, A bak Kwa company, A Chinese medicine factory. Chinese food industries company selling shark fin and abalone.<br><br>U expect no Chinese speaker involved?<br><br>Btw,Sg making english the business medium doesn't mean private company need to strictly follow. In Malaysia, Bahasa Malaysia is the official language but most MNC use english as the official medium. Only the Malaysia gov sector uses Bahasa Malaysia as the medium language...<br></div>
