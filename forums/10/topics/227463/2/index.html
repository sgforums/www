Where I would derive my reply from is probably some newspaper reports. But by doing that I would be making an assumption wouldn't I? Based on past personal experiences, I would say it is low. They have on the other hand proven their hospitality beyond what is experienced in Singapore or even Thailand, the Land of Smiles.<br><br>You don't see any Singaporeans shouting and calling the Banglas name but neither did I witness any Australians hitting out at Asians during my visit there. Our local news reporters are not interested in beaming such news ''live'' from Tan Ah Kow Street. Just because it is not reported in the news doesn't mean we can dismiss it on a whim. The sad truth is, it is happening whether you like it or not.<br><br>I suggest that we go out more, interact more and know more about the REAL world instead of the REEL world. My point is racism does exist in every country. Unless Singapore is in itself totally free of racism only then can we have the right to put Australia under the microscope.<br></div>

Melbourne has not much of an issue because of its huge asian population in the city , international students and it is pretty much a well integrated place . The italian (lygon , Carlton) , greek (Greek Precint)and chinese  enclaves (China town) are literally side by side without any problems and then you have the central business district. The Lebanese community in Melbourne has been there for generations and they have been already well integrated into the society - even Steve Bracks is a 4th gen aussie lebanese.<br><br></div>
