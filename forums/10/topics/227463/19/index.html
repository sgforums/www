            <div class='col-md body'>So why are some of the people in here going out to such great lengths to point our racism in Australia when we all know it's more all less endemic in the entire world?<br><br>Is the racism in Australia accepted by the majority? Do they accept it as a way or life or is that a problem they are trying to deal with. If racism is really a culture there, there would be a lot more stories to tell then the ones we harp on.<br><br>If all the governmental controls were lifted on us, do you think we are above having one of our beach race riots? I urge some people here to see the big picture.<br><br>If one is raising up the issue of racism in Australia just to bash it as a nation, defaming what is otherwise a large number of Aussies who are not even racists to begin with and not really being bothered to face racism on our own doorstep (our attitudes and treatment towards other races and foreign workers) we have no right to raise our voices here, much less use this topic for their own ends.<br><br></div>

Is this really the reality of things or the things you <span style="font-style: italic;">wish</span> it to be. So far I find little reason to believe your talk in here, given you don't really add much to this topic to begin with except trying to find increasingly creative ways to get around this pesky things called Truth and Logic.<br><br>I suggest you look over the case once again... if you have something against Australians and Australia fine enough... but at the very least make sure the stuff you are holding against them is <span style="font-style: italic;">for real</span>, if not you are just wasting your own time and energy, not to mention making yourself look extremely silly.<br><br>Not to mention if you were really against racism, painting all Aussies as racist probably isn't the way to go as far as fighting racism in Australia is concerned. What I do know about the White people is that in general they are not as homogenous in opinion and thought as asians are... there are bound to be some radical racists, as well as a significant number of White aussies who are markedly anti-racists.<br><br>I don't see how wanting to paint all of them, or the entire country as being of one mindset really help things... nor gives anybody in here a clear picture of what's happening on the ground. At worst, such demonizing of White aussies is pretty much a rather discusting form of racism itself.<br><br>So unless you give people in here a proper reason to listen to you, I suggest to everybody in here that Gazelle be more or less ignored until he can make a cohorent post that is actually constructive for a change.<br><br>Cheers, and have a g'day.<br><br></div>
