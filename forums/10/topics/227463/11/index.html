I just said long have I learnt about research that comes from [b] people sitting behind desks - you know the type that comes from the ivory tower </strong>.<br><br>I don't have an issue with researchers who are still involved with the day to day practice and trying to improve things because they are the end users .<br><br>I am actually discrediting Gazelle for taking and pasting a piece of research which admits that it has its own weaknesses. It underrepresented some groups . Anyways , if you read the ANU paper - it is merely a telephone survey of 5056 people compared to over 20 million people in Australia. It has no strong conclusion. It is just a description of what those 5056 people think . No clear conclusions to state how they think the group surveyed are enough to provide a mildly skewed view. It is purely theorectical - no statistical methods on estimating racism at all - it is just purely descriptive summary statistics of  opinions of people whom they surveyed( which is the most basic of all methods )  and it some how does not really link up to their study aims.<br><br>Mind you . Don't take it just as it is because a research says it is good or because the researcher or university has some reputation. I have read a sh!t paper coming out from some Harvard researchers before - one was about immunisation I think . Albeit there are alot of good papers but there are also sh!t papers who count on what you call a brandname of the school or researcher.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Are you saying that your personal view is more credible than the five thousands and fifty-six people that has participate in the survey?</div>
