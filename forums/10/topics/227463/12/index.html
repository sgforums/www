Since when have <strong>SINGAPOREANS</strong> not made comments about Banglas and PRCs ourselves. I find us equally racist. I am sure we have all heard our friends refer to other races (joking or not it's up to you to decide) in some terms that should not be used. I am very ashamed when we start accusing others when we don't even bother looking at ourselves first. Down right ASHAMED.<br><br>To 798: Please support your statement of MAJORITY of the white in australia. I have nothing against you, but rather the usage of words.<br><br>To Gazelle: Should I invite my WHITE Australian friend, who is 70 years old this year (thus belonging to the so called more racist era), opens a successful chain of shops that employs not only WHITE Australians to have a chat with you Mr Gazelle?[/b]</blockquote>The main reason why our racism seem mild here is because Singaporean's tend to be more reserved, they don't show off their feelings publicly, whereas Australians tend to be more vocal about their feelings. Singaporean law does not let you have the freedom of expression. There is always the fear of criminal liabilities if we do something too expressive.</div>

Gazelle is absolutely right... those Singaporeans passing by Little India and making racist remarks are not racist, because they don't say it in your face unlike in Australia. People who stares at Banglas when they enter the MRT and make jokes are not racist... As long as you don't hit anyone is not considered racism... So we can all go ahead and hurl racial insults behind other people's back. Nope, that is not considered racism. Insult all you want. Yes, I suggest that everyone do that now...<br><br>Infact racism means to commit assault and violence. Blogging with racist remarks is not considered as acts of Racism... to summarize, Australians are much more racist than Singaporeans because they say things out, unlike some Singaporeans who poke fun of other races behind their back.<br><br>Haiz I wish that all Australian can be like Singaporeans and stop being such racist... I would suggest they take lessons from our very resourceful deer, I mean Gazelle.<br><br>PS: For everyone here, reflect on what I've said. Are we all not guilty of racism some point in our lives? If a small group of Singaporeans were to hit out another group of fellow Singaporeans of a different race, are all Singaporeans racist?<br><br>There are many unreported gang fights amongst streetgangs of different races in Singapore, a quick check with your police friends or ah beng friends (if any) can confirm what I say. They are similar to the unruly racial violence that happened in Australia in 2005 except for the press coverage. Those White hooligans were provoked by another gang of Lebanese descended hooligans. Those Australians involved are hooligans, gangsters. Do we naturally associate them with ALL white Australians?<br><br>I hope not, because I am not a gangster, neither do I wish people in other country to accuse the majority of Singaporeans of racism just because of those incidents.</div>

The " white policy" of the Australian was only abolished in 1980, or around that time. I am really interested to know how much of the racists mindset remains, especially time when the whites lifestyles are affected, when jobs are taken up by new comers who are not white. Incidents like Cronulla beach incident tells me that the "white superiority" mentality is still there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br></div></blockquote>White policy of Australia was abolished in <strong> 1973 </strong> not 1980s . The 1975 Racial Discrimination Act made the use of racial criteria for any official purpose illegal. Which means that your resume - they don't want to know which ethnicity you are unless the job, usually targeted at indigenous australians, is specifically excluded from the EEO regulations .<br><br>Cronulla is not about white superiority - some elements made it look that way. It is about failure to integrate. The reason why they targeted people of middle eastern appearance is because there are problems with middle eastern youths targeting caucasian women at the beaches and making lewd remarks to them. Especially when in a  rape case of a girl  , the muslim boy went to make a defence about the way she dressed allowed him to rape her. A few of their rape cases have that <strong> pathetic </strong> defence excuse of " oh it is because my religion taught me that" . But those cases doesn't help much with integration and made things worse. Now an middle eastern iman in Australia went to actually call unveiled women an exposed piece of flesh. He said that if stray cats come by and feast on the meat (rape)  , it is not the fault of the cats . His comments does not even HELP integration. And calling for Australia to be an islamic state .. now that is designed to create furor.<br><br>For Cronulla , one thing turned to another through a catalyst of mob behaviour and it became all out war.However, the long term non-caucasian residents were spared.<br><br>I can tell you from personal experience , some of the young idiots of middle eastern appearance do make very lewd remarks and harass girls. Their car also has a huge arabic sticker and that is an identifier by itself.  Fortunately my friends and I were in a crowded place and some guy shooed them off because he thought something didn't look right.<br></div>
