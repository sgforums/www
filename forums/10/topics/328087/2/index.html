              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Here is the reason, with all our national financial assets being
              known to the world, people will gauge our financial muscle and may
              take a run on our dollar. BESIDES KEEING IT SECRET WILL KEEP THE
              WORLD GUESSING AND  and looking at our expensive looking city,
              they will think we have lots of money and invest more of their own
              money in our country, pathetic fools IN THE END WE ARE THE ONES
              LAUGHING OURSELVES TO THE BANK.</p>
              <p>LOOK AT USA, NOW ITS KNOWN THAT THEY ARE BROKE. THAT SETS OFF A
              CHAIN EFFECT CAUSING MORE PROBLEMS. this is becos USA MAKE ITS bank
              account known to the world. BUT YET, it could not be the real
              scenario. It could be a lie within a lie to do the rest of the
              world in and collapse international currencies  Read on if u
              want to understand further the motive behind :</p>
              <p>let me tell u that there are people , very clever people who
              will manipulate a country's financial systems for their own selfish
              needs from the outside world. Truth is , there has been "mysterious
              elements" in the large financial centres around the world . It
              involves, politics, military, intelligence, technology,
              environment. A grand web of lies which has been going on for
              decades. If needed these mysterious elements  individuals or
              groups of individuals will even do their own country in, let alone
              other countries. a fine example is the federal reserve bank
              conspiracy of the 1800s and how this led to millions of people in
              US and Europe to become indebted and keep them in slavery for a a
              centralised power of elites bent on world domination. This debt
              scheme has its roots since the ancient times. In short this theory
              suggests that " Paper currency is a worthless entity with no value
              meant bring about slavery". When the scheme tied in with the
              suspected oil scam, it does makes the word go around and
              around.</p>
              <p>Some people  think that the Federal Reserve Banks are
              United States Government institutions. They are private monopolies
              ANSWERABLE TO NONE  which prey upon the people of these United
              States for the benefit of themselves and their foreign customers;
              foreign and domestic speculators and swindlers; and rich and
              predatory money lender. In that dark crew of financial pirates
              there are those who would cut a man's throat to get a dollar out of
              his pocket; there are those who send money into states to buy votes
              to control  legislatures; there are those within it who
              maintain international propaganda like the Iraq War, 9/11 ect. for
              the purpose of deceiving people into granting of new concessions
              which will permit them to cover up their past misdeeds and set
              again in motion their gigantic cycle of crime."</p>
              <p>An furthermore, keeping our national money account secret will
              ensure we dont attract banking crooks who may manipulate our
              country.</p>
              <p> What we can do best is "Marketing" , hey look we did buy a
              billion of Meryll Lynch, shincorp ect. We do have money and we just
              dont want to let the rest of the fiannce world know how much we
              have or how we earn our bucks from.</p>
              <p>Those fools like CSJ asking for transparency is just a fool.</p>
              <p>Singapore knew something about this and could be the reason she
              is being secretive about her national assets.Another reinforcing
              factor is singapore having not only BANKS AND FINANCIAL SYSTEMS but
              OIL INDUSTRIES AS WELL.It could be a sign that she does know
              something about the world's financial systems and is trying to
              safeguard herself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The world we live in world works in mysterious ways</p>
              <p>SIngapore, u are one smart son of a B6tch . I applaud u.</p>
