              <p>Here is the reason, with all our national financial assets being known to the world, people will gauge our financial muscle and may take a run on our dollar. BESIDES KEEING IT SECRET WILL KEEP THE WORLD GUESSING AND  and looking at our expensive looking city, they will think we have lots of money and invest more of their own money in our country, pathetic fools IN THE END WE ARE THE ONES LAUGHING OURSELVES TO THE BANK.</p>
              <p>LOOK AT USA, NOW ITS KNOWN THAT THEY ARE BROKE. THAT SETS OFF A CHAIN EFFECT CAUSING MORE PROBLEMS. this is becos USA MAKE ITS bank account known to the world. BUT YET, it could not be the real scenario. It could be a lie within a lie to do the rest of the world in and collapse international currencies  Read on if u want to understand further the motive behind :</p>
              <p>let me tell u that there are people , very clever people who will manipulate a country's financial systems for their own selfish needs from the outside world. Truth is , there has been "mysterious elements" in the large financial centres around the world . It involves, politics, military, intelligence, technology, environment. A grand web of lies which has been going on for decades. If needed these mysterious elements  individuals or groups of individuals will even do their own country in, let alone other countries. a fine example is the federal reserve bank conspiracy of the 1800s and how this led to millions of people in US and Europe to become indebted and keep them in slavery for a a centralised power of elites bent on world domination. This debt scheme has its roots since the ancient times. In short this theory suggests that " Paper currency is a worthless entity with no value meant bring about slavery". When the scheme tied in with the suspected oil scam, it does makes the word go around and around.</p>
              <p>Some people  think that the Federal Reserve Banks are United States Government institutions. They are private monopolies ANSWERABLE TO NONE  which prey upon the people of these United States for the benefit of themselves and their foreign customers; foreign and domestic speculators and swindlers; and rich and predatory money lender. In that dark crew of financial pirates there are those who would cut a man's throat to get a dollar out of his pocket; there are those who send money into states to buy votes to control  legislatures; there are those within it who maintain international propaganda like the Iraq War, 9/11 ect. for the purpose of deceiving people into granting of new concessions which will permit them to cover up their past misdeeds and set again in motion their gigantic cycle of crime."</p>
              <p>An furthermore, keeping our national money account secret will ensure we dont attract banking crooks who may manipulate our country.</p>
              <p> What we can do best is "Marketing" , hey look we did buy a billion of Meryll Lynch, shincorp ect. We do have money and we just dont want to let the rest of the fiannce world know how much we have or how we earn our bucks from.</p>
              <p>Those fools like CSJ asking for transparency is just a fool.</p>
              <p>Singapore knew something about this and could be the reason she is being secretive about her national assets.Another reinforcing factor is singapore having not only BANKS AND FINANCIAL SYSTEMS but OIL INDUSTRIES AS WELL.It could be a sign that she does know something about the world's financial systems and is trying to safeguard herself.</p>

              <p>The chart shows Singapore petrol price (MOPS95) over the same period as the crude oil price chart. MOPS95 is industry jargon for the market price of generic quality 95 octane petrol quoted by Platts (a subscriber based information service) ex Singapore refineries. MOPS stands for Mean of Platts Singapore. Other octane grades are quoted (92 and 97 octane) but MOPS95 is the most common benchmark price. Australian quality petrol attracts a premium over MOPS95.<br><br>The pattern of prices over time is similar to crude oil, with prices typically in the A$50 to 60 per barrel range from 2000 to early 2004. A spike in March/April 2003 marks the Gulf War and another spike in September 2005 marks Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. From mid 2004, prices rose sharply due to underlying crude oil prices.<br><br>The ex-refinery price of petrol is based on the Singapore market price for petrol, adjusted for Australian fuel standards and freight to Australia; the price is not regulated but instead determined by market forces.<br><br>The reason Australian petrol prices follow Singapore market prices is that Australian refineries must compete against petrol imports (overall 18 per cent of Australia's petrol was imported in 2006) and Singapore is a major source of petrol for importers.<br><br>The crude oil markets and the petroleum product markets are completely separate, distinct markets. Traders in these markets influence the prices based on supply and demand, real and perceived shortages and geopolitical instability. This is the same as for any international traded commodity such as agricultural or mineral commodities or currencies.<br></p>

              <p>Money is just an illusion.. so say some. Back before currency.. we barter. But for the convenience of storage we go with paper currency.</p>
              <p>The biggest heist of all.. are the bankers.. who puts an interest on the money.</p>
              <p>Make money your slave.. not be a slave to money.</p>
              <p>Only people who are naive and ignorant believes those banks are their best friend.</p>
              <p>So dude.. I don't know .. perhaps you are new to the old evils of the world.</p>
