              <p><span class="postbody">HAVING paid the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) charges, some motorists
              still find themselves still stuck in a jam on roads and expressways
              here. <br> Transport Minister Raymond Lim said yesterday that this happens because
              there are many more cars on the road today than 10 years ago when the
              ERP system was introduced. <br> <br> 'Our ERP system has served us well, but it is coming under strain,' said Mr Lim. 
              <br> <br> Cars are also used more intensively here, clocking 21,000km a year on average, compared to 9,100km in London. 
              <br> <br> Also, the 50-cent increases to ERP rates are no longer enough to keep
              traffic going, seeing as how after it went up nine times in 2006,
              another 25 rate hikes were needed last year. <br> <br> The new changes announced yesterday aim to fix this problem: 
              <br> <br> ERP will kick in much earlier under a new formula; 
              <br> <br> The basic ERP charge will go up from July to $2, from $1 now, and each subsequent jump will be $1, instead of 50 cents; 
              <br> <br> Sixteen more gantries will be put up, all to help ease congestion in the city area as well as on major roads islandwide. 
              <br> Currently, the gantries go active once the speed of half the motorists
              travelling on a particular stretch over a 30-minute period falls below
              the optimal level of 45kmh for expressways and 20kmh for major roads. <br> <br> However, in practice, many motorists will be travelling far slower. For
              example, speeds measured from 7.30am to 8am on a stretch of the
              Pan-Island Expressway this month showed that up to 38 per cent of the
              motorists were actually travelling below 45kmh, despite paying the ERP.
              <br> <br> 'This also explains why there is at times a disconnect between what the
              Land Transport Authority says and motorists' actual driving
              experience,' said Mr Lim. <br> <br> Under the new formula, ERP charges will kick in when, in line with
              international practice, just over 15 per cent of vehicles fall below
              ideal speeds. <br> <br> So, at least 85 per cent of motorists will be assured of smooth travel when they pay the ERP charges,Mr Lim said. 
              <br> <br> Mr Lim expects that with the higher basic charge and larger increments, rate changes will be less frequent. 
              <br> <br> The new formula and higher charges will be phased in to give people time to adjust. 
              <br> <br> They will start in July in the Central Business District (CBD) and
              Orchard Road, after more bus and train trips come on line, and then to
              other roads in due time. <br> <br> The number of gantries will also go up in phases, from 55 now, to 60 in April, 65 in July and 71 in November. 
              <br> <br> The focus is on the city area. Speeds on major roads in the CBD have fallen by over 25 per cent, from five years ago. 
              <br> <br> To cross major junctions, say, between North Bridge Road and Bras Basah
              Road, motorists must wait for three or more traffic light changes. <br> <br> So, ERP will be used to discourage those motorists who are just passing
              through the already packed Suntec City, Bugis and Marina Square
              shopping areas in the evenings, and on Saturdays. They make up a third
              of the traffic now. <br> <br> The ERP changes will have an effect on motorists like retiree William Chan, 65. 
              <br> <br> He said: 'If ERP prices keep rising, we may switch to public transport,
              but we'll still retain the option of driving to places that are far
              away.' <br> <br> Others, like manager Chua Xin Kai, 28, will not make a switch - yet. 
              <br> <br> 'I'm paying so much for the car and after driving for 10 years, I am
              just lazy to take public transport. Maybe when I have to scrap my car
              in three years, I'll reconsider.' <br> <br> Until then, the Government expects to collect from such motorists $70 million more a year as a result of the changes. 
              <br> <br> And to show that this is not an excuse to raise revenue, but really to
              curb congestion, road taxes will be cut 15 per cent to the tune of
              about $110 million. <br> <br> Mr Lim said: 'If motorists were to drive less, the Government would be happy to collect less ERP revenue.'</span></p>

              <p>When I was a kid, my dad used to tell me Sg parliament is a waste of time and highlights from parliament on TV, more often than not, only serves to eat into the scheduled programmes. After all, whatever law they want to set who can go against it? Why even bother having a parliament session? Now that I've grown up, I fully understand what my dad meant.</p>
