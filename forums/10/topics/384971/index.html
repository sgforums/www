              <p>MM Lee off to another official visit to India</p>
              <p><span class="time">December 15, 2009</span></p>
              <p>Singapore’s octogenarian leader MM Lee Kuan Yew had flown overseas again for an official visit to India.</p>
              <p>According to records from the website of the Prime Minister’s Office, this is probably MM Lee’s fifth overseas trip this year.</p>
              <p>MM Lee had just returned from the United States in October where he met up with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House.</p>
              <p>It is not known if he is paying for these trips or are they paid for by taxpayers’ monies.</p>
              <p>At 86 years of age, MM Lee still toiled tirelessly in the service of the nation. Already the oldest MP in the world, MM Lee looks to set another world record should he decide to participate in the next general election due by 2011.</p>
              <p>MM Lee had been appearing in the news lately once every two to three days, more so than his son, the Prime Minister.</p>
              <p>As Minister Mentor, Mr Lee was paid more than SGD$2 million annually or about SGD$166,600 monthly. The median monthly salary of an average Singapore is only $2,600.</p>
              <p>Before his departure, MM Lee found time to make a visit to his Tanjong Pagar constituency where he presented the house key to a buyer of Pinnacle@Duxton, the tallest HDB flats built in Singapore.</p>
              <p>In a brief speech, MM Lee recalled that he had unveiled the first rental flats at the same plot of land 45 years ago in 1964.</p>
              <p>He reassured Singaporeans that HDB flats will remain “affordable” even as its prices continue to rise.</p>
              <p>A few days earlier, MM Lee had lectured the Japanese on the need to rejuvenate their aging leadership and to bring in young leaders like he did.</p>
              <p><em>“We also have a rule, I’m the exception to the rule, I’m 86….But I’m not doing the work; I’m just forecasting… The work is being done by younger people in their late 40s and 50s. So there’s an energy and a drive, and an understanding of the contemporary world. And they are also linked up with the younger generation of voters,” </em>he quipped.</p>
              <p>MM Lee had been doing a lot of “forecasting” for Singapore since he assumed his position in 2003.</p>
              <p>He once remarked famously that Singapore is entering a “golden period”. A year later, Singapore became the first Asian country to enter a recession.</p>

              <p>He is wasting a lot of public funds.</p>
              <p>Why can't younger ministers or leaders have a chance?</p>
              <p>George Yeo perhaps?</p>
              <p>Why this 87 year senile old fool, one leg in coffin fly here and there?</p>
              <p>Hope that his planes crashes.</p>
              <p>This whole year like a world tour for this senile old bastard.</p>
