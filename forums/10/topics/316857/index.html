              <p>Dear Monkeyboy (must be the dark skin type)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>been working in singapore for more than 1 year I am foreigner I realized just after a couple of months that Singaporeans are really stupid, why I am saying this is because when taking the MRT every morning, people inside already inside the train dont move inside to allow new passengers to get in they just standing there and dont move down at all so you insist and say sorry by pushing and trying squeeze yourself a little bit but they look at you and keep holding their position.  Really stupid attitude and manner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Reply: U can buy a car. With ur high and mightly background, perhaps u could get a aston martin with 0% upfront. That way, u can avoid the dirty crouds and behave like James Bond on the road of Singapore. But don't forget to pay the installment...</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When applying to a job, either you got overqualified for the positon or we dont have the money to pay you because you are well-educated foreinger with master degree they can not afford paying you. what makes funny is when Mentor Lee Kew Yew said "We need more talents to cope with increasing jobs offers and we dont have enought people to take up all the jobs" fucking not true at all, on the field it is the way round when sending resume over got no interviewed at all and I am really qulified not talking shit like mister LKY.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reply: You'r definately a freshgrad with High IQ but -0 EQ. When the interviewe said u're "overqualified" meaning that u have some kind of attitute which they don't like.. dispite ur High &amp; Mightly Master of the Universe degree or whatever u call it. They definaltely have the budget to pay the candidate, just that it is not very wise to pay someone with such an "unique" attitute. Maybe u did something during the interview which they get piss off? They just don't want to put it so upfront to u.. more ever, u're a FT... scare to offen u.. later u show ur powder. So, be more street smart alright :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pay remaining the same and living cost keep increasing at least 40 higher than last year. how can you survive in this stupid country. The condom is more expensive in Singapore than London but in London you get paid 3 times more than Singapore. how stupid is that ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reply: Raising cost of living, i'm sure u can effort it... u're a Master of ur Universe. So ur capability counts. maybe u just did not try harder. As for the condom, why u need a condom? well, unless u're have only one beautiful gf cum sex partner like me.. u don't need it. Ooh.. u can try with animal.. they don't need condom i guess. But let me know when u have done it. Or maybe u had had done it already... Oishii?  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what I can see Singapore is going to sink quickly not the government but poor Singaporeans with 800 to 1000 SGD per month per family what can they do more than suicide?</p>
              <p>sorry forgot "Welcome to the lying Singapore"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reply: Ooh.. how much are u getting? $1200 or less? u seen to know how a poor dude feel.. are u feeling the same as them.. but u're FT? Well, if u have more u can help to donate if u want... or tell u what, go back to ur own native tribes and contributes to them in term of money and sex.. i think they will be more gladly to recieve u. As for "Welcome to the lying Singapore".. I'm glad u make it through.. now, go buy a ticket and fly as far as i can. If u can't effort the airfair, try to swim to JB if u want.. no one stopping u but u might need a floats. its cheap anyway... :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope it helps.. and thanks for the contribution to the economy.. but please don't contribute ur speam here. Sure pollute the island.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers</p>
