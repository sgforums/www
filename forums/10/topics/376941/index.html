              <p><strong>The Star Online, 26 Sep 2009, Seah Chiang Nee</strong><br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Playing second fiddle to foreigners despite having a birthright</span></strong><br> <br> AN ELECTRONICS firm that advertised last week for a “preferably
              non-Singaporean” engineer has added fuel to a worsening controversy in
              this migrant city.<br> <br> It particularly stipulated that “permanent residents are welcome” to apply for this “mid-career job (salary negotiable)”.<br> <br> A copy of the advertisement found its way onto the web.<br> <br> Applicants should have a diploma or a relevant trade certificate, with
              3-5 years’ work experience, and “preferably non-Singaporean (PR
              welcome),” it added.<br> <br> This provoked strong reactions from Singaporeans who are already upset at the large number of foreigners allowed to work here.<br> <br> One asked if such discrimination is legal. “This sort of ad would have
              landed this company in heavy trouble in most developed states,” he
              added.<br> <br> Another writer said: <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>“Now we know where we stand. The policy has downgraded Singaporeans to below foreigners.”</strong></span><br> <br> Archilles said: <span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>“I feel left
              out by my own government, which is desperately trying to attract
              foreign talent (and) overlooking our own ‘local talent’. It’s sad, very
              sad!”</strong></span><br> <br> A similar storm broke some years ago when another <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>company
              told a fresh Singaporean graduate during a job interview that his
              chances were slim if he had to report for annual reservist duty.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>“We prefer a foreigner who has no such obligations,” the executive had added. Besides, they are much less costly to hire.</strong></span><br> <br> The reservist withdrew his application in disgust.<br> <br> This is not just another act of public whining. <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The fact is many Singaporeans are no longer sure about their own role or entitlement in society.<br> </strong></span> <br> In recent years, the rate of entry has increased sharply as the economy
              flourished. Every year some 100,000 foreigners have been arriving,
              putting pressure on what was already one of the most competitive and
              over-crowded cities in Asia.<br> <br> The controversy couldn’t have come at a worse time when the country is
              emerging from a severe downturn and the people’s uppermost concern is
              getting – or retaining – their jobs.<br> <br> Last month Seagate (worldwide: 10,000 workers) moved out its
              manufacturing capacity, retrenching some 2,000 workers. “It is
              difficult to imagine the impact of Seagate’s loss on our economy,” said
              commentator Harrison Goh.<br> <br> Its departure, he added, may have marked the end point of Singapore’s involvement in the global manufacturing market.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>“It spells a deepening crisis that most Singaporeans may not yet fathom, thinking that the PAP government has a ready solution.”</strong></span><br> <br> It is within this context that the unpopularity of the open door policy becomes apparent.<br> <br> Political leaders are now working hard to reassure embittered Singaporeans that their interests would always come first.<br> <br> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced last week that his government
              would reduce the inflow of foreign workers to maintain the “tone” of
              society. <span style="color: red;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He gave no numbers.</span><br> </strong></span> <br> At the same time, his Community, Youth and Sports Minister assured
              polytechnic students: “You have a birthright. Everything we do is for
              your long-term benefit. Foreigners are here to help make Singapore more
              viable and competitive.”<br> <br> The other side of the coin is equally stark.<br> <br> With 1.28 babies per couple, Singapore’s birth-rate is one of the lowest in the world and threatens its long-term survival.<br> <br> Singaporeans are also ageing rapidly, which may require young people to pay higher taxes to look after them.<br> <br> Both defects are already being felt in a manpower-short economy, which requires immigrants to correct, according to officials.<br> <br> “Companies have been coming to us to ask ‘where are the workers, we can’t get them’,” a government official said.<br> <br> Singaporeans, being descendants of immigrants themselves, have never
              been antagonistic to the presence of foreigners here – until now.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>What they resent is not their
              coming, but the overwhelming numbers, which they feel are threatening
              their jobs and education opportunities.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>They are also angry with uneven
              policies that benefit foreigners more than locals, especially national
              service (compulsory two years) and the subsequent annual reservist
              call-ups, a burden not borne by foreigners.</strong></span><br> <br> Permanent residents are exempted, but their children are not.<br> <br> Not having to meet reservist call-ups and cheaper wages are powerful
              attractions for employers to hire foreigners, particularly in a weak
              economy.<br> <br> Complaints have increasingly come from older or mid-career Singaporeans
              who have been replaced by lower-cost younger workers from China or
              India.<br> <br> The foreigners, hungrier and without family responsibility here,
              generally work longer hours for less pay – something that married
              Singaporeans with a home mortgage to pay cannot possibly match.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>A small industry has risen to
              recruit them in large numbers – as indicated by a recruitment agency,
              with this advertisement: “Do you find it difficult and expensive to
              hire local staff? Why not consider hiring foreign talents?”</strong></span><br> <br> Claiming it was licensed by the Manpower Ministry, the agency said that
              it had recruited thousands of workers from China, India, Vietnam and
              Malaysia for Singapore firms in the past five years.<br> <br> Every time such an ad appears, it cuts into the popularity of the
              government, which won 66.6% of the popular votes in the 2006 election.<br> <br> Several months ago, the government ordered its election machinery to prepare for a snap election in case one is called.<br> <br> With the improvement of the economy, it is widely expected that it will
              take place next year, instead of 2011 as scheduled. The public
              discontent against massive immigration promises to be one of the
              hottest campaign issues if it happens.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>This intensity of public feeling
              has been too sensitive to be reflected in the traditional media, which
              has toned down the coverage.</strong></span><br> <br> On the Internet, however, where Singapo-reans can air their grievances,
              the mood is more sombre. It probably requires more than mere government
              assurances to placate.<br> <br> --------------------<br> <br> <strong><span style="font-size: small;">Latest updates @ Singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com<br> <br> 1, OPINION: S'poreans playing second fiddle to foreigners despite having a birthright - Seah Chiang Nee<br> 2.

              <p>Leaving? Just because you believe what some minorities are saying? Have you check out the realities and facts of the situation first, coupled with patience for change?</p>
              <p>If you did, and still feel it is best for you, I wish you good luck, sincerly. Just know that if things are no better out there in this cruel globalized world, I am sure our doors will still be open for you.</p>
              <p>Better still, get a job first and work as an expatriate, and know the reality there, if you think you can settle for a lifetime on that side, without giving up on anything here.. </p>

              <p>Yeah, I kinda understand how you're feeling. But try to look at it this way - if not for the 40% froeigners, you and many other citizens may not even have a job....cos industrialists goes where the money to profit is... cheap labour filled by foreigners, and higher paying ones by us, unless skillsets we dont have, which we must upgrade...</p>

              <p><br>Another typical method deploy by PAP lapdogs who will accuse non PAP supporter with claiming its we who voted in PAP in and we have the right to exercise our right. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Tell me, how can I vote when my zone is not even contested becos of the GRC constitution policy introduced by PAP??</p>
              <p>Actually I will not be surprised PAP introduced e-electron election system using computerise method to replace all paper voting in 2011. Then they will claim its the wise singapore of 66.6% to vote them in again(no matter u vote or not is not important, cos as long as they can easily manipulate the voting will do). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Stop wasting yr faith on voting. Do u think it will work?</p>
              <p>Btw, U haven answer us what MP will do or PM LHL will do if we complain to them. Tell me leh!</p>
