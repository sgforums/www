            <div class='col-md body'>Government leaders have called for change, but they themselves are controlled by the old guards who come across as being too obsessed with their own personality cult than nation building to bother to change.<br><br>There are good people among Singaporeans but many of these good people have been exiled by defamation suits or beaten psychologically and politically to keep their low profile from politics.<br><br>The few Liang Shan brothers hibernating in the cyberspace mountain who have the sense of justice and commitments are not enough. They are too loose and too few. They need to get together selflessly and form political organization of larger perspective and functions than pure political parties which are too weak any way to make a difference. Such political organizations can groom and support future political talents but for such organization to arise and succeed they need to adopt proper set up and objective goals and accountable processes so as to invovel a fairly large network of talents to come up with solutions and alternatives to solve national problems and issues.<br><br>The tea sessions are the form and not the substance. To get the real political talents with passion, and commitments while in possession of ability, the net has to be pretty larger than a few scholars or academic persons.<br><br>The newbies inducted by the ruling party now are mostly impressionables or academically notable people of the same mould and cast as the civil service or the ministers lacking overall passions, commitments or perspectives. They cannot convince the old guards to accept new solutions and changes or move to a new direction.<br><br>Come another election, many newbies will be bundled out cermoniously again with excuses like given previously "not having baptism of fire" not "in been through battle" or some such-like reason. The fact is even if the newbies or some of the newbies have those abilities will they be given the leeway to disagree with many past assumptions and policies that have gone wrong.<br><br>Election after election Singaporeans have brought up this fear for change because the leaders were too self-centred with their own past policies which have been designed to control and legalistically ride roughshod over many of people's genuine needs and aspirations.<br><br>Singaporeans are left with one venue to groom political talents to be future leaders of visions and commitments and ability - political organizations which will serve as facilitators to future political common plans and alternatives.<br><br>Political parties have been controlled and overwhelmed with defamation suits and many of them do not attract people of calibre. So the only way forward is to get people to join political organization and keeping such organizations firmly supported by citizens.<br><br>As citizens there is only one place to seek and groom political talents - through setting up common goals and objectives through joining political organizations.<br></div>
