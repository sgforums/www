            <div class='col-md body'>Ngiam Tong Dow has admitted that after he retired from government service, and joined HDB Corps, he for the first time came to realize that he had to worry about paying their staff at the end of each month.<br><br>The ministers and civil servants are our expensive flower pots and iron ricebowlers who are only concerned with collecting more and more monies but unable to add values to the people social and economic vibrancy or restructure the economy.<br><br>Through artful arguments and rhetorics they have succeeded in giving a false impression that they have succeeded in governing the country.<br><br>Assets have dropped 30 % on average and wages to the lowest level for years but the leaders still have the cheek to claim success (which they waited to do and making claims of leadership again upon the first sign of world economy).<br><br>If leaders could only claim this kind of success, by collecting more and more monies from the people and spending less and less through clever corporation and privatization, can they claim true success.<br><br>Today, if we use non-talent ordinary people who have risen from rank and file from proven records and successful past performance and not the army of academic scholars, we could easily have done much better and save $billions to give economic bonus shares to all citizesn every year from such government salaries savings alone.<br></div>

A car park chief will be paid superscale of $10,000 - $15,000 per month when private sector car park manager is only paid $4,000 -$6,000 pm.<br><br>Lee Han Shih a ST journalist who reported the billion-dollar losses suffered by HDB in 2002 was right. HDB officers were so grossly overpaid even higher than the SIA officers.<br><br>If ministers cannot see what is wrong with government wage costs then people will have ot suffer high costs of living and problems in doing business.</div>

We must adopt certain ettiquette to better avoid our inevitable differences of opinions and share the common desire to question wrong doings and gerrymandering and ask for change.<br><br>When this group of active citizens in the sgforums grow bigger we will see the values and cultures as people which is the essence of a vibrant community. Such socio-sphere will develop and gather strength as we learn over time and share common ideas, goals and objectives.<br><br>We must try to stay together to look after each other's interest to give our views and question on government policies or wrongs. Even if we do not form formal party or society to interact I think it is still worth the while interacting as an active group of citizens or conscience keeper of the community.<br><br>Many of us have different skills and knowledge and abilities and we can all contribute towards sharing finer points about growing a more collective and active community.<br><br>For the time being, we in the sgforums community have reached certain common understanding that we must question undesirable and wrong government policies and views fairly and without fear and favor. We have exchanged views with those who are postulating government views here like Salman and I can he knows that he is unable to neutralise our independence with all his salmanizations and praising of past autocratic practices.<br><br>There are those who think that they could offer their philosophical discourses on government or system of society with others. This state of community consciousness is good to nurture and develop. When such active community develops we will then not be taken for granted by the bureaucrats who will be subject to our positive scrutiny. We have I believe offered many views so far from our question of GRCs and all the high-costs and elitist practices and I believe we are on the right track.<br><br>Over time, even if we stay informal and do nothing politically we have nothing to lose and I believe we will spread our common views and make them known and respected.<br><br>We only need to regularly ensure that this active sgforums community will grow and our goodwill will spread. If we need to meet at annual gathering, I am all for such exchanges as I think we as a community will gather strength as a civic body which eventually will provide us a certain collective platform to offer our views. I am sure such exchanges even on informal basis will count towards our final goals.</div>
