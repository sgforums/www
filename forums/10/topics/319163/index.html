              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><strong><em>By Michael Chick</em></strong><br><br>Nestled
              deep in Minangkabau Country, in Sumatera, lies a small town called
              Pariaman. This quaint hamlet today is quiet, and uneventful. However,
              words cannot decribe the horror of the bloodbath which occurred here
              exactly 50 years ago. 25 Chinese families were brutally murdered in
              their sleep in cold blood. They had their throats slit with sharp Zinc
              roofing shards. Every single one of the 180 odd Chinese residents were
              butchered this day 50 years ago. Their bodies thrown into the sea left
              to rot.<br><br>The 25 families were guilty of one and only one crime.
              They were successful business people. And for that, they paid with
              their lives. Today, as a result, Pariaman is economically decadent.
              Shops barely stay financially afloat. Most shops barely make enough to
              pay rent and utilities. Crime rates skyrocket. Corrupt Police Officers
              leech off the residents, who already barely make ends meet.Â  Citizens
              steal, rob and plunder from each other, and many shopkeepers have to
              sleep in their stores just in case "Kedai kena Maling" (shops get
              robbed), as one elderly resident so aptly put it. Dark shadowy figures
              stagger, engaged in Glue Sniffing, Narcotics, and shifty Drug Pushers
              ply the streets after dark. Women and children are preciously locked at
              home after nightfall, for fear of their lives. You will never see them
              after dark.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">The
              penniless children of Pariaman wander to Malaysia, hoping to make a few
              bucks. Instead, they are beaten, raped, and dumped overboard at sea.
              Left to drown in the Straits of Malacca by the Malaysian
              Police.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Pariaman
              Residents thought that to win the economic race, was to obliterate
              their competitor. What they failed to realize, was that in fact it was
              not the 180 Chinese throats that they slit, but their own. Their genocidal act is still felt by the entire Commuunity today.</span></p>
