Even the part about them 'spitting' into the food is not related to their past; instead, I can offer concrete evidence of non-convicted people who as waiters routinely spit into the food of pushy, rude customers. Therefore, my point is not that convicts are 'bad' because there are unconvicted people who would do bad things also. I just want to say that most humans are 'vindictive' by nature, and that it will only be natural that some of these ex-convict waiters may choose to excercise their relative power over the judges/prosecutors in the context of the cafe (by spitting in their food).<br><br>Trust me; i've got kitchen experience, so I know how filthy and petty some kitchen staff are.<br><br>And Sir, about 'assumptions'. We won't get through the day IF we don't use our many assumptions about others, would we?</div>
