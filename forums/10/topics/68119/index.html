            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, get this people!! This new wage revamp that the Govt is introducing, looks harmless right? They have thought of a great new idea to improve our economy and save jobs for all of us. In a way, yes I agree, some can agree but like always you have to read the terms and conditions in any agreement.<br><br>If you hear on the radio from all our DJs, promoting wage reform, "saves jobs", "makes us more competitive", "we will be better off", I really feel like a sheep, I listen I do. The only problem I have is, I think we're going to get TAX MORE!<br><br>Look, at the way the wage reform is structured, they have yet to release the full terms and conditions but there's this Annual Variable Component, AVC, now for those of you who are uncertain about the tax rules, its simple, we are taxed on our earned income ie if you earn more than 20k per year, you have to pay taxes to the govt. However, you have to pay taxes immediately for any bonus you receive at year end, this being the AVC. Thus, you do not see it but in the end, we get taxed on these variable parts, which acts as bonus I believe. Anyone knows more about this wage reform? Do we get taxed more year end on these so-called 'bonus'? or is it considered earned income? There's a big difference!<br><br>Anyone working for the IRAS knows how we will be taxed under this wage reform?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On your mention of the Taxes area, I do find it quite curious as to why in particular, the general 5% GST option had been choosen over other alternative considerations, say tax that target specific industries.<br><br>An example of what I mean by industry specific tax would be something like the extra 10% that we pay for dinning in restaurants?<br><br>Would industrial based taxation that target and revolve around specific parties be a better way of both managing and preserving a country's diversified revenue sources?<br><br>Tax percentiles can be adjusted in a more agile manner in accordance to the different changes in the various industrial performance cycles to better meet various macro economic conditions.<br><br>Where a rising industry is flourishing, the imposement of a slightly higher tax figure - to a reasonable amount, can help the country to both have tax revenues without increasing the level of business cost to an unsustainable level and provide yet another useful excuse for employers to go on a wage cutting rampage at an employer's whims and fancy.<br><br>Likewise where an industry sector is facing some serious challenges, reduce the industry tax figure for those whom are affected by the trade.<br><br>An experiences nomad will herd his sheeps to feed on different pastures of grass because he knows that ONE source of pasture should never ever be over consumed.<br><br>When all the grass that grows in a pasture get eaten away, the goats and the Nomad will not be able to avoid a similar fate.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taxation by industry can do more harm to the industry, by making it less competitive, and may tantamount to 'milking the cow' that may end up in 'killing the goose that lay the golden egg'.<br><br>The 10 percent tax that is applied on restaurant bills has to be paid by the public at large, and not by the restaurant as an industry. The restaurants only serve as points of collection for the Government.<br><br>Tax collection entails cost too, as there will be manpower needed to ensure that accounting and auditting process are correctly performed, and revenue collection do not result in leakages.<br><br>Tax collection should be kept simple, ease in implementation and operation, and do not entail a high cost in its execution.<br><br>It should also be seen to be fair and do not impose hardship by discriminating any sector, and its effect should net everyone equally without discrimination.<br><br>The GST is such a tax system that covers all economic activities - from individual consumption and transaction, up to that of the large corporations.<br><br>The Income Tax and GST policy is a 'double whammy' for Singaporeans, as prior to GST being implemented, it was announced that Income Tax will be reduced very substantially when the GST is fully implemented.<br><br>Now that we have seen GST being fully implemented to its 5 percent as originally planned - (Government Revenue Collection was already bursting to its seams when it was at its initial level of 3 percent GST) - we have yet to see Income Tax being reduced any further.<br><br>Similarly, when Mr Mah Bow Tan was the Communications and Transport Minister, he had indicated that once the ERP or Road Pricing System was fully implemented, Road Tax will be reduced substantially.<br><br>So far we have seen only a reduction of less then 25 percent, when Road Tax was increased by leaps and bounds of over 200 percent since increases were made from the late 1970s.<br><br>Now that Mr Mah is no longer the Communications and Transport Minister, what was said by him seems to have been conveniently forgotten by his successor.<br><br>Now, the shortness in Ministerial memory seems to be in effect with regards to the lowering of Income Tax, when the 5 percent GST is fully implemented.<br><br></div>

You can call in SWAT</strong></span><strong><br><br>Team made up of MOM, NTUC staff and employers' reps helps firms make pay structures more flexible and save jobs</strong><br><br>By Sue-Ann Chia , The Straits Times, 30 Jan 2004<br><br>COMPANIES needing help to revamp their wages can call in SWAT (reStructuring Wages Action Team).<br><br>Made up of human resource experts and officers from the Manpower Ministry (MOM), NTUC and the employers' federation, the team is currently working with the 'first wave' of 70 to 100 companies to help them make salary structures more flexible and save jobs.<br><br>The Government will also provide other help tools - such as a $2 million fund for small and medium enterprises to attend training workshops, and a pool of human resource consultants to assist companies with reforming their wages.<br><br>These measures are listed in the Tripartite Taskforce on Wage Restructuring's 137-page report that will be presented today at a conference.<br><br>About 1,600 employers, unionists and government officials will be there to discuss how the suggestions can be used to revamp wage systems.<br><br>The recommendations by the taskforce are designed to speed up wage restructuring in Singapore.<br><br>Chairman and MOM permanent secretary Yong Ying-I noted that the recommendations will reduce the 'hard work' for companies as the groundwork has already been laid by her taskforce.<br><br>There are also four sectoral groups - covering electronics, chemicals, transport and hotels - that have come up with sector-specific details on wage reforms. More groups dealing with other sectors are expected to spring up after the conference.<br><br>Ultimately, the help measures will 'keep up the momentum' of wage reform, she said at a briefing to release the report to the media.<br><br>She noted, for instance, that 70 to 100 companies in the initial batch are willing to restructure their wage systems as long as there was some 'hand-holding'.<br><br>From there, she hopes the success cases can be used as models, as such 'peer testimonials' will inspire other companies to follow suit.<br><br>Mr Stephen Lee, president of the Singapore National Employers' Federation, said companies are now 'more receptive' to the idea after witnessing the devastating impact of Sars on the economy and the waves of job losses.<br><br>Given the brighter prospects this year, he urged companies not to delay restructuring their wages as it would be easier and less painful to do so during good times - when there is more room to adjust wages and pay cuts will be less likely.<br><br>It will also enable companies to be more competitive and withstand future downturns.<br><br>Companies which have revamped their wages agreed.<br><br>A spokesman for Shell told The Straits Times: 'Wage restructuring must be embraced if we are to survive and thrive.'<br><br>But Mr Lee acknowledged that there are still a lot of companies 'struggling with the why and how'.<br><br>Smaller companies, in particular, are 'not familiar' with wage restructuring, noted Mr Lawrence Leow, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises.<br><br>Hence, the Workforce Development Agency's help to co-fund training and coaching fees, subject to a cap of $8,500, will come in 'very handy'.<br><br>Workers too will stand to benefit from wage reform, said NTUC president John De Payva.<br><br>'If the company does well, workers can look forward to higher bonuses and more pay,' he said, adding that it will ensure jobs are preserved during a downturn.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well back to Atobe statement about GLCs, with many GLCs the duration in one managerial post is usually 1 - 2 years before they leap frog to another higher post. At each post, the incentive for our 'scholars' to maximize their own wealth, would be to achieve a sales target or increase profitability. Sometimes, they use too much theory, in practice, sales targets are easy to get, just drop price and you get more sales. Or just axe most of the older workers so that you dunch have to pay them pensions to increase profitability. All this at what cost? So that you can get your base pay and your bonus as well? But what will happen to the poor GLC which might suffer in the long run due to poor margins and lack of skilled trained staff?<br><br>Sometimes, brains is'nt everything, Singapore bases everything on brains, tests and exams... look at mcdonald's CEO, if you looked at his track record, he started out at mcdonalds in Australia when he was 14 as a cleaner, then later learnt to cook fries, to burgers to serving at the counter. He worked his way up from manager to regional to... and finally CEO. GLCs definitely needs to base more on merit rather than just intellect. So long as the scholar does'nt screw up big time or make a huge mess at his post, he/she moves on to the next post.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Finding the right balance of payments<br>A tripartite taskforce on wage reform has come up with comprehensive guidelines for flexible wages. Bosses are expected to get the ball rolling. But just how and what are the pitfalls?</strong><br><br>EUGENE LOW, SUE-ANN CHIA and REBECCA LEE report, The Straits Times, 07 Feb 2004<br><br>THE toilet may be the last place where you want to hear about wage reform, but that doesn't deter Mr Han Hun Juan, director of human resources at Raffles The Plaza and Swissotel The Stamford.<br><br>With almost evangelical zeal, he takes every opportunity to persuade his colleagues of the merits of flexible wages.<br><br>'There were many dialogues - we talked about the issue everywhere, along corridors and even in the toilets,' he said.<br><br>'It takes time to educate and explain the changes to workers.'<br><br>The company rationalised staff allowances last month. A portion - about 25 per cent - was converted to basic salary, while the rest was made variable and dependent on performance. Around 400 of its 1,600 staff were affected.<br><br>All the effort to speak to employees was necessary because wage reform 'can be quite difficult to understand', said Mr Han.<br><br>Even minor changes that result in less take-home pay for employees will always meet with resistance.<br><br>Revamping salary structures to make them more variable is a complex process and companies can end up demoralising their employees if they push through changes in an insensitive manner.<br><br>So while many companies understand fully the advantages of a more flexible wage system - that they can cut the wage bill and save jobs in a downturn - they are not raring to make the changes just yet, because they know it will be tough to get workers to accept them.<br><br>They are also reluctant to be the first to change, for fear that workers will leave companies with flexible wage systems.<br><br>Enter the Swat (reStructuring Wages Action Team) team, a group of human resource experts and officers from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and the employers federation. It is working with the 'first wave' of 70 to 100 companies to help them implement more flexible wage systems.<br><br>Ms Joyce Kok, who is head of industrial relations at United Workers of Electronic and Electrical Industries and a member of the Swat team, said: 'Companies are waiting for each other to start, worried that they will be the first few.'<br><br>To tackle this issue, the taskforce is pushing for wage reform on a sector-by-sector basis. Its four sectoral groups - covering electronics, chemicals, land transport and hotels - have come up with sector-specific details on wage reforms. More groups dealing with other sectors are expected to be set up as well.<br><br>Beyond the fear of being the first, the issue of managing worker morale is probably the main reason for the delay in wage reform so far.<br><br>In recent years, the workforce has suffered blow after blow: wage cuts and retrenchments, and rising unemployment and successive Central Provident Fund cuts.<br><br>Fresh from the latest CPF cut in October, workers are unlikely to be optimistic about further changes that affect their pay package.<br><br>Like any restructuring exercise, the devil is in the details and it will take hours of painstaking work and persuasion to get workers to accept wage reform.<br><br>Just what does the taskforce recommend?<br><br>( To be Continued below )<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE IDEAL WAGE PACKET</strong><br><br>FOR one, it wants to see employers build up the monthly variable component (MVC) of their workers' wages. Many companies already have an annual variable component (AVC), but as the recent spate of crises have shown, few companies can wait till the end of the year to trim costs. So the idea is for the MVC to be trimmed when business conditions get bad - and restored quickly when things improve.<br><br>If the taskforce has its way, this is what the average wage packet for rank-and-file employees will look like: 70 per cent in basic pay, 20 per cent in AVC, and the remaining 10 per cent in MVC.<br><br>The taskforce recommends that companies build up the MVC partly from future wage increases and partly from basic wages. It also urges companies to convert wage allowances that 'no longer serve any purpose' to the MVC.<br><br>It sounds straightforward enough on paper, and there are clear gains from the change.<br><br>However, bosses will have to deal with the perception that introducing the MVC into the wage structure is just a way to initiate pay cuts, said Mrs Mildred Tan, managing director of Ernst &amp; Young Associates.<br><br>'This perception brings about associated fears and anxiety, leading to employee dissatisfaction and low morale,' she told Insight.<br><br>Ms Mary Chua, a consultant at Watson Wyatt Singapore, agreed.<br><br>'A key challenge will be engaging employees and soliciting their understanding and acceptance of a flexible wage system,' she said.<br><br>'Nobody likes uncertainty. A flexible wage system introduces more pay-at-risk and employees will find this change unsettling.'<br><br>One common perception which should be corrected is that basic wages will be cut in order to build up the MVC, said Mr Peter Lee, managing consultant of Remuneration Data Specialists.<br><br>'Their basic pay will not be cut, although it may now increase by less than before - for example, by 2 to 3 per cent instead of by 5 to 6 per cent,' he pointed out. The rest of the increment can go towards building up the MVC.<br><br>More important, employees need to be convinced that wage flexibility works both ways - while salaries may be cut in lean times, wages should rise when the company does well.<br><br>NTUC chief Lim Boon Heng, a staunch believer in flexible wages who constantly urges employers to reform salaries, said this was one area where bosses should play fair.<br><br>'Where there is the possibility of a downside, there must also be the possibility of an upside for the employees to feel that it is fair.'<br><br>NEC Semiconductors, for one, intends to spell out the criteria. It introduced the MVC three years ago. This now forms 6.5 per cent of total wages, and will go up to 10 per cent.<br><br>The company intends to set trigger points for when to cut and restore the MVC, said its director, Mr Eric Wong.<br><br>It is also setting clearer key performance indicators to determine variable bonus payments, and will seek help from unions and wage consultants.<br><br>One clear, explicit way to set such criteria is by linking variable pay to profit targets. When Singapore Airlines cut wages last year, for example, it promised that if it made $500 million in the current financial year ending next month, employees will get back a lump sum payment worth all foregone wages.<br><br>If profit is $600 million, the payback will be 115 per cent. The payback is 75 per cent if the profit is $400 million.<br><br>It may be possible to spell out such quantitative targets for company performance. But it is also individual performance that will determine how much an employee takes home in a variable pay system.<br><br>To win trust, companies need a transparent and fair performance management system.<br><br>'Performance criteria and assessment need to be clearly articulated and defensible,' said Ms Chua.<br><br>'Employees need to be assured that when they turn in good performance, they can expect to receive meaningful rewards.'<br><br>Philips Electronics Singapore has already redefined its performance measures.<br><br>'In the past, bonuses were based on a hotchpotch of things such as how the company performed, economic data and competitive data,' said Mrs Elizabeth Martin-Chua, executive director of country management and vice-president of human resources.<br><br>'This couldn't go on. There was a need to base the bonuses on performance - both the company's and the individual's. We have set clearer targets that will translate into bonuses.'<br><br>Some of its key performance indicators include economic profit (net profit after tax and deduction of capital financing cost), cash flow and customer satisfaction.<br><br>While Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is right in saying that setting up a performance appraisal system isn't exactly 'rocket science', it is also true that developing a robust appraisal system is not easy.<br><br>As Singapore Management University associate professor of economics Hoon Hian Teck notes, performance criteria may be hard to determine for some types of jobs.<br><br>'It may be easy in some businesses like the manufacture of umbrellas, for example, but much more difficult and hence costlier to do in, say, a consultancy business.'<br><br>However, managing worker morale is not simply a matter of having a good appraisal system in place. Nor is it only about providing verbal assurances to workers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>NEED FOR SAFEGUARDS</strong><br><br>WITH their wages at stake, employees want meaningful measures that will safeguard their interests.<br><br>For example, will the MVC become an instrument of first resort, since it's so easy to trim, rather than one of last resort? What recourse do workers have if companies are hasty in cutting it but tardy in restoring it? What assurance do they have that other business costs will be trimmed first, before wages are snipped?<br><br>And the most vital question of all: Since the flexible wage system is being sold to workers as a way to save jobs, who will monitor companies to make sure they keep their word? That, having cut wages, reduced CPF and introduced monthly variable pay, they don't continue to retrench workers even in the face of rising profits?<br><br>No compulsion is possible or necessary. But workers must feel they can trust their employers to do the right thing.<br><br>As it is, Singapore employers are fortunate that unions here are fully behind wage reform. Far from blocking it, the labour movement is actually at the forefront of change.<br><br>Unionists said another big concern for workers was whether pay increases can keep up with rising costs of living, especially with basic pay packets increasing by less under a flexible wage system.<br><br>Mr Fauzi Abdullah, a 40-year-old engineer, said: 'Workers can understand how flexible wages can help save their jobs but they need to know that basic items such as utilities, transportation and education will continue to be affordable.'<br><br>This is one area that is beyond the effort of the Swat team.<br><br>It requires commitment from the Government to provide a macroeconomic environment - and an inflation rate - that is consistent with lower assured pay increases.<br><br>As Acting Manpower Minister Ng Eng Hen said, the 'stars are aligned' for employers to act on wage reform. The ball is in their court.<br><br>But given that it is workers who will be at the receiving end if wage reform is not done properly, employers may have to volley the ball to workers gently, and make sure they don't hit it out of court.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Have you not heard of 'window dressing' to achieve 'profitability' ?<br><br>This practise is common in all countries, whether in Singapore or EU countries, UK, USA, or Japan, Australia, and any other countries with Public Accounting System.<br><br>Some corporations experiencing losses from their core business, will attempt to cover up these losses with more activities in non-related business - such as selling off some assets to improve their cash positions and reflect 'PROFITABILITY'.<br><br>The successor can only continue with the show, and the last man at the helm left with no more assets to dispose off, will have to think smart and pray that the cash that have been realised with all the past Assets Sales would have been put to better use - so as to achieve REAL PROFITABILITY. </blockquote>Selling off assets to reinvest isn't "window dressing". If by wat u say, then buying over assets should be considered as a "loss" too ? Selling off assets only increases the companies' liquid money, but it will not be considered as a profit unless they sell it off at a higher price then they buy it in.<br><br>DO u think in auditing, there is a loophole whereby when u buy in assets, it is not a loss while selling off assets is a profit ? In tat case if I am the CEO of a company, I will sell off all my companies asset (selling thus PROFIT) using the name of my subsidiary companies (buying is not loss), which transfer the asset back to the main company  (Since I control the companies I can do tat). Than I can earn any amount of money, maybe a few hundred trillion of dollars, depending on how often I transfer the name of the assets.<br><br>If tat asset doesn't help them or earn them any cash, I don't think there is a problem selling them off to reinvest in other areas. Such is the problem of economics, u cannot expect all your investment to perform as expected. It is the same for politics, u cannot expect all your policies to work.<br><br><blockquote>Miracles are NOT IMPOSSIBLE, as miracles do happen in the Business World.<br><br>It takes alot of hardwork and lots of LUCK too.<br><br>It takes commitment and undying perseverance.<br><br>It also takes alot of intelligence.<br><br>It requires a good sense of BUSINESS ACUMEN - a sixth sense to smell, see, feel and get excited with an OPPORTUNITY that no one is able to see.<br><br>This is what makes the Bill Gates (Microsoft) and Steven Jobs (Apple), Sim Wong Hoo (Creative) and Goi Seng Hui (Tee Yih Jia).<br><br>They all started with NOTHING, and as NOBODY. </blockquote>Other than these few examples u had given, the rest of the CEOs in the world r at least a graduate. From the previous reply from sk, he mentioned about a person working from a cleaner to CEO of Macdonald. How many cleaners r there in Macdonald ? How many of them make it into being a CEO ? For every CEO with humble beginning, there is at least a million other people with the same humble beginning but cannot excel as much.

If u need to develop people at an early age for future crucial needs, wat other guage do u have ?<br><br>Look at all the politicians out there in this world, which one of them aren't remarkable in their studies ? I guess the only names u can come out with is Arnold.<br><br><blockquote><br>To the credit of the Singapore Government, who had the decency to turn around - (and seemingly following the solutions proposed by SDP Dr CSJ's book written 10 years ago) - and are changing the education policy with a less emphasis on examination oriented achievements.<br><br>The Government is reviewing policies and giving schools the option of dropping the 'O' and 'A' Levels, and finding new creative ways to TRULY EDUCATE our Future Generation of Potential Leaders.<br><br>The Government has now decided to turn around from their skewed policy of having a limited quota of graduands from our only TWO Universities in Singapore; and have suddenly decided to place emphasis on KNOWLEDGE and EXPERTISE.<br><br>The past skewed policy of limited university graduates have been followed for the last 40 years (from the 1950's), even when there have been protests in the manner that the Government were limiting entries into local universities - especially with the imposing of SUITABILITY CERTIFICATES (politically motivated - after strong University Student's Union activities in Politics) before one is allowed to enter universities.<br><br>The government had always feared the nightmare of larger pool of university graduates with trained critical mind that the economy cannot absorb.<br><br>This fear rides parallel with the LKY's philosophy of 'Dull the Mind by Filling the Stomach'.<br><br>How can one 'Dull an Educated and Critically Trained MInd, when the Stomach has Difficulty in being Filled' ? </blockquote>The policy of limiting the people in the university is an old policy. In the past, most other countries also limit the number of people into the university too. In the past very few people get a degree in almost every country too. Is tis something only singapore display ? In the past, is it a time where manufacturing is important or knowledge is important ?<br><br>U seems eager to complain about old policies made in the past using the new found knowledge u have now. Is tat fair ? Does everyone know wat will happened in future ? During the times when the policy is implemented, it is illogical for them to do it ?<br><br><blockquote><br>Does a President's Scholar (or any returning Scholar) need to compete for any job in Government ?<br><br>They are led to any Government Job of their own choosing (within reason), unless their training and aptitude is seen to be needed elsewhere that the Government feel is more suitable for both their mutual benefit.<br><br>The Scholar will only need to compete with his own shadow, and until there is any major disaster in his hands that he is incapable of dealing with, his career is almost assured.<br><br>Compared to a 'scholar material' that enters the Private Sector, the President's Scholar position in Government is a 'walk-in-the-park'.<br><br>Many local corporations will give a 'scholar material' candidate a very short learning period, and is expected to perform within THREE MONTHS with a reasonable BOTTOM LINE.<br><br>Ever heard of CITIBANK's high pressure environment at the Top ? </blockquote>How does large companies treat their own returning scholars ? They also give it an acclerated route too. True, if they don't perform in 3 months, they get condemn. However if they perform well, they get to climb much faster and higher than other normal workers.<br><br>The Gov scholars may get an assured position caring little about performance. But then if they don't perform, will they be able to get into the <strong>ranks of ministers</strong> ? U may heard of Gov scholars getting the accelerated route into the ranks of at least a colonel early. However it gets much harder than tis after tat. They have to be made into Brigadier general, working under the minister of defense then gradually work up to become a minister. (giving an example if the scholars choose defence) Do u think one with no talent nor performance can made it so far ? Getting a quick route to a colonel is only the beginning. Trying to work up after tat is difficult. They will faced better competitors and had to really show performance in order to be promoted.<br><br>Thus I ask tis question, if the minister start working up in a private firm instead, will he be less successful and not earn as much when they work in politics ?<br><br><blockquote>You seem to be fixated with the term 'C.O.E' - which seems to hang over from our last cross-exchange some months ago in 2003.<br><br>The term 'C.O.E.' is supposed to be Certificate Of Entitlement for cars.<br><br>The correct term that you should be using is 'C.E.O.' - which actually means CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. </blockquote>Is just a small spelling error and u made a paragraph about it ?

COORDINATING and MAKING DECISIONS r some of the most important and hardest skill for human to acquire. These class of people r the one tat made the most money, thus became the real talents in the world. Isn't "Bill Gates (Microsoft) and Steven Jobs (Apple), Sim Wong Hoo (Creative) and Goi Seng Hui (Tee Yih Jia)" just plainly "attended to by an army of supporting staff "now ?

So wat is your point then ?<br><br><blockquote><strong>Ecellent</strong> academic results from 'hard work' that shows 'commitment and undying perseverance' does not necessarily help a Scholar to be a successful person in any other fields.<br><br>Their success in academia may confirm a certain degree of intelligence or capacity to learn, store and retrieve information, but not necessarily make every excellent Academic understand every complicated theories. </blockquote>BTW u had made a spelling error on the word excellent... should I write a para about it ? Hmm...<br><br>If u agree people tat r good in their studies have the following traits, then will u agree people tat failed utterly in studies, <strong>generally</strong> speaking will shows they have a poorer abilities of the above ?<br><br><blockquote>Neither does it take a person with excellent academic results to appreciate, understand, and cope with competition, and responding to excel over competition. </blockquote>If u know a scholar well, u will know tat they compare their performance with other people regularly. Studying is actually a competition among the students. Who is performing better ? a person getting a B while the average grade of the exam is F of a person with B while the average grade of the exam is A* ? U sure in studies there is not competition at all ?<br><br><blockquote>The <strong>efforts</strong> of a 'Scholar' is no different from that of a 'non-scholar'.<br><br>The difference is only in the Size of Financial Value in the achievements or the failures that can be attributed to the Scholar, or to the non-scholar.<br><br>The Scholar can make multi-million dollar blunders - as in decisions to invest in a Hard Disk Drive business when it is a sunset industry - and the money is not necessarily his or HER own. </blockquote>But then the <strong>ability</strong> between a scholar and a non scholar is different. Or at least more the ability of a scholar is more easily detectable. If someone has to make multi million decisions, who will u choose to make it ? Scholars or non scholars ?<br><br><blockquote>By your standard, late starters like Albert Einstein would not have a chance in Life.<br><br>Bill Gates would have been shown the door, and Steve Jobs would not even get to bite his Apple.<br><br>Little wonder that Sim Wong Hoo, a Polytechnic qualified technician, could not get any support from DBS Bank or EDB, and had to start his business in the USA.<br><br>Goi Seng Hoi was also a technician, servicing machines before he was offered the opportunity of a Life time to buy over the business that bought the machines he had designed, built, and maintained.<br><br>Academic results is only a small window to a person's ability.<br><br>It is the ATTITUDE and APTITUDE of a person - towards ALL THINGS - that makes a person successful in meeting all the CHALLENGES FACED IN LIFE. </blockquote>Sure it is. But if u r a company recruiting new people, how do u know who has the ATTITUDE and APTITUDE required ? Though studies may not be an effective guage, there is no other guage we can rely on. Telling me all these stories above is pointless. My question is if A and B, both with no working experiences are seeking a job, how will u chose who is more capable ? From wat I know, most people will choose qualification. Wat will u choose ?<br><br><blockquote>Will you consider Bush and Blair remarkable in their studies ?<br><br>How about Saddam Hussein, Idi Amin ?<br>Suharto ? Megawati ? Mrs Aquino ? Thaksin ?<br><br>They are not small time politicians, but political leaders of their respective countries. Were they remarkable in their studies ? </blockquote>From wat I knew, Blair is a lawyer. Bush is a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School in 1975. Thanksin has a doctorate in his hand too.<br><br>http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/gwbbio.html   # Bush<br>http://www.britannia.com/bios/blair.html                   # Blair<br>http://www.encyclopedia4u.com/t/thaksin-shinawatra.html    #Thaksin<br><br>Of course there were politician tat were poorly educated. They rise from their ranks because they r great soldiers. Saddam Hussein, Suharto and Mao Te Tong r examples. R they good politicians ?<br><br><blockquote><br>This 'Old Policy' of limiting the number of people into the Singapore University had been stubbornly followed by the Government for too long, and has affected too many Singaporeans to spend life savings to send their children to be educated in overseas Universities.<br><br>The 'Old Policy' was POLITICALLY and ECONOMICALLY MOTIVATED to achieve the undeclared agenda of the Government, but made quite obvious in their public actions - such as the implementation of the Suitability Certificate, the limited quota for certain courses, the manipulation of cut-off points for certain popular courses to redirect interests into areas that meet manpower demand from the Economy.<br><br>What is the purpose with 'Knowledge' but to improve one's ability to handle the challenges in Life ? Life will encompass all areas including economics that cover commerce, and industry.<br><br>We are back into one full circle, having returned to the economic malaise that we faced during independence - CREATING JOBS FOR SINGAPOREANS.<br><br>Yet, this time around, the Government seems to be awakened that with a LARGER NUMBER of MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE PEOPLE, Singapore stand a better chance to RUN the LONGER TERM RACE.<br><br>We now have more Universities, but Polytechnic Students upon graduation, remain blocked in further studies in local universities - even when ESTABLISHED Overseas Universities accept the qualification of our Polytechnic GRADUATES. </blockquote>Holding the old policy for too longÂ… is it true ? Even if it is, is it easy to pull out of an existing policy at the precise moment ?<br><br>Note we too have to improve on the quality of our 2 UÂ’s in order they be recognized as reputable University. How do people guage whether is a university good or not ? One criteria, is the number of students being selected from the total number of people applying for it. Tis is important as it gauges the standard of the students in the university. The 2 Singapore University always has a bad score for tis item because there r TOO LITTLE people here. The 2 Universities can churn out thousands of students a year, which probably make up 10-20% of all population born tat year. The ratio is already 20%, which is too high. It is the school policy to selectively pick people so tat they can become world class university. If u fail to get a place, it just means u arenÂ’t good enough for tis university. The university do chooses graduate from polytechnics too. However u must be good enough to be selected. In my knowledge, when poly graduates r going into NTU engineering, they r already sinking heavily as they canÂ’t cope with their studies there.<br><br>Reputable university ? I want to know if they can get into FAMOUS university since the reputation of the university in Singapore arenÂ’t tat bad either. Can poly students get into Harvard or Tokyo or Beijing or Oxford university ? Why donÂ’t u tell me the names of the reputable university tat accept people from our poly ?<br>[/quote]</div>

Your previous position is on the fact tat <blockquote>minister</blockquote> don't deserved the pay they r getting because they were <blockquote>helped by army of staffs</blockquote>. Even the examples like Bill Gate u had given r taking multi million profit solely on doing the job tat minister r doing now.
