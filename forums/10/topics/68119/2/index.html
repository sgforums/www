What a great debate!<br><br>Well, to add to the sub-topic about politics, we're going to add another 3 more ministers to our cabinet.

I have met and seen Dr Ng Eng Hen, he's quite a nice guy, when I was in army he was COA(I think) not too sure what his highest ranking position was in the army before he left to the private sector.<br><br>Well, back to the topic of wage reform, there are more reports showing that govt saying that wage reform might not be suitable for all companies. But they definitely did hit a touchy subject of AWS. A lot of people believe that AWS (known as Annual Wage and Supplement, in case stupidissmart mixes it up with something else) is something owed to them. There's a writeup in the Forum today about it, it will be interesting to see what what the govt says.<br></div>

Other fighting to be a prime minister, people with talents get to be appreciated and climb up the corporate ladder. Does it stop u from becoming a minister in singapore ? And does LHL really perform miserably ? Which other minister deserved be promoted to Primie Minister instead of him ? Does Madam Ho Ching failed to showed performance ? As wat u all had mentioned she manage to control so many firms within the short timeframe.

Americans have four star generals, Marines and air craft carriers while we don't. In singapore, master sergeant r meant for "condemn" case.

We r already faring poorer than them since their gov consists of more capable people than us. To be able to be equal or excel them, we have to attract the top <strong>0.1%</strong> of our country.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>In your post on Page 1, 08 February 2004 Â· 02:00 PM - you had asked : 'Thus I ask tis question, if the minister start working up in a private firm instead, will he be less successful and not earn as much when they work in politics ?' </blockquote>U totally missed wat I am trying to say ! I am telling u tat MINISTER will earn their MINISTER level salaries one way or another. They will still get their minister level pay EVEN if they remain to work in their own chosen field. So why the sore eyes over their pay ? If they doesn't work as minister, they aren't going to drop down and become poor. They will still be very much remains the same.<br><br><blockquote>If you believe that there is a lack of talent in Singapore - which the Government has try so hard to make you believe - then there is little I can do to change the self-doubt that you have of yourself. </blockquote>I do not believe in the proportion of talent in singapore. I believe in the LACK of people in singapore. Our population r so small yet we have to remain competitive with regards to other bigger countries. Tis is the same case as in Olympics or other bigger sporting events. Countries with bigger population have a bigger advantage over countries with a smaller population.<br><br><blockquote>Keep counting, if you are able to keep your numbers intact, as well as you have managed the idiosyncratic slant of your thoughts.<br><br>Everyone makes 'spelling error', some have a purposefully weak inclination, while others make honest effort in new directions.<br><br>Some seems to have a knack for errors that one cannot discern if it is willfully made, or part of a pun - as in 'SENTIMENTS' when the intended meaning was 'SEDIMENTS' .<br><br>It takes some ingenious effort to make multiple errors.</blockquote>4.<br><br><blockquote>You try very hard to be clever, but you conveniently forget to consider some KEY WORDS in my post - RICH BACKGROUND.<br><br>Is this another mistaken 'typo error' of the mind ?<br><br>If a strong person is RICH and can afford vitamins, health food, personal gym equipment, and specialist instructor - do you think he can benefit and IMPROVE his performance OVER a poorer strong person ? Is this not a HEADSTART of the Rich over the Poor ? </blockquote>So in the end, u not only confirm your stand tat rich people get better at their studies, u also state tat rich people get to win in all event, including fist fights. So poor people will always be losers while rich people be successful in all their endeavours ? I am glad tat people with such a twisted stand r not a majority here.<br><br><blockquote>You are now trying to make a futile justification in the wrong use of my reference, by quoting it 'out of context', to suit your new position from that previously made.<br><br>Your use of these persons - who proved you wrong, and that miracles do exist - was to equate them as having supporting staff to help them to be successful; and hence, the Ministers deserve the same supporting staff to be prove their success, and so deserve their high Ministerial Pay.<br><br>You fail to note that these MIRACLE MAKERS had STARTED their business as NOBODY and NO SUPPORT.<br><br>Your Post on Page 1 08 February 2004 Â· 01:24 AM:<br>Isn't "Bill Gates (Microsoft) and Steven Jobs (Apple), Sim Wong Hoo (Creative) and Goi Seng Hui (Tee Yih Jia)" just plainly "attended to by an army of supporting staff "now ? Without tis "army of supporting staff", can they get tat far ? </blockquote>First, I got to say u seems to have missed one of my posting on 8th Feb 2004 0152PM.<br><br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=post_display&amp;post_id=1575081<br><br>There u will find my stand about your miracles<br><br>Initially u say tat minister do not deserve their pay because they r just "helped by a army of staffs". They don't even have to prepare their own speech. Wat I am saying is tat isn't tat wat all high wage earners do ? Your "miracle workers" r all helped by "army of staffs" too now isn't it ? Do u think they prepare their own speech themselves ? Wat is the wrong of using them for tis scenario ? They may have started off as nobody, but so r most minister in singapore too (except for LHL). They started off the same and ended up the same. SO why discirminate them only ?<br><br><blockquote>Now you are taking a DIFFERENT line of argument.<br><br>You had previously posted that MINISTERS also MAKE PROFIT OF THE MARKET PLACE. </blockquote>Read carefully. When have I ever SAID tat ?<br><br><blockquote>Ministers DO NOT MAKE ANY PROFIT OF THE MARKET PLACE.<br><br>The unfortunate and more accurate description is that the MINISTERS are parasites to the environment and systems that they imposed onto the Market Place.<br><br>It is the BUSINESSMEN that make the PROFIT, which the MINISTERS will TAX, and doing it so efficiently through all kinds of Direct and Indirect Taxes to enlarge the Government Treasury</blockquote>Tis is your initial reply. U state tat just because MINISTER do not earn any profit from market, they don't deserve their pay. Well, firemen and police don't earn anything from the MARKET, should they get a pay ? Everyone has an important role to play. Why only reward people tat earn money from market place ? Minister job is not easy, an it has nothing to do with increasing revenues etc. They have a lot of other tasks like MANAGING big organisation like SAF, Police and Civil Defences. DO they not deserve pay ?<br><br></div>
