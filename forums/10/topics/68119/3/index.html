            <div class='col-md body'>My purpose of this topic was to see and be open about suggestions by the people to the government. Lets just say this forum is monitored by our kind parental government. They monitor almost every media circulation around the world and most imtportantly the ones here.<br><br>My view is through the stand of a neoclassical economics and sound financials, the wage revamp can be a temporary solution which is what the government might want you to think. However, if implemented, will be permanent. IE, when the economy is doing bad, just cut out the rest of the pay package and just give you basic wage. It makes the job easier for GLCs to do pay cuts and in SIA example, just a simple reduction in pay for the pilots. No more agruements by unions. Lets just say SIA is the only union that complains, the rest are controlled.<br><br>This makes the governments job easier to do so. However, like most things in life, you have to look at pass examples and see if they work. We have to move with the times and change our industry if needed. IE for the States, they have tried their best to keep their steel industry sector as it employed over 300,000 workers however it dies a slow death as they just are'nt cost effective against other countries. It does not mean we have to be paid less...<br><br>Thus, if we suck at doing something, we have to move on... The furtue of SIA is at stake due to low cost air carriers, they foresee luckily as the living example of the US bankrupted air carriers suffered when budget air carriers came about. However, there is a balance, longer the distance to travel people are more likely to pay more. Bascially, you can tell how much air carriers in the past earned as their profit margins were 3 or 4 folds.<br><br>Basically, as the people, we have to work harder and strive to get the benefit from doing so. However, we have sectors like the semi conductors whereby most of the workers are m'sians, this means there is captial outflow out of singapore. What this means is that money is not spent in Singapore but outside, thus SIngapore does not get any benefits.<br><br>Its hopeful that we are getting more involved into biotechnology as this will be the next bubble to live on. As the baby boomers, who are reaching old age, they want to live longer. And with bio engr, we can look towards nanotechnology to live longer. And as they say, a moment longer in one's life is priceless. Singapore's last trump card can be based on this. Trump card, this is a term I use, you can easily think of the trump cards Singapore has tried to use.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My purpose of this topic was to see and be open about suggestions by the people to the government. Lets just say this forum is monitored by our kind parental government. They monitor almost every media circulation around the world and most imtportantly the ones here.<br><br>My view is through the stand of a neoclassical economics and sound financials, the wage revamp can be a temporary solution which is what the government might want you to think. However, if implemented, will be permanent. IE, when the economy is doing bad, just cut out the rest of the pay package and just give you basic wage. It makes the job easier for GLCs to do pay cuts and in SIA example, just a simple reduction in pay for the pilots. No more agruements by unions. Lets just say SIA is the only union that complains, the rest are controlled.<br><br>This makes the governments job easier to do so. However, like most things in life, you have to look at pass examples and see if they work. We have to move with the times and change our industry if needed. IE for the States, they have tried their best to keep their steel industry sector as it employed over 300,000 workers however it dies a slow death as they just are'nt cost effective against other countries. It does not mean we have to be paid less...<br><br>Thus, if we suck at doing something, we have to move on... The furtue of SIA is at stake due to low cost air carriers, they foresee luckily as the living example of the US bankrupted air carriers suffered when budget air carriers came about. However, there is a balance, longer the distance to travel people are more likely to pay more. Bascially, you can tell how much air carriers in the past earned as their profit margins were 3 or 4 folds.<br><br>Basically, as the people, we have to work harder and strive to get the benefit from doing so. However, we have sectors like the semi conductors whereby most of the workers are m'sians, this means there is captial outflow out of singapore. What this means is that money is not spent in Singapore but outside, thus SIngapore does not get any benefits.<br><br>Its hopeful that we are getting more involved into biotechnology as this will be the next bubble to live on. As the baby boomers, who are reaching old age, they want to live longer. And with bio engr, we can look towards nanotechnology to live longer. And as they say, a moment longer in one's life is priceless. Singapore's last trump card can be based on this. Trump card, this is a term I use, you can easily think of the trump cards Singapore has tried to use.<br><br>FYI Btw, they reduced corporate tax from 22 to 20% but our individual tax rate is still 22%.<br><br></div>
