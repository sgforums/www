            <div class='col-md body'>After reading 3/4 through Bill Clinton's My Life autobiography and watching Viggo Mortenson's performance as Aragorn again in the LOTR trilogy, I can't help but compare these two leaders with our MIW leader- or supposedly- Lee Hsien Loong.<br><br>Firstly, it's simple. When I read through Bill Clinton's book, I feel inspired, I feel motivated and I can't help but incline to agree with it- regardless whether his opinion is faulty or not. The thing that struck me the most was the way he wrote.<br><br>Instead of writing and expressing his opinions in a far away, his words are like a fireside one-on-one conversation. Close, no less engaging and extremely honest. It just makes people feel like they want to talk to you for ages. That's Bill Clinton's strength throughout. His chrisma shines through out and his honesty just enhances it to no end.<br><br>No wonder many Americans went to buy his book when it was released just a year ago.<br><br>Now to Aragorn, the King Elssar of Gondor, the mythical Kingdom of men in Middle Earth. Although he's a product and character of a fantasy book, that doesn't make him less a leader than he is. Because although he's one, the personality of Aragorn is no less than any heroic general or King of the yester year.<br><br>Whether is it the Aragorn of the LOTR book or the Aragorn that was done by Viggo Mortenson in the films, Aragorn is just unbelievably chrismatic. Although he didn't consider himself to be able to lead men at the beginning, as the time went by, he began to realise that he was not only able to do that, he was able to inspire his men to fight till the last man. And he didn't just talk and did nothing, he was at the forefront of everything.<br><br>From the siege of Helm's deep, when Rohan was on the verge of collapse under Saruman's orc army, to the summoning of Rohan armies to help Gondor(his own Kingdom), to lead Legolas and Gimli into the Paths of the Dead(despite the great dread of his own and his close friends), to lead the Dead Army to relieve the Great Siege of Minas Tirth and finally the confrontation with Sauron and his own army at the Black Gates- he lead, he fought and he inspired. Everyone in his army loved him. The Fellowship that was with him fought with him. Even Gandalf was inspired by Aragorn to make the last stand.<br><br>Anyone who listened to the speech that Aragorn made(in the film version) would have been inspired to fight for him. Even the audience was impressed. I listened to it and I just wanted to fight for him! And considering that it's only a film and not real says it all.<br><br>Bill Clinton and Aragorn are true leaders who not only inspire people through sheer chrisma but also by the love they have demonstrated to their peoples. They serve a purpose that was to unite people, not divide people. They represent an age where not only honour and love are respected, but also returned in happiness. They were also people who prefer peace, and not war. Aragorn fought <span style="font-style: italic;">against</span> Sauron to bring peace to the people of Middle Earth. Bill Clinton fought hard with ultra rightists to bring America and the world together in hopes for peace in our own earth.<br><br>The question now is asked: Is Lee Hsien Loong comparable to these men? Or is he just a mere shadow of the people I have mentioned? Or is he even worse than these two- one who cannot even hold a candle to these great men?<br><br>Only people can tell- and as far as I'm concerned, not many can agree that Lee Hsien Loong is indeed comparable to the likes of Bill Clinton and Aragorn.

            <div class='col-md body'>Aragorn may have been a leader, but he was some distance from the actual battle. The real battle was the destruction of the One Ring. For that, we have to thank Frodo Baggins. He had been through worse than Aragorn. Frodo needed the help of someone familiar with the terrain in Mordor, only to be betrayed by him. Fortunately he had Samwise Gamgee at his side throughout. For that, Frodo is more admirable, because he shoulders a heavier burden. The One Ring represents the yoke of temptation, and the Ring bearer has succeeded in not succumbing to its corrupting influence.<br><br>For me, someone who does what is correct instead of what is easy deserves more respect.</div>
