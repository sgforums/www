              Courts abuse the law to favor the Lee Kuan Yew family in a commercial
              case. Skandinaviska, Mizuho, Bayerische, Sumitomo vs APBS</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Singapore
              Law Watch, a Singapore Law Report, www.singaporelawwatch.sg, of August
              31, 2009 has this judgment in the case of four foreign banks,
              Plaintiffs, against the Singapore company Asia Pacific Breweries
              (Singapore) Pte Ltd, Defendant. The four Plaintiff foreign banks were
              Skandanaviska Enskilda Banken, Mizuho Corporation Bank, Bayerische Hypo
              Und Vereinsbank Aktiengesellschaft and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
              Corporation. <br><br>The case involved the four banks suing the Asia
              Pacific Breweries for over a $100 million for moneys lent to it,
              through it's Finance Manager Chia Teck Leng who made off with it. <br><br>Anyone
              who knows Singapore would have been able to accurately predict the
              outcome of this lawsuit merely looking at Asia Pacific Breweries
              (Singapore) Pte Ltd. A search on it's website www.apb.com shows it is
              joint venture with Fraser and Neave Ltd and Heineken. For anyone who
              knows Singapore, a search on Fraser and Neave's website
              www.fraserandneave.com would have given the answer away immediately.
              It's director is none other than Lee Hsien Yang, the son of Singapore's
              strongman Lee Kuan Yew. No prizes for the right answer here! Asia
              Pacific Breweries won. The banks lost.<br><br>There are many outside
              Singapore, who wrongly think that Lee Kuan Yew only abuses the law in
              human rights cases; that in commercial cases there is impartiality.
              Singaporeans of course know better. This case clearly shows that not
              only in human rights cases, as if it is not bad enough, but in every
              type of case, the entire Singapore judiciary is corrupt to the core.
              They always favor the Lee Kuan Yew family or the Singapore government
              against everyone else. <br><br>In this case, giving the case to the
              foreigh banks would mean Lee Kuan Yew's son's company losing over a
              $100 million. Sucn an eventuality is unacceptable in Lee Kuan Yew's
              Singapore, never mind where justice lies. <br><br>And let this case be
              a warning to all foreigners; foreign banks, foreign companies and
              foreigners with money in Singapore. The Singapore legal system is
              corrupt. The Singapore's courts will shamelessly abuse the law to favor
              Lee Kuan Yew or the Singapore government against anyone else. It is
              impossible to get justice in the island when you are facing either the
              Lee family and their interests, or the Singapore government. And keep
              in mind, the Lee family and the government's interests stretch
              throughout Singapore and in every industry you can think of. Therefore
              beware your money and your interests in Singapore. In a dispute, there
              is no guarantee that you will see justice, as this case so clearly
              shows.<br><br>And what is more, the judge in this case was Belinda Ang
              Saw Ean, the same judge about whom I wrote which landed me in a
              Singapore jail last year. Need we say more? You of course know that in
              that case of defamation, she had ordered Dr. Chee Soon Juan to pay Lee
              Kuan Yew more than $400,000.00; as if money grows on trees; merely for
              criticizing him in a newsletter. Not just that, she refused to allow
              Dr. Chee Soon Juan to introduce any witnesses at his trial, deciding
              the case in her private chambers instead! <br><br>Another tell tale
              sign to predict the winner in this case are the lawyers. Asia Pacific
              Breweries Singapore was represented by Davinder Singh and Hri Kumar,
              Lee Kuan Yew's favorite lawyers and the favorite law firm to boot. <br><br>Belinda's
              judgement in this case is very long, 110 pages to be exact. But there
              is no need to read it all. The first few facts would be good enough to
              tell anyone that the banks should have won, not Asia Pacific Breweries
              (Singapore). Chia Teck Leng was the Finance Manager lawfully employed
              by the Asia Breweries. He also happened to be a habitual gambler. He
              was at all times working for the company. The company's documents
              acknowledged that he was the Finance Manager. The company's documents
              authorized him to make bank loans. In every way he had, what one would
              expect, the powers of a Finance Manger of a company.<br><br>These four
              banks, one Scandinavian, one German and 2 Japanese had no way of
              knowing that Chia was dishonest. And as expected of any bank, they took
              the normal precautions of ensuring that the company passed resolutions
              for each loan, that the articles and memorandum indicated he was still
              the Finance Manager and other routine documents for security. From the
              entire judgement, there is nothing to indicate that these banks had
              acted in any way improper or negligent. <br><br>Even a boy can tell
              you this. Asia Breweries was entirely responsible for their actions of
              it's Finance Manager. If he happened to be a crook, it is they who were
              responsible. These 4 foreign banks were entirely innocent, as they did
              not know Chia was a crook. How could they? They were an innocent
              contracting party. <br><br>But you see, everything changes in
              Singapore when Lee Kuan Yew or any of his family members are involved.
              In Singapore, the Lee Family never loses. How could this judge allow
              these foreign banks to win even if she wanted to. But knowing what she
              did to Dr. Chee Soon Juan when Lee Kuan yew sued him for defamation, we
              know also know that she is corrupt to the core. <br><br>This is how
              Belinda Ang, Lee Kuan Yew's judge twists the law and the evidence to
              favor her master Lee Kuan Yew. Her 110 page judgement starts off with
              the sentence "Chia Teck Leng was an inveterate gambler who
              unremittingly resorted to cheating and forgery in order to fuel and
              sustain his gambling addiction". Thoughout the long judgement she makes
              repeated reference to his dishonesty, trying very hard to justify her
              decision which clearly goes against the grain. And her reason for
              giving the case to Lee Kuan Yew's son's company, believe it or not,was
              to say that the banks had not used due dilingence when giving the
              loans, when nothing in the evidence indicates that! It is simply a
              biased judgment written by a baised judge. <br><br>Singapore's
              Minister for Law, K Shanmugam, and others in this government have been
              trying very hard to throw a veil over the real goings on there, arguing
              that there is rule of law in Singapore. For anyone who knows Singapore
              will tell you, nothing can be further from the truth. Your transactions
              and assets in Singapore are not safe and you may lose everything if you
              are not careful, as these four foreign banks have realized. <br><br>It
              is not just criminal law and the law of human rights that Lee Kuan Yew
              abuses in Singapore. And it is not just Singaporeans whom he abuses.
              Foreigners fare no better in Lee Kuan Yew's courts.

              <h3>Singapore Courts abuse the law to favor the Lee Kuan Yew family in a commercial case. Skandinaviska, Mizuho, Bayerische, Sumitomo vs APBS</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Singapore Law Watch, a Singapore Law Report, www.singaporelawwatch.sg, of August 31, 2009 has this judgment in the case of four foreign banks, Plaintiffs, against the Singapore company Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd, Defendant. The four Plaintiff foreign banks were Skandanaviska Enskilda Banken, Mizuho Corporation Bank, Bayerische Hypo Und Vereinsbank Aktiengesellschaft and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.<br><br>The case involved the four banks suing the Asia Pacific Breweries for over a $100 million for moneys lent to it, through it's Finance Manager Chia Teck Leng who made off with it.<br><br>Anyone who knows Singapore would have been able to accurately predict the outcome of this lawsuit merely looking at Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd. A search on it's website www.apb.com shows it is joint venture with Fraser and Neave Ltd and Heineken. For anyone who knows Singapore, a search on Fraser and Neave's website www.fraserandneave.com would have given the answer away immediately. It's director is none other than Lee Hsien Yang, the son of Singapore's strongman Lee Kuan Yew. No prizes for the right answer here! Asia Pacific Breweries won. The banks lost.<br><br>There are many outside Singapore, who wrongly think that Lee Kuan Yew only abuses the law in human rights cases; that in commercial cases there is impartiality. Singaporeans of course know better. This case clearly shows that not only in human rights cases, as if it is not bad enough, but in every type of case, the entire Singapore judiciary is corrupt to the core. They always favor the Lee Kuan Yew family or the Singapore government against everyone else.<br><br>In this case, giving the case to the foreigh banks would mean Lee Kuan Yew's son's company losing over a $100 million. Sucn an eventuality is unacceptable in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore, never mind where justice lies.<br><br>And let this case be a warning to all foreigners; foreign banks, foreign companies and foreigners with money in Singapore. The Singapore legal system is corrupt. The Singapore's courts will shamelessly abuse the law to favor Lee Kuan Yew or the Singapore government against anyone else. It is impossible to get justice in the island when you are facing either the Lee family and their interests, or the Singapore government. And keep in mind, the Lee family and the government's interests stretch throughout Singapore and in every industry you can think of. Therefore beware your money and your interests in Singapore. In a dispute, there is no guarantee that you will see justice, as this case so clearly shows.<br><br>And what is more, the judge in this case was Belinda Ang Saw Ean, the same judge about whom I wrote which landed me in a Singapore jail last year. Need we say more? You of course know that in that case of defamation, she had ordered Dr. Chee Soon Juan to pay Lee Kuan Yew more than $400,000.00; as if money grows on trees; merely for criticizing him in a newsletter. Not just that, she refused to allow Dr. Chee Soon Juan to introduce any witnesses at his trial, deciding the case in her private chambers instead!<br><br>Another tell tale sign to predict the winner in this case are the lawyers. Asia Pacific Breweries Singapore was represented by Davinder Singh and Hri Kumar, Lee Kuan Yew's favorite lawyers and the favorite law firm to boot.<br><br>Belinda's judgement in this case is very long, 110 pages to be exact. But there is no need to read it all. The first few facts would be good enough to tell anyone that the banks should have won, not Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore). Chia Teck Leng was the Finance Manager lawfully employed by the Asia Breweries. He also happened to be a habitual gambler. He was at all times working for the company. The company's documents acknowledged that he was the Finance Manager. The company's documents authorized him to make bank loans. In every way he had, what one would expect, the powers of a Finance Manger of a company.<br><br>These four banks, one Scandinavian, one German and 2 Japanese had no way of knowing that Chia was dishonest. And as expected of any bank, they took the normal precautions of ensuring that the company passed resolutions for each loan, that the articles and memorandum indicated he was still the Finance Manager and other routine documents for security. From the entire judgement, there is nothing to indicate that these banks had acted in any way improper or negligent.<br><br>Even a boy can tell you this. Asia Breweries was entirely responsible for their actions of it's Finance Manager. If he happened to be a crook, it is they who were responsible. These 4 foreign banks were entirely innocent, as they did not know Chia was a crook. How could they? They were an innocent contracting party.<br><br>But you see, everything changes in Singapore when Lee Kuan Yew or any of his family members are involved. In Singapore, the Lee Family never loses. How could this judge allow these foreign banks to win even if she wanted to. But knowing what she did to Dr. Chee Soon Juan when Lee Kuan yew sued him for defamation, we know also know that she is corrupt to the core.<br><br>This is how Belinda Ang, Lee Kuan Yew's judge twists the law and the evidence to favor her master Lee Kuan Yew. Her 110 page judgement starts off with the sentence "Chia Teck Leng was an inveterate gambler who unremittingly resorted to cheating and forgery in order to fuel and sustain his gambling addiction". Thoughout the long judgement she makes repeated reference to his dishonesty, trying very hard to justify her decision which clearly goes against the grain. And her reason for giving the case to Lee Kuan Yew's son's company, believe it or not,was to say that the banks had not used due dilingence when giving the loans, when nothing in the evidence indicates that! It is simply a biased judgment written by a baised judge.<br><br>Singapore's Minister for Law, K Shanmugam, and others in this government have been trying very hard to throw a veil over the real goings on there, arguing that there is rule of law in Singapore. For anyone who knows Singapore will tell you, nothing can be further from the truth. Your transactions and assets in Singapore are not safe and you may lose everything if you are not careful, as these four foreign banks have realized.<br><br>It is not just criminal law and the law of human rights that Lee Kuan Yew abuses in Singapore. And it is not just Singaporeans whom he abuses. Foreigners fare no better in Lee Kuan Yew's courts.

              <p><br>Again, Gopalan is putting the onus on APB to clean house on all its employees which is ridiculous to say the least. The four banks have the right to sue and the judge has the right to decline the lawsuit against an innocent party. Unless you would like to have a PI tail all employees even on their own freetime or leisure time, then APB doesn't not know that the Finance Manager,Chia, was an inveterate gambler until the bank came calling on loans due.</p>

              <p>Could the Finance Manager pass a Company Resolution by himself - without any second or third authorised signatory representing either the Board or the Executive Management ?</p>
              <p>If there exist a second or third signatory - is there collusion ?</p>
              <p>If no collusion exist - is there negligence on the part of the signatories for not checking the need or even the authencity of the loans application ?</p>
              <p>Under such circumstances, is there a miscarriage of justice in effect ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A company is responsible for the decisions and acts of its employees that it employs and empower with the authority, as much as it is responsible for the organisation and methods in the way business is conducted and authority distributed or concentrated.</p>
              <p>In this case, the Finance Manager - Chia - had "represented" or "mis-represented" APB in the loans application to the various banks.</p>
              <p>The loans were made on behalf of APB - not in the personal name of the Finance Manager.</p>
              <p>The banks transferred their loans into the legitimate bank accounts of APB.</p>
              <p>APB had taken criminal proceedings against its Finance Manager for criminal breach of trust on the company.</p>
              <p>Why should it take such actions against its employee - the Finance Manager, if the funds do not belong to APB ?</p>
              <p>If APB accused its employee for taking its money, why should it deny responsibility to the claims from the Banks ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is the case about the Finance Manager being a gambler ? </p>

              <p>This is a corporate matters, nothing to do with govt, tho govt may have a share in Asia brewery, but it is still a private corporate entities case, so let them settle among themselves, if the 4 banks felt that they cannot bang Asia Brewery here, they can go to any court of internation court to appeal..this is not even politic, and some ah ney are trying to link to it and mess up the whole picture, that is why i said, opposition dun provide solution, just trouble after trouble.</p>

              <p>one can definitely link business with politics. Just look at how US exert their political influence on Swiss govt to force UBS to disclosure clients data.</p>

              <p>i also did mention, they can go for appeal at higher court . politics is also one of the other way.</p>

              <p>That is intervention, the govt had all the rights to intervent for the purpose of the national secruity and the citizens they need to answer for it. Whereas, corporate need to answer to private shareholders. It is when corporate mgts, whom  in desparate situation, uses unethical business tactics, then the govt have to intervent and set it clear. The country govt created the Corporate Laws for the country to function and stay within the framework of the legal system.  </p>
