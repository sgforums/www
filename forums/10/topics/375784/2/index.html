              <p><br><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">And as expected of any bank, they took the normal precautions of ensuring that the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">company passed resolutions</span></span> for each loan, that the articles and memorandum indicated he was still the Finance Manager and other routine documents for security.</span></em></p>
              <p>Could the Finance Manager pass a Company Resolution by himself - without any second or third authorised signatory representing either the Board or the Executive Management ?</p>
              <p>If there exist a second or third signatory - is there collusion ?</p>
              <p>If no collusion exist - is there negligence on the part of the signatories for not checking the need or even the authencity of the loans application ?</p>
              <p>Under such circumstances, is there a miscarriage of justice in effect ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A company is responsible for the decisions and acts of its employees that it employs and empower with the authority, as much as it is responsible for the organisation and methods in the way business is conducted and authority distributed or concentrated.</p>
              <p>In this case, the Finance Manager - Chia - had "represented" or "mis-represented" APB in the loans application to the various banks.</p>
              <p>The loans were made on behalf of APB - not in the personal name of the Finance Manager.</p>
              <p>The banks transferred their loans into the legitimate bank accounts of APB.</p>
              <p>APB had taken criminal proceedings against its Finance Manager for criminal breach of trust on the company.</p>
              <p>Why should it take such actions against its employee - the Finance Manager, if the funds do not belong to APB ?</p>
              <p>If APB accused its employee for taking its money, why should it deny responsibility to the claims from the Banks ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is the case about the Finance Manager being a gambler ? </p>

              <p>So ATubby claims that being an inveterate gambler does not mean that such a person is not of sound character. But again, not one in the managment will know that the Finanace Manager has cooked the books to pass the Resolution Board until the yearly audit begins, so ATubby expects everyone to be a omninescent god to begin with. What kind of logic is that? The judge may have reservations on the case hence such a judgement in camera. Unless, ATubby is the external auditor for APB that financial year, I highly recommend that he cease speculation on the case.</p>

              <p>The question remains - was the case all about the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Finance Manager being a gambler</span></strong> - or was it about the rightful claim of the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">bank loans extended to APB</span></strong> on the basis of the Company Resolutions being passed for the loan applications made ?</p>
              <p>In any case, does a "hog" know the process of a Company Resolution being passed - and how many persons in authority will be involved ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How did the brilliant "hog" come up with such a "swei-siao" view that had him seeing the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">books cooked</span></em>" and could not be picked up "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">until the yearly audit begins</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did the "swei-siao-hog" missed the ChannelNewsAsia report that - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/1002223/1/.html">‘<em>Chia, who was a finance manager with APB, cheated four foreign banks of S$117 million between <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1999 and 2003</span> in the largest commercial fraud case here..</em>’ (*1) </a></p>
              <p>Obviously, someone at the Audit Firm did not perform with any diligence from 1999 to 2003 - or perhaps the "swei-siao-hog" had some vested interest to divert attention from the facts that prove to be so "swei-siao" to the interest of the "hog" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did the judge conduct the trial and gave her decision "<em><strong>in camera</strong></em>", or is the "swei-siao-hog" putting up another stunt in its bombastic "smoke and blanks" that only a "hog" is good at ?</p>
              <p>ChannelNewsAsia must be getting some special license to broadcast the result and have it posted even on the WWW despite the learned judge's intention of having the proceedings "<strong>in camera</strong>" as suggested by the "swei-siao-hog".</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/1002223/1/.html"><em>‘A High Court judge found that the two foreign banks were "very eager to start and develop a banking relationship" with APB, which has a reported huge cash reserve of over S$100 million.’ (*2)</em> </a></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/1002223/1/.html">‘The loans were considered relatively small and were regarded as a "door-opener" to future business opportunities. "From the view point of the banks, the advantages outweighed the risks," said Justice Belinda Ang.’ (*3) </a></p>
              <p>It is obvious that the "swei-siao-hog" is not as learned as the trial judge in her brilliant understanding of the events - with her comment that the banks were very eager to start and develop a banking relationship with APB.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the learned judge had recognised that the banks had transferred the monies to the Bank Accounts owned by APB, and not to the personal account of the Finance Manager.</p>
              <p>Obviously, ChannelNewsAsia did not make themselves to be so "swei-siao" except to report the truth that :-</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/1002223/1/.html"><em>‘SEB, HVB and two Japanese banks - Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and Mizuho Corporate Bank - then sued APB to recover the lost funds. They contended that Chia's acts were carried out in his capacity as APB finance manager and that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the company was bound to repay the loans</span>..’ (*4)</em> </a></p>
              <p>It is most probable that the simple mind of a "swei-siao-hog" cannot be expected to know that the money loaned to APB was based on the bank procedures having been met, and the banks were satisfied with the security of the loan being given to APB - and not the Finance Manager.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did the learned judge not take the position of the "swei-siao-hog"  that it is expected for the banks to be like "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">a omninescent god</span></em>" to know that Chia is cheating the Banks, and that the Documents and Company Resolutions were false ?</p>
              <p>Does it not require the 'swei-siao-hog" belief that one has "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">to be a omninescent god</span></em>" to know that - <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Chia in putting forward the forged documents as genuine was not acting within his actual authority, whether express or implied." </span></em>?</p>
              <p>Perhaps the "swei-siao-hog" should be the next Finance Manager at APB, and he can then enrich himself along the same lines taken by the Finance Manager.</p>
              <p>Afterall both are similarly "swei-siao" in the thinking compartment.</p>
