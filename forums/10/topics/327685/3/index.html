              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SPLIT SECOND:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I stayed in Aust a few years and there was this time i was doing
              a part time cash in hand job for a department store. It was huge
              store and they needed cleaners. But only two of us, one me ,
              another guy , a student from India cleaning the store. And we had
              shit loads to do for a meagre pay of $12 per hour, We had to clean
              and mop and buffer the whole store floor. The equiment given sucks
              and  it was very inefficient on the part of manpower cause
              such tedious 3 in one task had to be completed in 4 hours which we
              had to rush for time. If u look deeply into this case, they should
              have hire at least a min of 4 people to do it, one on each part of
              the cleaning process. But due to their stinginess in paying people,
              avoidance of going thru the hassle of workplace laws, they were
              exploiting those students who are looking to pay for their study
              expenses in AUS.</p>
              <p>and the manager was too fussy about being perfect. I told him if
              he wanted to have a perfect job, he should pay more and give more
              working hours. Generally its easier yo find fault with a job being
              done. I also told him he should have the sense that evetually no
              matter how much cleaning is done, dust and dirt are bound to appear
              after just 1 hour or after the store opens in the day for
              business.</p>
              <p>Finally i showed them the middle finger and left. Good thing for
              him i did not report him to worksafe ot other governing body or he
              will get fined for tax avoidance. My rationale was this:</p>
              <p>1) they are overloading us with work for a meagre pay.</p>
              <p>2) they could have saved money if they employed 4 people with
              $10 per hour pay.</p>
              <p>3) they could have avoided half f^cked job done due to the work
              overload</p>
              <p>4) it seems people always join and leave this place in it
              becoming unpopular and generally an exploitive place.</p>
              <p>5) Aus workplace legislations place emphasis on workplace ethics
              which this place clearly ignored.</p>
              <p>6) cash in hand job means u are  not covered in time of
              accidents or death</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I compare this place to many places in sg which overload workers
              for a meagre pay. Because firstly such exploitative behavouir
              causes friction between employer and employee. On the second, this
              place has no ethics to begin with.</p>

              <p>i don't know whether you are saying you were being explioted in oz while you were doing part time work there. but if it is, then have it ever occured to you that your predicament could be due to your communication skill? you seem to have problem making your point clear. nobody here seem to know whether you are saying there is lack of workplace ethics in sg or oz.</p>
