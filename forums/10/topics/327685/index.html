              <p>I stayed in Aust a few years and there was this time i was doing a part time cash in hand job for a department store. It was huge store and they needed cleaners. But only two of us, one me , another guy , a student from India cleaning the store. And we had shit loads to do for a meagre pay of $12 per hour, We had to clean and mop and buffer the whole store floor. The equiment given sucks and  it was very inefficient on the part of manpower cause such tedious 3 in one task had to be completed in 4 hours which we had to rush for time. If u look deeply into this case, they should have hire at least a min of 4 people to do it, one on each part of the cleaning process. But due to their stinginess in paying people, avoidance of going thru the hassle of workplace laws, they were exploiting those students who are looking to pay for their study expenses in AUS.</p>
              <p>and the manager was too fussy about being perfect. I told him if he wanted to have a perfect job, he should pay more and give more working hours. Generally its easier yo find fault with a job being done. I also told him he should have the sense that evetually no matter how much cleaning is done, dust and dirt are bound to appear after just 1 hour or after the store opens in the day for business.</p>
              <p>Finally i showed them the middle finger and left. Good thing for him i did not report him to worksafe ot other governing body or he will get fined for tax avoidance. My rationale was this:</p>
              <p>1) they are overloading us with work for a meagre pay.</p>
              <p>2) they could have saved money if they employed 4 people with $10 per hour pay.</p>
              <p>3) they could have avoided half f^cked job done due to the work overload</p>
              <p>4) it seems people always join and leave this place in it becoming unpopular and generally an exploitive place.</p>
              <p>5) Aus workplace legislations place emphasis on workplace ethics which this place clearly ignored.</p>
              <p>6) cash in hand job means u are  not covered in time of accidents or death</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I compare this place to many places in sg which overload workers for a meagre pay. Because firstly such exploitative behavouir causes friction between employer and employee. On the second, this place has no ethics to begin with.</p>

              <p>I worked in Japan and compared to here.. i feel like being exploit and underpaid according to the amount of works, benefit and professional without truth recognitions. More feel like a modern day slavery.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Japan, every season, these close to a week of public holidays above the usual holidays. Due to the wide specturm of cultural activities called "matsuri" (ç¥­ã‚Š). these tend to be 1 day holidays... The transportation from the point of your home to the office is fully sudsidised. In Japan.. the standard bonus system were rewarded 2 time per years.. which means, at least 2 months bouses instead of a tiny 1 month here... or sometime non if u're unlucky.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All in all.. in Japan even if u work hard.. u get the reward as u deserves unlike here. Morever Japan no doubt, high cost of living but mostly in major cities and the general wages were comparable at a normal salayman level. If u're professional of somewhat skill in various area.. these no problem for u to go through a life without fxxing worry about meeting ends meet unlike here. In here, its is high cost of living (every part of the island no where to run).</p>

              <p>They exploit me at 9 bucks an hour also. Working with Indians few months. Last day i call my kawan sekalian sit at the restaurant ordering glass of water. And while i finish up my dishes.. i trashed the kitchen, gave the chefs the middle finger and left without my pay. Never felt so good.. working for free. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Thats why they never reported me even though i smashed like a whole stack of washed dishes and tipped the rubbish bin upside down ..lol ... cause i can bring them to court. I dun mind working hard.. for shit pay given the circumstances. But working hard.. shit pay and shitty treatment.. and shitty racists comments, it didnt go too well with me.</p>
              <p>But u compare with most SE asian coutries , thier pay still way better then SG or MY .</p>
              <p>RM 2.00 pump attendent. vs NZD 12.00 bucks an hour pump attendent. Of course size of the sation, population .. demographic area etc..takes into accout,  but overall still pretty shitty by comparison. So i think i shouldnt have acted the way i did , but ... hey.. they shouldve exploited me subtely. haha</p>
              <p>I think TS case quite similiar. The cleaning part.. i work as storekeeper before also. Man.. the worst is when the container arrives at the warehouse. 50KG Red beans x100 bags.Rice 25 KG X200  , 10KG rice x 500 and other stuffs. lol.. I almost got crushed to death while stacking the 25 kg rice bags when it almost tipped and fall on me. hahaha</p>
              <p>The problem with these stingy ass employers is that , if you 'employee' can work as hard.. as good.. instead of giving u more pay or promoting u OR whatever that actually benefits everyone, they will start to cut cost and maximise your worth. So pretty much if u work as fast and as hard... they hire you , fire two dudes. So u are pretty much = 2 dudes working for the price of 1.</p>
              <p>Classic stingy ass employers modus operandi. Or should i say.. s.o.b employers. hehe</p>
              <p>Damn just writing about me makes me feel good at what i did.</p>

              <p>U are not getting my point. In AUST, if u working for a tax paying job, u can get at least $15 per hour. And adjusted to that country's living cost 12 bucks not that mch. Why must u compare with singapore where a plate of food costs $3 and in AUS it cost at least $6.</p>

              <p>againnot getting my point, firstly if i work in a proper tax paying job i can earn from $18-$25 p.H. and i dont need to go everyday + workplace welfare:</p>
              <p>average $20 p/h , i need to go for only 5 hours = $100. In order to earn $2000+ i need to go only 20 days per month ,</p>
              <p>Cash in hand job, low pay need to go everyday and no workplace welfare. And anytime job may stop.</p>
              <p>Also need time to study lah.I was in Uni, dont play a fool.  Everyday go work than how to study?</p>
