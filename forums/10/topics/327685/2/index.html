              <p>U are not getting my point. In AUST, if u working for a tax
              paying job, u can get at least $15 per hour. And adjusted to that
              country's living cost 12 bucks not that mch. Why must u compare
              with singapore where a plate of food costs $3 and in AUS it cost at

              <p>i study in aust back in late 90s. my kids and wife are in WA.</p>
              <p>but i am working in sg. yup, u got the pt, it just plain bad luck what u encounter in aust. Anyway, sg is not that bad, its work place ethics also depend on the type of industry u r in here in sg. not every company in sg sucks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>when u sign up for work in sg, u can always request what u want to be put into your employment contract. since i bet most of us are white color workers and not protected by union. u have to fight for your benefits. i bet the same apply in aust as well.</p>

              <p>They exploit me at 9 bucks an hour also. Working with Indians
              few months. Last day i call my kawan sekalian sit at the restaurant
              ordering glass of water. And while i finish up my dishes.. i
              trashed the kitchen, gave the chefs the middle finger and left
              without my pay. Never felt so good.. working for free. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Thats why they never reported me even though i smashed like a whole
              stack of washed dishes and tipped the rubbish bin upside down ..lol
              ... cause i can bring them to court. I dun mind working hard.. for
              shit pay given the circumstances. But working hard.. shit pay and
              shitty treatment.. and shitty racists comments, it didnt go too
              well with me.</p>
              <p>But u compare with most SE asian coutries , thier pay still way
              better then SG or MY .</p>
              <p>RM 2.00 pump attendent. vs NZD 12.00 bucks an hour pump
              attendent. Of course size of the sation, population .. demographic
              area etc..takes into accout,  but overall still pretty shitty
              by comparison. So i think i shouldnt have acted the way i did , but
              ... hey.. they shouldve exploited me subtely. haha</p>
              <p>I think TS case quite similiar. The cleaning part.. i work as
              storekeeper before also. Man.. the worst is when the container
              arrives at the warehouse. 50KG Red beans x100 bags.Rice 25 KG
              X200  , 10KG rice x 500 and other stuffs. lol.. I almost got
              crushed to death while stacking the 25 kg rice bags when it almost
              tipped and fall on me. hahaha</p>
              <p>The problem with these stingy ass employers is that , if you
              'employee' can work as hard.. as good.. instead of giving u more
              pay or promoting u OR whatever that actually benefits everyone,
              they will start to cut cost and maximise your worth. So pretty much
              if u work as fast and as hard... they hire you , fire two dudes. So
              u are pretty much = 2 dudes working for the price of 1.</p>
              <p>Classic stingy ass employers modus operandi. Or should i say..
              s.o.b employers. hehe</p>
              <p>Damn just writing about me makes me feel good at what i did.</p>

              <p>To TS: I see you replying "you did not get my point" several times. I do not quite get your point either. Maybe you should have put forth your case a little clearer in the first place.</p>
              <p>I am in agreement that sg lacks workplace ethics compared to other developed nations: there are few and difficult ways to seek redress on this island, the work culture is poor (ie. long hours, high stress, low rewards), and the remuneration is simply unacceptable for a '1st world nation' with excellent infrastructure and international (if you choose to believe) standing.</p>
              <p>1st world provisions for the the FTs, 3rd world rewards for Sillyporeans.</p>

                      another guy , a student from India cleaning the store. And we had
                      shit loads to do for a meagre pay of $12 per hour, We had to clean
                      and mop and buffer the whole store floor. The equiment given sucks
                      and  it was very inefficient on the part of manpower cause
                      such tedious 3 in one task had to be completed in 4 hours which we
                      had to rush for time. If u look deeply into this case, they should
                      have hire at least a min of 4 people to do it, one on each part of
                      the cleaning process. But due to their stinginess in paying people,
                      avoidance of going thru the hassle of workplace laws, they were
                      exploiting those students who are looking to pay for their study
                      expenses in AUS.</p>
              <p>and the manager was too fussy about being perfect. I told him if
                      he wanted to have a perfect job, he should pay more and give more
                      working hours. Generally its easier yo find fault with a job being
                      done. I also told him he should have the sense that evetually no
                      matter how much cleaning is done, dust and dirt are bound to appear
                      after just 1 hour or after the store opens in the day for
                      business.</p>
              <p>Finally i showed them the middle finger and left. Good thing for
                      him i did not report him to worksafe ot other governing body or he
                      will get fined for tax avoidance. My rationale was this:</p>
              <p>1) they are overloading us with work for a meagre pay.</p>
              <p>2) they could have saved money if they employed 4 people with
                      $10 per hour pay.</p>
              <p>3) they could have avoided half f^cked job done due to the work
                      overload</p>
              <p>4) it seems people always join and leave this place in it
                      becoming unpopular and generally an exploitive place.</p>
              <p>5) Aus workplace legislations place emphasis on workplace ethics
                      which this place clearly ignored.</p>
              <p>6) cash in hand job means u are  not covered in time of
                      accidents or death</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I compare this place to many places in sg which overload workers
                      for a meagre pay. Because firstly such exploitative behavouir
                      causes friction between employer and employee. On the second, this
                      place has no ethics to begin with.</p>

              <p>I couldn't really give a crap about foreign workers/students  who have no right to work in a country. This will discourage the illegals from taking local jobs. I believe in supporting only the locals and those who have the right visas to work.</p>

              <p>Complain about prices increase?..its more about complaint on
              living cost and inflation ratio. In Aust pp claim prices are exp
              but they are not exp at all. things like milk, sugar, bread ect
              cost  cheaper than in sg. Electronics cost slightly more exp
              only. this is due to the fact that there is no 2nd hand market

              <p><br>Australian workers' works ethically within their own, but not with foreign workers, their races and colors discrimination is stronger than most asia pacific region.

              <p>How true is that?.. I have worked in casual employment before and never expereinced such a thing. All PRs and citizens , regardless of nationality are entitlted to the same rights. There was a visa subclass for FW prior to 2008 which has no rights or min wage. But after June 2008, it has since been removed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, di u work and stay in Aus before?. Things u claim are not true in Melbourne Sydney or capital states. There are lots of Asians there living and working. In fact if any form of discrimination exsts, it will have to be a place with a majority race. Not the case for Melbourne and Sydney.</p>
