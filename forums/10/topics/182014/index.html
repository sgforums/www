Why is there a need to fear if you didn't borrow money from them?<br><br>In this age of video cameras and electronic survellenace, you can record evidence of loansharks vandalising or threatening you and go to the police. If tammy can use a mobile to take videos, I dun see why can't you.<br><br>Also, if the rest of their kakis continue to harass you, I believe that you are able to either bring enough of them to juctice via the police, until its no longer economically viable to harass you anymore. After all, loansharks in singapore do not harm or hurt others. If they do, just kill them.

That gambler is rather immoral, for want of a better word. Well, at least the victims managed to get rid of the loan sharks after sometime, although I do not doubt the amount of effort, distress caused and costs in damages.<br><br>What I really do not understand is, why are innocent people so afraid of these loan shark runners? They are just small fries with no gang clout. Use a cyber camera to record them breaking the law, frighten them off, splash paint on them, beat them up, etc... There is no lack of damage one can do to them, legal or otherwise.<br><br>You guys should read the thread on gangsters in chit chat. You'd have a really good laugh at these rubbish. Maybe its time to clear the trash from our home.</div>
