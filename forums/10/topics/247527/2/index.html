            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know why they want to compare with private sectors. Private sectors main objective is trying to make profits to survive and pay corporate tax to govt. But government and public sector main objective is to serve the country and people. So who do they pay their tax to? themselves!!! They are going to make the income gap worse. GST has no effect on the government . They make the government like a profit organization. I start to wonder did they ever donate money to charity to help the less fortunate. I think only the public is helping the less fortunate. Why they need so much money? If every MP donate half of their million salaries, wow, imagine it can help so many people. there will be no more corruption in charities. haha, they say they waited 6 years without increase in pay, it really match the 66.6% vote. I think some waited 10 years oso without increased and even get sacked. I think we need someone to dig into their private life to see how they spent their peanut salaries like durai case, maybe we can discover more than meet the eyes. Anyway, i also wonder the so called talents are from rich family with scholarship, so how do they know the hardship the average singaporean are suffering. I always see a few MP stand out to say a few pathetic words while the rest like dummy sitting quietly. So this are the good MP they selected. The talented they selected are just helping them to make and earn more money. Now, MP teo say they cannot compare their high salaries with other countries salaries. But why can they compare GST and transport cost with other countries? their words are conflicting. Money has become a motivation to do well in everything, no money, they can leave their post anytime they want. Without pay rise, they can disappear. In the end, their solution is to set casino to make Singaporean and foreigners indulged in gambling, then set up legal loanshark to collect money from them. Wow wow again, so this the solution that the talents people they recruit can think of.  Don't need to use brain, just set up all illegal stuff like prostitute, drug traffickings, pirated dvd to earn big bucks.</div>
