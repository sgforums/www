            <div class='col-md body'>When the elites gather and start talking to one another, all of a sudden the whole society seems to regard million dollar salaries as peanuts or pittance. When these people who are elites are given the technology start-ups to run usually nothing is heard of their doings.<br><br>So on and on the arguments go that our GLC or corporatised chieftains are all talents and our CLC taxi-company chiefs are talents each earning a million a year with a string of other benefits thrown in for good measures until the NKF saga when such salaries are regarded as peanuts as well.<br><br>Really is there a prospect of getting a good taxi-chief by paying him less than a million. How difficult is it to get someone less than a talent to manage a taxi or bus company sucessfully really ? One would have thought the most difficult job is to start a technology company climb up our competitive ladder and create jobs for the many unemployed. This latter job is the real million-dollar talent and we should pay such talent millions but how many of our so-called talents in government has the track record of such success or abilities. After they are shifted out from GLCs how many of them make it to this category of talents? Like Jack Welch ? Or is it that once any of them become ministers they deserve to go into GLC-retired army general category.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>very nice....<br><br>since mrs "peanut" behaves in this manner, it is quite or rather very likely that there are more persons with such mentality.<br><br>while it is true that many share the sentiments of the above written, what can be done to de-throne such a mentality? let alone person(s). are such mentalities toward life in society neccessary for the economic success OR must be part of the progress of a nation?<br><br>i believe that such people (as Mrs peanuts is) having grown up as cunning and scheming beings in our society (and other societies alike) craving for more luxury in the shadow of their man, while the poor toils in endless cycles. it is inevitable that we all seek a better life, but to demean all others due to ones higher social status is degrading to us as singaporeans (and to one and all in this planet). Mrs peanuts is a disgrace to our society and like all who share her mentality alike.<br><br>this henceforth this "PEANUTy" mentality is very much detestable (doesnt it?). such personalities require high statuses, wealth, power etc to appease their own insecurities very much require a re-education to come to terms with life and one and all around them.<br><br>lets all not be a PEANUT brain even tho we all hate what PEANUTy PEANUTs have done. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
