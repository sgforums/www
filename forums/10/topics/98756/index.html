            <div class='col-md body'>TODAY Today<br><br>Aim is level playing field<br>Competition Bill targets economic 'quantum step': Balakrishnan<br><br>Tor Ching Li<br>chingli@newstoday.com.sg<br><br><blockquote>AGAINST the backdrop of the recent reconfiguration in the media industry, a spirited two-hour debate was held in Parliament yesterday over the second reading of the Competition Bill.<br>.<br>Mooted with the aim of levelling the playing field for businesses, the Bill Â— when passed Â— will be implemented in phases starting in January next year.<br>.<br>The intention of the Bill is "to move the economy up one quantum step" by promoting the efficient functioning of local markets, said Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports and Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry.<br>.<br>The Act's exclusion of certain sectors of the economy, however, raised concerns among MPs, who also questioned the independence of a Competition Commission.<br>.<br>The Bill excludes sectors such as the media, telecommunications, energy, post and transport, all of which have their own regulatory authorities and laws. This could create "uneven standards" on competition policies, said MP Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC).<br>.<br>But Dr Balakrishnan said such clear and precise legislation would need to evolve.<br>.<br>"It would create more confusion to tell, for example, energy generators that they would be subject to both the Energy Market Authority and the Competition Commission," he said.<br>.<br>MPs Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio GRC), Sin Boon Ann (Tampines GRC) and Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah GRC) raised the issue of the impartiality of a Competition Commission, which will be established as a new statutory body in Phase One of the Bill's implementation, following its ratification in Parliament in January.<br>.<br>Mr Sin said: "Because the Government is also in business, it may on occasions be seen to be the poacher. This is evident in the extensive and deep engagements that our Government-Linked Companies (GLCs) have within the Singapore economy."<br>.<br>Mr Inderjit called on the Government to "keep the integrity of the commission by not having too many civil servants who, whether directly or indirectly, will have some connection with the GLCs under regulation".<br>.<br>Dr Balakrishnan assured the House that the Bill would apply to all commercial and economic activities, "regardless of whether the undertaking is owned by a foreign entity, a Singapore entity, the Government or a statutory body".<br>.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">MP Steve Chia voiced disappointment that the Bill did not cover the political sphere, where "monopolistic power and anti-competitive behaviour is evident".<br>.<br>But Dr Balakrishnan disputed this, saying the exclusion of Government and statutory bodies was in line with the original intent of the Bill Â— to regulate the conduct of market players. </span><br>.<br>He also stressed that the exclusion of certain sectors was not meant to protect them from competition, rather, these were sectors "in transition from a monopolistic to a more competitive environment", which warranted sectoral regulators with industry knowledge and expertise.<br>.<br>When the Bill is passed and the commission set up in January next year, the commission will spend the next year consulting with stakeholders on provisions for anti-competitive agreements, decisions and practices.<br>.<br>Regulations in these areas and others such as the appeal process and definitions of abuse of dominance will come into effect in phase two, scheduled to begin on Jan 1, 2006. By 2007, the remaining provisions relating to mergers and acquisitions will go into force. </blockquote></div>
