This is not true. Most of the successful entrepreneurs do not have high education background.<br><br>Ms wee is smart alright but she is bad in Public relation and common sense. I cant believe her daddy whom is a MP possess no common sense.<br><br>if the elite learn how to fawned to the less elite group which is the majority, maybe the situation could be better.

The letter should have given her a confidence boost.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">However, in the letter, she was told that in order to apply for the bursary, her family income must not exceed $4,000. She was visibly upset. Why send her the letter when the award could not be given? I am not writing to apply for the bursary. I can well afford her education.</span><br><br>But I just wonder if this is the right way to motivate young inquiring minds.<br><br>For two years, I have written to MOE and all I want is for her to be given a certificate for a job well done. Period. She can choose to frame it and be reminded of her efforts.<br><br>When the letter came this year, she was not so excited as she knew what to expect.<br><br>I believe MOE can be more creative or less rigid by ensuring students get what they deserve, not just in monetary terms but in encouragement as well.<br><br>Chan Chwee Leng (Mdm)<br><br><span style="color: blue;">How is it that's so easy for one to be so upset about?</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </div></blockquote>If we are talking about adults, ya, I agree, it's nothing to be disapoointed about. But we are talking about kids, dude.<br><br>Kids get disappointed, sometimes, over tiny whiny things. I can understand the child for feeling disappointed.</div>
