              <p>It is all american fault. they kill off saddam, now who does saudi and kuwaitis afraid of right now? the american can consider to turn their guns at the saudis royal family palace and fire a few rounds. i bet the  next day, another few million barrels can be squeese off their ass.</p>
              <p>the other day, donald trump was at CNBC, critising the bush administration not strong enough to tell OPEC to increase their supply and how they are ripping off the world!</p>

              <p>Here is an interpretation of the 1973 oil shock:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">On October 6, 1973,
              Egypt and Syria invaded Israel, igniting what became known as the "Yom
              Kippur" war.  Contrary to popular impression, the "Yom Kippur" war was
              not the result of simple miscalculation, a blunder, or an Arab decision
              to launch a military strike against the state of Israel.  The entire
              constellation of events surrounding the outbreak of the October war was
              secretly orchestrated from Washington and London, using the powerful
              diplomatic secret channels developed by Nixon's White House National
              Security Adviser, Henry Kissinger...</span></p>

              <p class="Quotes"><em>“I
              am 100 per cent sure that the Americans were behind the increase in the
              price of oil. The oil companies were in in real trouble at that time,
              they had borrowed a lot of money and they needed a high oil price to
              save them.”</em></p>
              <p class="Titel">He says he was convinced of this by
              the attitude of the Shah of Iran, who in one crucial day in 1974 moved
              from the Saudi view, that a hike would be dangerous to Opec because it
              would alienate the US, to advocating higher prices.</p>
              <p class="Quotes"><em>“King
              Faisal sent me to the Shah of Iran, who said: ‘Why are you against the

              a few years ago by Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, who was Saudi Arabia's
              OPEC minister at the time:</p>
              <p><em>“I am 100 per cent sure that the Americans were
              behind the increase in the price of oil. The oil companies were in
              in real trouble at that time, they had borrowed a lot of money and
              they needed a high oil price to save them.”</em></p>
              <p>He says he was convinced of this by the attitude of the
              Shah of Iran, who in one crucial day in 1974 moved from the Saudi
              view, that a hike would be dangerous to Opec because it would
              alienate the US, to advocating higher prices.</p>
              <p><em>“King Faisal sent me to the Shah of Iran, who said:
              ‘Why are you against the increase in the price of oil? That is what
              they want? Ask Henry Kissinger - he is the one who wants a higher
              price’.”</em></p>
              <p>Yamani contends that proof of his long-held belief has
              recently emerged in the minutes of a secret meeting on a Swedish
              island, where UK and US officials determined to orchestrate a 400
              per cent increase in the oil price.</p>

              <p>The Arabs' intention to invade Israel was real. It so happened that the US was able to get the best of what was inevitable - The Yom Kippur War.</p>
              <p>The Egyptians and Syrians launched a well-planned attack on Israel when the Israelis were standing before their Lord in the synagogues on Yom Kippur, the most important and solemn holiday for the Jews.</p>
