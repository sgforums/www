Is our system allowing us to throw up the best and the most capable leaders to run our country.<br><br>Is there such a thing called voting or election now? Are citizens able to vote for whoever we can get from our small population or limiting our choices only to a few pre-chosen by the power that be. Are the few available objective and capable candidates not being impeded to come forward to serve the country.<br><br>It seems like every potential candidates will have to be chosen by the power that be to stand for election to formalise some pre-determined backroom choices.<br><br>Citizens have to accept whoever put up by the power.
