              <p>I do not believe I speak loudly on the phone.  Just at a normal volume.  I know my compatriots from the mainland tend to talk louder than a megaphone and yes it can be annoying.  My country, as in China, is huge.  But HK as a seperate autonomous zone is a tiny blip on the map with probably even less useable land than Singapore.  Thats why HDB is usually twenty stories in Singapore while HK's version of HDB is 30-40 stories.  Newer ones will reach 50 stories.  New private condominiums will reach 60 stories.  Land is that scarce I'm afraid.  That's why the prospect of paying $1.5 million hkd ($300k sgd) for a freakin 500 square feet flat is not very appealing to me.  And even if you have the money, you have to go into a lottery and hope you get a slot for a new government built apartment.  Wait, this forum is on Singapore, not HK's problems.  Sorry.</p>

              <p>If this statement is true, then it would have negated or made all the acts of defiance to be worthless - when the truth is that the many protests and demonstrations by those in the 1950s had won indepedence for many countries under Colonial Rule.</p>
              <p>From India to Indonesia, from Vanuatu to Vietnam - all over Africa and Asia - the millions that lived under Colonial Rule had opposed the status quo to be continued after WW-2 - and many acts of defiance had occurred to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">change the rules and guidelines</span></em>" insisted by the various Colonial Governments.</p>
              <p>Can there be a modern China if Sun Yat Sen had not worked to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">change the rules and guidelines</span></em>" that were imposed by the defunct Manchu Imperial House ?</p>
              <p>Can India even hoped to see an accelerated path towards independence if Gandhi had not sparked the independence movement and simply waited to form a majority in Parliament that did not even exist ?</p>
              <p>Can Singapore even have won self-government - if the early political activists in the University and Middle Schools had not started political education of a migrant population - and cause public agitation against the colonial abuses ?</p>
              <p>When an arrogant Government insist on obnoxious rules and methods to sustain their own relevance to be imposed on the population - they are behaving no less like the old Colonial Government had been.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">however good candidate like low, chiam, silvia did command my respect. they had dare to stand up where most of us din have the guts and balls!!</span></em> "</p>
              <p>If the dismal performance of "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">low, chiam, silvia</span></em>" can win your respect - it is not a surprise considering that you will claim yourself to be amongst those who "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">din have the guts and balls!!</span></em>" - when WP Sylvia Lim had none in the first place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the PAP bastardising the Singapore Constitution, and toying the election methods - their accumulated acts have been studied and the effects measured statistically in an independent study - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.tfd.org.tw/docs/dj0401/135-154-Joel%20S.%20Fetzer.pdf">‘Election Strategy and Ethnic Poltics in Singapore - 2008 ’</a>.</p>
              <p>Under such circumstances, can Singaporeans be given the opportunity of being heard in Parliament ?</p>

              <p>If this statement is true, then it would have negated or made all the acts of defiance to be worthless - when the truth is that the many protests and demonstrations by those in the 1950s had won indepedence for many countries under Colonial Rule.</p>
              <p>From India to Indonesia, from Vanuatu to Vietnam - all over Africa and Asia - the millions that lived under Colonial Rule had opposed the status quo to be continued after WW-2 - and many acts of defiance had occurred to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">change the rules and guidelines</span></em>" insisted by the various Colonial Governments.</p>
              <p>Can there be a modern China if Sun Yat Sen had not worked to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">change the rules and guidelines</span></em>" that were imposed by the defunct Manchu Imperial House ?</p>
              <p>Can India even hoped to see an accelerated path towards independence if Gandhi had not sparked the independence movement and simply waited to form a majority in Parliament that did not even exist ?</p>
              <p>Can Singapore even have won self-government - if the early political activists in the University and Middle Schools had not started political education of a migrant population - and cause public agitation against the colonial abuses ?</p>
              <p>When an arrogant Government insist on obnoxious rules and methods to sustain their own relevance to be imposed on the population - they are behaving no less like the old Colonial Government had been.</p>

              <p>If you really wanna learn about Sg, u have to know how this country started and how we developed into an economy today. You say we weathered the strom pretty well, hey...do u know we are at the mercy of the world's economic performance due to the structure of our economy? We are still using outdated strategic initiatives thats has otherwise served us well in the 60s and 70s.</p>

              <p>Was the knowledge of the fact - that Middle-eastern countries can be held ransom to the massive foreign labor - the motivation for the PAP to make the statement that is now the title of this thread ?</p>
              <p>If your position is true - it is remarkable that the PAP has now fallen backward to a "policy of appeasement" - to make foreigners secure so as to serve Singapore in ever larger numbers despite the fact that they can hold Singapore's Economy to ransom by sudden withdrawal of their services in one form or another.</p>
              <p>Can this make Singapore more resillient and achieve the ideals of Total Defence - or was that another PAP propaganda that has served its time and no longer relevant and inconvenient to the new real circumstances ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The fact that horror stories exist can only be attributed to the haphazard and poorly thought out policies being implemented without the safeguards being put in place before implementation.</p>
              <p>Has this not been the characteristic manner in which the PAP Government work even with policies and legislations made towards governing Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>If you are as knowledgeable as you claim to be with the foregin labor situation in the Middle-eastern countries - can it be assumed that you can be aware that the citizens of those Middle-eastern countries named are well looked after by the respective governments - in ways unheard and unseen in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>The foreign workers - that migrate to those Middle-eastern countries - are there for short-termed contract, and do not compete with the locals for jobs, nor do their presence result in the wages being suppressed for the local citizens, nor do they compete for the resources and infrastructures built to benefit the local citizens.</p>

              <p>Why did the foreigh labour exit en mass from those countries? International crisis, marked improvements in their homeland, or simply there are greener pastures elsewhere. Whatever the reason the danger is there. Singapore knows it.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Did you miss out also the national policies that change with each change of the government from which these foreign labor come from ?</p>
              <p>Does the Singapore Government know about the many dangers posed ?</p>
              <p>Hardly, considering the typical rush to implement a poorly thought out policy, and then tinker with it as "works in progress" - which explains for the flip-flop policy changes over the last decade, and the many belated admissions even by MM LKY to past policies viewed with hind-sight.</p>
              <p>One danger that did not dawn on the Singapore Government is that with so much emphasis on the foreign workers - it was not obvious that it is the Singaporeans bearing the brunt of all the negative effects of a misguided policy.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are now seeing the belated actions being taken to remedy the situation - and done so only with the view of the up-coming General Election.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>To answer your question, (which is cleverly crafted for me to accept or reject a negative situation), I say this: I would like Singapore to make hay while the sun shine, to take all the opportunity of the present circumstances to move ahead and to progress as much as possible. Yes this would spread our resources thin, requiring the influx of foreign labour. I have stated I am agreeable to this, and do so again, as opposed to being restrained by the dangers of being too dependent on foreign labour. When the time comes, and they leave Singapore in a lurch, that would be another bridge to cross. In the mean time, Majulah Singapura.</p>
              <p>So should I expect Singapore, in view of those pitfalls, to restrain from going all out?   </p>
              <p>No. </p>

              <p>It is also obvious that your position is a by-product of the PAP's characteristic ways of rushing out the policies no matter the cost, fixing it as 'works in progress', dropping it quietly when the policy is a failure without any further accountability to the social, economic and financial costs incurred.</p>
              <p>You are a product of all the excesses that was made possible from the successes accumulated by the early generations that toiled, and have no idea as to how to conserve and focus on what we can do best.</p>
              <p>Is there any surprises left in the callous attitude to the loss of $100 Billion - without any further squeak by all concerned, and the continued pseudo-bravado with the more excesses in new foreign investments ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not smart to work on a high speed train while at the same time laying tracks ahead as you plan its next course. </p>
              <p>Can the high speed train work any faster, when you are uncertain what lies ahead, even as you have no clue as what the plan should be as to where you intend to lead the tracks to ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not knowing what the meaning of the word "fear" - does not necessarily mean that one is brave, it merely show that one is either ignorant of the language used, or plain dumb.</p>

              <p>Water pollution, air pollution, lesser usable land...these are problems alright, and the influx of foreigners wouldn't contribute to these problems?</p>
              <p>Did you miss the many threads regarding our government on your way to this thread? Funny that you are concerned that we having a dictator, which is true btw, and that protesting is illegal yet you chose to migrate here...didn't you do some research on our tiny island before migrating over? Are you planning to stay here permanently?</p>

              <p><br> <br> I've been working in Singapore for almost two years.  Do I
              feel squeezed by foreigners back in HK?  No.  Foreigners
              make up only five percent of the population.  But competition
              for jobs is nonetheless very high because I still have to fight
              with the other 6.5 million local Hong Kongers for employment. 
              That's one of the reasons I sought employment in Singapore. 
              The pay is decent and work hours are not backbreaking.  And
              one good thing about Singapore is that people in general are
              straight faced and will give you a straight answer.<br></p>

              <p>Think for your children, your grandchildren. Now, Singaporeans can't really stand all the foreigners that come in huge amounts, how will your children or the next generation (If you are planning to start a family here next time) survive if this continue? Don't forget, if your children/son is born in Singapore, he will need to serve NS &amp; compete with Foreigners next time too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore's population is around 4.8 million, which 1.6 millions are foreigners. In a few years time, it will definitely hit 6 million (That's the ideal amount the gamen state isn't it?) or more if this prob still continues. Now tell me, are you going to move out of Singapore again to find somewhere which is less competitive?</p>
