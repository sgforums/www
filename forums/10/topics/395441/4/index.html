              <p>It is a surprise that you will wish to digress from the main issue which began with your false claim that it is critical for Singapore that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">The economy need to be expanded to the max possible, so that we can have the widest choice possible in goods and services</span></em>" .</p>
              <p>Have you simply resigned from your position without even bothering to make a reasonable defense for the false statement made above - which you claim is the reason that justify the need for the huge influx of foreign labor to Singapore ?</p>
              <p>It is not too clever to simply dismiss my preceding reply as digressing when you could have attempted to be honest with yourself by addressing the issues raised.</p>
              <p>It is also not too creative to simply hide behind a simple excuse that there is "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the bone of contention between any persons who have their own opinion and care to express them</span></em>".</p>
              <p>If you believe in your opinion as valid you would have the conviction in yourself to push your ideas through instead of resigning from fear of having to change your views, or fear of something worst - to be debunked.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To put it all in a nutshell - are you prepared to see Singapore being so dependent on foreign labor to justify the maximum economic expansion for Singapore - to the extent of ignoring the pitfalls experienced by other countries such as the named Middle-eastern countries ?</p>

              <p>I digress?, I am keeping to the topic.</p>
              <p>I have reiterated my stand. I think because of  your scorn for LKY and his party, it did not register with you.</p>
              <p>Anyway my statement is my statement. It cannot be false, it can only be resonable, acceptable, or absurd.</p>
              <p>You ask this question, and it shows that you already know what my stand is.</p>
              <p><em>"To put it all in a nutshell - are you prepared to see Singapore being so dependent on foreign labor to justify the maximum economic expansion for Singapore - to the extent of ignoring the pitfalls experienced by other countries such as the named Middle-eastern countries ?"</em></p>
              <p>What makes you think that only you are privy to the details of the Middle-eastern countries' experience? Isn't knowledge of their experience the the cause of the statement which is the title of this thread</p>
              <p><strong>S'poreans must not create an image that new immigrants are not welcome.</strong></p>
              <p>Foreign workers here have their horror stories to tell too, but as can be seen they are by and large well treated. This eliminate or reduces one of the causes of foreign labour to leave.</p>
              <p>Why did the foreigh labour exit en mass from those countries? International crisis, marked improvements in their homeland, or simply there are greener pastures elsewhere. Whatever the reason the danger is there. Singapore knows it.</p>
              <p>To answer your question, (which is cleverly crafted for me to accept or reject a negative situation), I say this: I would like Singapore to make hay while the sun shine, to take all the opportunity of the present circumstances to move ahead and to progress as much as possible. Yes this would spread our resources thin, requiring the influx of foreign labour. I have stated I am agreeable to this, and do so again, as opposed to being restrained by the dangers of being too dependent on foreign labour. When the time comes, and they leave Singapore in a lurch, that would be another bridge to cross. In the mean time, Majulah Singapura.</p>
              <p>So should I expect Singapore, in view of those pitfalls, to restrain from going all out?   </p>
              <p>No.</p>

              <p>Wah just came back from my holiday in sg still onto this issue.</p>
              <p>mancha made some good pts but at the end of the day....</p>
              <p>whatever direction the government pursues "in the interest of the people and nation." It is their point of view.... if the people are not happy.... the government has either a choice to rethink their perspective to prevent civil unrest/racial tensions or they can gamble by persisting and perhaps lose a few votes. Which won't happen because PAP always wins so why bother.... lol</p>
              <p>Personally I agree wif Martin Lee in that the result in Singapore won't change.... yawn*. Whether u like your current government or not you're stuck with it. This is probably the only democracy whereby our forefather minister mentor can bash its people on international TV and get away with it. Face it Singaporeans. You're stuck. You either belong to the group that has no need to ship out because Singapore's cost of living is cheap and you have the $ or you don't have the $ and everything is expensive. (Damn I'm getting influenced by elitist propaganda.... paisei never knew I had it in me to talk like them.)</p>
              <p>Here's Martin Lee's point of view.</p>

              <p><br>I think this debate is moot. In the 1st place, Singaporeans aren't upset about the foreigners (at least from what I hear). Singaporeans ARE upset WITH the govt for not setting strict criteria in importing foreign labour..</p>
              <p>And I don't think it's an issue (in fact, I think it's justified) to favour locals to foreigners in one's own country, and only the better crop of foreigners can secure a job. For instance, I am working in USA, I fought past Americans and other nationalities to secure my job here. I pride myself at being able to overcome those initial disadvantages by proving my capabilities above everyone else, and got selected for the job. The Americans don't hate me, coz they can see my abilities when I come in here.</p>
              <p>The same goes for you. If SG makes it difficult for you to get a job, because companies favour locals more, I am sure you will not mind. In fact, would you not be proud if you best the locals to win the job?</p>

              <p>People stare at you cos you are unique. Singaporeans a lot cant speak cantonese. Those who stare at you happens to be Cantonese, and are surprised you can speak so fluently.<br><br>Anyway, Singaporeans are not prejudiced against Hongkongers, so don't despise yourself.<br><br>And probably, you spoke too loud on the MRT, thats why you are getting the stares.

              <p>I am from Hong Kong and I just want to say: Hatred, regardless
                  of what form it takes, will do you no good.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hatred? What a strong word...</span></p>
              <p>Now before you Singaporeans here start telling me to drag my
                  bloody corpse back to Hong Kong, have the good heart to hear me
                  out.</p>
              <p>I am a foreigner, and like all other foreigners, we never
                  "stole" your jobs, university placements, your livelihoods, or
                  anything for that matter.  Get that out of your head.</p>
              <p>We're just regular people making an honest living, trying to
                  provide for ourselves and our families.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And so are average Singaporeans trying to make a honest living, it doesn't help that the standard of living is very high but the salary is low here and for some reasons, our Government want to cramp more people in this bloody small island.<br></span></p>
              <p>Hong Kong also has plenty of migrant workers from the
                  Phillippines, Indonesia, and the PRC.  I'm sure most developed
                  countries, US, Canada, Australia, etc. have a sizeable population
                  of migrant workers as well.  This is the world we live in,
                  accept it.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Try comparing your country size to Singapore size...see the difference?</span></p>
              <p>Rid yourself of your prejudices.  And stop being so bloody
                  rude.  I start talking cantonese in the MRT and I can say at
                  least once out of ten times I will get a unpleasant look or stare
                  from some random Singaporean chinese because they know I'm from
                  Hong Kong.  This kind of rotten attitude will do you no
                  good.  NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING good will come out of
                  it.  You merely disgrace your country and your people.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Unless you're talking loudly, which is not a polite thing to do here I believe no one will give you the unpleasant look or stare.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">No offense to you but</span><span style="color: #0000ff;"> do you talk loudly while using the phone?</span></p>
