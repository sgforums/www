              <p>Rockstar, I do not understand your country.  That's right, I don't.  The only thing I do know is that employment opportunities are quite good here for the average university graduate.  But then there are people like Angel7030 who, when seeing a foreigner, will not hesitate to vent.  I just don't get it.  It's as if I killed her father and burnt her house down.</p>

              <p> As expected this discourse will be <em>boh liau</em>, with additiional issues introduced. I will be brief.</p>
              <p> This remark shows your comprehension ability. Also your memory must be failing as you can't remember what you asked me in the previous posts about my stand. </p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p><em>What possibly can give you the idea that the details of the heavy dependence on foreign labor by Middle-eastern countries - is privy to yours truly alone ?</em></p>
              <p>Was the knowledge of the fact - that Middle-eastern countries can be held ransom to the massive foreign labor - the motivation for the PAP to make the statement that is now the title of this thread ?</p>
              <p>If your position is true - it is remarkable that the PAP has now fallen backward to a "policy of appeasement" - to make foreigners secure so as to serve Singapore in ever larger numbers despite the fact that they can hold Singapore's Economy to ransom by sudden withdrawal of their services in one form or another.</p>
              <p>Can this make Singapore more resillient and achieve the ideals of Total Defence - or was that another PAP propaganda that has served its time and no longer relevant and inconvenient to the new real circumstances ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>The fact that horror stories exist can only be attributed to the haphazard and poorly thought out policies being implemented without the safeguards being put in place before implementation.</em></p>
              <p>Has this not been the characteristic manner in which the PAP Government work even with policies and legislations made towards governing Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>If you are as knowledgeable as you claim to be with the foregin labor situation in the Middle-eastern countries - can it be assumed that you can be aware that the citizens of those Middle-eastern countries named are well looked after by the respective governments - in ways unheard and unseen in Singapore ?</em></p>
              <p>The foreign workers - that migrate to those Middle-eastern countries - are there for short-termed contract, and do not compete with the locals for jobs, nor do their presence result in the wages being suppressed for the local citizens, nor do they compete for the resources and infrastructures built to benefit the local citizens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Did you miss out also the national policies that change with each change of the government from which these foreign labor come from ?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Does the Singapore Government know about the many dangers posed ?</em></p>
              <p>Hardly, considering the typical rush to implement a poorly thought out policy, and then tinker with it as "works in progress" - which explains for the flip-flop policy changes over the last decade, and the many belated admissions even by MM LKY to past policies viewed with hind-sight.</p>
              <p>One danger that did not dawn on the Singapore Government is that with so much emphasis on the foreign workers - it was not obvious that it is the Singaporeans bearing the brunt of all the negative effects of a misguided policy.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are now seeing the belated actions being taken to remedy the situation - and done so only with the view of the up-coming General Election.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>It is not a surprise that you will emphasise "</em><span style="color: #0000ff;">to take all the opportunity of the present circumstances to move ahead and to progress as much as possible</span>" - when you have not been able to see the pitfall suffered by Singaporeans, which the present PAP Government recognised belatedly only because of the upcoming Elections.</p>
              <p>It is also obvious that your position is a by-product of the PAP's characteristic ways of rushing out the policies no matter the cost, fixing it as 'works in progress', dropping it quietly when the policy is a failure without any further accountability to the social, economic and financial costs incurred.</p>
              <p>You are a product of all the excesses that was made possible from the successes accumulated by the early generations that toiled, and have no idea as to how to conserve and focus on what we can do best.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Is there any surprises left in the callous attitude to the loss of $100 Billion - without any further squeak by all concerned, and the continued pseudo-bravado with the more excesses in new foreign investments ?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not smart to work on a high speed train while at the same time laying tracks ahead as you plan its next course. </p>
              <p>Can the high speed train work any faster, when you are uncertain what lies ahead, even as you have no clue as what the plan should be as to where you intend to lead the tracks to ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not knowing what the meaning of the word "fear" - does not necessarily mean that one is brave, it merely show that one is either ignorant of the language used, or plain dumb.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The billions lost, yes, and this would bring this exchange to no end. It would be a digression.</p>
              <p>Rest are good philosophical material.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: Sorry about the italics, after a while I can't get the whole paragraph to be in italics.</p>

              <p>Thanks but no thanks for your reply - which does not throw further light to your preferred opinion when you declined to substantiate with any further 'clues' as to how you managed to cultivate your opinion to such an insightful conclusion.</p>
              <p>Concerning the 'large archive' - there was none worth keeping from this thread, as nothing conclusive came about from our exchange.</p>
              <p>I do not consider you an opponent as there was no engagement of any kind to begin with, and neither were you opposing any part of my response except to avoid having any sensible exchange.</p>
              <p>Was it any fault of anyone for you to feel tired so easily when only two attempts were made to have you respond to your preferred opinion ?</p>
              <p>If matters seem to be repititious, it can only be attributed to your inability to find the clues that can lead you to where you intend to go after making your initial point - which was specially highlighted for a focused exchange.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, you prefer to circumvent my attempts with ingenious excuses.</p>

              <p>Well one thing I am very clear about is this.  I am a foreigner and I can probably say this on behalf of other foreigners.  We do not intend to retire here nor do we intend to become official citizens.  There must be a truly compelling reason for me to surrender my HK and Canada passports so as to become a Singaporean citizen.  I also understand that there is probably a horde of ignorant f**ks out there who will claim that I'm either not good enough for Singapore or that Singapore doesn't want me.</p>
              <p>Most of us, and I know it may upset some of the locals, is to save as much as we can so that we can return to our original homes with a higher level of financial freedom.</p>
              <p>Atobe.  You're too smart to let that stupid ho, Angel7030, get to your head.  Let her do her ranting and talk about her uncles.  I will not directly engage her anymore.</p>

              <p>And what is the hip of holding a HKG passport? is not even a country that is why you need canadian passport as a backup. You are not even royal to Canada that is why you remain here in Asia. You are a lifestyle hopper.   </p>

              <p>I think in HK, if the gangsters have their ways of controlling immigration, they can do so as they are powerful enough to do that.</p>
              <p>I think if Singapore were to have lax laws like in HK, the foreigners from certain countries (except HK lah) would get a bashing long time ago.</p>

              <p>You just said it ALL to all Sing folks in this forums.
              you are here  for the quick bucks without due
              interest of Singapore.</p>
              <p><strong>We do not intend to retire here nor do we intend to
              become official citizens.</strong> <strong>There must be a
              truly compelling reason for me to surrender my HK and Canada
              passports so as to become a Singaporean citizen.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>we can return to our original homes with a higher level
              of financial freedom</strong></p>
              <p>Didn't i mention HKG folks work for their own personal
              wealth....do you honestly think you care  about the sing
              folks that work for you in your company who happen to put down
              roots and continue to sacrifice national civil duties as a
              citizen. </p>
              <p>And what is the hip of holding a HKG passport? is not even a
              country that is why you need canadian passport as a backup.
              You are not even royal to Canada that is why
              you remain here in Asia. You are a lifestyle hopper.

              <p>Hmm.  I guess you're right.  I'm here as a parasite to leech off of Singapore.</p>
              <p>And I'm quite sure that you, the great Singaporean, works not for his own personal wealth, but for the greater cause of Singapore!</p>
              <p>Keep your loyalty, I'm sure LKY will give you a medal for it.</p>

              <p>The least you could do is to acknowledge that LKY had once work towards Singapore independents.</p>
              <p>So you have to decide where you call home to be....Canada, Hong Kong, or Singapore....and make a commitment to your decision.</p>

              <p><br>Aturdie, Hitman+, Fuck PAP and LKY are examples of what citizens of a country should not be.</p>
              <p>They are people out to harm the prestige of their own country, instead of changing their country for the better.</p>
              <p>People who are true patriots to their own country are truly to be admired.</p>
