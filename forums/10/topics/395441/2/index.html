              <p>According to my understanding in my research in modern history of singapore,</p>
              <p>Foreigners working in Singapore is not a new issue, in the early industrialisation of our nation, we already got lots of foreigners, good, skillful, educated and well mannered foreigners we called them expatriates, and they have been with us for so many years, mentoring us on how work is to be done. They are the top level talented foreigners from Britain, Japan, Germany, Holland, France and USA. These are what we want, these are the real crucial peoples who will really help to expand our economy, our lifestyle and our Productivity. And, if you look at it,  during these period, from late 60s to early 90s, we learned and relearned from them, there were no shortage of Singaporeans taking up jobs, and the most we had were foreign maids, yet we have record double digits GDP in almost most of the years except the mid 80s recession.  There were no issue about foreigners, we worked hard, we were very productive, reaching high productivity level of 30 to 50% compare to a mere negative or a pathetic 0.1% of today productivity. We justified our wages of that time, which lag behind productivity, meaning we deserve that kind of paid and yet company is earning. We should have kept those foreigner peoples, the real talented ones to stay and make a living here, yet after the mid 90s..one by one left..if you look at those school, the jap, french, german, etc etc schools are getting less intake or some closing down, you know that they had left, because simply, they feel that Singapore govt is attracting the wrong peoples in, and they would not want to be a part of it.</p>
              <p>In comparing with today, what are we attracting?? for that you can see it yourself on the street? are they really helping us or helping themselves, did our productivity goes up higher because of them, and more importantly, have our wages increase or decrease with the ever higher and higher cost of living?? If wages is suppose to lag behind productivity, why are our govt taking so high a paid when productivity was at a negative stage??</p>
              <p>I am not saying that attracting foreigners is wrong or right, it is not a new issue, but the differences of yesterday attraction and today is a total difference in the substance of what we attracted. Yesterday foreigners are very well talented, respected our culture, teaches and make us a better nation, today foreigners are a bunch of peoples who are helping themselve more than helping us. And if Goh Tong Tong is asking them to blend into us, I think he must be go now to Chinatown or Serangoon to look for himself, or even my place in Geyland and Joo Chiat, the reverse is true, Singaporeans are blending themselve into foreign culture from India, China, Mynamar and philippine more than foreigners blending into us.</p>
              <p>If the  foreign intake policy is not relook into it, a backlash can be true, and by that time, the returns can be diseaster leading to cultural revolution, internal strifes and total identity chaos in near future when all groups are formed to retaliate each other for supremacy.</p>

              <p>S'poreans must not create an image that new immigrants are not
              welcomed: SM Goh</p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singaporeans should not create the image that
              immigrants are not welcomed in the country.<br> <br> Speaking at a gathering for new residents in Marine Parade on
              Saturday, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong also urged new Singaporeans
              and permanent residents to play their part to make their community
              a better place to live in.<br> <br> Residents are showing the way of how people in the community can
              bond. They also play games to break the ice and tear down
              barriers.<br> <br> Within the neighbourhood, the list of activities that bring people
              is growing.<br> <br> Among the many activities available at the Marine Parade Community
              Club to help integrate new Singapore citizens and permanent
              residents is an international cooking class. It's called the
              colourful chefs of Marine Parade where a group of citizens from
              Marine Parade have gotten together to share their cooking cultures
              with one another.<br> <br> Senior Minister Goh said these programmes have one objective.<br> <br> He said: "Whether a place is a nice place to live in or not depends
              on the people. And it depends on how we put in the effort to know
              one another and make this into a homely place."<br> This process has to be two-way and the onus is also on new
              immigrants and permanent residents to share and give.<br> <br> Mr Goh said: "If they come into Singapore and convey the impression
              that they are a community apart, they are not part of us and they
              are here just to take from Singapore and not give back, then sooner
              or later, the pressure on them will be great. In other words,
              Singaporeans will say why take them in, they are not
              contributing.”<br> <br> The advice to immigrants and new citizens - move fast.<br> <br> <strong>SM Goh added: "The immigrants who come in must very quickly absorb
              the norms and values of Singaporeans. Learn to speak English if you
              can't speak. You have to communicate and service Singaporeans to
              reach out to Singaporeans. As you become part of us, the next
              generation, your children, they will now study in our schools and
              will be very much like any other Singaporean."</strong><br> <br> This readiness to integrate was very much alive in 70 new residents
              and their families who were at the gathering to get to know their
              grassroots leaders and neighbours better.<br> <br> Tun Zow Myint, New Singapore citizen from Myanmar, said: "My
              parents knew that Singapore is a very safe place for us to move
              around and very close to home as well. The education system is one
              of the top class in the world. That's why we stick around in
              Singapore and bring them up here in Singapore as well."<br> <br> Mr Goh added that Singapore has to tackle the challenge of a
              declining population by topping up with immigrants.<br> <br> But it can be selective and ensure that those who came in
              contributed more.<br> <br> Mr Goh stressed that Singapore is not alone in attracting foreign
              talent to sink their roots in the country.<br> <br> New Zealand has a project to attract Singaporeans to work study and
              live there.<br> <br> Currently, some 4,500 Singaporeans had applied for different visas
              to the country, while statistics from Australia's Immigration
              Department showed that the country's now home to some 50,000
              Singaporeans. - CNA/vm<br></span></p>

                                  foreigners as the economy need to be expanded, and the manpower is
