              <p>"We need FT".   The "we" is referring to them.   They benefit to get more foreigners here to convert them to citizens to vote for them.  </p>
              <p>By having influx of foreigners at our expense, they have created problems for locals and resort to grumble and name calling when locals pour out their grievances.    They are expecting all singaporeans to suffer and die in silence in the mess they created for the nation.    The oppression is becoming more and more serious.</p>

              <p><br>What ever happen to the PAP insistence in learning from the experiences of other small countries with similar difficulties as was done when Singapore was suddenly given independence and had to grope around to find a path forward ?</p>
              <p>Did we not draw lessons from Switzerland, Israel, Malta, and some other smaller sized European countries as well ?</p>
              <p>Have Switzerland and Israel need any help from massive inflow of immigrants to take up citizenship just to ensure progress in their economic enterprises, or to ensure full employment, or to supplement their falling birth rates to achieve replacement in their population numbers ?</p>
              <p>All these countries - that Singapore had drawn lessons from in 1966 -  continued with their open political system of full citizen involvement in the political process; with Switzerland having a political leadership that do not assume themselves to be smarter then the sum total of all the intelligence of the citizens.</p>
              <p>The prosperity and stability of Switzerland is due to the Swiss Citizens being given a stake in the political process in that they are consulted on all major policies which can affect their interests - and done in a process called "Referendum".</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the PAP leadership has no confidence in their own policies nor with Singaporeans, and will not allow Singaporeans to have any say in political issues that affect our own lives through "Referendum".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is a fallacy to claim that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">The economy need to be expanded to the max possible, so that we can have the widest choice possible in goods and services</span></em>" - given the fact that we have limited resources in land, relevant technical skills and technology.</p>
              <p>The "father of Singapore's economy and industrialisation" - Dr Goh Keng Swee - had always advocated the need for Singapore to do what we do best, instead of trying to be the best in everything but being master of none.</p>
              <p>The economic "theory of comparative advantage" that Dr Goh had led Singapore in the early path towards industrialisation had given a foundation to grow within our limited resources.</p>
              <p>Now it seems to have been forgotten as the long period of success has resulted in sheer arrogance in the thinking of the PAP leadership - leading them to believe that they are omnipotently infallible.</p>
              <p>Is Singapore spreading our resources too thin and attempting to be involved in too many directions - to be the top in technology, bio-science, pharmaceutical, ship building and maintenance; to be a regional hub for air and sea transportation, to be a regional financial hub; to be the center of Southeast Asia in the film industry, in computer sciences, and communications ?</p>
              <p>It has always been the PAP policy of getting the "talent" if none is available locally so as to get the desired plans accomplished.</p>
              <p>Has anyone actually done an audit to all the projects that the PAP government has led Singapore to undertake ?</p>
              <p>What has been the returns - in financial terms - considering the huge R+D grants given to some of these new fields of bio-science and pharmaceutical niches that Singapore insist on having ?</p>
              <p>Does the financial returns justify the social and economic burden to the Singapore population ?</p>
              <p>Living within our means remains an Asian Value - and it seems to have been forgotten when it should never have been lost.</p>

              <p>No religious to be involve here. Yesterday, my Dad and Ah ma brought me to Sin Ming Road temple for Ching Ming, tho I dun burnt or pray, i just go there and respect my long dead ah Kong. Somehow, as I looked around, being all Singaporeans devotees and prayers here, I found a sense of True Singapore culture here which i felt that I missed since kindergarden years, it is like to good times when we are all Singaporeans (me taiwanese PR aside). But as we drove out of the place, we begin to feel the present of foreigners in and around us again.</p>
              <p>And the contracted peoples who burnt those hell papers for you and clean up the areas in the temple are all bangalas (muslim), how come temple dun employ Singaporeans, lots of yellow ribbons to pick on, help Singaporeans first.</p>

              <p>I don't mean the service line per se, I meant the generic service base. This would include expertise in manufacturing, shipping, banking, technical, bio-tech, pharmaceuticals and medical, and whatever, Singapore would be the hub of as many of these sectors as can be rather than have a manufacturing based economy.</p>
              <p>It is not whether it is right or wrong, but which is better, or what would be better. And whether to scale down the ambition, in view of the population numbers.</p>
              <p>Atobe has another factor, that is the consensus of the people in the direction to take, but I am not going in that direction because this is a thread about "immigrant workers."  This would open a whole new pandora's box and would be <em>'boh liau'</em>. </p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I think the shift away from a manufacturing base economy to a service one is a move in the right direction considering our size. Remember Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor, and the Iskander Regional Development each by themselves is much larger than the island of Singapore. Every inch of Singapore has to be covered with factories to compete with these developments.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Singapore is different from Israel and Switzerland, and have learnt from them in the begining. The early founders like Dr Goh Keng Swee have seen to that.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I agree that Singapore maybe spreading out its resources too thin. Although there are a number of developments that gives the appearance that Singapore is much advanced that the neighbouring countries, I believe this is because of the compact nature of our nation. Cities like Shanghai and even Kuala Lumpur is in some areas much more "advance" than Singapore. They can have a manufacturing and services based economy, whereas Singapore can only choose one. If it has been manufacturing, we would all have been regimented factory workers now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">What Singapore has as a resource is manpower, and this limited in number and quality. Thus the need to "import".  Singapore can stagnate or progress at a slower rate, and be a sleepy pearl of the orient like Penang and strive to attract tourist in Hawaiian shirts and straw hats to savour the colonial settings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Like it or not, Singaporeans are just as voracious as any other nationality in consumerism, and want to be so. I personally don’t think Singaporeans as a whole will exercise humility and be not materialistic. Singaporeans want, and will want the latest and the best and also the cheapest. And this is what the government of the day has to endeavour to provide for its citizens.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">There are numerous strategies to achieve this purpose. The ones that work well are deemed correct, the one that is disastrous is considered wrong, and all in between are open to debate. Therefore, considering that Singapore’s only resource is manpower, the shift to the various services industries should be in the right direction as oppose to manufacturing. And also in as many in this field as possible, and thus spreading the resources thin, as you have brought out. This has its pros and cons, as those not viable are left to their own demise, and those that take off are nurtured.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">That’s why the government has my agreement on the importation of foreigners to supplement our workforce. Then how they do it, and how you would like them to do it, is the issue.</span></p>

              <p>It is obvious that LKY and the PAP Government had followed this experimental trial and error method over the last five decades, and which you have shown your unique brilliance to continue the erroneous ways of the past.</p>
              <p>LKY's arrogant decisions during the '60s, '70s and '80s - have brought disastrous results that had lasting effects up to this day - as seen from his Family Planning "Stop-At-TWO" program that was implemented in the late 1960s through the '70s that had planted the small family into the minds of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>His insistence on Mandarin as the "Second Language" for the majority of Chinese, which stunted the educational progression of hundreds of thousands of young Singaporeans that could not advance into tertiary education without a Pass in Mandarin.</p>

He did lament that this had resulted in those successful businessmen with great genes not being able to have more wives so as to produce more capable, stronger and larger families.</p>
              <p>Over the years, Singaporeans have consistently witnessed the acknowledgement by MM LKY of his mistaken policies only when his progenies begin to experience the hardships of his past policies that remained stubbornly in place, and which have already affected generations of past and present Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is the importation of foreign labor the only solution for Singapore's continued advancement - especially with the need for low cost laborers to work in all the various menial jobs in the low wage industries and enterprises ?</p>
              <p>Whatever happened to the call for technological advancement in tooling and training so as to make Singapore less dependent on such cheap labor ?</p>
              <p>Are you certain that the experience of Switzerland, Israel and even Sweden has nothing to offer Singapore in the ways that they have resolved their economic progress in the face of their own limited human resource ?</p>

              <p>Obviously you have no clue as to the dependency of countries like the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Libya, and other similar wealthy oil producing Middle-Eastern Countries that are flooded by the large foreign labor pool that ensured the smooth running of their economies.</p>

              <p>To put it all in a nutshell - are you prepared to see Singapore being so dependent on foreign labor to justify the maximum economic expansion for Singapore - to the extent of ignoring the pitfalls experienced by other countries such as the named Middle-eastern countries ?</p>
              <p>What kind of resilient Total Defense for Singapore is there - when continued economic progress is dependent on an ever growing need for foreign labor to sustain the growth ?</p>
              <p>Can this be digression ?</p>
              <p>Surely you can learn something about being honest to yourself ?</p>

              <p>Ah Mr Atobe,</p>
              <p>You are digressive in your arguments.</p>
              <p>My stand is still the same, in that the economy need to be expanded, and expand it must.</p>
              <p>And I would add that whatever direction Singapore takes there is a cost. Whether it is blatant consumerism, or frugalities, or laid back lifestyle, there will always be a trade off, and not everyone will be fully satisfied.</p>
              <p>This will always be the bone of contention between any persons who have their own opinion and care to express them.</p>

              <p>my advice to those singaporeans taht had apply to NZ , do your own research before commiting. As far as i know, NZ is a hotspot for crime! neighbourhood are forming their own watches for security. NZ is not about what you see in lord of the ringsm beautifyl scenery and peaceful. Once you are there, you will know what kind of shit you are getting into.</p>

              <p>once again PAP twist and turn our words against us. we are saying,there are huge influx of foreigners into singapore. we never say, we dont need them at all. the problems is the numbers!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the govt should ask themselves have they done their job to cater to this influx.</p>
              <p>1. dormitory.</p>
              <p>2. escalating HDB prices.</p>
              <p>3. shortage of HDB units.</p>
              <p>4. jam pack public transport.</p>
              <p>5. social cohesion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if they had done their jobs, all this unhappiness about the Foreigners would never have occured. before PAP start to point finger at us, they should look at themselves.</p>

              <p>i would not say, everything PAP has done is bad. but i would say, what they had done in the last 5 years is definitely not ideal and can be better.</p>

              <p>If CSJ had born in taiwan, he would be alright. but as long as opposition is minority, he should be smart enough to know , play by the rules. PAP set the rules because they control the parliament.</p>
              <p>the opposition can only change the rules and guidelines when they had the majority in parliament.</p>
