              <p>Now before you Singaporeans here start telling me to drag my bloody corpse back to Hong Kong, have the good heart to hear me out.</p>
              <p>I am a foreigner, and like all other foreigners, we never "stole" your jobs, university placements, your livelihoods, or anything for that matter.  Get that out of your head.</p>
              <p>We're just regular people making an honest living, trying to provide for ourselves and our families.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong also has plenty of migrant workers from the Phillippines, Indonesia, and the PRC.  I'm sure most developed countries, US, Canada, Australia, etc. have a sizeable population of migrant workers as well.  This is the world we live in, accept it.</p>
              <p>Rid yourself of your prejudices.  And stop being so bloody rude.  I start talking cantonese in the MRT and I can say at least once out of ten times I will get a unpleasant look or stare from some random Singaporean chinese because they know I'm from Hong Kong.  This kind of rotten attitude will do you no good.  NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING good will come out of it.  You merely disgrace your country and your people.</p>

              <p>I migrated here because there was an attractive job opening here and now I am a "dumber" because of that.  Talking it over a cup of tea??  Well does LKY consult you??  Non violence is part of your culture??  So you're saying in Hong Kong, because we make peaceful protests, we are now a violent city?? Yeah I am such a "dumber"<br><br>And HK's unemployment is still at a 5 five year high mind you.  And no, the central government in Beijing doesn't miraculously funnel us money even though we're under their sovereign rule.<br><br>When ex-chief executive of HK Tung Chee Wah tried to pass a bill (Article 23) that would essentially rob the media and the press of their freedoms of expression, we did not consult him.  About half a million took to the street.  It was a peaceful demonstration.  Well your response to this is probably: HKers are mongrels with their heads up their ass.  Singaporeans are much more civil.</p>

              <p>You have no idea why folks like to compare SG and HK??  Well some starters for   you.  We are both former english colonies.  We are both financial powerhouses.  We are both major ports in Asia. </p>
              <p>Greenbacks is everything??  A too simplistic view of your everyday HKer but there is some truth to it.  Greenbacks is also the lifeblood of Singaporeans.  I'm sure your father tells you to study harder so you can enroll at NUS and thus find more venues of employment in the future.  Right??  Civil responsibilities and national duty??  Cmon, let's be honest here.</p>
              <p>The attitude of HKers were awful 15 years ago.  They were arrogrant with a rotten stench of pride.  But after '97, we felt we are actually not as great as we once thought.  And the guy from China, whom we once despised, is now coming down from Shenzhen with so much cash that we actually count stacks of bills by how thick they are (no, not literally but you know what I mean).  It's pathetic ain't it, but it's kept us afloat.  You will think, HKers have no pride!!  Fine, we have no pride.  We are nice to the mainlanders only because they have money, shame on us!  Well I'm sure the Gucci shop in Orchard road will be quite nice to the Indonesian lady or Chinese lady when they dish out money as well.</p>
