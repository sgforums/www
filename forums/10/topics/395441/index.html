              <p>S'poreans must not create an image that new immigrants are not welcomed: SM Goh</p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singaporeans should not create the image that immigrants are not welcomed in the country. <br><br>Speaking at a gathering for new residents in Marine Parade on Saturday, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong also urged new Singaporeans and permanent residents to play their part to make their community a better place to live in. <br><br>Residents are showing the way of how people in the community can bond. They also play games to break the ice and tear down barriers. <br><br>Within the neighbourhood, the list of activities that bring people is growing. <br><br>Among the many activities available at the Marine Parade Community Club to help integrate new Singapore citizens and permanent residents is an international cooking class. It's called the colourful chefs of Marine Parade where a group of citizens from Marine Parade have gotten together to share their cooking cultures with one another. <br><br>Senior Minister Goh said these programmes have one objective. <br><br>He said: "Whether a place is a nice place to live in or not depends on the people. And it depends on how we put in the effort to know one another and make this into a homely place." <br>This process has to be two-way and the onus is also on new immigrants and permanent residents to share and give. <br><br>Mr Goh said: "If they come into Singapore and convey the impression that they are a community apart, they are not part of us and they are here just to take from Singapore and not give back, then sooner or later, the pressure on them will be great. In other words, Singaporeans will say why take them in, they are not contributing.” <br><br>The advice to immigrants and new citizens - move fast. <br><br>SM Goh added: "The immigrants who come in must very quickly absorb the norms and values of Singaporeans. Learn to speak English if you can't speak. You have to communicate and service Singaporeans to reach out to Singaporeans. As you become part of us, the next generation, your children, they will now study in our schools and will be very much like any other Singaporean." <br><br>This readiness to integrate was very much alive in 70 new residents and their families who were at the gathering to get to know their grassroots leaders and neighbours better. <br><br>Tun Zow Myint, New Singapore citizen from Myanmar, said: "My parents knew that Singapore is a very safe place for us to move around and very close to home as well. The education system is one of the top class in the world. That's why we stick around in Singapore and bring them up here in Singapore as well." <br><br>Mr Goh added that Singapore has to tackle the challenge of a declining population by topping up with immigrants. <br><br>But it can be selective and ensure that those who came in contributed more. <br><br>Mr Goh stressed that Singapore is not alone in attracting foreign talent to sink their roots in the country. <br><br>New Zealand has a project to attract Singaporeans to work study and live there. <br><br>Currently, some 4,500 Singaporeans had applied for different visas to the country, while statistics from Australia's Immigration Department showed that the country's now home to some 50,000 Singaporeans. - CNA/vm <br></span></p>

              <p>Hypothetically, if the PAP were to ban all foreigners from coming to Singapore to work and live. Singapore would have full employement because the enterprises in Singapore would need all the manpower available, only Singaporeans. The economy cannot expand because of manpower shortage. Also the quality would fall because Singaporeans would know that they have titanium rice bowls. Singapore would be stagnant. Everything would be on hold. You wait for the Singaporean to come and provide you the service you need.</p>
              <p>Then the detractors who are voicing their disapproval of the foreigners now, would be singing an opposite tune. They would be saying that the PAP are stupid in not opening the doors to foreigners as the economy need to be expanded, and the manpower is required.</p>
              <p>The economy need to be expanded to the max possible, so that we can have the widest choice possible in goods and services.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Depends how "open" the foreigner talent pool is.<br><br>I feel that there is not much screening on the overseas talent at all, in particular Service staff. <br><br>Just look amongst yourselves. Service staff cant even speak a word of English, and they are already at work, legally hired by the employer. <br><br>For China service staff in Singapore, some of them just feel Singaporeans should start learning how to speak Mandarin to be able to communicate with them. You don't know how to speak Mandarin, I do not serve you. I encounter this 2 - 3 times already. <br><br>For Filipino service staff in Singapore, they have very good manners, greeting you Madam or Sir .. And everything also no problem. But sometimes, they take 20-30 minutes just to get you a spoon or a knife. I encountered this like 2-3 times too. Service staff say "Yes Sir, I get it for you." And then he go over and chit chat with his peers, ignoring my request totally. -_-"<br><br>And these service staff from China and Phillipines arent as hardworking and as fast as the government had potrayed. Most of the time, they are in fact, much lazier and always opt for the easier tasks, throwing those difficult jobs to peers in the same level. <br><br>Only when the bosses are around do they suddenly become enlightened, while the typical Singaporean wants to nag and complain to the employer, but gets ticked off instead. </p></div>

              <p>The national language was during the nation formative years, and was mostly to aplease the neighbouring countries.</p>
              <p>Now English is becoming more and more a global language, out pacing French.</p>
              <p>While Mandarin is regional. </p>
              <p>Malay is more localised.</p>

              <p><br>What ever happen to the PAP insistence in learning from the experiences of other small countries with similar difficulties as was done when Singapore was suddenly given independence and had to grope around to find a path forward ?</p>
              <p>Did we not draw lessons from Switzerland, Israel, Malta, and some other smaller sized European countries as well ?</p>
              <p>Have Switzerland and Israel need any help from massive inflow of immigrants to take up citizenship just to ensure progress in their economic enterprises, or to ensure full employment, or to supplement their falling birth rates to achieve replacement in their population numbers ?</p>
              <p>All these countries - that Singapore had drawn lessons from in 1966 -  continued with their open political system of full citizen involvement in the political process; with Switzerland having a political leadership that do not assume themselves to be smarter then the sum total of all the intelligence of the citizens.</p>
              <p>The prosperity and stability of Switzerland is due to the Swiss Citizens being given a stake in the political process in that they are consulted on all major policies which can affect their interests - and done in a process called "Referendum".</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the PAP leadership has no confidence in their own policies nor with Singaporeans, and will not allow Singaporeans to have any say in political issues that affect our own lives through "Referendum".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is a fallacy to claim that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">The economy need to be expanded to the max possible, so that we can have the widest choice possible in goods and services</span></em>" - given the fact that we have limited resources in land, relevant technical skills and technology.</p>
              <p>The "father of Singapore's economy and industrialisation" - Dr Goh Keng Swee - had always advocated the need for Singapore to do what we do best, instead of trying to be the best in everything but being master of none.</p>
              <p>The economic "theory of comparative advantage" that Dr Goh had led Singapore in the early path towards industrialisation had given a foundation to grow within our limited resources.</p>
              <p>Now it seems to have been forgotten as the long period of success has resulted in sheer arrogance in the thinking of the PAP leadership - leading them to believe that they are omnipotently infallible.</p>
              <p>Is Singapore spreading our resources too thin and attempting to be involved in too many directions - to be the top in technology, bio-science, pharmaceutical, ship building and maintenance; to be a regional hub for air and sea transportation, to be a regional financial hub; to be the center of Southeast Asia in the film industry, in computer sciences, and communications ?</p>
              <p>It has always been the PAP policy of getting the "talent" if none is available locally so as to get the desired plans accomplished.</p>
              <p>Has anyone actually done an audit to all the projects that the PAP government has led Singapore to undertake ?</p>
              <p>What has been the returns - in financial terms - considering the huge R+D grants given to some of these new fields of bio-science and pharmaceutical niches that Singapore insist on having ?</p>
              <p>Does the financial returns justify the social and economic burden to the Singapore population ?</p>
              <p>Living within our means remains an Asian Value - and it seems to have been forgotten when it should never have been lost.</p>

              <p>lol. thats your assumption that all foreigners who enters are skilled in some manner.</p>
              <p>let me share a real experience from work.</p>
              <p>an aircon unit at my workplace broke down (those AHU types), and a precision aircon company was called in for repair works.</p>
              <p>i have met many of their service and repair crews, and 100% of them are foreigners, mostly malaysians and prcs. most of them have low education, but they learn the skill on the job.</p>
              <p>but there are some, whom i dun understand how they manage to apply for a work permit at all. they are iliterate, doesn't have any experience handling ANY type of aircon, and literally can't figure out a hammer from a screwdriver. according to his fellow colleagues, he is totally useless, and hired solely base on the merit that he is cheap.</p>
              <p>this shows how lax our "immigration policy" is.</p>

              <p>According to my understanding in my research in modern history of singapore,</p>
              <p>Foreigners working in Singapore is not a new issue, in the early industrialisation of our nation, we already got lots of foreigners, good, skillful, educated and well mannered foreigners we called them expatriates, and they have been with us for so many years, mentoring us on how work is to be done. They are the top level talented foreigners from Britain, Japan, Germany, Holland, France and USA. These are what we want, these are the real crucial peoples who will really help to expand our economy, our lifestyle and our Productivity. And, if you look at it,  during these period, from late 60s to early 90s, we learned and relearned from them, there were no shortage of Singaporeans taking up jobs, and the most we had were foreign maids, yet we have record double digits GDP in almost most of the years except the mid 80s recession.  There were no issue about foreigners, we worked hard, we were very productive, reaching high productivity level of 30 to 50% compare to a mere negative or a pathetic 0.1% of today productivity. We justified our wages of that time, which lag behind productivity, meaning we deserve that kind of paid and yet company is earning. We should have kept those foreigner peoples, the real talented ones to stay and make a living here, yet after the mid 90s..one by one left..if you look at those school, the jap, french, german, etc etc schools are getting less intake or some closing down, you know that they had left, because simply, they feel that Singapore govt is attracting the wrong peoples in, and they would not want to be a part of it.</p>
              <p>In comparing with today, what are we attracting?? for that you can see it yourself on the street? are they really helping us or helping themselves, did our productivity goes up higher because of them, and more importantly, have our wages increase or decrease with the ever higher and higher cost of living?? If wages is suppose to lag behind productivity, why are our govt taking so high a paid when productivity was at a negative stage??</p>
              <p>I am not saying that attracting foreigners is wrong or right, it is not a new issue, but the differences of yesterday attraction and today is a total difference in the substance of what we attracted. Yesterday foreigners are very well talented, respected our culture, teaches and make us a better nation, today foreigners are a bunch of peoples who are helping themselve more than helping us. And if Goh Tong Tong is asking them to blend into us, I think he must be go now to Chinatown or Serangoon to look for himself, or even my place in Geyland and Joo Chiat, the reverse is true, Singaporeans are blending themselve into foreign culture from India, China, Mynamar and philippine more than foreigners blending into us.</p>
              <p>If the  foreign intake policy is not relook into it, a backlash can be true, and by that time, the returns can be diseaster leading to cultural revolution, internal strifes and total identity chaos in near future when all groups are formed to retaliate each other for supremacy.</p>
