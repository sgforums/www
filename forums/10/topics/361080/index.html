              <p>7.    The investigations into the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Marxist
              conspirators </span>led to an unexpected discovery.  A US diplomat stationed
              here, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hank Hendrickson, </span>had been interfering in Singapore politics,
              acting through <span style="color: #ff0000;">Francis Seow</span>, who was then President of the Law
              Society.  Hendrickson had asked Seow to lead a group of lawyers to
              contest elections against the PAP.  In a sworn affidavit, Seow admitted
              that he had been to Washington to meet Hendrickson’s superior in the US
              State Department, who had assured him of refuge in America were he to
              run into difficulties with the government.  And so they did, when
              Seow’s secret collusion came to light. </p>
              <p>8.    Such foreign clandestine operations are part
              and parcel of “the Great Game” between countries, even friendly ones. 
              More such cases are documented in the ISD Heritage Centre.  When the
              Centre receives foreign visitors, it often has to hide away the
              relevant displays temporarily, out of consideration for our guests. 
              These episodes taught us that it was just as important to monitor our
              friends as we do our enemies.''</p>

              <p>Simple and logical explanation, it's because Francis Seow (Former Harvard Professor) is more capable than LKY, the old man fears that his position is in jeopardy, that's why arrested him and threw him in jail.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of all the "ficticious" crimes Francis Seow was "accused" of, was he convicted of any?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only crime that the old man can muster up against him was tax evasion (convicted in absentia, with his prosecutors, judge and jury). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, it is possible to convict even the most prudent of tax payers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> If you pick up $1 on the streets (income sourced in Singapore) and did not declare it in your tax returns, it is possible to convict you of tax evasion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's a matter of whether the old man deem you a threat so as to take such extreme measures to secure his power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, are those other lawyers (representing the so called "Marxist" conspirators) you mentioned in <strong>politics</strong> like Francis Seow?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Francis Seow wanted to change Singapore political scene to a more democratic one, that's like going against the grain of LKY's authoritarian ideology.</p>

              Yew’s Prison</span></span></em><span><em><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333;"> </span></em></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333;">is an excellent study
              of the conceit and deceit of a man many Singaporeans thought they knew. The
              author, Francis Seow, is a former solicitor general and president of the Law
              Society in Singapore. This is his first-hand account of how he has suffered
              under the PAP government’s use of biased legislation and media manipulation to
              maintain political hegemony.<br> <br> In Devan Nair’s words, Seow’s book is an eye-opener, “<a href="http://singaporeelection.blogspot.com/2006/05/feature-on-tang-liang-hong.html"><span style="color: #6699cc;">for those whose eyes still require
              to be opened</span></a>”. The former president of Singapore, who incurred the
              “implacable wrath of a political genius gone awry” [referring to Lee Kuan Yew]
              for his public defence of Francis Seow, was labelled an alcoholic in a White
              Paper tabled before the Parliament.<br> <br> Despite that, Nair traded blows with the government in several hard-hitting
              press statements and included a scathing attack on Lee in the foreword of this
              book: “Today, Lee no longer deals with his equals, but with his chosen
              appointees, who did not earn power the hard way, but had it conferred on them.
              They are highly qualified men, no doubt, but nobody expects them to possess the
              gumption to talk back to the increasingly self-righteous know-all that Lee has
              become. Further, the bread of those who conform is handsomely buttered. Keep
              your head down and you could enjoy one of the highest living standards in Asia.
              Raise it and you could lose a job, a home, and be harassed by the Internal
              Security Department or the Inland Revenue Department, or by both, as happened
              to Francis Seow.”<br> <br> Such unsavoury opinion of Lee was shared by Seow, who wrote: “The passage of
              years, far from mellowing the prime minister, has made him more imperiously
              intolerant of the common man. His abrasive, intrusive style of governance has
              not changed, and is best exemplified by this statement, brimming with his
              customary, boastful insensibility, in the Straits Times of 20 April 1987: ‘I am
              often accused of interfering in the private lives of citizens. Yes, if I did
              not, had I not done that, we wouldn’t be here today. And I say without the
              slightest remorse, that we wouldn’t be here, we would not have made economic
              progress, if we had not intervened on very personal matters – who your
              neighbour is, how you live, the noise you make, how you spit, or what language
              you use. We decide what is right. Never mind what the people think.’”<br> <br> Referring to Lee’s brutal treatment of Nair, Seow lamented “there are,
              regrettably, very few Singaporeans with that rare courage and intellectual, let
              alone political, honesty to call a spade a spade”.<br> <br> On his part, Seow’s account of the horrendous process of interrogation he
              underwent at the Whitley Detention Centre includes disturbing dialogues like
              the following utterance by an Internal Security Department (ISD) officer:
              “Look, cut out all your court English. This is not a court of law. The rules of
              evidence do not apply here. We make the rules here. This is a kangaroo court.
              No one can help you, no one. All the human rights organisations can do is make
              a little noise, but how long can they keep it up? After a while, you will be
              forgotten.”<br> <br> This devious way of thinking was also evident at the press conference following
              the arrest of the supposedly Marxist conspirators, which triggered off a chain
              of events leading to Seow’s subsequent detention. When asked by Archbishop
              Gregory Yong for proof of the involvement of Vincent Cheng, et al, in
              clandestine communist activities, Lee interjected with a sharp disclaimer, “I
              have never said that I was going to prove anything in a court of law”, which
              left his audience stunned. He continued: “It is not the practice nor will I
              allow subversives to get away by insisting that I [have] got to prove
              everything against them in a court of law or evidence that will stand up to the
              strict rules of evidence of a court of law.”<br> <br> Contrast this to what Lee said during the Legislative Assembly Debate on 15
              September 1955: “If it is not totalitarian to arrest a man and detain him, when
              you cannot charge him with any offence against any written law – if that is not
              what we always cried out against in<span> </span><a href="http://mindbloggingstuff.blogspot.com/2005/04/is-lee-kuan-yew-fascist.html"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Fascist states</span></a><span> </span>– then what is it?”<br> <br> This, and several other quotes of Lee’s speeches in the 1950s and 1960s, were
              cleverly used by Seow throughout the book to show how Lee has become almost
              everything he used to be against since he came into power.<br> <br> Seow also quoted to potent effect a comment by Jerome A. Cohen, a prominent
              legal representative of Asia Watch, who found deeply disturbing both the use of
              psychological torture and what he called a pervasive Singaporean, if not Asia
              view that “if you haven’t hit somebody, it isn’t torture”.<br> <br> Seow’s description of his harrowing experience during detention seemed to have
              confirmed Cohen’s observation: “He [an ISD officer] swung his hand at me. I
              braced myself for the blow. But his fist stopped short just inches from my
              face. He looked like a thug. He behaved like a thug. He was a thug. …. Amidst
              deafening obscenities, he swaggered up to me and repeatedly blew thick clouds
              of cigarette smoke into my face. … Venting his frustration at my continued
              silence, he demanded that I take off my shirt leaving my upper body bare under
              the air-conditioner duct. No one stopped him. I reluctantly complied. It was
              cold. Very cold. Very very cold.”<br> <br> Later in the book, Seow described the ISD’s tactics as such: “The word ‘torture’
              normally evokes visions of medieval cruelty and violence, of racks,
              thumbscrews, and other exquisite instruments of pain and suffering. But the
              prime minister’s version of the Spanish Inquisition is more subtle and no less
              effective. A detainee can be made to admit anything by the simple expedience of
              prolonged deprivation of his sleep – a most effective weapon in the ISD armoury
              of persuasions, which is its standard procedure.”<br> <br> The author also highlighted some of the dirty tricks used by the ISD: “For
              years, the conference room of the Barisan Sosialis headquarters was wiretapped
              without the leaders being aware of it. And the bugging of the residence of
              Barisan Sosialis’ chairman, [the late] Dr. Lee Siew Choh, was only discovered
              when workmen accidentally found the bugging device above the ceiling of the
              dining room whilst making repairs in his home.”<br> <br> Seow further opined that the so-called Marxist conspirators were really just a
              group of young, intelligent, and idealistic graduates who could give the Worker’s
              Party credibility and status if they were to enrol as members. But, according
              to Seow, it was crucial, using officialdom’s favourite metaphor, to “nip them
              in the bud” before the flowers could bloom and contend.<br> <br> <em>To Catch A Tartar</em><span><em> </em></span>is

              charged for dishonesty for "over-claiming" a taxi fare by something
              like an insignificant sum of "S$1.40" - when the charges for the
              route taken by the taxi from NUS to his place of destination (a kindergarten)
              can be some variance depending on the traffic conditions at different times of
              the day, or different days of the week, or different week of the month, or the
              year when the month has school holidays.</span></p>

              any charges to tar CSJ - his NUS Faculty Head (who is a PAP Henchman) pulled
              out the travel claims that were approved more then a year before CSJ decided to
              ignore the invitation to join the PAP, and prefer to allow himself to be
              nominated as a SDP candidate.</span></p>

              charges of dishonesty involved postage stamps that CSJ claimed for sending his
              research papers to a US University for assessment, and with his research papers
              also including the research works from his wife that was accepted by the
              university in the USA. This matter of his wife's research work being included
              was also declared by CSJ in the list of contents declared in his postage
              claims, and was approved with payment settled prior to CSJ's election campaign.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">These
              administrative papers in the NUS were extracted and used by the PAP to tar CSJ
              so as to neutralize his popularity when he first entered politics - as it was
              more then 30 years since a tertiary educated person had joined the Alternative

              standards of politics be expected in Singapore when it is run by desperate
              politicians insisting to impose their self-serving double standard rules set

              jury). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, it is possible to convict even the most prudent of
              tax payers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> If you pick up $1 on the streets (income
              sourced in Singapore) and did not declare it in your tax returns,
              it is possible to convict you of tax evasion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's a matter of whether the old man deem you a threat so as to
              take such extreme measures to secure his power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, are those other lawyers (representing the so called
              "Marxist" conspirators) you mentioned in
              <strong>politics</strong> like Francis Seow?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Francis Seow wanted to change Singapore political scene to a
              more democratic one, that's like going against the grain of LKY's
              authoritarian ideology.</p>

              <p>Seriously, either you are a moron or you have zero comprehension abilities. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> I thought we have been in this all familiar road before in your previous thread about Francis Seow and you still chose to believe what your delusional brain thinks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you were basing your understanding that Francis Seow wasn't ever in Harvard on this article, then seriously it's time to get yourself back in Primary school. The statement just means that at present he is no longer with Harvard, it does not mean he wasn't ever in Harvard. I hope this isn't too complicated for your minute brain to comprehend. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Evidently Goh Chok Tung, the puppet who is keeping the Prime Minister's seat warm for one of Dictator Lee Kuan Yew's sons, became fearful at the revelation in this space that he may be confronted on his great day by the exiled <strong>Singaporean dissident Francis Seow, now a fellow at Harvard Law School.</strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Even LKY admitted that Francis Seow was in Harvard:</p>
              <p>MR LEE SAID HE'S CONVINCED THAT SINGAPORE WILL BECOME BETTER DESPITE THE ATTACKS FROM WESTERN HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS AND FRANCIS SEOW, <strong>WHO'S NOW A FELLOW AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY</strong>. IN: YOU MAY IMPRESS.... OUT: ...NO VOTES IN SINGAPORE. DUR: .35" MR LEE SAID SINGAPORE HAS TAKEN THE RIGHT STEPS FOR ITS FUTURE AND IT'S NOT IN SINGAPORE'S INTEREST TO HAVE IT SAID THAT ITS JUDGES ARE COMPLIANT OR CORRUPT.</p>

They won the 1959 election with the left-wing leaders as part of the PAP; The 1961 referendum had only one reasonable choice (the other two would have reduced Singaporeans to second-class citizens in Malaysia); the 1963 election was a snap election fought in the wake of Operation Cold Store, which arrested all the top Barisan leaders; and the 1968 election was boycotted by the Barisan.’  </a></p>

              <p>Do you seriously believe that LKY did not get support also from China so that he can consolidate his own power in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>He arrange for the Chinese Government to cut their support for all Communist Party activities in Malaya - which he claimed is backing the politics of Barisan Sosialist.</p>
              <p>This is a lie that he continue to perpetuate when he know full well that the Barisan Sosialists was formed by ex-members of the PAP, who were unhappy with LKY insistence in pushing Singapore into merger as part of a larger Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Although these members were leaning on 'socialist idealism' as LKY was in his younger days, these ex-PAP members were not Communists.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LKY received support also from the USA to help himself to stay in power by involving Singapore in the US war in Vietnam in the late 1960s, opening Singapore as a logistics base to support US military efforts fighting the Communist forces in Vietnam.</p>
              <p>Singapore was a convenient R&amp;R stopover for US personnel taking a break from the war, and allowed them to have near immunity from local entertainment laws in an exclusive facility now known as Serene House.</p>

              <p>The US Embassy staff that was accused of interfering in local politics by meeting with Francis Seow over a cup of coffee - is no different from our own Government Leaders and Embassy Staff having informal meeting with members of the Opposition Political Parties in UK, USA, Australia, and New Zealand over tea or coffee.</p>
              <p>Our Singapore Embassy staff in these countries has regular meetings to gain the different political views of these members so as to understand how to position our own political stand vis-a-vis those whom LKY see as Allies.</p>
              <p>Did the US Embassy Staff cross the line having an informal meeting with Francis Seow without seeking any approval from the Singapore Government - when Francis Seow is not even a public servant ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The noisy pussy is no better than a carpet beggar for the PAP to use as a mouth piece to spread seemingly innocuous views that pollute the truth and common sense.</p>
