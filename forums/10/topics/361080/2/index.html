              <p>Can the Singapore ISD interrogation be comparable to the US military tribunals created to investigate the guilt of the Guantanamo detainees - that has a tribunal judge, prosecution lawyers representing the State and defense lawyers assigned to the accused all of whom are US Military Officers trained in their legally assigned appointments ?</p>

              <p>China's support to regional and global insurgencies have been well documented in a 1973 CIA Intelligence Report released in 2007 into the public domain - entitled: </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.foia.cia.gov/CPE/POLO/polo-37.pdf"> ‘Peking’s Support of Insurgencies In Southeast Asia’ (See Page 110 on China’s policies towards Malaya) </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LKY's claim - that he had seeked Deng Xiao-Ping's assistance to cut off support to local insurgencies - is well known amongst those who have read his memoirs. </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.chinese-forums.com/showthread.php?t=3955"> ‘In Lee Kuan Yew's memoir, Lee clearly stated that during his meeting with Deng Xiao Ping in late '70s, Lee stunned Deng what overseas Chinese didn't like about PRC and asked CCP to stop rendering "party-to-party" support to those Communist Parties in Southeast Asia.’  </a></p>
              <p>In a separate report titled <a rel="nofollow" href="http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=TNEKgOFp9mkC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=deng+xiaoping+visit+singapore&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IN6cG9A9pI&amp;sig=_N-k9GBu1k32C9P9BJsCxsmCko0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ByYYSti5CoaGkQX04iA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#PPP1,M1">‘Singapore’s Foreign Policy – Coping with vulnerability : Michael Leifer’  </a>- it indicated that after visiting China in 1979, LKY <span style="font-style: italic;">"let it be known that while in Beijing, he had pointed out how China's support for communist insurgency within South-East Asia was a fundamental obstacle to better relations with regional states" (Page 115).</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, was this another one of those self-inflated claims that is typical of LKY attempt at polishing his own image ? </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>A different version has now appeared, as seen in a press release from the SG PM's Office, the Media Centre reported a speech by MM LKY at the S.Rajaratnam Lecture 09-April-2009 at Shangri-la Hotel - in which the following was part of his speech:</p>
              <p> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pmo.gov.sg/News/Speeches/Minister+Mentor/MM+Lee+on+the+fundamentals+of+foreign+policy+in+Singapore.htm">‘In the 1960s and 1970s, Singapore was berated in the Chinese media as a lackey of the American imperialists. The Malayan Communist Party (MCP) backed by China refused to recognise Singapore’s independence. This changed after Deng Xiaoping visited Singapore in November 1978. It marked a dramatic change in Singapore’s relations with China, and also China’s relations with Southeast Asia. Deng visited Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur before he arrived in Singapore. He personally saw that China had fallen behind these supposedly backward cities. Also, he concluded that China had to stop supporting insurgencies in Southeast Asia if he wanted ASEAN to support the resistance to Vietnam’s invasion of Cambodia.’  </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>US President Nixon had already broken the ice by visiting China in 1972, and had opened China again to the World, which unfortunately was not taken up by the ideologue in Mao - even as the more progressive Chou En-lai had desired progress for China.</p>
              <p>It was not until Deng Xiao-ping's visit to Singapore in late 1978 that he was able to appreciate that China had to change course : </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/09/weekinreview/the-world-china-sees-singapore-as-a-model-for-progress.html"> ‘The emulation of Singapore, an island-state whose population of 2.7 million is 77 percent ethnic Chinese, reflects a growing consensus among China's leaders that prosperity and order are more important than Marxist ideology. Singapore is attractive in that it has enjoyed an economic miracle with political stability in a system dominated by a single political party that the voters regularly return to power by overwhelming margins.' </a></p>

              <p>Despite China's taking Singapore as a model for the economic development of their coastal cities, the regional politics of Southeast Asia require LKY to set a policy that Singapore can establish diplomatic ties with China only after the other ASEAN countries had initiated ties with China first.</p>

              <p>Did the US send in troops into the Middle-east to fight alongside Israeli troops - in the same way that the US had sent in more then 400,000 soldiers into Vietnam to support the South Vietnamese Military ?</p>
              <p>The closest that the US interfered in the Middle-east affairs was to provide direct military aid to Israel that counter-balance the military aid from Soviet Russia to all the 10 Arab countries that were determined to annihilate Israel militarily.</p>

              <p>What makes you think that Singapore is "aka South East Asia" ?</p>
              <p>Can a Singapore population of 4.4 Million multi-ethnic people that is largely 78% Chinese, 13% Malays, 8% Indians and 1% Eurasian be "aka" representative of the 240 Million Indonesians of which 86% are largely Muslims; or the 98 Million Filipinos who are 81% Catholics; or the 87 Million Vietnamese of which 80% has no religion; or the 66 Million Thais who are 91% Buddhist; or the 48 Million Myanmese with 80% Buddhists; or 26 Million Malaysian with 60% Muslims; or the other smaller nations of Cambodia, Laos and Brunei ?</p>
              <p>What makes you think that life cannot be better with a push towards Democracy - with or without US help ?</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the present political deadlock is reflective of the "Works-in-Progress" of Thailand's journey towards a higher level of Democracy - in the same path that more mature Democracies have taken in the course of their nation's history.</p>
              <p>Thailand today has rid itself from the past Military Dictatorship of ONE Man Rule that was not accountable to the Thai Citizens. </p>
              <p>The Thai Citizens have the ability to hold their government responsible for the decisions made against the interests of the nation - can Singaporeans claim the same ability to voice their concern in more vocal ways to be heard ?</p>
              <p>Can Singaporeans hold our Government accountable for the mistakes in their decisions forced onto Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>The US has been in Singapore since the Vietnam War in the 1960s - when Singapore open the doors to allow the US military personnel to take an R&amp;R break from the war, giving them a place at the present day Serene House - for unrestricted entertainment that are not subject to local laws, and with the place restricted to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Even to this day, US Military maintain an active low profile presence in Singapore with their logistic office here being specially invited by the Singapore Government, who has also purpose built the Changi Naval Base in deep waters that allow the largest US Aircraft Carriers to berth and take on new supplies of fuel, ammo, and food.</p>
              <p>US combat and support aircrafts operate through Singapore, making regular and frequent landings at Paya Lebar and Changi Air Base.</p>
              <p>Besides Singapore, the US naval ships also make frequent stops at other Southeast Asian ports to take on supplies or make minor repairs, and spread their wealth through such visits to other neighboring countries with the encouragement from the Singapore Government.</p>
              <p>Does Singapore and the South East Asian region resemble anything like the political instability and insecurity in the Middle-east ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Dont forget the demography of S.E.A., quite similar to middle east, with Singapore becoming a second Isreal."</span></span></span></p>
              <p>In the Middle-east, Israel is surrounded by more then 8 countries with populations that have high percentage of Muslims and with Islam as the common State religion.</p>
              <p>If you revisit the demographic data given in the preceding paragraph, you will note that between Singapore's two closest neighbors - both may have majority population being Muslims, and only Malaysia has Islam as a State Religion, while Indonesia has maintain itself as a secular state.</p>
              <p>With different political history and development of the relationship in ASEAN - compared to the countries in the Middle-east, can Singapore be a second Israel ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is dangerous to perpetuate a paranoid "siege" mentality.</p>

              <p>Was there any "direct US interference" to the Middle East politics that affected Israel - in terms of military intervention or support to Israeli military operations ?</p>
              <p>Yes, there was "direct US interference" in Iraq - which begun from the conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that led to Kuwait being invaded; and after the war - the "direct interference" continued with the imposition of the UN sanctions on Iraq to limit her military threat to all the neighboring countries in the region.</p>
              <p>The second invasion of Iraq was based on the initial assessment of Iraq's political leadership development of Weapons of Mass Destruction, and the continued refusal of Iraqi political leadership to be forthcoming and open to UN inspections.</p>
              <p>It was only with hindsight, and the opportunity to have open events after the second invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein - that revealed as many mistakes and wrong conclusions that led to the invasion. However, it also reveal new evidences to the scale of internal destruction and murder conducted by Saddam Hussein and his cronies against the Iraqi minority groups.</p>
              <p>The second invasion brought a new beginning for the Iraqis.</p>

              <p>No, I am not a diehard supporter of USA nor Israel.</p>
              <p>Both should be subjected to scrutiny by the International Court of Justice - if they are signatories to the UN Charter, and when both expect the UN to function neutrally.</p>
              <p>There are several events that both will be surely found guilty of war crimes.</p>

              <p>Do you consider this as a direct military interference ?</p>
              <p>As I had stated in my preceding reply, US did provide support to Israel to counter the political agenda of the Soviet Union in their support given to the Arab countries.</p>
              <p>There was no denial that the US did deliver tons of weapons to the Israelis to put Israel on an equal footing to the quality and sophisticated weapons delivered to her Arab neighbors.</p>
              <p>Still it was one Israel, against Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Libya, and Iran - with the Islamic forces from Lebanon providing another undeclared front.</p>

              <p>After the second Iraqi War, even Colin Powell was dealt a deathblow to his prestige.</p>

              <p>That is true.</p>
              <p>His plot to see Hitler attack Soviet Union while Britain stood on the sidelines failed.</p>
              <p>The british are so shameful of this episode in british history that to this day they still teach total rubbish in their history books on Chamberlain's true goals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And by this date, certain members of the Milner Group and of the
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>British Conservative government had reached the fantastic idea that
                  they could kill two birds with one stone by setting Germany and Russia
                  against one another in Eastern Europe.</strong></span></p>
              <p>In this way they felt that the
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>two enemies would stalemate one another</strong></span>, or that Germany would become
                  satisfied with the oil of Rumania and the wheat of the Ukraine.</p>
              <p>It
                  never occurred to anyone in a responsible position that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Germany and
                  Russia might make common cause, even temporarily, against the West. 
                  Even less did it occur to them that Russia might beat Germany and thus
                  open all Central Europe to Bolshevism.</strong></span></p>
              <p>In order to carry out this plan of<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> allowing Germany to drive eastward
                  against Russia</strong></span>, it was necessary to do three things: </p>
              <p>(1) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>to liquidate
                  all the countries standing between Germany and Russia; </strong></span></p>
              <p>(2) to prevent
                  France from honoring her alliances with these countries;  and</p>
              <p>(3) to
                  hoodwink the English people into accepting this as a necessary, indeed,
                  the only solution to the international problem. </p>
              <p>The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Chamberlain group
                  were so successful in all three of these thing...</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>efforts of the Chamberlain group to continue the policy of
                  appeasement by making economic and other concessions to Germany and
                  their efforts to get Hitler to agree to a four-power pact form one of
                  the most shameful episodes</strong></span> in the history of recent British diplomacy...</p>
