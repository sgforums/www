            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Will these TARNISH S'PORE'S BRAND NAME?<br>By Elysa Chen and Leong Ching<br><br>July 18, 2007 </strong><br><br>MANY people see the Singapore brand as one of reliability and quality.<br><br>Extra rotan strokes<br>But with the closing down of the University of New South Wales (UNSW) campus, has our brand name taken a knock?<br><br>This was the concern of the eight MPs who filed questions in Parliament yesterday asking for an update.<br><br>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar GRC) asked bluntly: 'May I ask the MOS (Minister of State) whether the closure of the private schools here have dented Singapore's reputation as an education hub? Are there measures in place to regain lost ground?'<br><br>Replying, Mr Gan Kim Yong, MOS for the Education Ministry, said the Government was deciding whether it was feasible to introduce an accreditation system and a new regulatory framework.<br><br>But, he added, it was a 'fairly complex issue'.<br><br>'Today, we have some 1,200 private education organisations already operating in Singapore and for us to regulate them, we will have to do so very carefully.'<br><br>The MOE is consulting the industry now to understand its structure better, and is looking to establish a balance between regulation and promotion.<br><br>'We want to regulate and ensure compliance of the law but at the same time we want to make sure that we do not stifle up-and-coming new, emerging private education organisations that are trying to make a mark.<br><br>'So... that is why we have to tread very carefully, consult widely, understand the industry before we introduce a system.<br><br>'In a nutshell, from MOE's point of view, it is more important for us to have a good solution rather than to have a quick solution.'<br><br>Government Parliamentary Committee for Health chair Halimah Yacob (Jurong GRC) also complained about the confusion caused by a lack of 'an effective communication plan'.<br><br>'The impression given is that there was really no effective communication plan or strategy to the students when the news broke out to them and that has caused utter confusion and anxiety,' she said.<br><br>Mr Gan explained that the decision to close the university was made by UNSW itself.<br><br>'We were informed two days beforehand and immediately we swung into action,' he said.<br><br>'We gathered our local universities as well as several private educational organisers to set up a one-stop shop at the UNSW Asia campus to help facilitate our students who are affected by the closure. I think this is the best way that MOE feels that we can extend a helping hand to the students who are faced with this dilemma.'<br><br>Also in the spotlight yesterday was the case of Dickson Tan, who had been in the news for being caned eight times - instead of the five that he was sentenced to.<br><br>He was punished for abetting an illegal moneylender in harassing a debtor and sentenced to nine months' jail and five strokes of the cane. However, he got three extra strokes by mistake.<br><br>In Parliament yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law, Prof S Jayakumar explained that the court clerk had made a mistake when he was transcribing the sentence from the case file onto the warrant of commitment.<br><br>'PUT IT RIGHT'<br><br>The warrant of commitment notifies the Prisons Department of the offender's sentence.<br><br>The error was not spotted at the next level of checks - the sentencing district judge who signed off on the warrant.<br><br>Putting the issue in perspective, the Law Minister said that the Subordinate Courts handle 200,000 criminal cases a year.<br><br>'Even if these mistakes are rare, even if there is only one case, it is one case too many. We have to put it right and ensure it does not recur,' he said.<br><br>The court clerk responsible was allowed to resign, instead of being fired, as his overall performance record was good and because this was his first mistake.<br><br>The district judge in charge of the case was formally cautioned, and taken off judicial work which involves signing warrants of commitment.<br><br>From now on, court officers have to follow checklists when preparing paperwork for commitment to prison.<br><br>Warrants of commitment will now be checked twice at both levels, by another court clerk not involved in the preparation of the warrant, and by a second district judge.<br><br>There is also a review of all administrative procedures within the courts to put in place a system to avoid such mistakes in the future.<br><br>'We take responsibility, and put it right,' said the minister.<br><br>'I think that is the way to uphold and strengthen the hard-won reputation of our legal system for integrity and justice, which we have built up over many years,' said Prof Jayakumar.<br><br></div>
