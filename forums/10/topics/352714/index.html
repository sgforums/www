              <p><em>totalitarian</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In time the ruling class of Russia became acquainted
                  with Byzantine culture. They were dazzled by it, and sought to import
                  it into their wilderness domains in the north. In this way they imposed
                  on the Slav peoples many of the accessories of the Byzantine Empire,
                  such as Orthodox Christianity, the Byzantine alphabet, the Byzantine
                  calendar, the used of domed ecclesiastical architecture, the name Czar
                  (Caesar) for their ruler, and innumerable other traits.</p>
              <p>Most important
                  of all, they imported the Byzantine<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> totalitarian autocracy, under which
                  all aspects of life, including political, economic, intellectual, and
                  religious, were regarded as departments of government, under the
                  control of an autocratic ruler. </strong></span></p>
              <p>These beliefs were part of the Greek
                  tradition, and were based ultimately on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Greek inability to distinguish
                  between state and society. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Since society includes all human activities,
                  the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Greeks had assumed that the state must include all human
                  activities.</strong></span> In the days of Classical Greece this all-inclusive entity
                  was called the <em>polis</em>, a term which meant both society and state; in the later Roman period this all-inclusive entity was called the<em> imperium</em>.</p>
              <p>The only difference was that the <em>polis</em> was sometimes (as in Pericles's Athens about 450 B.C.) democratic, while the <em>imperium</em> was always a military autocracy. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Both were totalitarian, so that
                  religion and economic life were regarded as spheres of governmental
                  activity. </strong></span></p>
              <p>This totalitarian autocratic tradition was carried on to the
                  Byzantine Empire and passed from it to the Russian state in the north
                  and to the later Ottoman Empire in the south. In the north this
                  Byzantine tradition combined with the experience of the Northmen to
                  intensify the two-class structure of Slav society. In the new Slav (or
                  Orthodox) Civilization this fusion, fitting together the Byzantine
                  tradition and the Viking tradition, created Russia.</p>
              <p>From Byzantium came
                  autocracy and the idea of the state as an absolute power and as a
                  totalitarian power, as well as such important applications of these
                  principles as the idea that the state should control thought and
                  religion, that the Church should be a branch of the government, that
                  law is an enactment of the state, and that the ruler is semi-divine.</p>
              <p>From the Vikings came the idea that the state is a foreign importation,
                  based on militarism and supported by booty and tribute, that economic
                  innovations are the function of the government, that power rather than
                  law is the basis of social life, and that society, with its people and
                  its property, is the private property of a foreign ruler.</p>
              <p>     These concepts of the Russian system must be
                  emphasized because they are so foreign to our own traditions. In the
                  West, the Roman Empire (which continued in the East as the Byzantine
                  Empire) disappeared in 476 and, although many efforts were made to
                  revive it, there was clearly a period, about 500AD , when there was no
                  empire, no state, and no public authority in the West.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The state
                  disappeared, yet society continued. So also, religious and economic
                  life continued. This clearly showed that the state and society were not
                  the same thing, that society was the basic entity, and that the state
                  was a crowning, but not essential, cap to the social structure. This
                  experience had revolutionary effects.</span></strong></p>
              <p>It was discovered that man can
                  live without a state; this became the basis of Western liberalism. It
                  was discovered that the state, if it exists, must serve men and that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it
                  is incorrect to believe that the purpose of men is to serve the state.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> It was discovered that economic life, religious life, law, and private
                  property can all exist and function effectively without a state.</strong></span> From
                  this emerged laissez-faire, separation of Church and State, rule of
                  law, and the sanctity of private property.</p>
              <p>In Rome, in Byzantium, and
                  in Russia, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>law was regarded as an enactment of a supreme power. </strong></span>In the
                  West, when no supreme power existed,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> it was discovered that law still
                  existed as the body of rules which govern social life.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Thus law was
                  found by observation in the West, not enacted by autocracy as in the
                  East.</p>
              <p>This meant that authority was established by law and under the
                  law in the West, while authority was established by power and above the
                  law in the East.</p>
              <p>The West felt that the rules of economic life were
                  found and not enacted; that individuals had rights independent of, and
                  even opposed to, public authority; that groups could exist, as the
                  Church existed, by right and not by privilege, and without the need to
                  have any charter of incorporation entitling them to exist as a group or
                  act as a group; that groups or individuals could own property as a
                  right and not as a privilege and that such property could not be taken
                  by force but must be taken by established process of law.</p>
              <p>It was
                  emphasized in the West that the way a thing was done was more important
                  than what was done, while in the East what was done was far more
                  significant than the way in which it was done.</p>

              defending our country, we find it hollow. This Government has betrayed
              all the vital interests of the people to the British. It has no right
              to talk of defending the nation. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This Government is oppressing the
              people; more than 200 political leaders and trade unionists are in the
              jails of Singapore. Our Secretary- General, Mr Lim Chin Siong, is in
              Changi and political dwarfs like Mr Lee Kuan Yew can strut around and
              talk big only when giants like Mr Lim Chin Siong are kept out of the
