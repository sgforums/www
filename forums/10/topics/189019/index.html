            <div class='col-md body'>Found this:<br><br>"Repression, Sir is a habit that grows. I am told it is like making love-it is always easier the second time! The first time there may be pangs of conscience, a sense of guilt. But once embarked on this course with constant repetition you get more and more brazen in the attack. All you have to do is to dissolve organizations and societies and banish and detain the key political workers in these societies. Then miraculously everything is tranquil on the surface. Then an intimidated press and the government-controlled radio together can regularly sing your praises, and slowly and steadily the people are made to forget the evil things that have already been done, or if these things are referred to again they're conveniently distorted and distorted with impunity, because there will be no opposition to contradict."<br><br>- Lee Kuan Yew as an opposition PAP member speaking to David Marshall, Singapore Legislative Assembly, Debates, 4 October, 1956<br><br>http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew<br><br>Dunno if the quote is real.

            <div class='col-md body'>As the old saying goes, we must change with the time.<br><br>The missing part of memoir says: "When  I was once a young man, like that JG, I really hated Repression as it meant: silencing of the unions and oppositions and that was wholly bad and evil.<br><br>Well time has changed and like I always said, we ought to change with the time.<br><br>We must think out of the box. No body should feel repressed if control is good for the country. It may be necessary to repress - the first time would be full of pangs but then after a while it would be easier to get used to and then with a little practice, repression would be no more repression as no one would ever know it and there would be no one to feel it.
