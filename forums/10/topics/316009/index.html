              <p>Tuesday, 29 April 2008	
              
              
              <img src="http://yoursdp.org/images/stories/items/tak%20t-shirt.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" align="right">Singapore Democrats<br><br>Come down to Toa Payoh Central on Thursday and get your <em>Tak Boleh Tahan</em>!
              T-shirts for $12 and buttons for $2. We have had many requests to
              purchase these items since our protest outside Parliament House on 15
              Mar 08.<br><br>The revenue generated from the sales will be used for
              future campaign purposes. So come and support our campaign against the
              rising cost of living in Singapore.<br><br>While inflation may be a global phenomenon, the Government has done little to ease the burden of the ordinary people.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In
              fact some of its policies are the main cause of the horrendous rise in
              prices. The raising of the GST from 3 to 5 to 7 percent, the
              mushrooming of the number of ERP gantries, the escalation of land
              prices are just some examples.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The
              Government then said that it was "pleasantly" surprised at the
              collection of $6 billion in taxes and revenue last year, putting the
              spin that it was through good governance that brought about the
              windfall. There is nothing good about such governance. There is only
              state greed.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We know you are
              hurting, Singaporeans, and that you are absolutely sick and tired of
              being kicked around by the PAP. But if you choose to cower in fear,
              nothing will change and the PAP will continue to lord over you.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Remember,
              the ministers are there to serve the people. But they have cleverly
              used their positions to intimidate the people and abused their power
              for their self-serving needs.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We also know that you want to do something about this. Well, you can.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><img src="http://yoursdp.org/images/stories/items/tak%20buttons.png" border="0" alt="" width="200" height="129" align="left">Come
              to Toa Payoh Central on Thursday, 1 May, and support our campaign. We
              want to energise the people to bring about the change that all of us
              want to see. <br><br>The people must realise that we are not
              powerless. We must discover that we, as a people, have the ability to
              bring about democratic change. We must believe in ourselves.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">You
              can start by buying the T-shirts and wearing them to help spread the
              message. Pin on the buttons and let Singaporeans know that it is game
              on! <br><br>There are also other <a href="http://singaporedemocrat.org/articleT-shirts.html">T-shirt</a> designs to choose from. The two best selling ones are: "I love
              Singapore, it's the PAP I can't stand!" and "Singapore Democrat – and
              proud of it!"</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">There are many reasons for you to make your way down to Toa Payoh and absolutely none to miss it: Sign the <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/component/content/article/1-singapore/416-come-and-sign-tak-boleh-tahan-petition-on-may-day-in-wkss-constituency">petition</a>, grab a balloon, chat with the organisers and helpers, help pass out flyers, go on house-to-house visits with us, etc.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Whatever
              you do, don't just stay home. Come and be a part of history, a part of
              the change that is underfoot. It is said that the mightiest army cannot
              stop an idea whose time has come. Democracy is that idea whose time has
              come. <br><br>Times are a-changing and we, the opposition, are
              changing too. We are moving forward with right in our hearts and fire
              in our bellies. Your support in such times is crucial.</p>
              <p>We'll be there from 11 am to 6 pm. We'll keep the light on (in our hearts) for you.<br><br>Don't let Singapore down.</p>

              <p>Thailand is restricting its exports to PREVENT protests, thus increasing rice price for Singapore. Cannot protest against Thai embassy scarly embargo Singapore for delicious Thai rice.</p>
