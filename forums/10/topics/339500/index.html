              <p><strong>Ukraine and Georgia: Entry into NATO Put Off Indefinitely</strong></p>
              <p>by   F. William  Engdahl</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><em>NATO ministers in Brussels have decided to
                  ignore US wishes and to delay the admission of Ukraine and of Georgia
                  in effect indefinitely in what the Washington Administration is
                  sheepishly trying to claim is a positive ‘compromise.’ The decision,
                  following EU member state alarm last August over the prospect of
                  European states having to go to war at some point against Russia over
                  an incalculable despot in the Caucasus or in Kiev who decided to
                  provoke Moscow to react, was simply too much.</em> <br><br></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The
                  Germans have a far too deep and painful collective memory of the last
                  war with Russia to be willing to treat such a prospect as lightly as
                  Condi Rice or Washington seems willing to do. The decision deepens
                  growing tectonic fault lines across the Atlantic, as the ‘Made in USA’
                  financial crisis deepens and the dollar looks more and more vulnerable
                  once hedge fund repatriation effects by yearend wind down. The year
                  2009 will be clearly more turbulent even than 2008 in world geopolitics.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Brussels decision is the
                  more remarkable as an indication of the slipping power of Washington
                  over European NATO members. The December 3 NATO Foreign Ministers
                  Brussels meeting issued what to the naïve observer might appear a
                  masterpiece of diplomacy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> They unanimously agreed to sidestep the usual
                  Membership Action Plan vote for Georgia and Ukraine, the first concrete
                  step towards NATO full membership. Instead, NATO will expand the
                  activities of two existing bodies - the Nato-Georgia Commission and the
                  Nato-Ukraine Commission - basically to oversee the same reforms as
                  would have been contained in the action plan. As well NATO ministers
                  agreed in their communique to renew ties with Russia ‘in a conditional
                  and graduated manner.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Translated into real political
                  language, Washington has undergone a stunning setback in its agenda of
                  encircling Russia with NATO. Despite the fact President-elect Obama
                  retained Bush Administration Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and named
                  a person to be Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who is strongly on
                  record for bringing Georgia and Ukraine into NATO, key European NATO
                  members, led by Germany and France, blocked what must be a unanimous
                  membership decision. </span></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The real reasons</span></strong><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The
                  real reason for the refusal is the growing realization within the
                  European officialdom that it was Georgia’s incalculable President,
                  Mikhail Saakashvili, and not Moscow who initiated the adventure of
                  sending Georgian troops to try to occupy the breakaway province of
                  South Ossetia, that on evident encouragement of Washington.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">On November 28 in Georgian
                  official Parliamentary Commission testimony, on the background to the
                  August events, which saw Russian troops march into parts of Georgia to
                  repel the attack on Ossetians, Saakashvili made the surprising
                  announcement that he had indeed initiated the war. <br><br>According
                  to Saakashvili, the attack on the South Ossetian capital, which
                  involved night shelling of residential areas with multiple rocket
                  launcher systems, was aimed at protecting Georgian citizens. He said it
                  was a response to Russia’s "intervention" in the region. "We did start
                  military action to take control of Tskhinvali and other unruly areas.
                  But we took this difficult decision to fend off our territory from
                  intervention and save the people who were dying. It was inevitable,"
                  Saakavili said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Georgian President claims
                  Russia moved tanks into South Ossetian territory before Georgia
                  launched its attack. He said: "The issue is not about why Georgia
                  started military action – <strong>we admit we started it. </strong>The issue is
                  about whether there was another chance when our citizens were being
                  killed? We tried to prevent the intervention and fought on our own
                  territory."<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Saakashvili’s surprising
                  admission came only hours after the testimony of Georgia’s former
                  Ambassador to Moscow, Erosi Kitsmarishvili, who testified for three
                  hours before he was shouted down by pro-Saakashvili members of
                  Parliament. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">A former confidant of President
                  Saakashvili, Kitsmarishvili said Georgian officials told him in April
                  that they planned to start a war in Abkhazia, one of two breakaway
                  regions at issue in the war, and had received a green light from the
                  United States government to do so. He said the Georgian government
                  later decided to start the war in South Ossetia, the other region, and
                  continue into Abkhazia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">He refused to name the
                  officials who he said had told him about planned actions in Abkhazia,
                  saying that identifying them would endanger their lives. The official
                  US line has been that they had ‘warned’ Mr. Saakashvili against taking
                  action in the two enclaves, where Russian peacekeepers were stationed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Kitsmarishvili’s testimony in
                  front of the parliamentary commission, was shown live on Georgian
                  television. The chairman of the commission, Paata Davitaia, said he
                  would initiate a criminal case against Kitsmarishvili for "professional
                  negligence." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Deputy Foreign Minister Giga Bokeria, who was called on
                  short notice to comment on Kitsmarishvili’s testimony, called the
                  allegations "irresponsible and shameless fabrication," and said they
                  were "either the result of a lack of information or the personal
                  resentment of a man who has lost his job and wants to get involved in
                  politics." Mr. Kitsmarishvili was fired in September by the president.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Mr. Kitsmarishvili walked out
                  amid the furor on Tuesday. "They don’t want to listen to the truth," he
                  told reporters. Two days later, Saakashvili proved Kitsmarishvili
                  right. </span></p>
              <p><strong>
              </strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Full Spectrum Dominance</span></strong></p><strong>
              </strong><p></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">As I detail at some length in my book, due out in January 2009<strong><em>, Full Spectrum Dominance: Totalitarian Democracy in the New World Orde</em></strong></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">r,
                  the strategy of bringing Georgia and Ukraine into NATO is part of a far
                  larger and more dangerous strategic long-term plan of Washington to
                  ultimately encircle, confront and dismember Russia as a functioning
                  state. Russia, even more than China, is the most formidable obstacle to
                  a Washington-centered sole Superpower Pax Americana. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Russia’s understandable refusal
                  to abandon its nuclear strike force in the face of US violations of
                  agreements made in 1989 between the Soviet Union’s Mikhail Gorbachev
                  and then-US Secretary of State James Baker III, namely that NATO would
                  not expand east to the former states of the Warsaw Pact or USSR,
                  presents a dilemma for any planned sole US superpower domination. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Bush Presidency was a raw
                  attempt to remedy this by brute military force. The militarization of
                  Iraq and the Middle East oilfields was but one step. The creation of a
                  US ‘missile shield’ in Poland and the Czech Republic, was another, a
                  major step. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The misnamed ‘missile defense
                  shield’ would be in reality an offensive capability that when installed
                  by perhaps 2012, that will put the world, especially Western Europe on
                  a hair-trigger to nuclear war, combined with entry of Russian border
                  states Georgia and Ukraine would simply present Moscow with de facto
                  defeat. This is not about Russia returning to old Soviet-style rule
                  under Putin or Medvedev. It’s about the ultimate survival of Russia as
                  a nation, as Moscow rightly sees it, not about the fine points of
                  democracy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">No one in either Berlin, Paris,
                  London nor Brussels, and certainly not in Washington, is ignorant of
                  that reality. European NATO members are increasingly nervous about the
                  prospect of a military confrontation with Russia. Last August’s swift
                  Russian response to act in aid of South Ossetians against the Georgian
                  invasion sent a reality shock through Europe. Neither Germany nor
                  France wish to admit unstable states like Georgia or Ukraine only to be
                  forced to act militarily in their defense in event of a repeat of the
                  madness of last August. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">That, simply stated, is the
                  real, unspoken reason that Washington on December 3 in Brussels was
                  forced to accept a face-saving compromise. The NATO membership of
                  Georgia and Ukraine to all intent and purposes is dead. As one NATO
                  military official stated, ‘Nato has lost the glue that once held it
                  together.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The statement of Rice following the NATO meeting was telling. She was forced to tell press, ‘…<em>there
                  is a long road ahead for both Georgia and Ukraine to reach those
                  standards. The United States stands resolutely for those standards,
                  meaning that there should be no shortcuts to membership of NATO.’ </em>Rice added.</span></p>
              <p><strong>
              </strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Polish motorcade shoot was ‘Georgia stunt’</span></strong></p><strong>
              </strong><p></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Further adding to the
                  atmosphere of almost Laurel &amp; Hardy comic farce around Georgia’s
                  erratic President, who was filmed shortly after the Russian invasion in
                  August by BBC actually swallowing and chewing on his tie, it has now
                  emerged that an alleged shooting incident a week before the Brussels
                  NATO meeting, involving the motorcade of the Georgian and Polish
                  presidents was a staged ‘stunt.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Special services in Warsaw say
                  the alleged attack near the South Ossetian border was a provocation
                  staged by the Georgians. A report by Poland’s Internal Security Agency
                  (Agencja Bezpieczenstwa Wewnetrznego – ABW), published by the <em>Dziennik</em> newspaper, claims Georgia staged the incident for propaganda purposes. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The incident took place on
                  Sunday evening when Georgian President Saakasvili was showing his
                  Polish counterpart Lech Kaczynski the area near the border with South
                  Ossetia. After the convoy stopped at a checkpoint, there was gunfire,
                  which the Georgians claimed was an ‘attack by Russian troops.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Lech Kaczynski's personal
                  security chief was dismissed. Colonel Krzysztof Olszowiec was accused
                  of failing to ensure proper security for the president during his trip
                  to Georgia. Olszowiec was dismissed despite objections from Kaczynski,
                  according to the Polish media.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The trip to the border area
                  with Russian-backed South Ossetia was the result of a last-minute
                  invitation from Saakashvili, according to Polish Foreign Ministry
                  spokesman Piotr Paskowski. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Initially, Warsaw blamed Russia
                  for the incident. But now Polish security forces say it was staged by
                  Tbilisi. Russia strongly denied the allegations, saying Tbilisi was
                  behind it. President Kaczynski confirmed that shooting had taken place
                  but stopped short of blaming anyone. Russia’s position has now been
                  supported by Poland’s ABW, who said "the shots fired near the cars of
                  Georgian and Polish president were a Georgian provocation". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Polish
                  document points out that Saakashvili kept on smiling after the first
                  shots and his bodyguards didn’t react. The report also highlights
                  another suspicious fact, namely, that the bus carrying journalists was
                  instructed to travel in front of the motorcade, while the car with
                  Kaczynski’s own bodyguards was pushed back by Georgian soldiers. The
                  result was that they were not in a position to witness the alleged
                  shooting. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">All in all it might be that
                  Saakashvili’s tenure as President faces major internal challeges for
                  his bent to undertake such reckless stunts. The Obama White House will
                  inherit a plate full of geopolitical problems in Europe next January
                  21.</span></p>
