In the past, they imposed high diesel tax on diesel taxis because of high carbon particulates found in diesel emission. Technology has come a long way since. Diesel engine is much cleaner now. But can they bring down the diesel tax if they allow the import of diesel engine private cars? NO! So they give another excuse - owners of diesel cars cannot be trusted to maintain their cars in tip top condition, so the ban on diesel private cars continues. This way, they still get to keep the high diesel tax they imposed on taxis.</div>
