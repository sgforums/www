            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>As posted at www.youngpap.org.sg<br><br>The international accountancy firm KPMG investigated the business activities of NKF and issued a report on 16 December 2005 including the following conclusions:<br><br>-In 1995 Durai's pay was increased from $12,000 to $18,000. The promotion was backdated six months, so he received another $36,000. On top of that, Durai received a $30,000 bonus "top-up" based on the revised salary.<br><br>-In 1997 Durai was offered a salary of $30,000 a month but he chose to accept only $25,000, a $7,000 increase over his previous wage. The increment was backdated 11 months, amounting to an extra $77,000.<br><br>-September 1997 to October 2003. His overtime pay amounted to $187,000.<br><br>-May 1995 to November 2003. Encashing his leave entitlement brought in another $350,000.<br><br>-In 2004 Durai chalked up an average bill of $32,952 per month on his corporate credit card.<br><br>-In 2004 a $70,000 "study trip" to Las Vegas for six of NKF's staff, including Durai, to get fresh ideas on doing charity shows.<br><br>-In 2004 $430,000 on movie and concert tickets to be given free to "nurture" donors<br><br>-Staff received pay increments as often as four times a year. Former director Matilda Chua's salary rose from $1,300 to $12,500 over nine years.<br><br>-Staff were given exit payments of up to 10 months' salary.<br><br>-Durai used NKF funds to pay bills relating to his wife's Mercedes, including paying for petrol and repairing the car.<br><br>-In 2004 NKF made a surplus of $993,677 from drug sales. Although NKF claimed it helped its patients save over $3.5 million in treatment costs, it had charged its patients a premium for certain discounted drugs, instead of passing the savings on to them.<br><br>So many misdeeds, only worth 3 months jail for NKF TT Durai, Kan-ni-na, then better be corrupt and rob the banks man, here I come!!</blockquote>Were the above-stated wrongdoings by Durai figments of imagination? What did the regulatory authority and minister do with these findings by KPMG?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>JUST a day after one chapter was brought to a close in the National Kidney Foundation scandal, another multi-million-dollar bombshell rocked the charity scene.<br>.<br>The Commissioner of Charities on Friday launched an inquiry into the disappearance of some $3.88 million from the coffers of the St John's Home for Elderly Persons, apparently drawn without authorisation by a staff member.<br>.<br>The loss was discovered on June 8 when two of the home's cheques to its vendors bounced.<br>.<br>The home checked with the bank and found that a fixed deposit account, from which the cheques were to have been paid, had been emptied out.<br>.<br>The next day, a check with another bank revealed that all the home's fixed deposits with it had also been withdrawn, according to a joint press release issued by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) and the home on Friday.<br>.<br>A report was filed with the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports and the police last Monday.<br>.<br>That same day, home superintendent Benjamin Ho, 60 Â— who had gone on overseas leave in late May Â— did not return to work as he was scheduled to. He could not be reached despite repeated calls to his home and mobile phone.<br>.<br>The home, which was set up in 1959 at Macpherson and now has 62 residents Â— some of whom are destitute and homeless Â— does not get any government grants and relies wholly on donations from various churches and members of the public.<br>.<br>When this newspaper dropped in on Friday evening, its Annual General Meeting was under way and the managerial committee had just informed donors and volunteers about the loss. They received the news calmly.<br>.<br>Speaking for the board, honorary treasurer Mr Andrew Lioe told Today: "We all feel very sad. A lot of this was based on trust and so we are quite stunned. Our trust has been betrayed."<br>.<br>Chairman Wilfred Anthonisz declined to speculate on Mr Ho's involvement as the matter is under police investigation.<br>.<br>But the possibility that forgery was involved was raised. According to the home, any withdrawals from the banks required Mr Lioe's signature and that of one of three approved people -- Mr Anthonisz, vice-chairman Mr Woon Wee Yim and honorary secretary Mdm Laureen Tan.<br>.<br>All four have told police they did not sign off on any withdrawals.<br>.<br>Meanwhile, Mr Anthonisz gave the assurance that the home had enough funds to carry on. Its total monthly spending is about $40,000. He said: "We want to carry on running it as normally as possible."<br>.<br>The NCSS is helping to ensure that residents continue to be cared for and, at the home's behest, will take over its financial administration functions in the interim. It will also look at ways to improve the home's financial systems and internal controls.<br>.<br>According to the home's 2005 financial statements posted online, its total expenditure that year was $583,000, while its total assets amounted to $4.66 million and total funds were $4.62 million. The total receipts Â– including from donations, grants, members' fees and investments Â– stood at $613,000.<br>.<br>This development, so close on the heels of other high-profile lapses among charities Â– which led to an overhaul of regulatory systems Â– has shocked observers.<br>.<br>Said Associate Professor Mak Yuen Teen, who sits on the Charity Council and heads the Corporate Governance and Financial Reporting Centre at the National University of Singapore: "The charity sector certainly does not need another one of these episodes. But the commissioner is doing the right thing by stepping in quickly to announce it to the public and investigate it as speedily as possible."<br>.<br>The COC will look into how the loss occurred and assess the governance and financial control systems at the home, whose Institution of Public Character status will be reviewed.<br>Sheralyn Tay and Lin Yanqin<br>sheralyn@mediacorp.</blockquote>If the minister in charge of NKF at the time had acted more effectively, instead of repeating what Durai had claimed to defend him in parliament would we be seeing so many more cases of irregularities at so many charitable institutions?<br><br>Where is the accountability of government ? If government does not believe in helping citizens in needs due to unfortunate unemployments it should at least let them survive by desisting to tax them heavily with all kinds of direct and indirect taxes plus all the profiteering schemes on lands and assets as HDB has been doing after Mah Bow Tan has become minister for ND.<br><br>At the very least if government does not want to offer any help at all to citizens in needs of help due to illness or old age, by making the public look after them through charities, the minister in charge should have ensured charity donations do not get misused by CEOs to enrich themselves as has happened in so many cases.<br></div>

There are essentially three questions the public is most interested in. First, what methods are used to raise the money? Second, how much of the charity dollar is used to raise funds? And, finally, how is the money spent or saved?Â”<br><br>Of the three questions, the third is the most relevant to the issue today: Was NKF in compliance with regulations over how the money spent or saved?<br><br><strong>Mr Lim did not mince words</strong>: Â“<span style="color: red;"><strong>Mr Speaker, Sir, the NKF is in full compliance with the regulations</strong></span><span style="color: darkgreen;">.Â” (emphasis added)<br><br><strong>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong><br><br>Then there was the matter of the National Council of Social Services (NCSS). On Dec 31, 2001, the NCSS revoked the IPC status of NKF. The NCSS took action because it saw the problems within the NKF. And yet, within a month the Ministry of Health reinstated the NKFÂ’s IPC status.<br><br><strong>Now read what Mr Lim told Parliament in 2004</strong>: Â“[The Ministry of Finance] has certain criteria by which [it] evaluates applicants who want IPC status, and these criteria are set by IRAS, and we make sure that people who apply have to qualify before they are given this IPC status.Â” (emphasis added)<br><br>In other words we are given to believe that there was an active search for answers from the NKF before NKF was given clearance to reclaim its IPC status. </span></blockquote></span></span><br><span style="color: darkred;">Ignoring clear calls for some checks to be made with an arrogant dismissal can hardly be called <span style="font-style: italic;">''an oversight''</span> - a term that did not even originate from Minister Khaw Boon Wan, and was coined to allow some idiot to desparately pick it up and make some hopeless defense from an already indefensible position.<br><br>Compared to idiots, it  will be fools that will pick-up trails designed to be a trap, and there will be clowns who will put up the pitiful act of <span style="font-style: italic;">''Ministerial arrogance''</span> when they are no more then just <span style="font-style: italic;">''a puff of hot air''</span> from a self-inflated head similar to a mere size of a mushroom.<br><br>It seems that your bark is worst than your bite - sue anyone in this Speaker's Corner ?

"But there are not many others like these two."<br>.<br>When it comes to managing new media, Mr Mahizhnan believes authorities face a dilemma.<br>.<br>He told Today: "On the one hand, it (the Government) wants to promote information communications technologies (ICT) in Singapore, but on the other hand, it is also concerned about ICT abuses. So, it tries to put certain controls, but unfortunately, the Internet is not easily controlled by any one government or one organisation."<br>.<br>Mr Mahizhnan believes the way forward is to accept that there will be a divergence of views in the digital world. As such, he believes the focus should be on building a socially immune system. Hailing groupings such as the Parents Advisory Group for the Internet (PAGi) as exemplary, he said: "The move for society to build its own defences has to be a many-pronged approach, both top-down and bottom-up."<br>.<br>But will new media have any impact on regulations governing the mainstream press in Singapore?<br>.<br>Another panellist, Associate Professor Tey Tsung Hun who teaches at the National University of Singapore's law faculty, takes a cautious stand. He said: "It is unlikely that we will see any changes in the legislative framework governing the print media in the next two to three years. There is no reason to change the law unless there is evidence that it is not conducive to the Government's aspiration to develop Singapore as a media hub."<br>.<br>But panellist Au was hopeful. Citing the advent of gay websites, he said at the session: "Here is maybe an example where new media can lead to social change which, in turn, in due course might lead to a loosening of regulations governing mainstream media."</blockquote><blockquote>You go and see the blogs set up by the p65 and the YPblog, they hardly put up any new post, and they can hardly argue their points...How do you expect the people to engage them with politics? The worst is p65, must wait for the p65 MPs to certify safe to post, then can get through....Nabe, so scared, don't start a blog la.....Somemore got cheek to ignore my posts.....</blockquote></div>

Kadish</strong><br><br>The law of complicity (or accomplices or aiding and abetting, as it is sometimes called) imposes liability on one person ("S" for secondary party) for a crime committed by another ("P" for principal party) where S intentionally helps or encourages P to do the action constituting that crime.<br><br>The law is inescapably complex since it involves two dimensions of interacting <span style="font-style: italic;">mens rea</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">actus reus</span> problems, those associated with S and those associated with P. I attempted to deal with complicity law generally over a decade ago.(1)<br><br>In this paper I revisit one group of issues, namely <strong>those arising from the <span style="font-style: italic;">mens rea</span> requirement that S must intend his actions to encourage or help P to commit a particular crime</strong>. My earlier study was concerned mainly with why the law of complicity should have taken the form it did. <strong>Here I want to take a more critical view of the requirement of intention and ask how far it can withstand critical scrutiny</strong>.<br><br><strong>The puzzle in the requirement of intention is that it stands in contrast with situations where the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">accountability</span> of an actor <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for the harmful consequences of his action turns on whether he caused them</span></strong>.<br><br>In these latter cases, <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>recklessness as to the occurrence of the consequences</strong></span> (and sometimes <strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">negligence</span></span></strong>) <span style="font-style: italic;">is enough to make the actor criminally liable</span> -- the crime of manslaughter is the commonest example.<br><br>Why should it be different where the consequences of a person's action take the form of the criminal actions of another? <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Can reckless aiding or encouraging the crime of another ever be an acceptable basis for holding S criminally liable?</span></strong> These are the questions I will pursue in this paper.<br><br>The thread of my argument is as follows. <strong>Part I</strong> argues that three main considerations lie behind the law's general requirement that S's help or encouragement of P's crime be intentional -- culpability, the policy of not subjecting lawful practices to excessive risk, and an ethic of individualism and self-determinism. The remainder of the paper considers whether those considerations are incompatible with recklessness as an alternative basis of complicity liability. <strong>Parts II and III</strong> deal with the culpability consideration.<br><br><strong>Part II</strong> describes the one situation where <span style="font-style: italic;">English and American law systematically depart from the requirement of intention and allow negligence or even less to suffice</span>.<br><br>This occurs in what the English misleadingly call "common purpose" or "joint enterprise" cases, where S is already an accomplice of P in some other crime (misleadingly, because the common purpose is to commit some other crime, not the one P commits).<br><br>I argue that the major defects of this doctrine are that it permits punishment for mere negligence, or even less, and that it provides for the conviction of S for a crime for which S lacks the required culpability or its equivalent.<br><br><strong>In Part III</strong>, I argue that the doctrine of reckless complicity can be made compatible with the requirement of culpability by restricting it to cases where P's crime is one of recklessness or can be committed recklessly.<br><br>I then consider in <strong>Part IV</strong> whether the policy of not chilling lawful activities precludes the creation of <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">a general reckless complicity principle</span></strong> untied to the situation where S is already an accomplice of P in some other crime. <strong>I argue that it does not</strong>, and therefore conclude that neither the principle of culpability nor policy considerations <strong>require rejection of a general doctrine of reckless complicity</strong>.<br><br>The final section, <strong>Part V</strong>, considers <strong>the ethic of individualism and self-determinism</strong>, and <strong>concludes that it does indeed stand against reckless complicity as a general ground of liability</strong>, and is the real force behind the law's requirement of intention; and further that this ethic, while deeply ingrained, is normatively problematic. </blockquote></span><br><span style="color: darkred;">With Singapore's Laws largely following English Law, are you claiming that it is erroneous to claim of negligence on those with the Authority to check on a <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>''KNOWN event of Public Concern''</strong></span> ?<br><br><strong>continue below</strong><br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by soul_rage:</div><div class="quote_body">similar to Gazelle, whom has gone delusional in another thread.<br>Anyway, I see ministers in other countries resigning when something major happens in the domain they are in charge of, like for instance, a major accident, etc.<br><br>You can argue that its not their fault and they should not resign, but at the end of the day, they are sitting in a position where they must be ever-vigilant to ensure that the domain they are taking care of have as little problems as possible. Stepping down is a show of their willingness to accept blame that they are not doing an adequate job on their part.<br><br>What has our ministers do when screw-ups occur (train derail, circle line deaths, NKF, etc)? Mostly just to perform taichi and redirect blame away from themselves. Not one has been willing to accept responsibility for the problems occurring under their charge.<br><br>How can we trust such ministers, when they refuse to accept responsibility to their inadequacies, and instead continue to insist they are the cream of the crop?<br><br>In fact, what proof do they have that they are the cream of the crop, other than just blasting that they are talents with their mouths? As I said, name me one good thing they have done all these years (taking over what the old guard has done such as CPF/HDB), and you will be hard-pressed to find something worth commending about.</div></blockquote>ah you have hit the nail right on the head. who decides who should be given millions from the money that you, me, our parents, our grandparents contributed? who should they prove to? its us regular folks. people in HDB flats, working in hawker centers, educated in neighbourhood schools. ordinary people. if you hired someone, trusted him, paid him, gave him a good life, and he mismanages something in which he was hired to oversee. would you ask him to step down and let someone else more capable and more deserving to continue the work? or would you continue to enrich him, make him an ever richer man?<br><br>take responsibility and step down. because you know the people can't vote you out because the system has been so screwed that you can get into office not because the people voted you in, but one person thinks you can do the job.</div>
