A person acts with intent or intentionally when he acts with the objective or purpose to accomplish a result which constitutes a crime.<br><br>(b) <strong>KNOWLEDGE</strong>. A person knows or acts knowingly or with knowledge when:<br><br>(i) he is aware of a fact, facts, or circumstances or result described by a statute defining an offense; or<br><br>(ii) he has information which would lead a reasonable man in the same situation to believe that facts exist which facts are described by a statute defining an offense.<br><br>(c) <strong>RECKLESSNESS</strong>. A person is reckless or acts recklessly when he knows of and disregards a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur and his disregard of such substantial risk is a gross deviation from conduct that a reasonable man would exercise in the same situation.<br><br>(d) <strong>CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE</strong>. A person is criminally negligent or acts with criminal negligence when he fails to be aware of a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur and his failure to be aware of such substantial risk constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable man would exercise in the same situation.<br><br>(2) Substitutes for Criminal Negligence, Recklessness, and Knowledge. When a statute provides that criminal negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense, such element also is established if a person acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. When recklessness suffices to establish an element, such element also is established if a person acts intentionally or knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to establish an element, such element also is established if a person acts intentionally.<br><br>(3) Culpability as Determinant of Grade of Offense. When the grade or degree of an offense depends on whether the offense is committed intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence, its grade or degree shall be the lowest for which the determinative kind of culpability is established with respect to any material element of the offense.<br><br>(4) Requirement of Wilfulness Satisfied by Acting Knowingly. A requirement that an offense be committed wilfully is satisfied if a person acts knowingly with respect to the material elements of the offense, unless a purpose to impose further requirements plainly appears.<br></blockquote></span><br><span style="color: darkred;">Why should you be waiting for facts, when the facts are already published ?<br><br>Are you denying that the Ministers have no knowledge of the issues raised by the Backbenchers in Parliament ?<br><br>The fact that the Miisters have been informed of these issues would have proven the culpabilities of the Ministers for their preferred inaction even with their newly gained <span style="font-style: italic;">''KNOWLEDGE''</span> - based on the ambit in Point 1[b][ii] ?<br><br>On the second ground of culpability, the Ministers' outright dismissal despite the knowledge of the concerned issues raised is again confirmed by their acts of <span style="font-style: italic;">''RECKLESSNESS''</span> as decribed in Point 1[c]; and this is mere academic if their action is not considered to be <span style="font-style: italic;">''NEGLIGENCE''</span> as detailed in Point 1[d].<br><br>Instead of avoiding issues by indulging in polemics, you can gain some self-respect and credibility by debunking the above statements if you are so eager to prove me wrong.<br><br>You are certainly great at being a true twirp.<br><br>Keep growing your head bigger, and you will surely be a Mushroom. </span></div>

CEOs these days have to go to jail when well-audited well-respected firms were discovered to be committing fraud via creative accounting. They are made to sign forms to say that they are liable for the accounts, even though we all know that they are made to be responsible for things of which some may be beyond their control.<br><br>Similarly, our ministers (who love to compare their pay with the private sector) should be equally vigilant, if voices of concern are raised to them. CEOs do not have the luxury to say they made an error of judgment for mistakenly putting their faith in their subordinates. Negligence is an invalid excuse. Our ministers, on the other hand, are allowed such negligence<br><br>If you are so adamant to always talk about bringing people to court, I say make our ministers sign forms to indicate they may be brought to court if they are found to be negligent in the domains they are taking care of (liable for fine, jail, OR BOTH).<br><br>I also question your lack of knowledge on the area of motivational strategies. If our ministers are always allowed to say their mistakes are honest, and they should not be held accountable, then there is no motivation for them to shape up (coz they do not need to ship out). They can continually make blatant mistakes, and they are still not accountable.</div>
