              <p>It is odd that Singapore's National Day celebration has never involved every Singaporean - as the Alternative Parties have been excluded from the day's events except for the elected MP being present at the National Day Parade review.</p>
              <p>While the PAP take on the center stage with its high profile participation - from a contingent of a hundred strong PAP flag marching participants, to the ministers holding National Day flag raising ceremonies in schools, factories, and neighborhood events - the petty politics of the PAP will exclude the Alternative Political Parties from getting political advantage from this major National event.</p>
              <p>Even the two honorable MPs from the Hougang and Potong Pasir constituencies are not allowed to be involved in the various National Day celebrations conducted by schools and factories even though they are the ELECTED Member of Parliament for the constituencies that these facilities are located.</p>
              <p>The two constituencies of Hougang and Potong Pasir will see parallel or duplicate celebrations of National Day - one held by the PAP and the other held by the Elected MP for Hougang and Potong Pasir.</p>
              <p>National Day is supposed to be a Day for ALL Singaporeans - yet the PAP will see fit to celebrate this Day by being divisive instead of playing the role of National Leaders.</p>

              <p>And so? You want to cow father cow mother about NDP celebrations? I was hoping that NDP celebrations are going to be played down since the economy is still downhill. And next, I couldn't mother fakr care less about the SDP NDP message since it is aimed at Singaporeans to care less about the people of Singapore and creating divisiveness. Since HDB is about housing, then we just need to set the Board back on its track to solve problems. Materials wise is another matter since global inflation is something a country cannot control.</p>
