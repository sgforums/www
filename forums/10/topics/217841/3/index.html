According to the LTA website, it's VQS (Vehicle Quota System). Don't ask me what that is, the explanation in LTA's website does not seem clear.<br><br>Cars being affordable may not be such a gd thing after all. It has resulted in an explosion of $0 downpayment and many many people are in huge debt. Shd the car encounter a serious accident and total scrap has to be imposed on the car, the owner is left with a huge loan to repay but no car to drive. Insurance can only cover to a limited extent.<br><br>COEs can only be collected every ten years of a car's cycle but ERP is collected by the millions daily. More cars will mean more revenue and also the govt is "making everyone happy" by allowing more car ownership.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
