We should be responsible to the environment and it is a cleaner system that will definitely work.<br><br>The pre-requisite is that the public transportation system must be good. More frequency, more choices between MRT and Bus (rather than making the public take a combination and increasing transportation time), making it more convenient like is was (instead of switching many buses to get to a single destination).<br><br>The current system is crap and I suspect that the govt knows it. Two advantages is that they can appease the public and that they can collect more money from COE and ERP (especially ERP). That's probably why they still choose it.<br><br>If you buy a 60k car, would you park it at home rather than spend $2 for ERP entry? So do you think ERP will work??<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ERP will work as far as the people will bear. People make a decision whether or not to dump the car and switch to public transport. For the sake of a little convenience and a seat on the way to work, they are prepared to pay the ERP. The reason why the roads are still crowded indicates that the ERP is not high enough to discourage people. Half-hearted measures will not do. The government is wrong in trying to please Singaporeans who want to own cars (and allowing more COEs), whilst not imposing punitive ERP prices (which is necessary to control car usage).<br><br>It's either one or the other. Measures in the 90s will not do now when incomes and expectations have risen. There are too many poly/JC students and undergrads driving cars when they are not even working. You either make car ownership very expensive or the ERP so punitive that only a select group can afford it.<br><br>Singaporeans want to have their cake and eat it. They want to own cars and use it as well. It was before one election when there was a great deal of clamour for more COEs in the media. The government bowed to public pressure, issued more COEs and tried to control car usage with ERP.<br><br>I say that the ERP prices are not high enough to discourage car usage. London has imposed a congestion charge of 8GBP (S$24) within central London (like our restricted zone). It has been successful in cutting congestion and pollution ( http://www.conocophillips.co.uk/stations/autogas/Latest_News/London_Congestion_Charge_Environmental_Success.htm).<br><br>An ERP charge of $3 will not discourage motorists from using their cars during peak hours. It should rise to a punitive amount, at least $10 per gantry to have sufficient deterrent effect. However, I feel all public transport including taxis should be exempt. I believe taxis should be included as part of public transport and should be kept cheap to encourage people to give up their cars.</div>

They <strong>choose</strong> to incur the tremendous loans and have no money to get married. Whose fault is that? Don't blame the government for an individual's folly.

The revenue collected from those who choose to pollute the environment and contribute to congestion can go to improving public transport infrastructure and building more roads.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Think about it. And goodness sake, ERP does not discourage car usage. If it does, then hefty rd taxes and car insurance would have discouraged car usage a long time ago. </strong></blockquote>They do, just that the fees are not hefty enough, relative to the cost of a car. People will rant but will still pay the $3 ERP since they have already spent 200k on their car. Raise the ERP three times, raise the fees until it really hurts...and people will realize that it is better to pick up their gf in a Mercedez cab.<br></div>

People make a decision whether or not to dump the car and switch to public transport. For the sake of a little convenience and a seat on the way to work, they are prepared to pay the ERP. The reason why the roads are still crowded indicates that the ERP is not high enough to discourage people. Half-hearted measures will not do. The government is wrong in trying to please Singaporeans who want to own cars (and allowing more COEs), whilst not imposing punitive ERP prices (which is necessary to control car usage).<br><br>It's either one or the other. Measures in the 90s will not do now when incomes and expectations have risen. There are too many poly/JC students and undergrads driving cars when they are not even working. You either make car ownership very expensive or the ERP so punitive that only a select group can afford it.<br><br>Singaporeans want to have their cake and eat it. They want to own cars and use it as well. It was before one election when there was a great deal of clamour for more COEs in the media. The government bowed to public pressure, issued more COEs and tried to control car usage with ERP.<br><br>I say that the ERP prices are not high enough to discourage car usage. London has imposed a congestion charge of 8GBP (S$24) within central London (like our restricted zone). It has been successful in cutting congestion and pollution ( http://www.conocophillips.co.uk/stations/autogas/Latest_News/London_Congestion_Charge_Environmental_Success.htm).<br><br>An ERP charge of $3 will not discourage motorists from using their cars during peak hours. It should rise to a punitive amount, at least $10 per gantry to have sufficient deterrent effect. However, I feel all public transport including taxis should be exempt. I believe taxis should be included as part of public transport and should be kept cheap to encourage people to give up their cars. </div></blockquote>My sis is in town will talk 2 her,liar!!!</div>

LPPL statement here right. ERP does not reduce car usage at all. Cars can choose to bypass expressways in the mornings to avoid ERP. Cars that do not want to go thru the city ERP can park somewhere nearby and take a bus/mrt down.

Car-pool has been tried before and it had a limited amount of success when the government introduced restricted zones in the 1970s. Cars with at least 4 persons within were exempt from the charge. The reason why it did not work is given by Rock^Star. Singaporeans are too selfish and treasure their privacy too much to share a car.<br><br>Park and Ride does not work because the cost of ERP is not punitive enough. Motorists have made the capital investment in their cars and paid their road tax. The additional amount they pay in ERP is nothing compared to what they have already invested. On top of that, once they factor in the MRT fare, car park charges and the loss of 'prestige' walking to the office from a crowded MRT train, this option no longer becomes attractive. That's why for such schemes to work,  the ERP must rise further to punitive levels and there must be greater discounts for car park/MRT fare for motorists who participate. This is something the government must consider...but for it to work, ERP prices must rise higher.<br><br>It can work. The costs of driving in London is so high (congestion charge, parking charges) and traffic so congested outside the Congestion Zone that most people use public transport to go to work. There are lots of people who live in Oxford and work in London. They park their cars near the coach station, take the 1.5 hour coach ride to London and transfer to the Underground to go to work each day.<br><br>The reason why many parallel bus services were withdrawn when the NEL came up was of course a typical business decision. The bus companies thought that the passenger numbers will drastically drop when the NEL came up and it would no longer be economical to run a service when the buses are empty.<br><br>If what you say is true and there is a demand for parallel bus services despite the NEL, write to the bus companies to re-consider. If there is money to be earned on a route, they will not turn it down. However, perhaps you are the minority and most people prefer the NEL.<br><br>I like the suggestion of allowing car pool vehicles to use bus lanes. We need incentives like these to persuade Singaporeans to abandon their vehicles. More carrots to entice them and we also need to use a bigger stick to dissuade others from car ownership.<br></div>
