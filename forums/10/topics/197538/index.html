            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, those were Steyr (not Sar21) supplied by the Australians. The very same country who supported and partly finance the indonesian invasion, under the anti-communist slogan. check history<br><br>Secondly, Iran has no international weapons ban against it.... only US imposed ban. (for the obvious and usual reasons, before any future regime changes or invasion)<br><br>Thirdly, Timor leste is a pacific nation - not part of ASEAN. Even if the weapons were supplied.. they were sold to legit government agencies - whether they turned rebels are their internal matters.<br><br>Fourthly, Singapore is not the biggest nor the most prominent nation doing this. By and larger, nowadays, Singapore only supplies weapons to government agencies only.</div>
