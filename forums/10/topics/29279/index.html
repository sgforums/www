The Internet is here for you.<br>According to LKY's memomair,  Malaysia was naturally the 1st<br>option to ask for military training  assistance. But having found<br>them untrustworthy and with an inert Malay-dominated military,<br>Singapore choosed otherwise.<br><br>And so the then Defence Minister , Goh Keng Swee went looking<br>for help elsewhere:<br><br>1) He contacted <span style="color: darkred;">Mordecai Kidron, the Israeli ambassador in Bangkok,</span> for help, who flew in from Bangkok to offer assistance in military training. LKY put this offer on hold until he get reply<br>from (2) and (3).<br><br>2)  <span style="color: darkred;">Lal Bahadur Shastri, the Prime Minister of India, and</span><br><br>3)  <span style="color: darkred;">President Nasser of Egypt<br></span><br>Last two were officially requested by LKY in letters seeking their<br>urgent  help to build up Singapore armed forces.<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>None of them offered assistance.</strong></span><br>Yes, maybe you are right, Singapore was just another pre-maturely<br>forced delivered poor, small 3rd world country with a 35 yr old<br>leader. Who cares anyway ?<br><br>But so was Isreal after having fought at least 2 major wars against<br>several of her  larger Arab neighbours. Anyone would be impressed<br>with its military credentials and effectiveness shown in her short<br>history of nationhood.<br><br>And as of why was Israeli assistance kept secret then ?<br>Well, we know not just about religion sensitivity towards Muslims in<br>this region, but also LKY's worry of anti-independent Singapore<br>Malaysians like  Syed Ja'afar Albar "might persuade military<br>officers like Brigadier  Alsagoff to reverse separation. " -<br>Hence a risk of possible military aggression from certain<br>segments within Malaya to force Singapore back into<br>the federation.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/army/infantry_images/infantry_picture_15.jpg"></div>

PAP is always eager to make the people feel vulnerable so that we'll always have a slightly war-like edge that can be easily mobilized should the occassion arise.<br><br>under the Brits, Sg was the administrative HQ of the straits settlements and as a crown colony, it was administered directly under the colonial office. direct rule in those days were reserved for places that had strategic importance.<br><br>when the japanese came, they supported collaborative regimes all over: in southern china, manchuria, the philipines, burma and indonesia. Singapore was administered directly by the military becase of its strategic location and because they didn't have anyone to trust here... too chinese.<br><br>although LKY is always harping about how island nations are political jokes, he would be the first to admit that Sg has commandered importance totally out of proportion to its size.<br><br>hence, it is not totally inconceivable that Israel would want to help us. Sg was important historically, it was likely to remain so because of its location and it was surrounded by people not too friendly with Israel.<br><br>of course it suited their interest to gain an influence here.<br><br>part of it was plain political charity, but a large part of it was <span style="font-style: italic;">quid pro quo</span> as well. they would fully expect us to be on their side after they came in.<br><br>have u ever heard Sg say <strong>anything</strong> about how Israel treats the palestinians?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>besides, the israelis have no real friends. only very real interests. as long as its a mutually beneficial relationship, they'll like u. so they're ok people to have around... its a much more stable relationship than the americans.<br><br>there are still a sizeable number of israeli "defence contractors" around doing some really funky stuff...<br><br>and one significant benefit of working with israelis is that u would not likely find the malaysians using the same stuff as us  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>i'll laugh myself silly the day they buy the same weapons the israelis built to whack their muslim cousins in the mid-east.<br><br></div>

If the new guy cannot control them, they may engage in petty arguments. Of course, a most effective way to unite them is to engage in "S'pore-bashing", which is a card they often play as of now.
