Cut the costs<br>2. Increase the wages<br><br>What PAP did was to raise the cost without without raising the wages.<br><br>To cut the cost it is simple... cut the price of HDB flats and build until there are too many of them and ensure that there are too many HDB flats all the time. This will ensure that the resale price does not shoot up. This is in government control. The price of flats conservatively rose from 15K to $200K (200/15 x 100%=) which is an increase of about 1333%<br><br>Salaries at the time for a new army officer at that time when the flats was 15K was about $1000 per month. So are the new army officer now getting $13330? Other than the increase in pay of over a thousand % for the ministers and the big bosses in GLC and those at the top of their professions.... the rest of us are exploited.<br><br>Blame PAP; blame NTUC.<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=189166" rel="nofollow">Since thread was locked(Click here)</a></div>
