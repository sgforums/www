                  reason is simple, they see participation as futile as I shall explain.. <br> <br> In <strong>'GRCs make it easier to find top talent: SM'</strong> [<a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2006/yax-615.htm">ST 26June2006</a>], when SM Goh was reported saying <em>"Without

                  election,  many able and successful young Singaporeans may not risk 
                  their careers  to join politics"</em>,  I wonder if SM Goh sensed that perhaps the selling of one's soul to the hegemony of the PAP as reflected in <strong>'Singapore lifts whip on orchestrated parliament'</strong> [<a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw02/020321af.htm">AFP 21Mar2002</a>]: <em>"The

                  said."</em> could be one main reason why morally inspired young minds shun association with the PAP.<br> <br> Inspired and altruistic as impressionable young minds may be, perhaps 
                  income and an increasing cost of living might be an issues they all 
                  struggle to cope with; like the examples of our dear PM and his gangly 
                  entourage, young Singaporeans too seek the privilege of stratospheric 
                  salaries [<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TFHv1FuLrSI/AAAAAAAAAOE/saa2THDeL3w/s1600/ST23Mar2007-+Why+pay+must+go+up.JPG">chart</a>].
                   But for selling their souls to PAP hegemony, few eventually attain 
                  their ideal salaries, much less afford basic properties in the public 
                  housing developments of their fancy. <strong>'Affordability of HDB flats – a response to Minister of National Development'</strong> (Hazel Poa) [<a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/11/17/affordability-of-hdb-flats-%E2%80%93-a-response-to-minister-of-national-development/">TR, 17Nov2010</a>][<a href="http://tinyurl.com/3n973ab">alt link</a>] <em>"From 1990 to 2009, median household income increased from $2,296 to $4,850<a href="http://votingrp.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php#_ftn1">[1]</a> – an increase of 111%. Over the same period, resale flat prices increased by 342%<a href="http://votingrp.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php#_ftn2">[2]</a>.
                   The affordability of HDB flats has certainly deteriorated very 
                  significantly over the past 19 years. It now takes a median income 
                  household more than double the time to pay for the flat."</em><br> <br> Next we have to consider political participation in Singapore. Whilst 
                  some argue that PAP was tested through a period of political turmoil, 
                  one thing in her favor would be that political elections then was easier
                   to comprehend and participate in- thus the vibrancy of participation. 
                  One could stand as an independent candidate and still beat party 
                  representative candidates in general elections; what mattered most was 
                  one's concern for one's constituents. Today, that relationship is lost. 
                  Besides being plagued with gerrymandering, many feel disenchanted with 
                  political parties that appoint and retire candidates/ MPs at will with 
                  neither the interest of constituents.<br> <br> In 1988 when the GRC system of elections was introduced by the PAP 
                  government into Singapore's growing political scene, 13GRCs taking up a 
                  total of 39 parliamentary seats left 42 seats untouched as SMCs out of a
                   total 81 seat parliament (i.e. more then half of all parliamentary 
                  seats remained unaffected). For reasons known only to themselves, PAP 
                  quickly reduced the number of parliamentary seats available to contest 
                  as SMCs, extra seats were added to each GRC, notwithstanding the adverse
                   impact  it had upon minority racial representation [<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/THTMjsVwbNI/AAAAAAAAAO8/uNlT3dUTQnk/s1600/100825-+Betrayal+of+the+original+intent+of+the+GRC+system+of+elections..JPG">Chart: column C: GRC seats as a prop. of all parl. seats</a>]- the purported raison d'être for the existence of GRCs in the first place. <br> <br> The SMC is an essential feature of parliamentary democracy (PD) in that 
                  it allows for constituencies to be represented by individual 
                  representatives of their choice. The barrier in entering most 
                  parliaments today is that of receiving enough votes from one's own 
                  constituency.<br> <br> Despite having spearheaded Singapore's rapid economic development, nary a
                   thought was made about advancing the democratic aspect of elections in 
                  Singapore (SG), an arcane 'first past the post' (FPTP) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting">wiki</a>]  remained with improved voting options such as the 'Single transferable vote' [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote">wiki</a>]
                   needing no discussion. One reason would be the GRC system of elections 
                  totally eliminating any such necessity as all political opposition, by 
                  General Election 2006 (GE2006),  had dwindled to an in-perceivable 
                  trickle; 'by-election strategy' being one of circumstance rather than 
                  choice. In fact, according to SGE2006 'full results' [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_general_election,_2006#Full_results">wiki</a>],
                   contest by any independent candidate was extinct. Elections in 
                  Singapore had by now become a purely partisan affair, so scarce was 
                  opposition that no three way contest occurred. Perhaps Singaporeans were
                   distracted by the prosperity promised by the opening of the Integrated 
                  Resorts (IRs) and easy visits to the casinos on home soil. Whatever the 
                  case, the political apathy that the PAP had now induced was total, 
                  Singaporeans were now almost completely beholden to the PAP.<br> (In FPTP voting, where the highest count wins, just 34% valid votes in a
                   3cornered fight suffices, provided that each of the other 2 opponents 
                  receive 33.5% of valid votes each- no vibrant opposition against the 
                  incumbent can develop under such odds of election).<br> <br> Bloated with conceit over the extinction of independent representation 
                  and a whimpering opposition in the walkovers GE of 2006,  yet mystified 
                  about the paucity of political participation by the young, PAP quickly 
                  claimed the credit of a 'first class political leadership' [<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TFHv1FuLrSI/AAAAAAAAAOE/saa2THDeL3w/s1600/ST23Mar2007-+Why+pay+must+go+up.JPG">pict</a>]
                   and in 2007 legislated raises in it's own office holder's salaries, 
                  with Ministers and the PM enjoying raises of about 60% and 50% 
                  respectively [<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TS2c2fWKNqI/AAAAAAAAAQ4/9hHVbo3gcVg/s1600/SG+Gov+sal+2006-2008.JPG">chart</a>] (see related link about the source of 'prosperity' of some private companies (IBM) in <strong>'How long can an economy, sustained on steroids last?' </strong>[<a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?p=54304518#post54304518">link</a>]).<br> <br> Fortuitously or otherwise, some more realistic internal voices must have
                   decried the embarrassment that might follow in GE 2011 if walkovers 
                  completely plagued elections in Singapore. Would Singaporeans migrate to
                   another land where they could feel free? Would such exodus bankrupt 
                  this young country?</p>
              <p>So worrying was this possibility that PM Lee announced in 2009 that <strong>'GRCs to shrink, but they will stay'</strong> [<a href="http://www.pmo.gov.sg/content/pmosite/mediacentre/inthenews/primeminister/2009/May/grcs_to_shrink_buttheywillstaysayspm.html">ST, 28May2009</a>]: <em>"Currently,

                  system of election and the PAP's palpable intent on 'fixing' the  
                  opposition, Singapore's journey to a full parliamentary democracy will

                  PAP swept the polls,..). In the next seven GEs, the campaign period was 
                    truncated to 10 days and in the 2001 and 2006 GEs, they were further

              <p><br>PAP not corrupted??? The mastery of PAP is their ability to make corruption legally, for that, I have to kudo to them. And you guys and gals of Singapore are just legally paying them without knowing that you are corrupting them.</p>

              <p>The increased NMP seats are merely to entrench the hegemony of PAP. They are hoping that people may actually want more opposition voices to be in parliament but the PAP to still govern as majority.</p>
              <p>What the hell is noise in parliament? They don't televise this for all singaporeans to watch at all. Just some recorded footages on CNA websites. Fuck la. Vote for change, let LHL become opposition.</p>
