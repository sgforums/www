            <div class='col-md body'>13% of students who borrowed from parents' CPF accounts have not paid back money<br><br><strong>SINGAPORE: Manpower Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen said Tuesday that 13 percent of students who had borrowed from their parents' CPF accounts for tertiary education have not been able to pay back the money despite the Board's enforcement efforts.<br><br>To better prepare Singapore for the needs of the ageing population, Dr Ng said the Ministry should not extend the use of CPF for educational purposes.<br><br>He told Parliament there were other existing avenues through which students could obtain financial assistance.<br><br>He stressed that only 40 percent of active CPF members turning 55 are able to meet their CPF minimum sum.<br><br>Hence, Singapore should help members set aside more CPF savings in the future, instead of allowing withdrawals for more purposes. - CNA/ir<br></strong><br><br>Looks like they really want us to hoard our CPF til 65. Without that CPF 'loan' which i'm returning With interest, i may have had to work after my 'O' levels before i took on my diploma.<br><br>Come on man.

            <div class='col-md body'>Is he making an assumption that the sons and daughters of Singapore will not support their parents in future, thus he needs to better prevent the CPF monies of the parents from going into "unnecessary" uses?<br><br>Then following his viewpoint, shall we also prevent CPF monies being used in so-called investments that allows people to get a higher return as these incorporate some risks? If the CPF board cannot achieve a higher return on the people's CPF from the paltry 2.6% (is it?), why shall such investments be allowed?<br><br>But in another of my opinion, I do agree with his viewpoint. People can borrow from banks and there are financial assistance programs (though their criterias can be softened at times) so I can see where he's coming from. But at the same time, I dislike his "hard" approach in "convincing" a change to the current policy. Maybe that is his way, his mentality and what he believes in. However, I am definitely not a fan of hard-selling, though I do not have a choice of it.</div>

This is being too critical isn't it? It is generally accepted that in Singapore, the higher your education level the higher your pay.

Then again, it's an inherent feature in most "nanny states". After all, are you seriously expecting an overly-domesticated cat to possess the survival instincts of its counterparts surviving in the wild?<br><br>Back to your analogy. Are you aware Federal Grants are available to just about every American college student (and I literally mean every college - from private to public schools)? In addition, numerous private colleges and state governments actually provide further financial aid (which could come in the form of grants, loans or work-arrangement schemes) to facilitate the student's educational financial liabilities. To illustrate such policies in practice and the significance of them in helping students out, just look at how many of the country's top institutions (which charge in the range of USD40000-USD45000 annually - my figures could be a little off as it's been sometime since I left college but it should be roughly in that range) are actually only able to afford a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">need-blind admissions policy</span></span></strong> to Americans, but not to International Students simply because the dearth of Federal Grant/Aid available to foreign students would render it impossible for such colleges to provide sufficient financial aid to help these students through. (As far as I know, Harvard, Yale and MIT are the only colleges that has a need-blinds admission policy for International Students due to their excessively large endowment funds)<br><br>On a sidenote, many American college students spend a year or two doing internships or taking part in charitable/worthwhile causes before they begin college do so out of interest and to boost their CV (which is essential for those planning to attend graduate schools and a massive source for reference letters and endorsement) as much as for the money.<br><br>In Singapore, tuition grants are only granted to the local institutions which are effectively state-funded (the local universities and polytechnics) - if you were attending a private school, you wouldn't even get any form of state grants to help you tide things over. In essence, you're left to fend for yourself.<br><br>In essence, there's hardly any parallel between the 2 systems.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by boka:</div><div class="quote_body">And u do have a point in that 13% of that figure who might be serving NS.<br>However,looking at the upthread now,how confidnent are we to say that most yougnster would actually return that amount of sum borrwed?<br><br>Even the increasing numbers of elderly being chuked into the old folks home is a worrying sign enough.<br></div></blockquote>Why should the state be allowed to dictate how parents could help their children out with their <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">own</span></span></strong> money?</div>
