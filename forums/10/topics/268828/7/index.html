That said, just because this particular criminal is no easy target doesn't mean folks should go down the road of "appeasement" and advocating this brand of "forced savings" as a necessity.<br><br>At the end of the day, the very people this policy hits hardest are arguably the most needy who need to touch their CPF money to put their kids through college - it'd hardly be an exaggeration to suggest people in this category could very well do without the nonsensical extortions perpetrated by this regime.<br><br>It may be quite another matter if it's billionaires' funds we're talking about, but we aren't.</div>

What the Workers' Party has done thus far is lay low and slowly work into the minds of the people. This is quite contrary to what Chee and Jeyaratnam have done which unwittingly provided the PAP with ammunition to attack them vigorously.<br><br>However, there is a lot of road to go for the Workers' Party. The fact that 66% who voted in the last election provides a large enough sample size of the population to give us a rough idea of how the population thinks. A good part of the population supports the PAP.<br><br>What the PAP does best is to prey upon the inferiority complex of Singaporeans, reminding of how weak Singapore is, and the need for "unity". This inferiority complex then gives rise to a need for a strong Govt who would do all the decision making for them and they would be "good citizens" and obey.<br></div>
