The amount of interest to the individual may not be much and it does not really matter. They key is leaving the CPF status quo.<br><br>Can you not understand this point by looking from their perspective? Or do you choose to look only from your own?<br><br>However, you won't be wrong to say that the govt uses the interest as part of their investments. Like a double edged sword.<br><br>There used to be a time when CPF stipulated that all CPF investments, if terminated and returned to the CPF, should include interest as well. That ruling has since been removed in 2002.<br><br>The main purpose was to keep Singaporeans' CPF meant for retirement status quo. However, the govt then realised that not all investments made money and that many Singaporeans were penalised by paying cash.<br></div>
