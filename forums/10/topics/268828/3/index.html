It's mighty time the government shifts towards a more equitable national insurance system if it's really worried about an aging population. Many of my peers feel that it's time that we increase our income taxes in return for a social welfare scheme for retireees.<br><br>Secondly, are you so sure that there isn't a rising number of Singaporeans who prefer higher income taxes and a consequent strong safety net in their old age?

Since the govt has decided to relax the CPF many years back for education usage, then surely they would want the CPF account holder to have his money back as if <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"it had never been touched"</span>?<br><br>Surely that helps retirement? But I can't say the same for raising the retirement age and doing away with withdrawal at age 55.</div>

It's mighty time the government shifts towards a more equitable national insurance system if it's really worried about an aging population. Many of my peers feel that it's time that we increase our income taxes in return for a social welfare scheme for retireees.<br><br>Secondly, are you so sure that there isn't a rising number of Singaporeans who prefer higher income taxes and a consequent strong safety net in their old age? Your assumption that people will not be happy, is very similar to the lines that the Ministry loved to spout for decades. You should not assume that society thinks A or society thinks B.<br><br></div></blockquote>Khaw Boon Wan has mentioned the "3 safety nets" for Singaporeans: Medisave, Medishield and Medifund.<br><br>If these are indeed safety nets, then they must be of poor, poor quality. I wouldn't mind paying more tax if the govt can ensure that I do not have to pay $500,000 for a cancer treatment when I'm old in 2040.<br><br>However, given the low taxes that majority of Singaporeans have paid all these years, it does take a bit of mentality change to adapt. Perhaps Boka's assumption that people will not be happy is not unfounded. Just that if higher taxes for more welfare is ever implemented, it has to be done in stages.</div>
