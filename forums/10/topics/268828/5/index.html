            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">It is getting to be more worrying the manner in which our CPF is being managed, considering the non-transparency of the system that has been implemented by the Government aka the Ruling Party.<br><br>If the concern is with the ability of the Aged to be independent with sufficient savings from CPF - the Government has failed to make CPF work with its many about turn changes in its policies as it meanders through the last thirty years.<br><br>If each Singaporean worker has a CPF Account that receives $200 from its own wage deduction, and another $200 from its Employer, this will result in a monthly INDIVIDUAL contribution of $400, or $4,800 per annum.<br><br>If there are 1,000,000 in the Singapore Workforce, this annual sum received by CPF will be $4,800.000,000 per annum.<br><br>Across the working life of the next 30 years, the CPF Board will have received a shocking total sum of <strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">$144,000,000,000</span></span></strong>.<br><br>This total at the end of the 30th year has not even considered the annual compounded interest that is payable by CPF on the accounts held.<br><br>This total has not considered any wage increases as some in the workforce move up the wage scale.<br><br>This total sum is only considering the initial 1,000,000 workers from the 1950s period, and has not considered the additional contributions from the new annual entries into the workforce.<br><br>With a CPF system that has to support a larger population of those born in the 1950s, it will require an <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>ANNUAL INCREASE</strong></span> to the numbers entering the workforce to contribute more than the amounts that the 1950s generation will have to withdraw.<br><br>It will require a larger annual CPF contributing population to form the large base of a Pyramid, and the retiree population withdrawing from the CPF forming the space at the smaller apex of the pyramid.<br><br>Unfortunately, the effective outcome of the Population Control Program during the 1960s campaign of <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>'STOP At Two'</strong></span> has resulted in an annual shrinking of the birthrates and a slow depletion of the population that do not reproduce itself.<br><br>This must result in an inverted pyramid when the larger numbers from the 1950s baby boomers are now retiring, and it is being supported by a smaller and shrinking workforce that ccontribute insufficiently into the CPF to support the larger amount being withdrawn by the 1950s retirees.<br><br>All that we have seen is denial from the Government that there are no funds to make the payouts, but a slew of policy changes seems to hint otherwise - when policy changes indicate a continued delay to the withdrawing age from the inital 55 years to the present 65 years; and we have also seen the many programs that deplete our main CPF acounts by deduction for Medicare, or transfers to MediSave.<br><br>These deductions to Medicare and MediSave will only provide a minimal coverage to each Singaporean, and will hardly cover the total sum of any major medical treatment that has reach astronomical sums even at Government managed hospitals.<br><br>There seems to be a reluctace and resistance to snowball all the individual deductions and transfers into a Super National Insurance Scheme that will provide a Super Coverage Net for ALL Singaporeans, that will be of sufficient amount to protect Singaporeans healthcare without need for any CASH outlays.<br><br>Such a scheme works as the amounts not utilised by healthier Singaporeans can be used by those less healthy and in greater need for help.<br><br>If charity and self-help is expected from Singaporeans, it is surprising that the Government being in the seat of main control and major influence will not take the Leadership Role to make this obvious happen, but will indulge in tinkering the CPF system to achieve some minor goals with smaller effective results.<br><br>The CPF system belong to Singaporeans, and if it must be used to help one's offspring to gain a better education, it is also an investment by the parents on their children who will be in a better position to look after the parents in old age.<br><br>If there are fears that conflict will arise in the abandoment of the parents, there are legislations already in place to ensure that this do not happen; unless the Government is claiming that the policy is a failure.<br><br>The CPF has been manipulated to its death, and it looks like Singaporeans will have to bear with another round of arrogance from the Government in not consulting us for decisions already made. </span><br></div>

In Singapore guys will lose 2 years due to their national service. This does not bode well for them. The American educational system is more laid back, allowing them more time to catch up on other things. If you want to blame, blame it on our educational system and the kiasu-ness of all Singaporeans. I agree with great planning one can handle multiple jobs, but will this allow them to handle a full-time education?<br><br>Imagine taking up loans after loans when your parents have the money.

            <div class='col-md body'>Very interesting discussion indeed, 5 pages in 24 hrs.<br><br>It is an undisputable fact that: "CPF is our money, we should be able to use them as we like", and I am all for using CPF for education.<br><br>To put the matter in perspective, how much are we talking about? University education in Singapore school fee alone, S$7500 per yr for SMU, S$6000 for NTU and NUS, excluding degree for Medicine. So total 3yrs S$25,000 max.  If your parents cannot even afford to pay for you in cash in 3 years, I think the child should understand the problem and pay back your parents more than just S$700 a month. With a degree, and before you get married, this should not be problem. If you need ng eng hen to tell you to repay, you already failed as a person and not qualified to say talk about your fatherÂ’s CPF money. It would be better for you to go to UK and flip burgers.<br><br>If you have to go overseas, UK and US costs including living allowance S$70,000 per year or S$210,000 for 3 yrs. Australia would be S$50,000 per year or S$150,000. These are minimum figures and DO NOT include tickets back home between semesters, or trip round Europe or America during vacation. If you want that you have to flip burgers. Now that is a lot of money of your parents CPF, if they canÂ’t pay in cash. As children, you may choose not to pay them back into their CPF, but you must give your parents the assurance that you would pay them in cash or look after them in their older days, even, or especially if you decide to migrate there after your study. With an overseas degree, you should not have any problem, may be just delay buying your first house. Ng eng hen can say anything he likes, but you can sleep in peace because your father has assurance of your support at old age.<br><br>From the parents perspective, I will borrow from relatives and friends to support my children, especially if I have two or three children. I would be happy if they work hard enough to settle for a local U then my burden is less. I would be happy if they could pay me back so I can plan for my retirement. If they would agree to look after me at my old age, I would be happier even if I donÂ’t need or want that. On the other hand, if my children give me all the money I paid for them and see me only once a year, my days at old age would not be very happy, regardless of what ng eng hen says, or even if there were a new government.<br><br>So, are you the father or the sons? DonÂ’t let the government decides your family matters, but together we fight for better use and better returns for our money in the CPF.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">Very interesting discussion indeed, 5 pages in 24 hrs.<br><br>It is an undisputable fact that: "CPF is our money, we should be able to use them as we like", and I am all for using CPF for education.<br><br>To put the matter in perspective, how much are we talking about? University education in Singapore school fee alone, S$7500 per yr for SMU, S$6000 for NTU and NUS, excluding degree for Medicine. So total 3yrs S$25,000 max.  If your parents cannot even afford to pay for you in cash in 3 years, I think the child should understand the problem and pay back your parents more than just S$700 a month. With a degree, and before you get married, this should not be problem. If you need ng eng hen to tell you to repay, you already failed as a person and not qualified to say talk about your fatherÂ’s CPF money. It would be better for you to go to UK and flip burgers.<br><br>If you have to go overseas, UK and US costs including living allowance S$70,000 per year or S$210,000 for 3 yrs. Australia would be S$50,000 per year or S$150,000. These are minimum figures and DO NOT include tickets back home between semesters, or trip round Europe or America during vacation. If you want that you have to flip burgers. Now that is a lot of money of your parents CPF, if they canÂ’t pay in cash. As children, you may choose not to pay them back into their CPF, but you must give your parents the assurance that you would pay them in cash or look after them in their older days, even, or especially if you decide to migrate there after your study. With an overseas degree, you should not have any problem, may be just delay buying your first house. Ng eng hen can say anything he likes, but you can sleep in peace because your father has assurance of your support at old age.<br><br>From the parents perspective, I will borrow from relatives and friends to support my children, especially if I have two or three children. I would be happy if they work hard enough to settle for a local U then my burden is less. I would be happy if they could pay me back so I can plan for my retirement. If they would agree to look after me at my old age, I would be happier even if I donÂ’t need or want that. On the other hand, if my children give me all the money I paid for them and see me only once a year, my days at old age would not be very happy, regardless of what ng eng hen says, or even if there were a new government.<br><br>So, are you the father or the sons? <span style="color: red;">DonÂ’t let the government decides your family matters, but together we fight for better use and better returns for our money in the CPF.  </span></div></blockquote>U sum it all up what i've just said.<br>This is possible if childrens have the responsiblity to return the CPF funds so that the government do not have to concern themselve with retirement funds.</div>

[b]</blockquote>You took one potshot at those who supported the CPF eduction scheme and lambasting us as worthless person without understanding the whole senario. The CPF board has implemented some form of governance in making sure that the student returns the money.<br><br>From what I understand, we are only allowed up to 40% of the funds available in the CPF. Fees of 100k is unheard of for local tertiary education. Given Singaporean's emphasis on results and speed, we cannot afford the American's way of approaching education.<br><br>Should you take away the use of CPF money, ultimately it will be the parents who suffer because they might have to take on additional jobs just to see their child through their child's full time education.<br><br>But of course, it is the child's responsibility to see that he returns those money loaned from the CPF and their responsibility to see their parents through their old age.</div>
