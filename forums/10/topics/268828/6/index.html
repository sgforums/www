Getting a head start is so important nowadays.<br><br>If the govt is so concerned about helping us save that 20k, perhaps they ought to considering sponsoring 100students 10k each with their million dollar salaries or just lower the price of HDB flats by 20k across the board. </div></blockquote>I double that.

Not to mention, IF i take a bank loan just for my poly, i'm going to be working even longer after i get my dip, Just to return the loan.<br><br>We really lose out, cause of the 2 years (some of you may be able to work part time, but try being in an infantry unit or one that stays in mon-fri), and age.<br><br>Even now, would you rather hire a 26 year old uni grad? or a 32 year old uni grad?

I mean you may call me a spoilt brat, but I'm 20 this year and I'm proud to say when I work PT, not only do I give my parents 10% of my pay to each, I've also bought the refrigerator and washing machine that we use at home. If the govt. is worried about kids not paying, its because the kids are spoilt by their parents. My parents do not have such problems with me...because they gave me the right values.

And that's precisely what's so wrong with this - and other totalitarian regimes for that matter - regime where self-serving despots and tyrants legislate flawed policies. The bottomline is : what business is it of the state's to interfere in what is essentially a family matter and money belonging to family members? After all, if you had a family dispute on the disbursement of inheritance to various family members and this matter needs resolving in a court of law, you aren't counting on the state to bear the legal costs (for both sides) of the entire proceedings, are you? In which case, why then should the state be allowed to selectively interfere in what are effectively family matters? I doubt you need Einstein's IQ to work out the ulterior motive behind the modus operandi of this regime's selective interference which isn't all that alien from that of other organised crime syndicates.<br><br>Technically, if I may use another example, the logic of the whole debate doesn't deviate too much from illegal moneylenders - after all, would you not agree it'd only be reasonable in principle that the debtor returns what he has borrowed from his creditor? So why should non-institutionalised moneylenders be outlawed?<br><br>If your argument stems from this regime <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">deservedly</span></span></strong> having the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">right</span></span></strong> to force a debtor to return the borrower with funds belonging to the borrower, shouldn't this regime abet illegal moneylenders in their quest to recover their loans instead of outlawing them? As far as the practice and principle go, they're effectively the same!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by walesa:<br><strong><br><br>That's just your take and you perceive it to be right. And that's precisely what's so wrong with this - and other totalitarian regimes for that matter - regime where self-serving despots and tyrants legislate flawed policies. The bottomline is : what business is it of the state's to interfere in what is essentially a family matter and money belonging to family members? After all, if you had a family dispute on the disbursement of inheritance to various family members and this matter needs resolving in a court of law, you aren't counting on the state to bear the legal costs (for both sides) of the entire proceedings, are you? In which case, why then should the state be allowed to selectively interfere in what are effectively family matters? I doubt you need Einstein's IQ to work out the ulterior motive behind the modus operandi of this regime's selective interference which isn't all that alien from that of other organised crime syndicates.<br><br>Technically, if I may use another example, the logic of the whole debate doesn't deviate too much from illegal moneylenders - after all, would you not agree it'd only be reasonable in principle that the debtor returns what he has borrowed from his creditor? So why should non-institutionalised moneylenders be outlawed?<br><br>If your argument stems from this regime [b]<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">deservedly</span></span></strong> having the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">right</span></span></strong> to force a debtor to return the borrower with funds belonging to the borrower, shouldn't this regime abet illegal moneylenders in their quest to recover their loans instead of outlawing them? As far as the practice and principle go, they're effectively the same![/b]</blockquote>If you perceive them as robbers, so be it. I have never disputed that, just that I have never considered them one until the recent decision to up retirement age and remove the option to withdraw at 55.<br><br>'Robbers' is too strong a word for me but then again, I respect your usage of it because you justify it.<br><br>You perceive this 'forced savings' system as robbery. I do not dispute that either. The govt definitely hoards this money for their usage.<br><br>However, imagine if Singaporeans do not have such a system, would they be financially and investment savvy enough to save enough for retirement? Some may but my gut feel is that many will not.<br><br>Have you noticed that there are many out there who earn, save and spend, then repeat this vicious cycle for years? (I was an ex- financial planner)<br><br>Then this will create social ills and the govt has reason to be worried.</div>
