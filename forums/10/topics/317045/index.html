              <p><strong>Needy elderly to get subsidised care from all GPs next year<br>By Hasnita A Majid, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 09 May 2008 1446 hrs</strong></p>
              <p><br>SINGAPORE: Starting from next year, needy elderly Singaporeans can get subsidised treatment for three major chronic illnesses at their family doctors' clinics.</p>
              <p>This is because the Ministry of Health has extended the Primary Care Partnership Scheme to cover diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia - or high cholesterol.</p>
              <p>The scheme was introduced in 2000 to allow eligible, means tested elderly Singaporeans to receive care at subsidised rates, but only at participating private GP (general practitioner) clinics.</p>
              <p>The aim of the scheme is to make it more convenient for the elderly to receive subsidised care nearby, instead of having to travel to a polyclinic.</p>
              <p>The move will benefit more than 19,000 patients who can get treated at the 450 GP clinics and 190 dental clinics participating in this scheme.</p>
              <p>74-year-old He Ming Rong and his wife go to the Toa Payoh Polyclinic every three months for treatment on their chronic diseases, as they pay subsidised rates.</p>
              <p>But they found it inconvenient as it takes them about half an hour to get to the polyclinic on foot. If they take the bus, they have to transfer at Ang Mo Kio Interchange, which they found troublesome. All in, they spend about four hours travelling to and fro, and consultation at the polyclinic.</p>
              <p>As such they prefer to go to their family doctor, whose clinic is just five minutes away from home.</p>
              <p>"We have seen this doctor for some time. (At) the polyclinic, the doctor keeps changing, and the things keep changing, like new medicine. It's very troublesome," said He.</p>
              <p>But this is all about to change. From next year, they can go to their family GP as the Primary Care Partnership Scheme (PCPS) is extended to cover chronic ailments.</p>
              <p>The scheme, which was introduced eight years ago, aims to make it more convenient for the needy elderly to receive subsidised care at nearby private clinics, instead of having to travel to a polyclinic. Currently it only covers ailments such as coughs and colds.</p>
              <p>"I'm already seeing them (patients) for acute conditions such as coughs and colds, so I think it would help if I can take care of their chronic diseases as well. That gives me a better idea of the patient's health in general," said Dr Teo Boon See at the Camry Medical Centre.</p>
              <p>Polyclinics now see 43 percent of patients with chronic diseases. The latest move will address this imbalance in the polyclinic's disproportionate share for chronic diseases and ensure right-sitting of patient care.</p>
              <p>Said Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan: "If the primary care sector is not strong and the healthcare sector is dominated by essentially tertiary care or hospital-based care, I think the country suffers for it. It doesn't mean (that there will be) no primary, what it means is a very expensive way of delivering primary care in a hospital when it can be done at a community level.</p>
              <p>"It will also help develop a long-term doctor-patient relationship, to eventually realise the vision of having one family physician for every Singaporean."</p>
              <p>Chronic diseases are a growing global epidemic and Singapore is not spared from this. To tackle this problem, the MOH wants to rally both the general practitioners and the polyclinics to work together as a team and complement each others strengths.</p>
              <p>To detect chronic diseases early, Singaporeans will be encouraged to be screened at GP clinics.</p>
              <p>From next month, those aged 40 and above will receive a letter from the Health Promotion Board to inform them of the importance of such screening, as well as the nearest GP clinic where the screening can be done. The screening programme will cover diabetes hypertension, lipid disorders and cervical cancer.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Subsidies will be given to the poorer 30 percent of the population. To qualify, patients need to come from households with a per capita income of S$700 and below, and be aged 65 and above. Disabled patients also qualify.</span> - CNA/ac/ls</p>

              <p>that's very bad inferencing skills you have. poorer 30 % does not equate to all having &lt;700 in income. &lt;700 in income, is possibly a subset of 30% and not an entirety -_-.</p>

              <p>Headache.... This is how i reason</p>
              <p>Subsidy given to poorer 30% of pop</p>
              <p>Subsidy mus have &lt;700/capita household</p>
              <p>So 30% of pop comes from &lt;700/capita household</p>
              <p>If percapita &gt;700 no subsidy<br>Therefore nt inside 30%pop.</p>
              <p>If by your definition, which might be true, then the sentence "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Subsidies will be given to the
                                      poorer 30 percent of the population." <span style="color: #000000;">is redundant. They might as well jus say help will be given to ppl with &lt;700. </span><br></span></p>

              <p>Subsidies will be given to certain people in the bottom 30% of the population. They must be over 65 years of age, and earning &lt;$700. Therefore not all in the 30% band will get the subsidies.</p>
              <p>This cannot be called a subsidy, it is more like reluctant charity.</p>
