Police are investigating," police spokeswoman Siow Cheng Cheng told Reuters.<br><br>The police probe came a day after the election, which saw the PAP, led by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, winning 66.6 percent of the votes cast and sweeping 82 out of 84 seats in parliament.<br><br>As with previous polls, this election was also overshadowed by defamation lawsuits and personal attacks -- a timeworn PAP tactic that has bankrupted some opposition leaders, thus disqualifying them for parliament.<br><br>Just a week before the election, Lee and his father, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, launched a defamation suit against the tiny Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) and its leaders.</div>

Gomez was attempting to leave the country but was stopped by immigration officials, who turned him over to the police.<br><br>"We don't know the specifics, but it could be due to the minority certificate," said George, referring to an incident when Gomez initially accused officials of misplacing his election papers more than a week before Saturday's election.<br><br>He subsequently apologized after security camera footage showed he put the form into his bag. The academic claimed he was distracted.<br><br>Gomez was part of a five-member Workers' Party team that contested a multimember ward against the ruling People's Action Party, where a minority candidate is compulsory.<br><br>On Saturday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's PAP won 82 of 84 seats in Singapore's 10th general elections since independence in 1965.<br><br>"Police received a complaint against James Gomez from the Elections Department, and police are investigating," said police spokeswoman Siow Cheng Cheng. She did not elaborate.<br><br>A security official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with policy, said Gomez has not been charged. If found guilty for criminal intimidation, Gomez could be jailed for up to seven years.<br><br>It is not immediately clear why the elections department waited till after the polls to file the complaint.<br><br>The incident was played up by ruling party politicians and local media, which rarely deviate from the government line.<br><br>Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew, called Gomez, 40, "a liar" and a "bad egg."<br><br>"He's not a fool ... He's saying he's got brains," elder statesman Lee was quoted on state-broadcaster Channel NewsAsia's Web site as saying. "Well, what do you use those brains for?"<br><br>Lee is the father of the current prime minister and wields considerable influence as "Minister Mentor" in his son's cabinet.<br><br>The PAP said they targeted Gomez, a researcher with a Stockholm-based institute, as it was an issue of credibility.</div>

And I will repeat it anywhere and you can't go and say, oh, I have apologised; let's move on. Can you commit a dishonourable -- maybe even one which is against the law -- an illegal act and say, let's move on because I've apologised? You may move on but you're going to move on out of politics in time."<br><br>Mr Lee said that whether other Workers' Party members connived at Mr Gomez's doings was a matter still to be determined.<br><br>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was asked to comment on Mr Gomez's detention during his victory parade in Ang Mo Kio.<br><br>Mr Lee said he was not aware of what had happened, since the Elections Department filed a police report against Mr Gomez.<br><br>He said the matter was now in the hands of police.<br><br>At about 8pm, Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim and the party's defeated candidate in Ang Mo Kio GRC, Lee Wai Leng, were seen entering the police headquarters.<br><br>It is believed they are helping with investigations. - CNA /ct<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/207083/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/207083/1/.html</a></div>

Thus the "wayang" comment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Bad news, forgot to check for security camera(s) and Oooooppssss! Sorry, yep will check, thanks for your precious time, see you next year, hope you did not take my threat seriously, i was just testing to see if you are alert.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
