And I will repeat it anywhere and you can't go and say, oh, I have apologised; let's move on. Can you commit a dishonourable -- maybe even one which is against the law -- an illegal act and say, let's move on because I've apologised? You may move on but you're going to move on out of politics in time."<br><br>Mr Lee said that whether other Workers' Party members connived at Mr Gomez's doings was a matter still to be determined.<br><br>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was asked to comment on Mr Gomez's detention during his victory parade in Ang Mo Kio.<br><br>Mr Lee said he was not aware of what had happened, since the Elections Department filed a police report against Mr Gomez.<br><br>He said the matter was now in the hands of police.<br><br>At about 8pm, Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim and the party's defeated candidate in Ang Mo Kio GRC, Lee Wai Leng, were seen entering the police headquarters.<br><br>It is believed they are helping with investigations. - CNA /ct</blockquote>2.Why he leave spore right after GE?He think he will lose?<br>If he win,how he serves ?</div>
