It was the PAP and the media who caused a crowd to gather. A more accurate metaphor would be:<br><br>- Man walks into a laundry shop and ask for jacket.<br>- Shop says don't have it.<br>- Man starts to question shop's procedures and cast suspecion on shop.<br>- Wife/CCTV proves that man never left jacket in shop.<br>- Shop owner go out on the streets and start shouting for everyone to come and see this blur c0ck screw up.<br>- Man embaressed and apologised in public to the crowd that gathered, admitting he made a mistake.<br>- Then shop owner became anal and paranoid and say that that man trying to frame shop and is probably spent by rival laundry shop to sabotage. And goes on and on and on to the crowd.<br>- Man roll eyes and left.<br>- Shop owner call police and said man threatened him.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anyways, in your laundry shop case, what is really wrong? The laundry shop system! They never even issue receipts for verification. There's obviously something wrong with their work flow!<br><br>In the case of the Election Dept, whose sole purpose of existance is to conduct elections, surely better work flow control and management could be in place for an event that happens once in 5 years.<br><br>SOMEMORE........<br><br>Gomez was accused of CRIMINAL INTIMINATION.....<br>please lor....wagging finger also criminal intimination, then loan sharks no need to hang pig heads and splash paint already.<br><br>SOMEMORE..........<br><br>The previous problem with the forms was not Gomez's mistake (if i remember correctly, it was the Justice of Peace's mistake to endorse an incomplete form). It was an administrative mistake by the WP team, not Gomez's fault.<br><br>SOMEMORE..........<br><br>Can we move on? My bak chor mee cold already......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me try to answer Lionnoisy :<br><br>My answers are in blue<br><br>Quote:<br><br>u are a laundry boss and a client walk in to<br>claim an expensive jacket his wife gave to u.<br>But u checked no such records.The client raised his voice and<br>a crowd gather.Every body looked at u.<br>Later,the wife of the client came in and told him<br>he went to a wrong laundry!!<br><br><span style="color: blue;">HOW could such a SILLY thing happen in the first place ? In any business transaction there is this thing called receipt. Will you leave something valuable in a shop without asking for an acknowledgement or receipt ? Even a client who has a receipt but loses it will rightly not be entitled to a claim. The business on its part will definitely want to issue a receipt, to protect itself from such potentially scandalous incidents. Of course, unless the business is not straight to start with.</span><br><br>Quote :<br><br>How if the wife never turned up and how the crowd would<br>think??<br><br><span style="color: blue;">The crowd would think that the "client" was a liar, trying to pull a farce one because he did not have a receipt. If the laundry did not issue any receipt, then the crowd would wonder what kind of business this fella was running.<br>They would never want to patronise such a shop.</span><br><br>Quote :<br><br>justice??Gomez,ask yourself,what have u done?<br>A Ph D candidate could make mistakes twice just on a form.<br>Fansatic lah.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">EXACTLY. If this fella is punished, it is not because he has committed any crime (absent minded is not a crime)  but because he is so dumb as to let the Ruling Party has an excuse to find fault with him during elections time.</span><br><br>Quote :<br><br>Do u beleive that when Gomez went to ELD on 26 Apr<br>at about 9.30am and asked for the Minority form,<br>he truthly thought that he DID submit on 24 April?<br>Only Gomez can give the ancwer.<br>U,as a thinking citizen,pl read all the info.from<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Since only Gomez can give the answer, why are we still articulating and speculating, as if we know all ? There are plenty of such actions, dialogues and "wayangs" going on. It happens everyday in business transactions, in schools and even at home. Who cares who is right or wrong ? They can continue bluffing each other. But the fact that the Gomez case happened during elections times made him stand up, for the wrong reason of course.<br>He was accused of lying to the Government, the Nation and hence all the citizens including you and me (if you are also a Singaporean).  This is the best ammunition for any party during elections time to whack its rival, is it not ??? Out of curiosity, let me ask one simple question - why did he need to do what he had done on that fateful day, KNOWING FULL WELL that there was a camera recording ? </span><br><br><span style="color: green;">Freedom of speech may be curbed<br>But freedom of thoughts cannot be curtailled.</span><br><br></div>
