In any business transaction there is this thing called receipt. Will you leave something valuable in a shop without asking for an acknowledgement or receipt ? Even a client who has a receipt but loses it will rightly not be entitled to a claim. The business on its part will definitely want to issue a receipt, to protect itself from such potentially scandalous incidents. Of course, unless the business is not straight to start with.</span><br><br>Quote :<br><br>How if the wife never turned up and how the crowd would<br>think??<br><br><span style="color: blue;">The crowd would think that the "client" was a liar, trying to pull a farce one because he did not have a receipt. If the laundry did not issue any receipt, then the crowd would wonder what kind of business this fella was running.<br>They would never want to patronise such a shop.</span><br><br>Quote :<br><br>justice??Gomez,ask yourself,what have u done?<br>A Ph D candidate could make mistakes twice just on a form.<br>Fansatic lah.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">EXACTLY. If this fella is punished, it is not because he has committed any crime (absent minded is not a crime)  but because he is so dumb as to let the Ruling Party has an excuse to find fault with him during elections time.</span><br><br>Quote :<br><br>Do u beleive that when Gomez went to ELD on 26 Apr<br>at about 9.30am and asked for the Minority form,<br>he truthly thought that he DID submit on 24 April?<br>Only Gomez can give the ancwer.<br>U,as a thinking citizen,pl read all the info.from<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Since only Gomez can give the answer, why are we still articulating and speculating, as if we know all ? There are plenty of such actions, dialogues and "wayangs" going on. It happens everyday in business transactions, in schools and even at home. Who cares who is right or wrong ? They can continue bluffing each other. But the fact that the Gomez case happened during elections times made him stand up, for the wrong reason of course.<br>He was accused of lying to the Government, the Nation and hence all the citizens including you and me (if you are also a Singaporean).  This is the best ammunition for any party during elections time to whack its rival, is it not ??? Out of curiosity, let me ask one simple question - why did he need to do what he had done on that fateful day, KNOWING FULL WELL that there was a camera recording ? </span><br><br><span style="color: green;">Freedom of speech may be curbed<br>But freedom of thoughts cannot be curtailled.</span><br><br></div></blockquote>May be it is time for the ED to update / review their procedure.<br><br>A receipt to be issued for any forms collected by ED.<br><br>This is common practice in most business organization.<br><br>Why first world ED do not put this good practice in place and subject himself to this nonsense now?<br><br></div>

This is too simplistic. In real life, there is often no absolutes but a mixture of right and wrong with both parties contributing one part of the problem.<br><br>Singapore's democracy framework ..eg its one-man-one-vote election system has been altered to suit the power in power to perpetuate its control and power.<br><br>The basic and fundamental rights of citizens are in danger of being superseded by new meanings interpreted legalistically to suit narrow interest of the power that be.<br><br>There is no more rule of law when the significance of justice, fairness and equity are being made less objective and more subjective. Innuendos have taken over as important part of evidence in defamation suits.<br><br>Whoever is in political power will be able to interpret new innuendos as almost every utterances can be interpreted as innuendos. How does the judiciary going to go about in administration of laws and its legal system when we are fast reaching a point where distinction between right and wrong has become quite blurred.<br><br>It now looks like the government can deprive citizens of their rights and entitlements for estate upgrading depending on loyalty to the political party in power. There is no absolute right or wrong now about citizens' rights too.<br><br>So it would be quite farcical to carry on talking about mistakes in forms or who is liars etc as bigger mistakes committed depending on who committed those mistakes may not be mistakes but excused or justified on some shifting subjective ground.</div>
