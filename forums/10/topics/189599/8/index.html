This was a credible showing for an Opposition team but not enough to dislodge its PAP competitor which was led by Foreign Minister George Yeo.<br><br>The spotlight was directed at Mr Gomez at the hustings after an incident at the Elections Department over a minority candidate form.<br><br>He claimed that he submitted the form on April 24 but when he went to collect the certificate, the department said that it did not have his application. He waved his finger at the officials and was seen saying: "You know what's the implication? Something must happen. When will you call me?"<br><br>Subsequently, when the department reviewed a recording by its closed circuit camera, it showed Mr Gomez putting the form in his briefcase and walking away with it. It released this recording to the media.<br><br>Mr Gomez later apologised, saying he was Â“distractedÂ”.<br><br>But PAP leaders said the apology was inadequate and pressed the WP to drop him from its slate of candidates.<br><br>Last week, Deputy Prime Minister Mr Wong Kan Seng issued a statement detailing how Mr Gomez Â“stage-managedÂ” the incident to damage t he government and discredit the department.<br><br>Minister Mentor Mr Lee Kuan Yew called Mr Gomez a liar and challenged the WP man and the partyÂ’s leaders to sue him if that was untrue.<br><br>The police statement today confirmed that the police interviewed several people, including department officials, Mr Gomez and Ms Lim.<br><br>Mr Gomez was approached on Sunday as he was about to leave Changi Airport to return to his job in Sweden as a policy analyst at the Idea International think-tank based at Stockholm.<br><br>Police officers requested him to follow them back to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to help them in their investiga tion.<br><br>He agreed and was questioned at the CID for eight hours. He said he gave the police a Â“full and comprehensive outline of what had transpiredÂ”.<br><br>He also said this morning that his passport Â“has been seized and impounded indefinitelyÂ”.<br><br>Today is the last day of his leave from work. He is waiting, he said, for a letter from the police to explain the situation to his employer.<br><br>He will, he added, continue to extend his full co-operation to the investigation by the police.<br><br><a href="http://www.asiaone.com/specials/ge2006/news/20060508_story6_1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asiaone.com/specials/ge2006/news/20060508_story6_1.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ha ha.... this is ludicrous.<br><br>I believe gomez didnt pursue the issue beyond what was caught on camera..He asked the officials if they new the consequences of their actions.<br><br>How many times have we forgotten something and insisted that we havent.<br>Is that to say that we all are liars? Is human error not to be accounted for? Even The stupid ERP system cant work properly... We put cash card in.. THe bloody thing never deduct, we still get letter stating that we need to pay fine cuz we never put card in... i mean what the hell. Unless the goverment can prove malicious intent, (which they undoubtadly will, through the power of influence) The case has no weight in my eyes.<br><br>Look in my service to the government, on numerous occasions, members of the public have done simillar things. Some, so insistent that are right, have written in to their MPs. After ive proven that there is no record, no action was taken. I have even been abused verbally by the public. These individuals were not taken to cort, or custody. So, i am left baffled at this arrest. Makes no coherrent sense to me.</div>
