The Elections Department says he warned its staff of "consequences" when the document could not be traced.<br><br>Asked about the missing document by reporters, Mr James Gomez, a Workers' Party (WP) candidate for the Aljunied GRC, merely said he did not wish to discuss his election administration with the media.<br><br>The Elections Department felt that by brushing aside the issue, Mr Gomez had planted a doubt on whether the officials had been straight in dealing with him. So, on Friday, it released the transcript of a taped phone conversation and footage from a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera to show exactly what happened on Monday, when Mr Gomez claimed he had submitted his certificate.<br><br>In the phone conversation on Wednesday, Mr Gomez is heard reiterating that he did, indeed, hand in the document.<br><br>The CCTV footage, on the other hand, shows him putting the certificate in his own bag and walking away Â— without submitting it.<br><br>Technically, the issue did not turn out to be serious as the WP had other candidates with minority certificates to slot into its GRC slates. It could, however, have influenced Mr Gomez's choice of constituency.<br><br>In fact, if not for the fiasco, Mr Gomez could have stood in Ang Mo Kio, which required an Indian candidate, instead of Aljunied GRC which did not, said Foreign Minister George Yeo on Friday night in a Party Branch at Hougang Avenue 1, after the People's Action Party's (PAP) maiden rally was cancelled due to thunder and lightning.<br><br>But the clear proof that Mr Gomez had wrongly claimed he had submitted his certificate Â— and did not take the chance to clear the air Â— has already given the ruling party some ready ammunition.<br><br>Referring to the WP's recently-stated plan to campaign on three issues including that of accountability, Mr Yeo said Mr Gomez's run-in with the Elections Department showed that while "it's easy to say these things ... carrying them out, walking the talk is not so easy".<br><br>The Elections Department said it was releasing the transcript and the recording to remove all doubt about the integrity of the electoral process.<br><br>Mr Gomez had visited the Elections Department on Wednesday, telling its officials to look for his certificate and asking them to call him back. Around 1pm that day, when Ms Florence Tan from the department phoned and asked him to describe what happened, Mr Gomez gave a vivid narration of how had had submitted the certificate two days earlier.<br><br><strong>"I submitted this with my colleague ... so my colleague was with me all the time," Mr Gomez told Ms Tan in a conversation that she taped. "I've checked with (the colleague) and she confirmed also that the form was submitted and was accepted."<br><br>The CCTV footage, on the other hand, shows a female colleague walking up to Mr Gomez's side only after he had put the document in his bag.<br><br></strong>After he had given his version, Ms Tan told Mr Gomez: "We have reviewed the CCTV footage ... After you filled (the certificate) in, you actually kept it in your bag and ... you didn't take it out any more."<br><br>On hearing this, Mr Gomez "abruptly changed tone", said Mr Yeo.<br><br>"Oh, I see. I am very happy to hear your version of the story. I will just go and check my bag because I'm outside now," Mr Gomez had said according to the transcript.<br><br>Mr Yeo said he found it "very odd" that Mr Gomez never thought to check his bag for a "big envelope" containing his application form from Monday to Wednesday, especially since it was during an anxious time in the run-up to Nomination Day.<br><br>With the evidence out, Mr Yeo said WP chief Low Thia Khiang owed an explanation to Aljunied voters for fielding Mr Gomez to contest the GRC.<br><br>"Beyond that, he (Mr Low) owes it to all Singaporeans to tell us the full story of what had happened," said Mr Yeo, adding that it might take some time for the country to have a "First World Opposition".<br><br>The Elections Department said that Mr Gomez had not contacted it since Â— either to confirm that he had found the certificate in his bag or to confirm whether his colleague still maintained that he had submitted the form. - TODAY/fz</blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">if u want review this saga,must read fast for CNA may remove<br>by 7 days archive.<strong></strong></span></div>
