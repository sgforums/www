            <div class='col-md body'>Well, he claimed  he submitted the forms, but was forced to retort his claims when the ED released the CCTV. Under Section 182, it can be argued that Gomez does have the motiff to confound the ED through the developing circumstance of him apologising after the release of the CCTV. But I have to concede, that is a very weak case as it does not  prove Gomez had intentionally and deliberately misled the ED, the nearest sniff to that is circumstantial at best. I'm no law student, so correct me if I'm wrong</div>

But see, sometimes the way we put things across can be interpreted differently and out of context.<br><br>He did not do this twice - the last time he was penalised by being disqualified. This time, it looks as though there is an attempt to penalise him under section 182. Which simply goes against the sense of justice that most Singaporeans have.<br><br>The scenarios for administrative chaos and loss of confidence in the civil service are a bit of overreaction, and really shows a lack of trust in ourselves, to be discerning. Its a tired paternalistic view which fails to recognise that the kids have grown up.<br><br>You have to remember on nomination day in some countries (of course not Singapore), quite a lot of plot and counterplot take place as each party try to conceal where they will field their candidates and the other party tries to find out in order to counter challenge if necessary.<br><br>Party sympathisers may disguise themselves as passers-by to try and discover where an opposing candidate is likely to want to stand. All this is part of the fun and games and one can be sure that there would be possible feints. Wayang, one might even call it.<br><br>Lets for a moment imagine that things like these do happen, and that there are all kinds of last minute plans that can be activated at the last minute, it would be entirely possible for a chap who has a track record of getting paperwork wrong to mess up again in the stress.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></div>
