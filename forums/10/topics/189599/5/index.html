I appreciate your help."<br><br>And he could have done so with a smile.<br><br>I don't think ED could have easily got him fixed up if he smiled.<br><br>Of course, the conversation between the two party were unknown and his facial expression might have gotten him into big problem.<br><br>If the legal system finds JG guilty and places a harsh sentence on him, I believed that I would find it hard to accept.<br><br>Afterall, he apologized. It was not a mistake that is unrepairable. It is not like JG made detestable remarks about how the country was being run. It is not like JG made horrible speeches aimed at ED and the ruling party.<br><br>If ED had solid proof to testify JG was abusive and intimidating, I believe apologies are not sufficient, but if he was not, a light sentence would acceptable if he was found to have erred and no sentences should there be insufficient evidence.<br><br>Although I find his 'forgetfulness' unacceptable, I believe he should be given the right to walk scot free since I did not find his actions in the footages offensive. I doubt I would vote in his favour though in future elections though.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

What if the SDA member could really carry out the building of HDB flats in good quality and lower cost?! Wouldn't Mah deprive Singaporeans of this previledge?! Even if he cannot, it is good to be transparent to the public on the breakdown of our costs for our HDB falts, quality of material, sub contractor's names etc etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is the big deal over the James Gomez issue i have still failed to understand. he has apologised and realised his mistake on the form submission. so lets move on. we all make mistakes and have in the event called and threatened our town councils or government bodies all the time for failling to act on matters relating to services provided. i'm not ashamed to say that i have done it too. does this mean that all singaporeans should be charged too for having a go at a civil servant who fails on his/her duties?<br><br>what i dont agree with is MM Lee's high handedness and going around calling people liars. MM Lee is not god here. Its time he steps down and retires once and for all.</div>
