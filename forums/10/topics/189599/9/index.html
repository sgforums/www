Mah said that Edmund Lim can be subcontractor of HDB, but when Lim goes to HDB to request information and be the sub-contractor Mah asked HDB not to give him.

Gomez himself also did not use this new argument just put out by Low Thia Khiang.  What Gomez did say was that he did not file his minority certificate.<br><br>So, if GomezÂ’s own explanation can be believed, then Low Thia Khiang must have thought of this new explanation only in the last 24 hours.<br><br>Anyway, after the general election, there will be a full public resolution on this matter.<br>WONG KAN SENG,5  MAY 2006</blockquote>Read and Think and think again.Who tell truths?Whi lied?<br><br>2.<strong><a href="http://www.pap.org.sg/articleview.php?id=808&amp;mode=&amp;cid=23" rel="nofollow">Â“I submitted this with my colleague; so my colleague( Ms Sylvia Lim )was with me all the time.
