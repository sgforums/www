              <p><strong>Indian new citizen/PR told Singapore NSman complaining about foreigners to make himself more “marketable”</strong></p>
              <p>Temasek Review</p>
              <p>A probable Indian new citizen/PR has asked a Singapore citizen and NSman complaining about unfair competition from foreigners to make himself more “marketable” on a discussion about the Budget 2010 on YPAP Facebook:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/ypapbudget586.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="350"></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: </strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=153492722129&amp;ref=nf#!/youngpap?v=feed&amp;story_fbid=356053044256"><span style="color: #a91b33;">YPAP Facebook</span></a><strong>]</strong></p>
              <p>The discussion was started by YPAP member Genesis Shen who had expressed concerns that the PAP’s “generous spending” on the middle and lower income families in Singapore will “affect the Party’s long term policy of fiscal prudence.”</p>
              <p>Ting Siong, a 28 year old Singapore Chinese male who had served two and a half years of National Service shared his personal experience: he had been doing one contract job one after another because the permanent jobs are mostly taken up by foreigners.</p>
              <p>Mr Sinha Shekhar,who was born in Dhanbad, India and indicated clearly that he shared the political views of the PAP on his Facebook, replied that “there is nothing called permanent jobs” and urge Ting Siong and other Singaporeans to make themselves more “marketable and move ahead”.</p>
              <p>He also praised the  budget as being a “very prudent” one and it is “good that we have been tiSghtening our belt for quite some time.”</p>
              <p>His insensitive and callous remarks brought a barrage of criticisms from fellow Singaporeans on the discussion who questioned if he is a new citizen or PR.</p>
              <p>A Singaporean Sin Rak Sin told Mr Sinha to shut up:</p>
              <p><em>“Sinha, Cut the bootlicking crap and shut the fxxk up, will u? We do not need a foreigner to meddle with our internal domestic affair.”</em></p>
              <p>Of late, the Straits Times Forum has been publishing letters of support from these new citizens and PRs heaping praises on the PAP government.</p>
              <p>How can Sinha expect Singaporeans to make themselves more “marketable” when they have to compete directly with foreign workers who cost a fraction of them?</p>
              <p>Furthermore, NSmen like Ting Siong are at a disadvantage as they have to be away for 4 weeks each year due to reservist obligations.</p>
              <p>The PAP has been actively recruiting PRs and new citizens like Sinha into their Youth Wing and grassroots organizations to boost their flagging support base.</p>
              <p>As they are not familiar with Singapore, they tend to agree blindly with what the leaders told them, as exemplified by the comments posted by Sinha.</p>
              <p>Due to the PAP’s liberal immigration policies, foreigners now make up 36 per cent of Singapore’s population, up from 14 per cent in 1990. Of the remaining 64 per cent who are citizens, an increasing number are born overseas like Mr Sinha.</p>
              <p>According to a recent Wall Street Journal, the relentless influx of foreigners over the last few years has depressed the wages of ordinary Singaporeans, increased the cost of living, especially that of public housing, decreased labor productivity and led to an overall decline in the standards of living.</p>
              <p>Faced with a potential backlash from angry voters in the coming election, the PAP is now trying to sing a different tune to placate Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>If Singaporeans do not vote wisely in the next election, they will have to bear with the lectures of not only the PAP leaders, but their new “comrades” like Mr Sinha as well.</p>

              <p>If PRs cannot see the additional burden of National Service and its reservist obligations, tell him or her to imagine that it is akin to the PR taking 2-4 weeks of no pay leave from the employer every year and going to do often unproductive menial work under the hot sun for those 2-4 weeks.  </p>

              <p><strong>ST: Foreigners “integrating” into Singapore as more of them are joining dating agencies to find “love”</strong></p>
              <p><strong>TR</strong></p>
              <p>According to a report in the Straits Times today, more foreigners are joining Singapore dating agencies in a bid to find “love”.</p>
              <p>Dating agencies told The Straits Times they have seen an increase of up to 30 per cent in single foreign clients over the past two years, most of which are professionals and executives in their late 20s to early 40s and are degree holders.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times added a spin to it by claiming that it is a sign that PRs and foreigners are more willing to “integrate” themselves into Singapore society.</p>
              <p>It quoted NUS sociologist Paulin Straughan as saying:</p>
              <p><em>“When you are willing to consider dating and forging a long-term relationship not from your own race and nationality, it’s the ultimate willingness to assimilate.”</em></p>
              <p>Due to the ruling party’s liberal immigration policies, foreigners now make up 36 per cent of Singapore’s population, up from 14 per cent in 1990. Of the remaining 64 per cent who are citizens, an increasing number are born overseas.</p>
              <p>The Department of Statistics revealed that there are 533,200 PRs and 1.25 million foreigners in Singapore as of last year. This is up from the 449,200 PRs and 1 million foreigners in 2007. In 2008, 6,077 citizens married non-Singaporeans, an increase from 4,566 in 2003.</p>
              <p>It is hardly surprising to see an increase in the number of foreigners seeking long-term relationships in Singapore as they are more of them coming to study and work here.</p>
              <p>How it can be interpreted as a “sign” that they are willing to integrate themselves into Singapore society is anybody’s guess.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, it is highly debatable if all of them are looking for a partner in Singapore purely out of love or because of other more mundane motives.</p>
              <p>A number of foreigners are marrying Singaporeans simply because they want to secure Singapore citizenship which can be a passport for them elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Again, not all foreigner-Singapore couples choose to remain in Singapore, especially the highly qualified professionals who may relocate with their foreign spouses back to their homelands or elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Faced with a potential backlash from angry voters in the next election, the ruling party has been trying hard to convince Singaporeans initially that foreigners are needed in Singapore and now that they are “integrating” well into Singapore.</p>
              <p>As too many foreigners are allowed into Singapore within too short a period of time, it is near impossible to expect most, if not all of them to assimilate into Singapore society in a single generation.</p>
              <p>Fortunately for the ruling party, no matter how badly it screws up, it can always rely on the ever faithful Singapore media to whitewash their mistakes and portray them in a positive manner.</p>

              <p>According to a recent Wall Street Journal, the relentless influx of foreigners over the last few years has depressed the wages of ordinary Singaporeans, increased the cost of living, especially that of public housing, decreased labor productivity and led to an overall decline in the standards of living.</p>

              <p>I think a lot of these PRs don't understand fully what it means to be a Singaporean male working in Singapore.</p>

              <p>If PRs cannot see the additional burden of National Service and its reservist obligations, tell him or her to imagine that it is akin to the PR taking 2-4 weeks of no pay leave from the employer every year and going to do often unproductive menial work under the hot sun for those 2-4 weeks.  </p>

              <p>Agreed.</p>
              <p>Many of these Indian born migrants are rather naive when comes to Singapore politic. </p>
              <p>They naively compare chaotic, slower lifestyle and to modern, convenient city-life and see all the pros without bothering about the cons of small city-dwelling.   <br><br>But working, studying and talking to them, I am seeing a (very) small percentage slowly wise-up to Singapore politics. </p>
