            <div class='col-md body'>any thoughts or comments?<br><br>frankly, i think it sux... the timing could not have been worse, considering that we are facing the problem of unemployment, poor economy and pessimism.<br><br>it is frankly, not just a "review" of property tax valuation, but an outright increase in the tax rate... at a time when the gov't should really be lowering the tax rate to stimulate consumer spending... this, coupled with the GST hike, really does have the effect of lowering the average family's ability to spend more to stimulate the domestic economy...<br><br><strong><span class="large">Straits Times</span></strong><br>APRIL 15, 2004<br><br><strong>Property tax rise small, but it's 'not a good time'<br>Some HDB homeowners are concerned about Iras' review, although many welcome Government's continued annual rebates </strong><br>By Daryl Loo<br><br>IN FIVE years of living in his four-room Sengkang flat, writer Isaac Tan hasn't had to bother much about his property tax.<br><br>The Government's property tax rebate covers most of it, and he spreads the remainder over 12 interest-free Giro payments. So the tax he pays each month is 'almost negligible'.<br><br>But instead of paying about $20 a year now, he will have to pay about $83 when the tax rise takes full effect in 2007.<br><br>As expected, he and some of the other 15 people interviewed yesterday were concerned about the increase.<br><br>The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore said yesterday that it is revising the annual values of all Housing Board flats, and the property taxes payable by flat owners this year.<br><br>Except for one or two-room HDB flat owners, who still will not have to pay property tax, most of those who own three-room or larger flats will have to pay more.<br><br>Currently, 99.8 per cent of three-room homeowners and 73 per cent of four-room homeowners do not have to pay out of pocket because of property tax rebates given since 1994.<br><br>With the revision, 87 per cent of three-room flat owners and all four-room flat owners will now have to pay.<br><br>'I don't see the increase as a huge sum to pay, but the jump raises my eyebrows,' said Mr Tan. 'Singaporeans are still feeling the doom and gloom of the economic slowdown after all.'<br><br>Ang Mo Kio resident Ronald Phoah, 57, a taxi driver, agreed. 'Is this the right time?' he asked.<br><br>But there were others who thought the increases were not too much to absorb.<br><br>Mrs Lynda Yap, 37, a human resource executive, said she is paying $150 a year in property tax for her executive flat in Hougang. The increase to $186 is 'quite minimal' for her.<br><br>Housewife Cindy Toh, 30, who lives in a five-room flat in Punggol, agreed. 'I don't think the increase is a lot,' she said.<br><br>Others welcomed the Government's continued yearly property tax rebates, which range from $25 to $150 a year, depending on the annual value of the property.<br><br>Iras is also going to phase the increases in for those who own and live in five-room or smaller flats. They need pay only one-third of their tax bill next year, two-thirds in 2006, and the full bill only from 2007.<br><br>Help is also available for those who can't pay, Iras said. Taxpayers can approach its officers to find out more.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Copyright @ 2004 Singapore Press Holdings.

            <div class='col-md body'>Our gov is heartless and stubborn,not listening to the public view. Even the amount require to fork out is not significant,one must be wondering why the gov not continuing sponsering since the amount is so small! I suspect the property tax may be rising rapidly to a weighty amount in the near future! So sporean don't take this lightly!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I think whether its been 14 years since the last increase is not the issue. the issue is WHY NOW? Anyway, i was trying to recall what has been increased lately, maybe you guys can help my memory.<br><br>1. Housing tax rate<br>2. Potentially have to pay more for university<br>3. Public transport fare<br><br>I dun think this is very encouraging to young couples to give birth AT ALL! Our society is more educated now and we would like to ensure that our children and us are able to live in reasonable comfort and luxury. Living expenses here are high, with public transport and housing cost expected to increase, plus uni fees are expected to increase in the future? I say forget it.<br><br>Reports about overseas student having to work thru their uni days to pay off their debts? But cars dun cost above 100k over there... they are not expected to buy new cars every 10 years (or an a punishment, pay higher road tax plus insurance), their housing does not cost over 200k (for a 1000+ sq ft apartment).<br><br>So what if my wife or I get additional days off? Wow, am I supposed to be jumping for joy when I know from then on my life will go downhill with non-stop worry about whether I can pay my bills???<br><br>The govt makes it sound that giving maternity leave was the best thing on earth. We are smarter than that. They give us leave but increase our cost of living. They are not serious in wanting to give us the best. When our MP speaks up for us, they get scolded in Parliament (eg. Amy Kor who spoke up for her constituent when they felt betrayed).<br><br>To date, I have not seen a decent proposal to encourage us to give birth. The more I wait, I fear, I regret that the govt is only making our decision easier to not want children.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>like CX mention, PAP no longer affected by unpopular policies and still be in power in the next election. Time for us to wake up. maybe alot of singaporean has woken up that why topic like more and more singaporean migrating oversea in search of greener pasture and relax life.<br><br>Darnsplace you mention about increasing the following:<br>1. Housing tax rate<br>2. Potentially have to pay more for university<br>3. Public transport fare<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4. GST </strong></span><br>very true, not only increase the above but your decrease the following :<br>1. CPF by 2 %.<br>2. wage freeze/paycut/flexiwage syste,<br>all these come  at a time when our economy is picking up.<br><br>basically govt now govt is trying to balance it buget depicit by increasing the GST/COE/ auxilliary taxes. wana guess what next?<br><br>By the way, our minister Yao say few days ago confirm increasing transportation cost again due to security reason. each passenger has to pay few more cents per trip.to me, this is bullshit, just way t increase the revenue of the public transport operators.<br>i have few question for such a move:<br>1. are these guards at MRT station/ bus terminal armed? if not, no meaning , they cant protect themselves. even if they are arm, can they search for every passenger? or they just stand there for show or increase the revenue of Cisco police?<br>2. every passenger add few cents will means additional hundreds of thousands of revenue to them/day.<br><br>they are indeed smart to suck our bloods!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>instead of sliming the gov't, i think its helpful to think and see if there are alternatives to these... not that we can actually change the world here, but that we should actually see if there's a better idea...<br><br>to me, i think the increase in property tax is uncalled for... 14 years or otherwise... bad timing is bad timing.<br><br>it seems odd that an issue as sensitive as tax rate wold normally raise a big debate in a more democratic country... but here, u see an announcement in the papers and voila... your tax bills comes along and u pay without a peep...<br><br>hmmm... it seems rhetorical to even ask where's the opposition that's supposed to speak for the people...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
