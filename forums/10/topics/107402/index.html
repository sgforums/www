You bet one dollar on the table, immediately 20 cents go to the government as tax; 30 cents go to the operator.  The remaining 50 cents is pool for "win".  After few rounds, majority of the money is gone - to the government and operator.<br><br>Where as, if you go into stock market, you buy share with money that you can spare.  You can study the market and "invest" in "blue chip" shares if you are adverse to high risk.  Hold it (lock it up) for the rest of your live and cash it only when the need arises.  That is how many "stupid investor" had safe guided their life saving through stocks and shares, by investing prudently.<br><br>Of course, they are also pundit (very cleaver investor) treating stock market as gambling pit and invest based on rumours.  They can make it big but also can lose their pant in a very short time.<br><br>In another word, you enter the casino with the chance that you sure lose.  Whereas you enter a stock market, you still have a chance to make good if you do not treat it as a gambling pit (hit and run).<br><br></div>

Wat do u think of sentosa now ? How often had u go there ? Face it, singapore is a dead boring place and tourists aren't coming here anymore. Wat do u propose to pull in tourists over ?<br><br>Actually I thought they already have the go ahead and r planning on who to build the casino or who to be the main contractor now...</div>

There r social ills from opening a casino but there r also social gains. Without casino, Las vegas is nothing. Some people may gamble their life savings away, some people may earn their life saving from employment of casino. Some children may be neglected, but some children may get the economic benefit from opening a casino as well. They will bite your ass, yet sooth it in another way too. U say tat it will be us who bears social ill, but it is also us who gain social benefits as well. Singapore become richer, gov become richer, less tax for us, more jobs with higher pay for us. We also benefit.</div>
