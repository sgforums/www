              <p>The problem is psychological testing is still a dubious science. You just can't measure whether how much a person can take before he or she cracks. Even if you could measure it, it can also mean the person is inflexible to accept another way of thinking.</p>
              <p>IQ =/= EQ is a nice phrase to toss around, but only applicable in hindsight. How sure are you that the person next to you wouldn't sell you out given the correct incentives?</p>
              <p>Though i agree with you that Nobel Prizes don't seemed to be a good gauge of intellectual competency of a country.</p>

              <p>The unfortunate suicide of A*Star scholar Mr Lin Zhi Qiang purportedly over rejection of love by a China woman has shocked not only his family and friends who are still going to terms with his unexpected demise, but also ordinary Singaporeans from all walks of life.</p>
              <p>A*Star stands for the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, a premier research company which is started and funded by the Singapore government in its ambition to make Singapore the research hub of Asia.</p>
              <p>The Singapore government has a long history of awarding scholarships to the creme la crop of junior college students for them to pursue their tertiary education either overseas or at local universitites. Most of them are awarded on the basis of their academic grades in the GCE ‘A’ levels examinations though there have been a shift of late towards non-academic attributes such as creativity and leadership skills.</p>
              <p>XXX</p>
              <p>The present “scholar system” has done grave injustices to both the scholars themselves and those who have failed to qualify for it. To the former, the artifically cloistered environment in which they are put in deprives them of a chance to fulfill their full potential in the outside world. To the latter group, the limits placed on their career advancement does little to recognize or reward their hard work, talents and contributions.</p>
              <p>It is time for the government to relook into its policy of giving out scholarships funded by taxpayers to the most academically gifted students regardless of their socio-economic backgrounds. Only by levelling the playing field between the scholars and the non-scholars will there be real meritocracy in the state bureaucracy instead of a half-baked segmented meritocracy for the two different groups which is the reality on the ground now.</p>

              <p><br>Does it matter anything at all if the victim is a "scholar" and he's from A*Star?</p>
              <p>It doesn't matters anything to me at all. To me, he is just as regular as any Singaporean living and walking human beings out there. And it doesn't means because he WAS a "scholar" and from some A*Star-hoo-ha company makes him deserves MORE compassion than anyone else.</p>
              <p>Everybody's lives are equally important and valuable, to compare people's death and put them on a scale is completely wrong. How would you feel if your lives were less worthy than him because he's a "scholar"?</p>
              <p>If that "scholar" has already chosen DEATH over LIFE, then maybe he wasn't that much of a talent as you had expected.</p>
              <p>Flame me if you want, but I have absolutely no mercy nor compassion for cowardly people who simply do not have the will to LIVE. Such people have trampled upon the gift of life bestowed upon him by his parents and it truly disgust me to think that I need to pay my tribute to people who have absolutely no respect for LIFE and the LIVING people who cared, love him and especially brought him upon to the world.</p>
              <p>I don't need to tell you, you will also know where he is heading right now. And I don't care, I don't care and I don't care. So please shut up about your compassion plead cos they are absolutely worthless and meaningless to me. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>I CARE ONLY FOR THE LIVING AND THOSE WITH THE WILL TO LIVE.</p>

              <p>EQ's rubbish and the measurement of IQ is a flawed system.  In either case it wouldn't have helped this bugger - it was his neuroticism that did him in.  What might have helped is his colleagues giving enough of shit to see that he was in strife.</p>
              <p>As for thiose asking about the significance of this guy's death, some of the work at A*Star is of a sensitive nature.  If he went off the rails, security on these things could have been compromised.  It's not so much a case of him offing himself as the fact that the job requires a reasonable amount of security clearance that would justify selection testing.</p>

              <p>i think it's MOE whom should be blamed for, i remember when my scholarship is terminated, although i got many reason, but the officer in charge, said it's all excuses, i think she failed to understand, and at the end she said, she don't like me,</p>
              <p> so i gonna to say, yes, just leave it to fate,</p>
              <p>before we come here, the officer in charge of selection, went to china, and picture singapore to be the heavan on earth, if once she mention the suicide rate a bit, i think whose scholar won't be so rushy to come here.</p>
              <p>i don't want to raise any conflict, just stating a fact.</p>

              <p>my suggestion to it, is to equipped the distorted scholar with free cigarette, and then exam system have to be reformed, if failed, don't have to worry to spend another semester.</p>
              <p>Making exam retaking , let's say in three weeks possible</p>

              <p>ntu really sucks, the 50 years anniversary is fake, actually it's only 20 sth, needless to say Nanyang technological university doesnot come from Nanyang university, the Nanyang university teach in chinese, the teaching in nanyang university is good.</p>
              <p>The graduate from Nanyang university won't recognise Nanyang technological university.</p>
              <p>NTU don't have alot tradition, so you don't have to wait for the professor in ntu to enlighten you, except academic, they are worthless in other place.</p>
              <p>THere do have some good teacher in NTU, but they are in business faculty, not in engineering, i remember i take a GE about religion study in NTU, and professor is westerner, he is quite good.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if you are going to be admitted into NTU, don't expect you are going to have a interesting experience.</p>

Just because the guy's a scholar and obviously is too much of a nerd to take rejection, doesn't change anything. There's an obvious undercurrent of "anti-scholars" which is natural because of the way they are venerated by the government, but that does not change the fact that parents and schools and the government value paper qualifications over emotional development. That means, you, me and everyone in Singapore. Until that changes dramatically and across the population, such things won't be unusual at all.</p></div>
