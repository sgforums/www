              <p>A pledge does not meant its is need to be fulfiled, as long as you work toward the pledge and always bear it in mind that this nation is base what is within the pledge, you are a good citizen. I believed that Singaporeans acknowledges the progress what Singapore has done during these 50 years of nation building and self governing thru the aspiration and tenets as enshrined in the National Pledge. It further reaffirms its committment towards achieveing goals and ideals of our pledge when we debate and argue over national policies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If Pledge can be fulfilled, it is no more a pledge, because it had be fulfilled and let move on to another set of pledge, I believe that when writing this pledge, the late Mr Rajaratnam should had known that there can never be a equal society base on justice and equality, therefore he wrote it to constantly remind us to works toward it. This is further edited by LKY to make it a National pledge for all to recite it as a true singaporean.</p>

              <p><br>The Pledge is an honest one - and is treated as solemn as an Oath.</p>
              <p>Can an Oath be a dishonest oath ?</p>
              <p>Surely, the late S.Rajaratnam did not go through all his troubles to draft a "dishonest" Pledge ?</p>
              <p>The Pledge is to be recited in only one possible way - solemnly as an OATH.</p>
              <p>The honesty lies with the person who takes the Pledge; and if he is honest enough to be true to the Oath that he take with this Pledge, and fulfull it - and not to simply treat it as mere 'aspiration' that are good for hoping only.</p>

              <p><br>companies' statement spell out their objectives and committment toward customer. It is total different from the pledge ya, people work for money, they abide the statement because of a job, a salary and a family to take care of, unlike our national pledge, it dun pay you, it is more of a vision and patriotism for the country you are labelled with as a Singapore's Singaporean. An identity you honored without any string attached ya</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>When you raise your - <em>protest banners and tell Mr LKY,''we want equality throughout all races, regardless u r malay,chinese,indian,or european" </em>- do you have any idea what you want that is to be "<em>equally spread throughout all races</em>" ?</p>
              <p>The Pledge simply state "<em>to build a democratic society based on justice and equality</em> - <em>so as to achieve happiness and progress for our nation</em>".</p>
              <p>Firstly a Democratic Society must be built to ensure that justice and equal treatment is given to every Singapore Citizen, who made the Pledge, and it is through justice and equal treatment that happiness and progress for our nation can be achieved.</p>
              <p>It is not so clever for MM LKY to bring out the bogeyman fears that the call for equality will spell trouble in that the weaker minority Malays will react with suspicious that the help extended to them will no longer exist as guaranteed in the Constitution.</p>
              <p>Why should this help to the Malays be removed ? It can only result in no justice and equality when the special help given to the Malays are removed, when there are more in the Malay Community recognised as being weaker and cannot compete with the other ethnic groups - it is only right that such help is extended to them.</p>
              <p>There is no contradiction to the call for justice and equality for all irregardless of race, language or religion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Foreign Talents</strong> - are a different issue.</p>
              <p>While we recognised them for their contribution to our society, Singapore also extend an invitation for them to join our cosmopolitan nation - to be a Citizen and enjoy the same rights as Citizens.</p>

              <p>What do you think ?</p>
              <p>Has Singapore not reached "equality", "harmony" and "prosperity" ?</p>
              <p>"<strong>Harmony</strong>" between ethnic groups have certainly been achieved - but is this merely skin deep, or has this sunk deeper into easy acceptance of cross-ethnic relations of employers and employees in small private businesses ?</p>
              <p>After 44 years of independence, the PAP Government has allocated specific number of ethnic minority allowed in any block of flats according to the percentages of the various ethnic groups in Singapore. This has resulted in some disadvantage to the minority group ability to resell their homes to a smaller ethnic group, so as to maintain the approved ethnic mix in an HDB block.</p>
              <p>This was done out of concern that human nature will naturally move same ethnic group to congregate in the same area, resulting in Singapore becoming segregated into ethnic regions of a Malay area, Chinese area, Indian area, and European area.</p>
              <p>While this maybe true, one can see from historical records that this policy was made to the advantage of the PAP to dilute the minority ethnic groups into the majority, so as to allow themselves the opportunity to better "manage" politics.</p>
              <p>Is there "<strong>equality</strong>" - when the income divide is widening, and when skilled and unskilled foreign talents are competing with Singaporeans in all spheres of employment ?</p>
              <p>Can a modern metropolis be considered "<strong>Prosperity</strong>" - when the people continue to work as hard as our forefathers, who were able to retire at age 55 - when after 44 years of independence, we have to work even harder till 75 at least ?</p>
              <p>Despite all the glass and glitter of modern buildings, and MRTs and shiny buses and cars - the real worth of wages earned by Singaporeans today cannot even compare to the real monetary value of 1960s - let alone the1950s.</p>
              <p>The wages of a university graduate in the early 1960s would have bought him a semi-detached house in Serangoon Gardens, a car, and raise a family.</p>
              <p>Can the same be said of a university graduate today ?</p>

              <p>What do you mean by "<em>the inland homegrown malays of Singapore in the 1920s</em>" ?</p>
              <p>In Dr Mohammed Mahathir's book - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Malay_Dilemma">‘The Malay Dilemma’ (*1) </a>- that was banned by Tunku Abdul Rahman - Dr Mahathir had written that the Malays of Malaya were actually migrants from the Yunan Province in China.</p>
              <p>In a later Malaysian blog by a Dr Wan Hasni - he wrote in his piece: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://wanhasni.wordpress.com/2008/09/20/a-very-brief-history-of-the-malays-and-malaysia/">‘A very brief History of the Malays and Malaysia’ (*2) </a>- that corroborated Dr Mahathir's work.</p>
              <p>[Quote] </p>
              <p>The Malay race (consists into two groupings – Proto Malays and Malay Polynesians, or Melayu Darat and Melayu Laut), likely originates from the Yunnan province or surroundings.</p>
              <p>The early Malay (or Champa) civilizations are: Lin Yi (also called Fu Nan), located in what is South Vietnam and Cambodia today, the dates of the civilization is around 100AD until 1500AD during its peak, and finally ended with the last King of Champa who died in 1823.</p>
              <p>The remnant of this civilization is off course the Great Angkor Wat.</p>
              <p>The second great civilization of Malays is Sri Vijaya, located in Palembang (South Sumatera) – which I believe, the empire was established after waves of migration from the Champa continent by sea using the monsoon winds to South Sumatra.</p>
              <p>After the fall of Sri Vijaya, which was defeated by Majapahit of Java, Parameswara, the prince of Palembang migrated to Malacca, which in turns established the Sultanate and Empire of Malacca.</p>
              <p>From the Malacca Empire and Sultanates, then we saw the birth of many Sultanates and kingdoms in the Malay Peninsula (as most of the Malay Sultans are linked by marriage or by blood to the Malacca Sultanate).</p>
              <p>[Unquote]</p>
              <p>The first settlers were the Malays, who came around the Seventh Century and called their newfound fishing settlement "Temasek" or "Sea Town" - with Prince Sang Nila Utama sighting the Lion on Singapore shores recorded as being in the 13th Century.</p>
              <p>If the migratory path of the Malays are followed according to the above article, the Malays in Singapore were not natural to this island and are immigrants as much as the other ethnic groups that came later into Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The citizens of Singapore are recognised as people of migrant stock, can anyone claim to be a Son-of-the-Soil as the aboriginese in Australia, or the Ibans in Sarawak, or the tribal people living in the jungles of Papua New Guinea ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not sure where you intend to head with your last statement but if it is designed to scare anyone from taking the Pledge seriously, you had better examine the honesty of the Pledge in the simple words chosen.</p>
              <p>A Pledge is an Oath.</p>
              <p>An Oath when taken has to be fulfilled.</p>
              <p>Is there any threat to having an open, transparent, accountable Democratic Society that is built on Justice and Equality ?</p>
              <p>What are you afraid of ?</p>
              <p>Are you a member of the Ruling Party ?</p>
              <p>The only fear that the Ruling Party will have is for an open democratic society, and for justice to be given to every citizen - including members of the Alternative Political Parties - that all should be treated on equal terms as the PAP ability to enjoy the freely given support from the various Government Departments and Agencies, the Police, HDB, LTA, the Broadcast and Print Media.</p>
              <p>The Ruling Party believe in total monopoly in the control of all the above mentioned so as to allow them "to fix" everyone in the position that they think is best for the interest of their Party first, and Singaporeans second.</p>

              <div class="metadata"><strong>BY TAN KIAN HWEE</strong></div>
              <div class="metadata">Posted on 29 August 2009</div>
              </div>
              <p>During the Parliament sitting on 18 August 2009, new Nominated Member of Parliament Viswa Sadasivan delivered his maiden speech for the purpose of moving a motion to hold the government to reaffirm <em>“its commitment to the nation building tenets as enshrined in the National Pledge when debating national policies, especially economic policies”</em>.</p>
              <p>The speech and the aftermath scenes became a discussion topic within the confines of the political cyberspace arena for various reasons, foremost being the attraction of a counter response by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, who rarely spoke in Parliament, but paid enough attention to move an amendment to the motion.</p>
              <p>Much has been talked about and speculated this far about the roles of MM Lee, Workers’ Party MP Low Thia Khiang and other PAP MPs in the entire debate, even that of Mr Viswa himself, but one final “factor” has gone nearly unnoticed and yet to be examined – the PAP MP whom Mr Viswa had approached to second his original motion, with the latter’s consent.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The PAP MP is none other than Mr Michael Palmer, MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC</span>.</p>
              <p>Considering the fact that several parts of Mr Viswa’s speech, primarily in the areas of paragraph 36 and 39, called upon the PAP government not to inhibit the growth of opposition parties and to encourage equal space to be accorded to the opposition, it certainly must raise eyebrows that Mr Palmer consented to seconding the Bill.</p>
              <p>One may now wonder if Mr Palmer agreed with the following extracts of the speech.</p>
              <p>From <strong>paragraph 36</strong>, they are:</p>
              <p><em>“Accountability requires the government to go beyond lip-service in addressing the call for greater democracy, civil liberties and choices.” </em></p>
              <p>Does Mr Palmer agree that the government has being paying “lip-service” in terms of greater democracy, civil liberties and choices?</p>
              <p><em>“In the Political arena – a more level playing field especially in the management of elections and media coverage. What is increasingly demanded is fairness and justice, not just in form but substance.”</em></p>
              <p>Does Mr Palmer agree that the political arena is lopsided and is fair and just only in form?</p>
              <p><em>“But what is asked for is that the government desist from making it difficult in an unfair and undemocratic manner for the opposition to gain success – through last minute changes in electoral boundaries, or a lack of media coverage or what can sometimes be seen as biased coverage.”</em></p>
              <p>Does Mr Palmer agree that the playing field creates disadvantages for the opposition in an unfair and undemocratic in the aspects described?</p>
              <p>And from <strong>paragraph 39</strong>:</p>
              <p><em>“Examples would be the ground sentiment about the string of libel suits filed by PAP leaders against various opposition party leaders”</em></p>
              <p>Does Mr Palmer agree that defamation suits against opposition personalities created negative sentiments?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Should the PAP MP not concur with all of the above, why would he agree to second the motion?</span></p>
              <p>To clarify, this is not to say that Mr Palmer represents or should represent the official governance methodology of the PAP government or the position of the ruling party.</p>
              <p>Although he is a PAP MP, it is only fair to him to state this as he neither holds a cabinet post nor is a member of the PAP’s central executive committee.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Nevertheless, it is generally clear that the PAP has never been open to the idea of fair political space where the opposition is concerned but prefers to maintain the unbalanced status quo and if Mr Palmer agrees with Mr Viswa, he should bring forth these points relating to a more even electoral playing field to his party leaders behind closed doors</span>.</p>
              <p><strong>Otherwise, it surely wouldn’t be delightful for PAP candidates to emerge victorious under electoral rules they are aware are favourable to them</strong>.</p>

              <p><br>Thanks for clarifying your position, and you should be comforted with the knowledge that the Pledge written by S.Rajaratnam was carefully thought and crafted by him, and his entire effort was edited by LKY - with the final balanced piece is what has been recited by all Singaporeans for the last 44 years.</p>
              <p>The objective of the Pledge was for Singapore to achieve <em>'happiness, prosperity, and progress'</em> - that will spring forth from the preceding conditions that Singaporeans  <em>'regardless of race, language or religion'</em> - must strive to <em>'build a democratic society based on justice and equality'</em>.</p>
              <p>The Pledge was a balanced piece of work to achieve harmony amongst all the ethnic groups in Singapore, but recognising that one ethnic group amongst us are ethnically less competitive, and will need help - the Constitution was tweaked to guarantee help to this single ethnic group.</p>
              <p>This help was modified about ten or twenty years later, when the program succeeded in creating a substantial pool of successful high income earners from this ethnic group   </p>
              <p>Such changes to the original support plans were made only after discussion and agreement with the managing committee for this ethnic group, and it allowed for those who have succeeded to compete with others on equal terms, and not depend on the offical help available. This was to allow more concentrated help to be given to those who truly need such help.</p>
              <p>This is similar to a parent's concern to the weakest child amongst all the children, to assist the weakest child to compete with the stronger ones - as it will not be fair to the weakest child if neglected, neither will it be fair to the stronger ones when the weaker child continue to grow and be dependent on the stronger ones through adulthood.</p>
              <p>No one in the family will complain about the parent's extra attention given to the weakest child.</p>
              <p>No one in this community has ever complained about the extra help given to the weaker ethnic group as a whole, and as guaranteed in the Constitution.</p>
              <p>However, to use this as an excuse or to scare us from achieving the goals of the Pledge is rather a bald attempt to escape the responsibility from the solemn Pledge that we have been consistently made for the last 44 years.</p>
              <p>It was simple honesty on the part of NMP Viswa Sadasivan to have made his speech to remind the PAP Ministers, and the PAP Members of Parliament that it is time for the PAP Government to work according to the solemn Pledge that they have also taken every year as Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have been lulled to sleep without realisng that the PAP Government has been working in a totally different direction, while simply paying lip service to the goals of the Pledge that was recited by them every 9 August .</p>
              <p>All the hoopla of 9 August is forgotten the next day, and life continues as per normal.</p>
              <p>Can this continue for another 44 years ?</p>
              <p>Is there truly a Democratic Society in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Is there Justice that is equally afforded to everyone in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Is there Equality in treatment from the Government - to the Rich and to the Poor, to the Old and to the Young, to the Employers and the Employees, to Singaporeans and to the New Arrivals, to the Citizens and that given to those Foreign Talents, and to Singapore Citizen Workers and to the PAP Politicians ?</p>
              <p>Should we be surprised that after 44 years, we have come full circle to the hardship and uncertainties of the 1950s and 1960s - when despite all the glass and glitter, the shiny and modern transport systems - Singaporeans have to struggle twice as hard to make ends meet, when Singaporeans remain locked to foreign enterprise to open shops here and for us to slave for them with wages not in sync with the Cost of Living and determined by a NWC that is unknown to the general population ?</p>

              <p>If you are still in your 4-Dimension view in looking at my response, can you return to a 1-Dimension view and read carefully what was written in simple words ?</p>
              <p>Is the Pledge about the National Wage Council ?</p>
              <p>Are you sleep walking after being awake all night street walking ?</p>

              <p>"Freedom is the end of Government. To exalt men to self rule is the end of all order rules; and he who would fasten on them his arbitrary Will is their worst foe. "  (Channing)</p>
              <p>LKY have been in office too long and had not live as a street Singaporean.  The Pledge have been adopted by Singaporean and is a social agreement that establish social status quo of all citizens. This arbitary back toddle only reflect his aging Mind.  </p>
              <p>An observation: </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span> </span>What set “Singaporean” apart from the rest of Asia? </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Whenever "we" meet up as oversea Singaporean, other than Red Passport to signify our political identity, With oversea friends and business meeting   --- Frequently we introduce Singapore as an multi ethnic society, living and working together that is one key characteristics of being Singaporean. It set us apart from being Oversea Hong Kong Association or Oversea Chinese Association; it gives us a common Identity within a broader Asia demographics. <span> </span><span>  </span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Singapore govt send SAF /their families station overseas, they shared with their local overseas community with asian food, shared the different festival that we celebrated, speak singlish, and the local community learned the various ethnic groups in Singapore thru these interactions. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Still aspiration? I think the Singapore Man and Woman in uniforms are working towards the pledge. Why would Govt undermined their effort?</p>
              <p>My thought is</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">To marginalized the Pledge is to marginalized being Singaporean. <span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 12pt;       '>The Pledge has gone on for 40 years, numerous generation have moved forward, we set a standard for the region. </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">In fact the regional players should take que from The Singapore Pledge to help to resolve their own ethnic tension. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As the bible said...."Your old men dream dreams, your young men dream of a vision". But woe to him who distrusts the vision.</p>

              <p>With Taiwanese "hums" like you around, it is not surprising that you will forget all that you have pledged the moment the calendar date has moved.</p>
              <p>What does a Taiwanese "hum" like you know about the solemness in The Pledge ?</p>
              <p>Do we need to wonder the flippant attitude in Ah Bian when taking his Taiwanese Presidential Oath of Office ?</p>
              <p>If only he had taken his oath more seriously, he would not have gotten into his troubles today.</p>
              <p>The ignorance of a "hum" is only good for "singing cock and talking song".</p>
