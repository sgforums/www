              <p>Is the Singapore Pledge all about EQUALITY only, or something

              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://nmpviswasadasivanmaidenspeech.blogspot.com/2009/08/nmp-viswa-sadasivans-maiden-speech-in.html">maiden speech by NMP Viswa Sadasivan in the

              called for the Singapore Government to conduct its policies along
              the lines of The Pledge - which was crafted as:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>We, the Citizens of Singapore</em> - <em>pledge
              Ourselves as ONE UNITED PEOPLE - regardless of race, language, or
              religion -  to build a Democratic Society based on Justice and
              Equality, so as to achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for
              our nation.</em></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>You are right, the pledge is not about equality; it is about HARMONY.  Following this definition, my point was simply that absolute equality across all spectrums is a Utopian dream.  The same can be said of Justice.</p>
              <p>It doesn't mean we throw them out of the window, but rather, we hold on to these ideals as guiding principles. </p>
              <p>And honestly, I feel that our national pledge really means llittle since all the nouns used are abstract concepts that no one actually bothered to sit down and define.  "Happiness" can be 2 very different thing between you and me, and the way to achieve it requiring differing methods. Maybe the problem was really having too many of those terms...?</p>
              <p>Compare it against the American Pledge of Allegience..</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman'; line-height: normal;  "><strong>I pledge allegiance to the Flag<br>     of the United States of America,<br>and to the Republic for which it stands:<br>     one Nation under God, indivisible,<br>With Liberty and Justice for all.</strong></span></p>

              <div><br></div>
              <div>As you can see, it is actually a pledge of allegiance to the State and elected government and presidency.  The Singaporean pledge, simple put, requires us to live harmoniously with one another.</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think why what LKY said was so "controversial" was that most people either did not know or was afraid of the truth of equality.  That none are truly equal.  Governments can endow upon their citizens equal social, economic, civil and politica/legal rights, but at the end of the day, none are truly equal.  To attempt to enforce equality would be as good as being communists where you strip the bourgeoisie of their wealth and redistribute it to the poor/workers. </p>
              <p>Another matter which I would say in a rather frank manner is that the constitutional advantages given to the Malays are needed due to the sensitivity of our region.  We really do not want to appear as a "little red dot in a sea of green."  The lack of such an institution may legitimize "Malay-Chinese" polarization of our little corner in SEA. </p>
              <p>I guess what LKY was trying to say is that, and true our rather oddly Hobbesian characteristics, we ought to strive for sufficient equality to maintain a peaceful and harmonious society.  </p>

              <p>Justice is an utopian idea? Having a good legal system is as practical as it can be and also conducive for the country's development right? At least the country should strive for a fair and uncorrupted legal system right?  Yes, there is injustice around in the world - genocide, war, corruption, ur collick backstab and can still get away from it etc etc. Maybe in there sense, justice seems like an utopian idea. Nevertheless, theses are some of the qualities drive people to  envision and build a stable and harmony society upon it.</p>
              <p>Happiness is subjective -and well, at least the basic needs are fufilled.</p>
              <p>And true, chasing absolute equality is like chasing goose. At least we strive for a reasonable equality that promote and maintain harmony. </p>
              <p>Anyway i like the rest of your points.</p>

              <p>Justice is an utopian idea? Having a good legal
              system is as practical as it can be and
              also conducive for the country's development right? At
              least the country should strive for a fair and uncorrupted
              legal system right?  Yes, there is injustice around in the
              world - genocide, war, corruption, ur collick backstab
              and can still get away from it etc etc. Maybe
              in there sense, justice seems like an utopian
              idea. Nevertheless, theses are some of the qualities
              drive people to  envision and build a stable and
              harmony society upon it.</p>
              <p>Happiness is subjective -and well, at least the basic
              needs are fufilled.</p>
              <p>And true, chasing absolute equality is like chasing goose. At
              least we strive for a reasonable equality that promote and
              maintain harmony. </p>
              <p>Anyway i like the rest of your points.</p>

              <p>Well you see, Justice and Legal are not synonymous. Legal simply put, means in accordance to the laws.  Laws however, can be just or unjust depending where you are and what values you hold and the norms that the society follows.</p>
              <p>For example, the Internal Security Act here may be consider unjust and unconstitutional in the US.  Or where a single person being a director of multiple boards being unjust and in violation of anti-trust laws in the US, is however legal here and some European countries.</p>
              <p>Point is, if people knew what was Just or Unjust, nobody would have to codify laws and have them written so specifically.  Laws are there such that you just have to tell society, "just follow the law, and we will consider you just."  </p>

              <p>You are right, the pledge is not about equality; it is about HARMONY.  Following this definition, my point was simply that absolute equality across all spectrums is a Utopian dream.  The same can be said of Justice.</p>
              <p>It doesn't mean we throw them out of the window, but rather, we hold on to these ideals as guiding principles. </p>
              <p>And honestly, I feel that our national pledge really means llittle since all the nouns used are abstract concepts that no one actually bothered to sit down and define.  "Happiness" can be 2 very different thing between you and me, and the way to achieve it requiring differing methods. Maybe the problem was really having too many of those terms...?</p>
              <p>Compare it against the American Pledge of Allegience..</p>
              <p><span><strong>I pledge allegiance to the Flag<br>     of the United States of America,<br>and to the Republic for which it stands:<br>     one Nation under God, indivisible,<br>With Liberty and Justice for all.</strong></span></p>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>As you can see, it is actually a pledge of allegiance to the State and elected government and presidency.  The Singaporean pledge, simple put, requires us to live harmoniously with one another.</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think why what LKY said was so "controversial" was that most people either did not know or was afraid of the truth of equality.  That none are truly equal.  Governments can endow upon their citizens equal social, economic, civil and politica/legal rights, but at the end of the day, none are truly equal.  To attempt to enforce equality would be as good as being communists where you strip the bourgeoisie of their wealth and redistribute it to the poor/workers. </p>
              <p>Another matter which I would say in a rather frank manner is that the constitutional advantages given to the Malays are needed due to the sensitivity of our region.  We really do not want to appear as a "little red dot in a sea of green."  The lack of such an institution may legitimize "Malay-Chinese" polarization of our little corner in SEA. </p>
              <p>I guess what LKY was trying to say is that, and true our rather oddly Hobbesian characteristics, we ought to strive for sufficient equality to maintain a peaceful and harmonious society.  </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>'Hobbesian characteristics'</em> is a 16th Century concept of what the citizens' role is in society, should we use a 16th century model for the 21st Century ?</p>
              <p>Is striving "for <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sufficient equality</span></em> to maintain a peaceful and harmonious society" sufficient to fulfill The Singapore Pledge ?</p>
              <p>Can such half-measure attain the goals of happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation without the other call for justice and a democratic society ?</p>
              <p>You should be commended for a very clever approach in redefining The Singapore Pledge to mean 'HARMONY' - which is not incorrect if one is to consider the origins from which The Singapore Pledge was crafted by the late S Rajaratnam.</p>
              <p><em>We, the citizens of Singapore<br>pledge ourselves as one united people,<br>regardless of race, language or religion,<br>to build a democratic society,<br>based on justice and equality,<br>so as to achieve happiness, prosperity and<br>progress for our nation.</em></p>
              <p>Considering that Singapore's sudden and shocking independence was an afermath of a bruising racial battle that was fought and lost to the UMNO ULTRAS - who were determined to build a Malaysia with the prime interests of the Malays as the majority race in the country - S. Rajaratnam was inspired to craft <em>The Singapore Pledge</em> to be sworn to by its Citizens to build a Singapore that will be totally different and which will ensure <em>'happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation'</em>.</p>
              <p>To ensure that Singapore will not follow the ways of the UMNO ULTRAS, the citizens of Singapore had considered that even as we will build a Democratic society based on justice and equality - the special interests of the minority races will be protected.</p>
              <p>Was S Rajaratnam's objectives for "equality" based on the Communists ideology of a classless society with all being treated equally in all ways - irregardless of productive efforts and receiving all rewards in equal portions ?</p>
              <p>Or was the "equality" that he wanted for Singapore based on the democratic principle of <em>justice and equal opportunity</em> for all - irregardless of race, language or religion - that allow each and every citizen the opportunity towards happiness and prosperity; in total contrasts to the racist politics of the Malaysian UMNO ULTRAS that demand first and foremost the recognition to the privileges for their majority race in Malaysia ?</p>
              <p>One will then question - why were the Malays given extra privileges over the other minority communities such as the Indians including the Sikhs, the Eurasians, the Jews, the Arabs, and others ethnic groups within our multi-ethnic milleau ?</p>
              <p>Was it simply to appease the sea of green that this Little Red Dot happened to be accidentally sited by the good fortunes of nature, or was it done to appease our own conscience of justice and equality for all in a democratic society to be built ?</p>
              <p>Was it not done due to the recognition that the Malays as a minority group were less capable to compete in a society that is to be built on equal basis for all ? </p>
              <p>Is it unequal for the other ethnic groups in Singapore that in order for the minority Malays not to be left behind in the march to progress, that the Constitution was specially redefined to include a Clause that will protect the special interests given to the Singapore Malays ?</p>
              <p>* On a sidenote - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/372615?page=4">It is recommended that you look into the response from 4sg dated 21 Aug ’09 7.31PM on Page 4 of this thread (*1) </a></p>
              <p>Even within a Family, where the Parents will give more attention to a weaker child to survive, does it mean inequality to the remaining children ? Without the weaker child being helped in its early stage, will it be able to pull its own throughout its life ?</p>
              <p>Will there be justice and equality for the weaker child to be expected to compete on equal terms to its stronger siblings, or would it not require 'handicap points' - as in the game of golf - to help it to compete with the other more capable siblings ? </p>
              <p>Will it not be more unequal for the other siblings to have to look after the weaker child that will be a continuous burden to the Family, when it remains unable to look after itself throughout its adulthood ?</p>
              <p>Equality when viewed as a perfect mathematical equation that demand one thing to be absolutely equal to another may require a redefinition to fit into a philosophically practical end to the politics that divide the total sum.</p>
              <p>Is it utopia to achieve such a Democratic society that is to be build on Justice and Equality ?</p>
              <p>Utopia is a state of mind that requires constant movement towards its achievement.</p>
              <p>However, it contrasts with the present reality crying for democracy which concerns the present and now, justice is also a demanding cry from the present, as much as equality is for the present in order to move into the future.</p>
              <p>Utopia is a state of mind that can only be satisfied when The Pledge is fulfilled in sufficient volumes that satisfy the "utopia in the mind".</p>
              <p>Is the Singapore Pledge so abstract that the nouns are different for you and I ?</p>
              <p>While the quality and the motivation towards "Happiness" maybe different for you and I - was S Rajaratnam splitting hair in the manner that you prefer to redefine this noun ?</p>
              <p>Or was his goals for The Pledge not based on the fact that the sum total efforts of all Singaporeans will move Singapore forward, so as to create an environment that will allow each one of us to enjoy the circumstances allowing our individual quality and motivation for happiness to be achieved ?</p>
              <p>For all intent and purpose - The Singapore Pledge has a different goal from The American Pledge of Allegiance, and it has to be different.</p>
              <p><strong>It must be so, considering the origins of OUR History</strong>.</p>
              <p>If you want to compare to The American Pledge of Allegiance towards the State and elected government and presidency - have you forgotten The SAF Pledge ? </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">We, members of the Singapore Armed Forces, </span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">do solemnly and sincerely pledge </span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">that we will always bear true faith and allegiance </span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">to the President and the Republic of Singapore. </span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">We will always support and defend the Constitution. </span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">We will preserve and protect the honour </span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">and independence of our country with our lives.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><em></em> </p>
              <p>If you are looking for specifics that makes a pledge more certain, you will surely find it in the SAF Pledge - but does it fulfill the goals that S Rajaratnam had in his mind for Singaporeans to have, and to build the Singapore that is unique.....considering the circumstances of Singapore's birth ?</p>
              <p>It may interest you to note that on SAF Day, the recitation of the SAF Pledge is also accompanied by The Singapore Pledge.</p>
              <p>If The Singapore Pledge is redefined to be 'aspirations' and not a solemn oath to be fulfilled - it is sheer nonsensical and hypocritical for the entire nation led by the Ministers in White reciting this Pledge so solemnly on 9 August for the last 44 years.</p>
              <p>Is NMP Viswa Sadasivan wrong in his call for the PAP Government to conduct its policies according to The Singapore Pledge ? </p>
              <p>Was his speech narrowed to a call for equal treatment only ?</p>

              <p><br>The Pledge is used as a tool to give the Singapore Population a hoopla pride that is soon to be forgotten immediately after the solemn recitation is over.</p>
              <p>Once the back is turned from the Flag - the Pledge taken before it is wiped out of the memory, and everyone return to the status quo of non-democratic politics, injustices continues in all spheres, and unequal treatment for the rulers and the ruled.</p>
              <p>No wonder MM claimed that The Pledge is only an "aspiration" to be desired and not to have - as it will create the nightmarish visits by his bogey-men that continue to haunt him despite his 44 years of incarcerating Singapore citizens, whom he had accused but never charged.</p>
              <p>To have The Pledge fulfilled in its three key elements of having a true "Democratic Society based on Justice and Equality" - for both the PAP Elites, the Alternative Political Party Members, and the Citizens - will only mean more work "<em>to fix</em>" by the PM, MM, SM, and the PAP.</p>

              <p>A pledge made has to be fulfilled, certainly. (Especially that of a loan.)</p>
              <p>The onus is on the pledger to fulfill whatever is pledged.</p>
              <p>In this context, it is a nation that pledges itself.</p>
              <p>So it is for the nation to fulfill it.</p>
              <p>In Singapore we have Lee Kuan Yew, Chiam See Tong, Low Thia Khiang, Chee Soon Juan, and the late JB Jeyaratnam and a few others who have stepped up to fulfill it with their own manifesto, which have similar ideals though it would be worded differently.  </p>
