              <p>The following is a Channel News Asia report of today's Parliamentary Proceedings.</p>
              <p>The speech by NMP Mr Viswa Sadasivan that was reported in this Wednesday's Straits Times had brought LKY to speak out in Parliament.</p>
              <p>Mr Viswa had proposed for Government policies to follow the principles of the Singapore Pledge, which was crafted by one of Singapore's founding father - the late Mr S. Rajaratnam.</p>
              <p>Now it seems that LKY is claiming that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_84_2004-12-13.html">The Singapore Pledge  </a>is not a principle but an "<strong>aspiration</strong>".</p>
              <p>According to LKY speech in Parliament - it is dangerous for Government Policies to follow the principles of <strong>the Singapore Pledge</strong> that state<strong> the building of a Democratic Society based on justice and equality</strong>.</p>
              <p>Now it seems that it is dangerous to believe in equality.</p>
              <p>Is it dangerous to have justice and democracy too ? </p>

              <p><strong>Govt accountable in actions, has worked towards non-discrimination</strong></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/449858/1/.html">by May Wong, Channel News Asoa, 19 August 2009 22.17hrs. </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew says the government has been accountable in its actions and has worked towards ensuring that no race is discriminated against in Singapore. He adds that what the country has achieved so far is evidence of that. </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><br>Speaking in Parliament on Wednesday - which he seldom does - Mr Lee explained that he did not intend to intervene in the parliamentary debate initially. <br><br>But having read what a Nominated Member of Parliament said in Parliament on Tuesday, he decided to speak up. <br><br>He said: "I think it was dangerous to allow such highfalutin ideas to go un-demolished and mislead Singapore." <br><br>Mr Lee took issue with the points the Nominated MP made, without naming the member. <br><br>The Nominated MP was Mr Viswa Sadasivan, who had called on Parliament to ensure that national policies be founded on the principles of the National Pledge such as racial and religious unity. <br><br>Mr Viswa had made several suggestions like re-examining the current emphasis on racial categorisation and encouraging political associations to better reflect the tenets of the Pledge. <br><br>In fact, Mr Lee highlighted Singapore's Constitution which provides for the minorities like the Malays. <br><br>Minister Mentor Lee said: "We expressly stated in our Constitution, a duty on behalf of the government, not to treat everyone as equal. It's not reality, it's not practical. It will lead to grave and irreparable damage if we work on that principle. So, this was an aspiration. <br><br>"As Malays progressed and a number joined middle class with university degrees and professional qualifications, we have asked Mendaki not to have special rights of free education in universities but take what they were entitled to. Put those fees to help more disadvantaged Malays." <br><br>Mr Lee also pointed out that policies introduced have in fact taken into account the needs of the people. <br><br>He said: "Our Constitution spells out the duties of the government to treat minorities and Malays with extra care. So the basis on which the Nominated Member has placed his arguments is false and flawed. It's completely untrue. It has got no basis whatsoever. <br><br>"And I thought to myself, 'perhaps I should bring this House back to earth', and tell us and remind all what's our starting point, what is our base and if we don't recognise where we started from and these are our foundations, we'll fail. <br><br>"We're here today, we have this building, we have all these facilities, and all around us is evidence of our accountability. Without being accountable, we would not have been re-elected and there would have been no Singapore of today." <br><br>- CNA/ir</p>

              <p><br>From the present clarification given by LKY - can anyone blame Singaporeans like you from being feeling apathy towards anything political ?</p>
              <p>It becomes clearer that the PAP work at two levels - the continuous big psychological hoopla to motivate the Singaporean blob in any directions that they decide, and a second level that immunise the Elites from the hoopla themselves.</p>
              <p>It is fine for Singaporeans to believe seriously in the Pledge and aspire towards it.</p>
              <p>It is another to expect the Government to fulfill the Pledge for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>According to the Channel News Asia video news commentator, she added that it will probably take another 50 to 100 years before it is safe for Singapore to see the Pledge coming into fruition.</p>
              <p>For the moment, we can stop dreaming about Democracy, Justice and Equality - all of which are too dangerous for Singaporeans to have.</p>
              <p>Justice is not dangerous for the PAP Elites to have to protect their "reputation" that they build for themselves, but dangerous for Singaporeans to clamor.</p>
              <p>Equality too is dangerous for Singaporeans to have now as it will upset the status quo.</p>
              <p>Democracy will be all hopeless in the mind of LKY - as it will open the PAP pandora's box that will expose all the skeletons that have accumulated since 1957 - when he stepped into political office.</p>

              <p><br>Simply said - the NMP want the Government Policies to follow the Singapore Pledge.</p>
              <p>Do you know what is said in the Singapore Pledge ?</p>
              <p>LKY say that the idea about EQUALITY in the Pledge is dangerous and reminded Members of Parliament about where "we came from" and how all that has been achieved today had come about.</p>
              <p>If the idea of EQUALITY is dangerous to be considered for implementation in all the government policies - we should expect LKY to view that it is similarly dangerous for any government policies to be based on justice and democracy for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should take a second look if what was written by S Rajaratnam was a simple aspiration to be said as a sacred pledge, and not to be implemented.</p>
              <p>If sacredness in the Singapore Pledge is not to be taken seriously, is anything from the PAP worth any serious consideration ?</p>

              <p>But the Utopian dream still lives on and see fruitation one day, as we make our oath to our society each day and attempt to live it, flawed humans that we are.</p>

              <p>Did you deliberately miss out mentioning "JUSTICE" in your reply - which mentioned much about "democracy and equality" requiring RESPONSIBILITIES from all the Singaporean Citizens ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are Singaporeans not entitled to "JUSTICE" - or are there similar conditions before justice can be dispensed to Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are there no justice available to the politicians from the Alternative Political Parties - who have made so much personal sacrifices for Singapore and Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Is there no justice for Lim Chin Siong and his generation detained without trial - especially Chia Thye Poh who was detained for 32 years and released without even his signature on a piece of paper to admit to all the false charges ?</p>
              <p>What about justice for JBJ, CSJ and all those accused by LKY and the ISD to be Communists in the Catholics Church in Siglap ?</p>
              <p>What about justice for Ryan Goh - the leading member who had represented the interests of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/labour.html">Singapore Airline Pilot Association “Alpha-S”  </a>- and was forced to leave Singapore with his family ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is a fallacy to believe that democracy and equality will exist only when citizens have some or complete understanding of the responsibilities involved.</p>
              <p>Can the principles of democracy and equality be traded according to someone's determination or judgment of the achieved levels of responsibilities ?</p>
              <p>Democracy and equality are sacred to any society - and more so in a multi-racial society like Singapore - as was intended in S Rajaratnam's perception in the pledge that came about from the aftermath of the racial riots in 1963.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A community of citizens gives of themselves to protect each other in the Community, and the citizens will expect their Community to protect the Rights of these citizens with democratic values, justice and equality.</p>
              <p>The responsibility works both ways and applicable to every single individual.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the understanding of LKY - who hide behind the spectre of the riots in the 1950s and 1960s which were consistently created by those in authority - he had reasoned that the Singapore Pledge is only an aspiration.</p>
              <p>If at all, the fact is that any government policies that adopt the declared principles of Democracy, Justice and Equality - will only challenge and weaken LKY's carefully crafted position for the PAP to continue dominating Singapore.</p>
              <p>In LKY's views - it seems that it is right for the Community to expect the Individual to make sacrifices for the Community, but it is wrong for the Individual to expect the Community to give any democratic values, justice and equality as the automatic right of the Individual.</p>
              <p>It is the Right of the Community to seek the services of the Individual, but not the Individual's Right to seek services or protection from the Community.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This skewed and parsimonious value in the dispensation of the Individual's Rights can only be designed to hold to ransom all the indivdiduals in a community.</p>
              <p>Now the reason is clear for the reasons in the PAP taking actions in bastardising the Singapore Constitution - by changing the clearly expressed basic principles of the minimum Citizen's Rights.</p>

              <p>The Pledge (let me see if I can still remember, old man liao)</p>
              <p>We the citizens of Singapore, pledge ourselves as one united people. Regardless of race, language or religion. To build a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">democratic</span></strong> society. Based on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">justice</span></strong> and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">equality</span></strong>, so as to achieve, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">happiness</span></strong>, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">prosperity</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">progress</span></strong> for our nation</p>
              <p>So which parts of our pledge have we achieved?</p>
              <p>Equality has been mentioned to be out-of-bounds</p>
              <p>I haven't gotten to vote for my President, therefore I don't have a president, I haven't voted for many elections...</p>
              <p>There is a stronger and stronger disconnect between them and the rest of us.</p>
              <p>Did we progress for our nation? Is economic progression the only indicator of our progression?</p>
              <p>Are we prospering? Or again, is this just from a $$$ point of view?</p>

              <p>JUSTICE is a no-brainer in any civilise society. It is for all - rich or poor- where justice is blind. In cases where the poor have no money to fight a case, in Singapore, the courts still give him access to society paid legal counsel.</p>
              <p>Having said that, I must admit that I do not have much faith on humanity's, let alone Singapore's mortal justice. It follows in the neutral tradition of King Solomon, whereby none gets what they really want. A baby to be split in 2 to be awarded to the disputing parties. Even if the child truly belongs to me, i would rather my baby gets to live and be awarded to another party.</p>
              <p>It may be an extreme example, but only a realistic example of how none gets what they really want under human law, having lived long enough to realise this fact. There may be gains, but what had you actually lost when the total overall costs(not just money) are counted?</p>
              <p>I will follow the rule of law and its legal engagements with others in my society, but where disputes begin, I would rather to resolve it out of court where criminality does not exist, and find a settlement, where possible. The courts will always be a last resort.</p>
              <p>This is pragmatism, and a down to Earth approach, when we as a society has not yet reach Utopian status.</p>
              <p>But there is still one justice that many put more faith in, and that is divine justice. None escapes it, no matter what religion or philosophy one belongs to. No one.</p>
