              <p>You can save your efforts, as there is no Singapore Legislation requiring the minimum number in population turnout to make an election valid in Singapore - (but I stand to be corrected by your diligent efforts).</p>
              <p>After bastardising the Singapore Constitution with new amendment legislations that have been rubber stamped through a PAP dominated Parliament since 1957, do you seriously think that the legal mind of LKY would not have seen to this small detail that will sabotage his scheme in total domination of local politics ?</p>
              <p>The manner in which the one and only Referendum ever conducted in Singapore - to get Singaporeans to agree to his Merger Plans with Malaysia - is already evident of his style. (Incidentally, the Referendum was a requirement from the UN as part of the legal process to recognise the merging of independent states).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the recent Afghan Elections, the UN and NATO were striving for a turnout of at least 50 per cent of Afghan population to make the election results credible.</p>
              <p>Similar elections under the auspices of the UN in East Timor also required this minimum level of participation from the population.</p>
              <p>Even in the elections conducted by EU for their periodical leadership change, and referendums to some of the policies that require approval by the citizens of the member states, both these processes require that at least 50 percent of the citizens of the member states should be involved in the process - otherwise the election results and proposed policy measure will be void.</p>
              <p>This is the minimum standard of an Election Process.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Yes you are right, there is no quorum requirement for the Singapore General Election, nor for the UK Parliamentary Elections.</p>
              <p>The closest reference to a quorum is the <a href="http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/274334,italian-electoral-law-referendum-fails-to-reach-quorum--summary.html">Italian law referendum</a> that was declared invalid due to poor turnout. But this a referendum, not an election.</p>
              <p>As our GE is for parliamentary representation, the <a href="http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2027_95.htm">Belarus situation</a> would be more apt, where the parliamentary elections fail to fill enough seats for a quorum.</p>
              <p>If the Parliamentary Elections Act were to state that all constituencies must be constested, (i.e. no walk over for unconstested nominations) we would certainly have the Belarus situation.</p>
              <p>And the powers that be must rule by decree, which would be worse.</p>

              <p>Think about it this way... can there possibly be absolute equality?  Can it really be achieved?  Equality in one aspect may mean inequality in another.  Chasing after absolute equality may be a wild goose chase after all.  Equality may have been a bad choice of word after all, for I'd think "equilibrium" might suit better.</p>

              <p>Is the Singapore Pledge all about EQUALITY only, or something larger then just the word concerning 'equality' ?</p>
              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://nmpviswasadasivanmaidenspeech.blogspot.com/2009/08/nmp-viswa-sadasivans-maiden-speech-in.html">maiden speech by NMP Viswa Sadasivan in the Singapore Parliament on 18 August 2009 (*1)  </a>had called for the Singapore Government to conduct its policies along the lines of The Pledge - which was crafted as:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>We, the Citizens of Singapore</em> - <em>pledge Ourselves as ONE UNITED PEOPLE - regardless of race, language, or religion -  to build a Democratic Society based on Justice and Equality, so as to achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Citizens of Singapore would have included all the Cabinet Ministers and Government Officers, who have all pledged - for the last 44 years -  to build a Democratic Society based on Justice and Equality.</p>
              <p>NMP Viswa Sadasivan had simply and boldly requested that the PAP Government fulfill the Pledge that they have solemnly made for the last 44 years - and conduct government policies with the Pledge as "a guiding principle". </p>
              <p>It was MM LKY's ingenious efforts to distract the public attention from NMP Viswa's brave speech - by indulging in his favorite fear mongering speeches by returning to the racial politics of the past.</p>
              <p>It is in MM LKY's true form to cleverly redirect attention to himself with a return to his favorite old bogey-man illustrations in his own preferred interpretation of the  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_83_2005-02-02.html">Mariah Hertogh incident(*2) </a> and his version of the nightmares in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_race_riots_in_Singapore">1964 Racial Riots in Singapore (*3) </a> (that was partly a result from his own wilfull conduct during the period when Singapore was part of Malaysia).</p>
              <p>Was it all about Equality only in the speech by NMP Viswa Sadasivan that MM LKY claimed had questioned the status quo, when the amended Singapore Constitution had protected Malay Special Rights ? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hopefully, your response is all about MM LKY's silly little speech that was designed to protect the interests of the PAP by killing NMP Visva Sadasivan's attempt to have the Singapore Government fulfill The Singapore Pledge.</p>

              <p>An Oath/Promise is NEVER an aspiration. The implications are really different.</p>
              <p>We are committed to our pledge via an oath or promise. Of coz, we may break our promise or oath, but that will be a dent to our morals and ethics.</p>
              <p>But we are not obligated to fulfill our aspiration, and there is no implication to the failure of fulfillment.</p>
              <p>In the terms and conditions of a legal contract, a promise not fulfilled would have resulted in consequences (In the event we cannot deliver upon our product, we will refund you...). An aspiration, on the other hand, would not result in consequences. (We endeavor (aspire) to provide you the best service...)</p>

              <p>Anyway, fuck the "aspring to be" pledge. The PAP Government do
              not follow it anyhow, From the Malays in NS issue all the way to
              the Foreign Talent issue. Never gave a straight answer, but keep
              dodging everytime the issue is raised. PAP Govt version of
              equality: If you vote for us, your GRC get upgraded, if not carry
              on leaving in the same 80's looking flats. The comparison with the
              Americans with their stand on African Americans and us? So are we
              going to wait 100 odd years the we are ready to appoint a minority
              PM? Or are we going to keep the PM ship in his family only?</p>
              <p>Hell, even the judicial process is biased towards the PAP/Ruling
              Class.You got money, you are above the law, like Mr C.K ( I need a
              Kidney)  Tang. If not you fuck off to prison. The rest of us
              are relegated to hold on to this "belief" while they laugh and earn
              big bucks on our sweat and blood.</p>
              <p>I think a French Revolution ala Singapore style is soon on the
              horizon. I will be in the first row hacking off heads with an axe.
              I hope Mr Harry will still be alive while his "empire" will get
              dismantled....Crawl back to the fiery depths of hell with all the
              tongue twisting lawyer friends of yours, old piece of shit.</p>

              <p>It doesn't really matter what they do. I still have a heart for Singapore, which is ultimately still my home. Which particularly irks me when someone up there behaves as if this island is his and his alone, and makes a mockery of the oath that we made to each other.</p>
              <p>Call it my principles, or that I am inflexible. But the pledge is an oath, which I have carried out subconsciously as best as I am able to, throughout my life. I treated people with equality, to be friends with Malays, Indians, Eurasians, Westerners, Easterners, etc. Never mind the occasional squabbles, but the pledge has taught me to be open and tolerant, to be an international citizen.</p>
              <p>The pledge has brought me to where I am today, to the States, in an international position. Because I adhered to the oath of "Regardless of race, language, or religion", I am seen to be a perfect candidate for international working environments.</p>
              <p>End of the day, we have heard of the stories of the supremacists in other countries, do we want our country to be like that? Where we cannot live in peace and harmony?</p>
              <p>And the pledge is the foundation to all of that. Just as in an organization, if it has no vision or values (which is the foundation), its just a headless duck attempting to survive in this difficult world.</p>
              <p>Demeaning the pledge, is demeaning ourselves. I am a Singaporean, I am proud of it. But I am not proud of our govt, and this fiasco has caused my impression of LKY to fall even further.</p>

              <p>Put it this way, if they were screwed up right from the start, would they be where they are now?</p>
              <p>Hence, do not ask of where this pledge came from, but whether this pledge is one that identifies us all. Its the same as during marriage, when you made the pledge to be with each other till the day you die. People break the oaths more regularly these days. But its an oath that is worth saying to the one you love. Similarly, our pledge is one that is worth saying to people that matters to you (the friends around you that matters to you)</p>

              <p><br>Not said i heckcare, my principle still remain the same, and i had not lost any bearings, of course talking about the 2 bearings on you guy, i dun have it..but unlike immature and childish old peoples, i understand that there is no point argueing over a pledge that has multiple meaning in it, more so, with each one having his/her own intrepretation. Further argueing make no sense. Everyone you met in the street gives a different view on it..and i did do a small empirical survey on my customers, i asked about 30 of them, most in their middle age...10% said LKY is right, 5% have other opinons, another 15% said I am mad to go on drinking. So, in the end, my hypothesis is that, we are arguing on an empty vessel.</p>

              <p>dear angel7030</p>
              <p>it's interesting you SUDDENLY become "Heck care the pledge".</p>
              <p>It's pretty interesting to see how your logic degenerates once you no longer believe in what you say. It's also interesting to see how you FORGOT what you posted. It shows a person without clear understanding of herself (what she thinks, how she thinks, why she thinks it this way, etc). Perhaps you should understand more of yourself before you come back.</p>
              <p>Yeah we are all old old, still behave like children, argue over pledge, blah blah, yeah, maybe its true. But you are the ROLE model for all of us.Attempting to come in to argue, and then losing all bearings.</p>
              <p>At least I respect fellow human beings coming to Singapore to make a living (I am only against the way the Govt executes the FT policy, and NOT against the individual). Unlike you, treating the staff in your pub (if it ever exists) as if they are just money-making machines.</p>
              <p>And in case you think these are baseless accusations, I think you should go back to your old postings and see what you posted about your staff. Or perhaps, you have FORGOTTEN you even posted?</p>
