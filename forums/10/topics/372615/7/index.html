              <p>You can save your efforts, as there is no Singapore Legislation requiring the minimum number in population turnout to make an election valid in Singapore - (but I stand to be corrected by your diligent efforts).</p>
              <p>After bastardising the Singapore Constitution with new amendment legislations that have been rubber stamped through a PAP dominated Parliament since 1957, do you seriously think that the legal mind of LKY would not have seen to this small detail that will sabotage his scheme in total domination of local politics ?</p>
              <p>The manner in which the one and only Referendum ever conducted in Singapore - to get Singaporeans to agree to his Merger Plans with Malaysia - is already evident of his style. (Incidentally, the Referendum was a requirement from the UN as part of the legal process to recognise the merging of independent states).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the recent Afghan Elections, the UN and NATO were striving for a turnout of at least 50 per cent of Afghan population to make the election results credible.</p>
              <p>Similar elections under the auspices of the UN in East Timor also required this minimum level of participation from the population.</p>
              <p>Even in the elections conducted by EU for their periodical leadership change, and referendums to some of the policies that require approval by the citizens of the member states, both these processes require that at least 50 percent of the citizens of the member states should be involved in the process - otherwise the election results and proposed policy measure will be void.</p>
              <p>This is the minimum standard of an Election Process.</p>

              <p>Only you alone is answerable to your oath that each and everyone

              <p>Oaths?? OMG! u think the whole singapore is a law court ar?? Aspiration is not fully wrong, it is a part of the pledge meaning, it can also be inspiration and motto or simply a sense of belonging. A kind of notion that said we are all for one and one for all. The pledge also in a way gives us an identity of a place we call home, a morale motivator and a reminder that we are a multi racial society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is never a Oath or a laws that you need to follow if not you get punished. Speak the word, if you want to pledge it out loud, keep it in your mind if you want to remain silent. Nobody is going to said anything.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course there are many opinons, individual thinking and feeling for this pledge, if you think that as tho these pledge is a oaths to be true nothing but the true, so be it, but then you got to respect other seeing it as an inspiration or aspiration. Not wrong either..just like if you like, display sing flag, if you dun like, nobody is going said that you must display it. It a kind of respect within one view towards his/her nation. So, take it easy, pledge or no pledge at 8.22 is not going to make much differences ya.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>An oath, a pledge, or how you wish to term is made on your own free will and to honour and uphold it is yourself. Look at the splinter in your own eye before you condemn others. Thus my question to you was - will you uphold your oath? which you had yet to reply directly as a man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i will not hold it against you, for you answer to yourself on an oath. Others will judge you only by the value of your words, or the lack of it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It seems you have yet to comprehend 'debate' and what it is about. This is your mistake, but again, I hold it not against you, for none of us are perfect anyway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A good debater or bad debater knows that it is others whom judge, and never judge or pride themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are only making more and more mistakes,of the judgemental kind with each post. Do you need help? I am no model of perfection, capable of helping you, but I can send you directions to go to for such help.</p>

              <p>Good morning, so the transvertite had to walk away from its X-rated-yearnings after finding the solace to suck to sleep and now return filled with energy to write with more exaggerated hollow fluff that plagiarise the style of someone's honesty.</p>

              <p>Amazing style of debate that refutes honest truths but prefer to promote falsehood, and flourish on the excrements of lies.</p>
              <p>Is it not typical of a transvertite unable to handle the truth of being stuck between the rock and a hard surface, and enjoying the moment while it is able to ? </p>

              <p>Yes, how eloquently laced with all the fluff, when the idiocy of a transvertite cannot makeout the difference between the gravity of an Oath to Principles based on "an aspiration" or on "an ideal" .</p>
              <p>Should we be surprised that the transvertite cannot reply or avoid to reply directly as a man to this important difference ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>How ironical that the transvertite will want others to judge all the fluff even as the words proclaimed that <em>"you have to answer to yourself on an oath"</em> ?</p>
              <p>The controversies of the transvertite stems from the confuse origins of its DNA and will continue as long as this is not resolved, and will flow to affect all things and everyone with its half-truths mixed with false accusations.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>How can a transvertite ever hope to be perfect when it refuse to comprehend honesty and truth - whether in its own gender, or least of all in "debate" ?</p>
              <p>The chubby and amateurish Pakistani hijacking SQ117 who have been wrongfully compared to the vicious terrorists from the North West region, and the maligned Gurkhas and as well as the reputation of the SAF Special Force Unit - still remain without an apology from the transvertite who claim boastful knowledge of all their origins and activities in all the flowery fluffy prose.</p>

              <p>You certainly took pride in your falsehood, and the plagiarising attempts of someone's honest writing skills with your debasing attitude towards others.</p>
              <p>Can you continue to hide behind all the flowery fluff and perpetuate your dishonesty ?</p>
              <p>Others may not be able to judge you in the manner that you wish, do you lash back like a true transvertite at the honest truth spoken about the reality of you ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, it is always the mistake of others when the judgement that you seek becomes inconvenient to your false pride, and when it pinches on the truth till it hurts and demand that you demean the process of debate by calling others names from your mind fertilize with manure.</p>
              <p>It is indeed the honesty spoken when the transvertite cannot cope with the tyranny of truth and honesty.</p>
              <p>We can empathise with your tortured position in your display with wreckless retorts.</p>
              <p>You certainly need help for yourself before attempting to offer help to others.</p>
              <p>Can a transvertite be a perfect model for anyone except to another feminine kind ?</p>

              <p>Oaths?? OMG! u think the whole singapore is a law court ar??
              Aspiration is not fully wrong, it is a part of the pledge
              meaning, it can also be inspiration and motto or simply a
              sense of belonging. A kind of notion that said we are all for one
              and one for all. The pledge also in a way gives us an identity
              of a place we call home, a morale motivator and a reminder
              that we are a multi racial society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is never a Oath or a laws that you need to follow if not you
              get punished. Speak the word, if you want to pledge it out loud,
              keep it in your mind if you want to remain silent. Nobody is going
              to said anything.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course there are many opinons, individual thinking and
              feeling for this pledge, if you think that as tho these pledge is a
              oaths to be true nothing but the true, so be it, but then you got
              to respect other seeing it as an inspiration or aspiration. Not
              wrong either..just like if you like, display sing flag, if you dun
              like, nobody is going said that you must display it. It a kind of
              respect within one view towards his/her nation. So, take it easy,
              pledge or no pledge at 8.22 is not going to make much differences
              ya.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Aspiration is an emotion drawn from the pledge, a desire to fulfil the pledge and if someone pledge to do something, it kind of like he makes his objective and promise to fulfil it within his means and plans, but that does not mean he will succeed or have to really fulfil it. Of course if you ask me, aspiration or inspiration are words different from the word "pledge",  for eg, I pledge a toast, may all be healthy..yam seng!! the aspiration is that hope that all be healthy, but does not really mean that all will be healthy, same as we pledge (as a verb) to be equal, racial harmony and properity, a desire to achieve and fulfil all these above as far as possible, as you should no, no country will ever fulfil it, but if you can get close to it, it is a bonus for all of us to enjoy and live happily. Just like low crimes doesn't mean no crime ya..understand Uncle</p>

              <p>In my view, a mature debater, regardless of his stand, acknowledges the valid points made by the other party. To delude oneself that the other party is 100% wrong demonstrates how immature oneself is. These are people (BOTH pro-PAP and opposition) that should not be debating in parliament.</p>

              <p>Now you bring another new item in when you cannot even understand the above yet. Aspiration is an Emotion??? Hello??? Since when is aspiration an emotion? It's a goal or achievement that you want to achieve. The success or failure coming from the aspiration probably gives you emotions.</p>

              <p>it both inspire and aspire you to achieve your desire. The feeling (emotion) of wanting to fulfil. As i said, Aspiration is just a word by itself use as one of the apparatus to inspire a pledge, a pledge contain many other factors, we are not saying aspiration is equal to pledge. As LKY put it, the pledge is an aspiration, does not mean that a pledge is equal to aspiration. It all depend on how you aspire it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, people of different thoughts have different view. More so if people are influenced by the thought of being oppressed by LKY.</p>

              <p>Yeah, you are right, if you twist and turn, it can also be death = life.</p>
              <p>So yes, you are right. LKY is right, and we should stop this useless debate. For what is the point if people can equate wrong terms together and still insist they are correct? :)</p>
