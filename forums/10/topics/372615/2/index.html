              <p>Seems like our older generation are getting fed up with the pledge, but we the younger ones still pledge mah. This just a pledge to remind us of our mission, our inspiration and our attention.</p>

              <p>You dun think there is perfect equality, perfect harmony and perfect peace,..there can never be, maybe only in heaven if there is one. Therefore, the pledge is just reminding us to that we are singaporeans and that we are subject/fragile to equality, racial and harmony if we make a wrong move.</p>

              <p>This is too exaggerating.</p>
              <p>It is just a pledge.</p>
              <p>" We, the citizen of Singapore, pledge of ourself as one united people, <strong>regardless of</strong> <strong>race, language or religion , </strong>to build a democratic society, based on justice and equality, so as to achieve happiness, prosperity and progess of our nation"</p>
              <p>Hence, <em><strong>if</strong></em> it does not achieve happiness, prosperity and progess for our nation, this pledge do not need to be honored. That's all. This pledge is uniquely for Singapore in where different race, language or religion have to be united as one. </p>
              <p>Yup. It is just waste of a time and resources to debate on the pledge or live by it without understanding the real gem of the pledge.</p>

              NMPs were introduced to give different views in Parliament.  Thats what the new NMP, Mr Viswa did and he got shot down by MM.  Give the new man a break. 
              Whats the point of having NMPs if he can't give different views in Parliament?  Is it just lip-service?  If it is,  then NMPs would be considered a "wayang" in parliament.

              <p>The plege use to be aspiration, but I think for many of us the pledge is more than just an aspiration. Leaving
                                      aside whether or Singaporeans adhere to it or not. The pledge has always been a
                                      reminded to both old and the young on how one should act as Singaporeans. For Singapore
                                      to survive we Singaporeans need to act with justice and equality regardless of
                                      race, language and religion. Imagine what would happen to Singapore if we didn’t
                                      upload this two morals</p>
              <p>If it would take centuries before the pledge can be made into reality that
                                      why would you want to stop the NMP who is trying to make a start now</p>
              <p>The other line where MM Lee was taking about the Brahmins in Sinda, I have
                                      no idea what he was trying to mean by it. Most Singaporean Indians have long
                                      forgotten which caste they descended from and even our grandparents have a hard
                                      time pin pointing the right one, So why would MM Lee talk about it like as
                                      though caste was still playing a big part in the life of Singapore Indians?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Why?</p>
              <p>The speech is not mend for you or me, it is mend for his MP speech in the parliament, he is trying to correct it. LKY will not apologise, especially at this time of the year, you must be joking. Even if he is wrong, he can alway push it away with another set of words, his commands of english had make wonder for him, u can hardly make a cambridge trained lawyer to apologise, he knows the twist and turn.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had a feeling that all these are a set up, usually MPs never really argue and dun make this kind of statement against our pledge, and believe me, those who are going to speak, their notes would had been screen thru, unless you are opposition MPs. The intention here is to ask a MP to speak it out and LKY again as the old hero will rise to challenge it, if not, there is nothing much to debate and talk about, and LKY will not be in the news again.</p>

              <p>Regarding CDC trying ways and means not to provide financial aid. I totally disagree with your friends.</p>
              <p>Cause from what i see, all the cdc and wda staff are doing their very best. The demand are more than what they can provide. So they had to carefully select.</p>
              <p>Those who are eligible will definitely be given. Same goes for the job. Sometime, its people like us who are making them difficult. No providing them actual info, hiding some info, not turning up for the interview..etc</p>
              <p><br>They had to give the money to those who needed most and not to everyone that need help they had to give. It is our tax money, If it is given to those who dun need it urgently, it is going to be a wastage and the cdc had to answer for all the money.<br><br>I think one day, u should drop by one of the 5 cdc to see the actual situation. It will be better than just heard from your friends. Thanks</p>
