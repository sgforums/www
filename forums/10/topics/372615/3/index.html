Even if the child truly belongs to me, i would rather my baby gets to live and be awarded to another party.</p>
              <p>It may be an extreme example, but only a realistic example of how none gets what they really want under human law, having lived long enough to realise this fact. There may be gains, but what had you actually lost when the total overall costs(not just money) are counted?</p>
              <p>I will follow the rule of law and its legal engagements with others in my society, but where disputes begin, I would rather to resolve it out of court where criminality does not exist, and find a settlement, where possible. The courts will always be a last resort.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">History<br></span></strong></span><span style="color: #0000ff;">The National Pledge was written in the mid-1960s in the aftermath of the racial riots that had affected communal harmony in Malaysia and Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Rajaratnam believed that race, language and religion were the main factors contributing to the division of the people. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In wording the Pledge he sought to bring across the message that these differences can be overcome if Singaporeans were committed to and caring enough for their country. <strong>The dream for Singapore is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">spelt out in the ideals</span> of the Pledge</strong>. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>It calls for a sense of nationhood to be fostered despite differences, and encourages all to bring reality to the dream of building a country which all Singaporeans could be proud of.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Rajaratnam remembered taking only a day or two to pen the words although it was refined further by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew before submissions to the Cabinet. Some sources suggest Ong Pang Boon had a hand in the writing of the Pledge, but generally, Rajaratnam is credited for its entirety. </span></p>

              <p>Do you know the difference between "ASPIRATION" and a "PLEDGE" ?</p>
              <p>Can "Aspirations" be as solemn as a "Pledge" ?  </p>
              <p>Does an entire Nation swear to uphold an "Aspiration" consisting ideals, or does a Nation swear to a "Pledge" consisting of ideals ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should anyone be surprised at your callous attitude to believe that  "<strong>JUSTICE is a no-brainer in any civilise society</strong>" ?</p>
              <p>With the no-brainer part claimed by you, it is not surprising that even as you believe that Justice is available "<strong>for all - rich or poor- where justice is blind</strong>" - yet you " <strong>do not have much faith on humanity's, let alone Singapore's mortal justice</strong>."</p>
              <p>Is the paradox due to the reality in Singapore Politicizing of the ways that Justice is being dispensed according to the whims of the Political Masters ?</p>
              <p>Is Singapore Justice available to all - rich or poor - as you have resolutely claimed - when the Public Legal Aid is not available to the Poor intent on Private Proceedings to correct any injustice that should fall on the Poor ?</p>
              <p>Can there be any Divine Justice to those who are die-hard Aetheist or Agnostics ?</p>

              <p>Atobe, enjoy your word play and twisting of other's view, as you usually do, and will continue to do. I suppose you must find comfort and solace in doing it. It is your belief system and that which keep you alive.</p>

              <p>Atobe has one thing which I would like to ask you, since you seemed to keep avoiding the subject.</p>
              <p>Do you know the difference between a pledge and an aspiration?</p>
              <p>Or are you just suddenly using the word "aspiration" because LKY said so?</p>
              <p>Let me make it easier for you.</p>
              <p>A <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">pledge is an OATH</span></span></strong>, which is a vow or a promise (made to the nation in this case, NOT PAP), making the nation a witness to the binding nature of this vow or promise. In legal terms, its LEGAL BINDING. <span style="color: #0000ff;">It is no aspiration, but an enforcement that you have placed upon yourself</span>, when you make the pledge. In legal terms, if you don't meet the terms spelt out in the pledge, you are liable for it.</p>
              <p>Aspiration is far different. It's a goal, an aim, an ambition, which means that you make your best efforts to reach it, but if you cannot reach it, no one would blame you.</p>
              <p>If our pledge is an aspiration, why don't we just call it an aspiration?</p>
              <p>"We the people of Singapore, aspire ourselves to be one united nation..."</p>
              <p>By not distinguishing the difference, and then coming here to challenge Atobe, it clearly reflects upon you as an ignorant individual who just listens to LKY (and use the word "Aspiration" automatically).</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>By stating that the Singapore PLEDGE is an aspiration, LKY is already WRONG 100%.</p>
              <p>From a legal point of view</p>
              <p>From an oxford dictionary point of view</p>
              <p>And this coming from a legally-trained and English-educated person...</p>
              <p>He is 100% dead wrong. Trust the people like xtreyier to challenge the dictionary and the legal point just because LKY says so.</p>
