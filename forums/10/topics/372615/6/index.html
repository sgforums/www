              <p><br>Dear Oppositions,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In political arena of today world had changed, gathering and protesting is not going to be the soup of the day, even as disintergrated as country like Mynmar are facing a serious problem among it citizens, especially those young to middle age adults. Singapore is no exception, the present President of US had used it and did well on it. Oppositions should therefore learn to use the internet wisely, popular sites in the net is a good platform for deliberating your cause, speaks like Obama, speaks for yourself and what you want to do and act for the citizens, do not condemn anyone, do not compare with a third world country, you will fail misearably as a 1st world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For example, if you are comparing with a country like indonesia, you are making a big mistake, why? u go figure it out yourself.</p>

              Kuan Yew to NMP: "Pledge is an ideal. Not a reality!"</h2>
              <div class="post hentry"><a name="8377291582918374884"></a>
              <h3 class="post-title entry-title"><a href="http://singaporeanskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/08/lee-kuan-yew-to-nmp-pledge-is-lie.html">Thursday, 20 August 2009</a></h3>
              <div class="post-body entry-content">So it turns out that the Singapore pledge 
              isn't true after all. We are not treated equally regardless of race according to 
              Uncle Lee. The Singapore pledge is not a reality but an ideal according to 
              him.<br><br>As a person who created a party that is notorious for numerous 
              changes to our constitution, it is interesting (and ironic) to see him use the 
              constitutional argument to justify the different treatment of the races by the 
              Government.<br><br>I suppose one can understand his attitudes towards race by 
              reading his book. No, not that work of fiction "<a href="http://singaporeanskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/04/minister-contradicts-himself-again.html">From 
              Third World to First</a>" but his first one "The Singapore Story:Memoirs of Lee 
              <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew". He has 
              experienced bitter riots/politics 50 years ago so that racial bogey man is 
              always on his traumatised mind.<br><br>What Lee has failed to realise is that 
              the main problem is now no longer one of race but one of foreigners. Special 
              position of Malays?! More like special position of our foreign 'talents'!! Our 
              Minister <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementors#Dementors"><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Dementor</span></a> has been so 
              overwhelmed by his historical baggage that he cannot see the 
              present!<br><br>Despite Lee 'reminding' us of the special privilege of Malays, I 
              do not feel that Malays in Singapore enjoy more rights than other Singapore 
              citizens. I do not resent Singapore Malays like the way the Malaysian Chinese 
              feel about the Malays in their own country. In fact, I feel a greater affinity 
              to my Singaporean Malay/Indian/Chinese brothers and sisters compared to a PRC 
              Chinese or Malaysian Chinese.<br><br>Perhaps it is because I went to the same 
              schools as them. Perhaps it is because in my old NS unit, only half were 
              Chinese. I would feel so much happier if I see a Singaporean 
              Malay/Indian/Chinese get a job instead of a foreigner of Chinese 
              descent!<br><br>We are all citizens of Singapore! We shouldn't care about the 
              colour of our skins just the colour of our <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">ICs</span> (pink). Sadly, the PAP is undermining our 
              country by importing these foreign Chinese/Indian/White trash from overseas. 
              These are the people I resent.<br><br>Well, if the PAP keep up their nonsense, 
              we Singaporeans will become more united in opposing them regardless of race, 
              language or religion!<br><br>See also:<a href="http://singaporeanskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/08/singapore-pledge.html"> The 
              Singapore Pledge</a><br> <blockquote>Straits Times Aug 20 2009 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MM rebuts 
              <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">NMP</span></span><br>IN A rare 
              intervention in Parliament, Minister Mentor Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew rose yesterday to 'bring the House 
              back to earth' on the issue of racial equality in Singapore. Spelling out the 
              Government's approach to the treatment of different races, he pointed out that 
              the Constitution of Singapore itself enjoins the Government to give <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Malays a 'special position', rather than to 'treat 
              everybody as equal</span>'</span>.<br><br>He rebutted as 'false and flawed' the 
              arguments by Nominated Member of Parliament <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Viswa</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Sadasivan</span> calling for equal treatment for all 
              races. On Tuesday, Mr <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Viswa</span> had tabled a motion for the House to 
              reaffirm its commitment to principles in the National Pledge when debating 
              national policies.<br><br>A total of 14 <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">MPs</span> spoke on the motion over the past two days. 
              The wide-ranging and vigorous debate ended with Parliament accepting an amended 
              version of Mr <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Viswa's</span> motion proposed by People's Action Party MP <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">Zainudin</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">Nordin</span>, and modified slightly by MM 
              Lee.<br><br>Mr <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">Zainudin's</span> amendment was to acknowledge the 
              progress Singapore has made in nation building, while Mr Lee's was to highlight 
              the principles in the Pledge as aspirations. While present at almost every 
              Parliament sitting, the last time Mr Lee rose to speak was in April 2007 during 
              a furore over ministerial pay increases.<br><br>He told the House yesterday that 
              he had not planned to weigh in on the debate over the Pledge, but was moved to 
              do so by Mr <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-error">Viswa's</span> remarks on the hot-button issue of race. In a lengthy speech on Tuesday, the 
              <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-error">NMP</span> had expressed 
              pride in Singapore's inter-racial harmony and principle of equal opportunity for 
              all races.<br><br>However, he questioned if the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government was sending out mixed signals by 
              emphasising racial categories</span>, for example, through ethnic self-help groups. 
              MM Lee declared that the assumption of equal treatment for all races is 'false 
              and flawed', and 'completely untrue'.<br><br>To 'remind everybody what our 
              starting point is', he pointed to the racially tense period of the 1960s, the 
              circumstances in which the Pledge had been written. Singapore had just been 
              thrown out of Malaysia. The Malays in Singapore were feeling particularly 
              vulnerable, unsure if the Chinese majority here would treat them the way the 
              Malay majority in Malaysia had treated the Chinese minority there. Because of 
              such a backdrop, the Pledge crafted by then Culture Minister S. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-error">Rajaratnam</span> took pains to 
              emphasise principles that would be 'regardless of race, language and 
              religion'.<br><br>Mr Lee also drew the House's attention to Article 152 of the 
              Constitution, which makes it the Government's responsibility to 'constantly care 
              for the interests of the racial and religious minorities in Singapore'. In 
              particular, it states that the Government must recognise the special position of 
              the Malays, 'the indigenous people of Singapore', and safeguard their political, 
              economic and educational interests. Mr Lee contrasted Singapore's approach with 
              that of the United States, where despite a 1776 declaration that 'all men are 
              created equal', blacks did not get the right to vote until a century later, and 
              racial segregation continued well into the 20<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> century.<br><br>For Singapore to reach a 
              point where all races could be treated equally 'is going to take decades, if not 
              centuries', he said bluntly. For this reason, he sees the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pledge not as an 'ideology', as Mr <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-error">Viswa</span> put it, but as an 
              'aspiration</span></span>'. Mr <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_18" class="blsp-spelling-error">Viswa</span> had also wondered if Singapore had got 
              the balance right between prosperity and the happiness of its citizens, and if 
              it had done enough to strengthen its democratic fundamentals.<br><br>Education 
              Minister <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ng</span> Eng Hen, 
              who spoke after MM Lee, provided a detailed response, spelling out how the 
              Government's record over the past 50 years had been entirely in the spirit of 
              the Pledge. 'Far from compromising these ideals in the pursuit of economic <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-error">gro</span>-<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-error">wth</span>, we have been 
              defenders of these ideals in building a nation,' he said.<br><br>Policies are 
              debated openly in Parliament, and the Government is accountable to the people at 
              every election, he said. He noted that Mr <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_22" class="blsp-spelling-error">Viswa's</span> model of a multi-party democracy, more 
              opinionated media and politically active universities was drawn from other 
              democratic models in the West. In Asia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand 
              have elements of these models too.<br><br>But he questioned if those places had 
              done better than Singapore, and said it was not self-evident that their models 
              would work here. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">More important than high-flown 
              rhetoric in pledges and anthems was the reality on the ground</span>, in the lives 
              that citizens led, he maintained. He agreed with the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_23" class="blsp-spelling-error">NMP</span> that Singapore must move with the 
              times.<br><br>However, Dr <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_24" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ng</span> said: 'We must not do so unthinkingly, but 
              consider carefully each step forward, carving our own path towards a better 
              society and a more vigorous economy.'</blockquote></div>

              <p>Majority ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps, a sucker's belief in the self-deluded version of the PAP meaning of majority.</p>
              <p>The self-deluded majority can only be seen as a weak majority.</p>
              <p>This explains the desperate political acts to neutralize Singaporean Political Rights by enacting legislations that make it an illegal assembly of one in public protests, and to claim that the Pledge is merely an "Aspiration", and that the contents in the Pledge cannot be fulfilled at any time soon.</p>

              <p>If you are knowledgeable about the validity of any election process recognised by the International Community - it is that a turnout in participation that involved <strong>less then half the population</strong> is always seen as an <strong>invalid election process</strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Statistics available showed that the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.theodora.com/wfbcurrent/indonesia/indonesia_people.html">Indonesia Population on July 2009 was estimated at 240,271,522 (*1). </a></p>
              <p>In the recently concluded <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_presidential_election,_2009">Indonesian Presidential Election 2009 - results showed a total voter turnout of 121,504,481 (*2) </a>- which represent <strong>50.569 per cent</strong> of the Total Population (that included those below 16 years + PRs and Foreigners).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the Singapore scenario - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Singapore">Singapore Population in 2006 was a Total of 4,483,900 Singapore Residents and Non-Residents, or 2,973,091 Citizens, 290,118 PRs and 754,524 Non-resident population(*3) </a></p>
              <p>The records of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_general_election,_2006">Singapore Election 2006 (*4) </a>had only 1,123,273 votes received from an Electoral List of 2,147,840 registered voters.</p>
              <p>The number of <strong>1,123,273 votes</strong> received is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">37.78 percent</span></strong> to the <strong>Total Population of 2,973,091</strong> <strong>citizens</strong> - which compares dismally to the Indonesian participation rate of <strong>50.57 percent</strong> of the Total Population.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Considering that Indonesia is spread across over 1000 big and small islands, its ability to get 50.57 percent participation from a Total Population of 240,271,522 is even more remarkable.</p>
              <p>It will surely speak volumes of Indonesia's determined democratic practices - that are devoid of the sham GRC and political manipulation that is shamefully practised in this tiny Little Red Dot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is there any reason for only <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">37.78 per cent</span></strong> Singaporeans participating in Election 2006 ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You may wish to know that President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono stood as a Single Candidate - (a.k.a Zero GRC help) and received a total of <strong>73,874,562 votes</strong> which represent <strong>60.80 per cent</strong> of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NATIONAL</strong></span> votes cast.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore PM LHL needed a GRC to help him get into political legitimacy and received only <strong>96,636 votes</strong> or <strong>66.14 per cent</strong> of the <strong>159,838 votes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cast in AMK</span></strong> GRC, and losing 33.86 per cent to six new faces from the Worker's Party.</p>
              <p>The total number of votes received by the PAP in Election 2006 was <strong>748,130 ballots -</strong> representing only <strong>34.83 percent</strong> of the Electoral Roll of <strong>2,147,840</strong> <strong>Singaporeans</strong>.</p>

              <p>Perhaps in your eagerness to malign Singapore you missed the point of what I posted.</p>
              <p><em>The majority of valid votes <strong>casted</strong>.</em></p>
              <p><em>Thats the voting process, anywhere.</em></p>
              <p>Whether it a national election, or a local AGM the votes, it is the votes casted that matters. Citizens or members of an organization who are absent, or boycotted the process are not counted.</p>
              <p>You would do well if you compared the pros and cons of the the Singapore parliamentary system against  the constitutionally elected head of state system of Indonesia. These are two different system of electing the government.</p>
              <p>Therefore the statistical comparision is flawed.</p>
              <p>In any voting process, it is valid votes that are counted, not the population.</p>

              <p>Perhaps in your eagerness to malign Singapore you missed
              the point of what I posted.</p>
              <p><em>The majority of valid votes
              <strong>casted</strong>.</em></p>
              <p><em>Thats the voting process, anywhere.</em></p>
              <p>Whether it a national election, or a local AGM the votes, it is
              the votes casted that matters. Citizens or members of an
              organization who are absent, or boycotted the process are not
              counted.</p>
              <p>You would do well if you compared the pros and cons of the the
              Singapore parliamentary system against  the
              constitutionally elected head of state system of Indonesia. These
              are two different system of electing the government.</p>
              <p>Therefore the statistical comparision is flawed.</p>
              <p>In any voting process, it is valid votes that are counted, not
              the population.</p>

              <p>Firstly, it was not Singapore that was maligned, - it was the PAP imposed election process.</p>
              <p>Secondly, you did ask about the election process being recognised, and my response stand that any election that involve less then 50 per cent of the population is invalid.</p>
              <p>Even an AGM or EGM requires a quorum, least of all an Election.</p>

              <p>Do we need to do battle with a half wit transvee ?</p>
              <p>We can certainly admire your transvee knowledge about "freedom lovers" - as much about Anwar and Mahathir; and all viewed in the same manner that you maligned the Gurkhas and distorted information about the Pakistani hijackers of SQ117, and boasting your erroneous views about the glory of the SAF Commandos - when all are half baked details coated in your fluffy prose plagiarising the style of someone more honest</p>
              <p>Simply viewed, your verbage is as useless as the rubber lips on a woodpecker.</p>
