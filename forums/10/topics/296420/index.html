            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore's GIC Calls For Sovereign Wealth Fund Disclosure<br><br>SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- Sovereign wealth funds ought to improve their transparency while countries in which they invest shouldn't impede their activities, the head of the Government Investment Corporation of Singapore said Monday.<br><br>GIC Deputy Chairman and Executive Director Tony Tan Keng Yam also said all participants in global financial markets should be treated equally and that the state-backed funds shouldn't be discriminated against.<br><br>The remarks came as the GIC said it will own around 9% of Swiss bank UBS AG ( UBS) following a CHF11 billion investment in the Zurich-based financial giant. The GIC's investment in UBS is long term and the Singapore sovereign wealth fund isn't looking for management control, Tan said at a press conference.<br><br>"Recipient countries should not adopt policies that inhibit cross-border investments. Reciprocity in keeping markets open for foreign investments would be desirable," he said.<br><br>"Any guidelines for SWFs should encourage SWFs to operate according to commercial principles with a long-term orientation, free from political motivations," Tan added.<br><br>The comments suggest that Singapore, which is among a growing number of countries that operate sovereign wealth funds, is eager to head off any potential public backlash that may threaten its investment opportunities overseas. They also suggest that the small Asian city-state is keen to have its voice heard as financial authorities from the U.S., Europe, Japan and elsewhere try to formulate policies on how to deal with the state-backed funds.<br><br>Moves are afoot in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations to address the increasing influence of sovereign wealth funds, whose financial firepower Merrill Lynch estimates could soar to $7.9 trillion by 2011 from $1.9 trillion currently. G7 officials are concerned the funds may become a source of volatility in financial markets or cause national security problems if they seek stakes in companies that are sensitive from a national security standpoint.<br><br>"All players in the global financial markets should be treated equally," Tan said, adding that sovereign wealth funds should be perceived as a stabilizing force in financial markets because of their focus on well-diversified portfolios, long-term stance and "virtually no leverage."<br><br>Tan said Singapore "will participate actively" to create a set of principles and best practices for SWFs, and that the "GIC believes that it can contribute in a positive way to the framework for greater disclosure."<br><br><a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/aspxcontent/NewsStory.aspx?cpath=20071210%5CACQDJON200712100513DOWJONESDJONLINE000135.htm&amp;selected=9999&amp;selecteddisplaysymbol=9999&amp;StoryTargetFrame=_top&amp;mkt=WORLD&amp;chk=unchecked&amp;lang=&amp;link=&amp;headlinereturnpage=http://www.international.na" rel="nofollow">http://www.nasdaq.com/aspxcontent/NewsStory.aspx?cpath=20071210\ACQDJON200712100513DOWJONESDJONLINE000135.htm&amp;selected=9999&amp;selecteddisplaysymbol=9999&amp;StoryTargetFrame=_top&amp;mkt=WORLD&amp;chk=unchecked&amp;lang=&amp;link=&amp;headlinereturnpage=http://www.international.na</a><br><br>---<br><br>Definitely something worth looking at.</div>
