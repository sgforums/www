            <div class='col-md body'>One very worrying issue that was brought up during the recent 'Singapore bashing' by the Malaysians regarding the complacency of most Singaporeans. They pointed out that most Singaporeans have lived too good a live that they are not interested to fight even if there is a war!Are they misjudging our capability or are there plain truths about the complacent Singaporeans?<br>There are more worrying signs that more Singaporeans who are studying overseas refuse to return after graduation! And worst still, the annual birth rate has plunged to all time low. Now, who is going to shoulder the role of defence if this trend continues? What needs to be done to correct these trends from continuing?<br><br>Many were asking whether one day Singapore needs to rely on mercenary fighters to defend its shoreline!?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heartlander, read Machiavelli. Mercenaries will send our country to ruin.<br><br>I think that at the heart of it all lies the question of whether SIngaporeans care enough for SIngapore to fight for it. Cos if this question is answered in the positive, then no matter where one is, one will rush home to defend it.<br>When the Israelis were under attack by the Arabs, Israelis all over the world rushed back to join up their army units to fight. Those too old or too young to fight or with no units formed themselves into volunteer battalions.<br>I share Heartlander's worry that the Singaporeans of today are too soft and only think of getting out of SIngapore; as if leaving Singapore would make their life so much better. My view is, to these people: get the F out of my country. We don't need your kind here.<br><br>Having a small dedicated force who is willing, able and committed to fighting will always triumph over superior numbers anyday. History has shown this and we have no need to fear for those A**holes who refuse to come back to S'pore to fight if we are in trouble.<br>The arabs outnumbered the Israelis 10-1 in all 3 wars and yet suffered crushing defeats.<br>The Fins during WW2, though outnumbered nearly 25-1 thrashed the Russians so badly that it took the Russians nearly 1.5 million men KIA to secure Finland.<br><br>Even if in the unlikely event that S'pore loses the conventional war (touch wood! choy choy choy!) the fact is that 'north-man' will never be able to hold on to our state...without incurring disproportionate losses and it will make them withdraw. even if they beat us all back past the causeway, we will turn every building into a FIBUA for them, and good luck to them trying to clear every single damned built up area in S'pore... There will still be thousands of SIngaporeans running loose with arms and explosives and the knowhow to use them. And i'm sure all of us will be pissed as hell, and ready to die fighting - after all, with our backs pressed to the wall, there's nothing left to lose already.<br><br>Just look at the Israeli take over of Jenin...they had to fight it out building by building, painstakingly and watching their body count grow.<br>And they were just dealing with palestinian gunmen armed no more than with AKs and some explosives. and the jenin incident was just a refugee camp! not even a city...<br><br>Like Stalin scoffed at the German Commander of the 6th Army - we will make you pay in blood for every step you gain in Stalingrad.<br>and then when your blood flows kneww deep, we will still have the city.<br><br>now in the 21st C, the Chechens are teaching the russians that you can 'conquer' our lands, but you'll never own it and you'll never get a single moment of peace.</div>

Don't try to make it sound so positive when it's a fact that singapore is more becoming like a hotel more than a home to most as was pointed out in the <a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/columnist/0,1886,16-37675,00.html?" rel="nofollow">news</a><br><br><blockquote><br>I share Heartlander's worry that the Singaporeans of today are too soft and only think of getting out of SIngapore; as if leaving Singapore would make their life so much better.

And hence the results, more local migrating oversea and more oversea are needed to fill in the gaps. Great policies right?<br><br><blockquote>Having a small dedicated force who is willing, able and committed to fighting will always triumph over superior numbers anyday.

But does a dying nation facing population crisis need a large force to protect it anyway? But wait a minute, don't forget we still got a large pools of foreign worker to protect to substain the economic in singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FIBUA has always been a bitch.  Every turn, every corner, every window, can be fatal to SOMEONE.  It saps morale as well as the enemies fighting capabilities at the same time.  The way I look at FIBUA in SIngapore, every drain can be turned into a trench, every HDB block conceal Sharpshooters, and more than enough places to position portable AT weapons.<br><br>Okay, I understand the topic relates to whether Singaporeans will fight or not in the first place.  I can tell u, Singaporeans WILL fight, or risk having nothing left.  Perhaps u should read Sun Tzu Art of War for more details.  One technique to make your men fight, is to burn ur own supplies, and cut off yourself from retreat, and then make ur men unite and fight to the end.</div>

Silent mobs will be carried out, more and more people will disappear from work and turn up in green.<br><br>Unless you have your own learjet to fly you out of S'pore, you can forget it. You're stuck with us here. Us being those of us who will gladly rush back to our units to kit up and get ready for war, to ensure our national survival.<br>And whatever your reason for remaining in S'pore (whether you siao on or you lun lun) once your back is to the wall, and you knwo that if you don't shoot, the bugs will, then every man will fight to the last drop.<br><br>as for those who refuse to come back to S'pore,...well. thats something that they have to live with. If we lose, they have nothing left too. They will be 2nd class citizens...oops, stateless refugees in a white man's country.<br>and when (not if) we win, those people who refused to come back earlier will catch hell from those people who stayed through the conflict.<br><br>Those brtishers and french who fled UK and france during WW2 and didnt' return until after the war was over thought taht they could just happily slip back in unnoticed.<br>Fat chance.<br>many were prosecuted for treason.<br><br>And rightly so. cowards.<br></div>

I'm not applying that tactic to EVERY situation, cos I'm not keen on commiting national suicide.<br><br>Soldiers often gain morale from different situations, how much they gain, depends on how well the commander rallies them.  Some feel the urge to fight harder when they see atrocities, some fight harder out of desperation, and some fight for his buddy. Whatever these individual reasons maybe, it is up to their commanders to rally and push.  Morale affects the fighting spirit, tenacity, and the ability to carry out actions with extreme violence and prejudice, up to a point where personal survival becomes secondary.<br><br>Admiral Arleigh Burke, (Captain at that point of time), charged Japanese Naval destroyers when he knew that he was gravely outnumbered.

No bonus for 9 month etc No pay increment for MPs and hence the complaint etc. Income taxes is not the only way they squeeze from you my dear. When the government is "too good", you won't be seeing local migrating oversea and you will see most of the foreigner making long queue to get the Pink IC instead of the Blue one i guess.

            <div class='col-md body'>I for one will want to get back to Singapore asap. Coz look at how the British government and people work, I feel fortunate that ours are more efficient and fast responses and adapt to changes fast enough.<br><br>Conparing the responses of my Malaysian classmates who are talented in their work and are Chinese and Singaporeans, most Malaysians want to work elsewhere whereas those Singaporeans wants to return home and work. Although most of us are average, our loyalty still lies with our families and country though few are willing to admit as they feel is corny to.<br><br>Overall Malaysia would face a brain drain as their talented Chinese and Indians (cited as they have a larger percentage of them)moved out of country and stay out there as they feel elsewhere is better, most of the home bred Singaporeans would want to be home.<br><br>But there is this number of Singapore who are overseas since young want to leave outside of Singapore as they are more familiar to the those countries.<br><br>Another group of people would want to leave Singapore to work would be the Arts pple, coz the market in Singapore is too small. And they feel there is no space for them to develop. But looking at the modern arts today, I would say it is senseless art. Oh yeah and druggies. would want to consider moving out of Singapore. Its lax law here in UK sure produce a lot of druggies and criminals. And I called the police when I witness and break in gave them the car plate number, considering the police staion is 45mins walk away, no responses for the ten minutes the thieives where searching the house. Consider that.<br><br>I posed the same questions to 3 of my friends here and the answer was yes they will go back and fight when the need come.<br><br></div>
