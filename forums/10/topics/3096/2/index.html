            <div class='col-md body'>Kyo23, I think that you might have a rather unpleasant NS experience, and it seems as if you think that 1) the entire experience must be just as 'worthless' for everyone else and 2) the officer / command / NCO corp deserves the blame for your misfortunes and lastly 3) that our govt spends too much on amenities.<br><br>I agree with you partly on point 3. Yes it does seem excessive spending all this money building more and stupid golf courses, but such spending should not be equated to an incompetent military structure.<br><br>Next, your alleged incompetence of the SAF. Well, no one's perfect, especially us NSFs and even regulars. There will always be dickwits and twits in every organisation. I'm honest to say that in the beginning of my term as an officer, I was caught up in the 'rank and salute' nonsense, which you despise. In retrospect, I have made many errors in the way i handled my men. There were many other ways that I could have done better.

Have you ever lowered down your self-esteem in camp to apologise to that driver and undo all your wrong instantly? And maybe to the driver who din exposed you, either becos you are an officer or becos he know you are just another NSF who is trying to learn the way out. Even for me, i will sympathy for my own kind in camp but definitely not for those regulars esp officers who are taking in salary, who should do their jobs diligently which i c otherwise. Well, guess a good life with SAF club house and golf club membership is their ultimate aim for signing on.<br><br>And for your own experiences which you think are beneficial to yourself at the expense of others, do you think you will be less than that if you are exposed to working in real practical world earlier to learn all those proper stuff instead thinking you can command your staffs like recruits to do work for you? Do you think experiences in NS is relevant and applicable in the civilian world where "fuck you" and punishment can work?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Just like you prob had problems and encounters with idiots like me when i was all young and rash    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But you know, it's not the entire organisation that is inapt.<br><br>Everone has a part to play in the army.

Complaining in camp will only make your life even more miserable amid all those officer pig esp regulars who frequent NCO officer club house. It is only when we are out as civilian that we can start criticing the systems for the sake of our future generations as feedback. If such a system is to be fair to the population as a duty and commitment for those who want stay in singapore, then please include those foreign talent and PRs who's earning big bucks in singapore as well. If GST hike is to be implemented to lower income tax, then please include those rich men esp MPs into the picture when their original reason for exemption no longer stand strong. I would like to see these pple washing the toilet side by side with the next generation at least to boost morale. Lead by example and we will follows.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I refuse to believe that you never met anyone in your NS time who made a positive impact on you, regardless of rank or position.</strong></blockquote>Sorry to disappoint you, i had never encounter any positive or look up on any regular, officer or authority in camp for my NS. None deserve it unless they lead by example. But instead as an example, they took revenge on the new recruits for all the hardship they being thru in their Sispec/OCS courses. And as for those NSF Mens or officer like you, we are all just being conscripted cheaply for 2.5 years till we orded before we can finally get a life. What can you expect? You want to garang for free is your problems. We have better thing to do to improve oneselves i believe instead of wasting time and losing out in the real unfair world where foreign talent is replacing everyone amid the crisis coupled with national problem that threaten the survival of the nation's identity. In the end, we might become the minority protecting a whole lots of rich foreign pple and some local suckers.<br><br>Well, all aboves are my personal opinions which you can disagree of course, but it's agreed by me.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 23 April 2002).]</div>
