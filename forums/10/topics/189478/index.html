Perhaps he had been a hawker or a house-painter, informal jobs with nothing by way of a pension. In his old age, he might have a mountain of financial worries. Worse yet, life and society as he knew it in his younger days were disappearing. The dialects are gone from official speak, in their place, not Mandarin, but Angmoh (English). Medical and hospital costs are stratospheric compared to what he had known 3 decades ago. Even taking a bus downtown costs more than taking the taxi in days gone by.<br><br>Meanwhile the richer have gotten richer. And the government talks the incomprehensible language of foreign investment, foreign talent, GDP, globalisation, creativity and the arts.<br><br>He would not have understood any of this, but he didn't mind that. What was important for him tonight, was that for once, a politician had articulated his sense of loss, his insecurity and his bewilderment at the galloping pace of change.<br><br>I don't know what the solutions are, he would have said. I don't understand half the stuff that ministers talk about anyway. But it doesn't matter. What matters is that tonight, I heard someone speak eloquently what I feel. And if he knows what I feel, then I can trust him to do something.<br><br>Of course, not everything can be fixed. I've lived long enough to know there will be no magic solutions. I'm not expecting any; just a little improvement is all I ask. Speak for me to the powers that be and give me hope. Do that, and I'll put my trust in you.<br><br>We don't understand politics until we understand that<br><br>~commenting on the possible reasons for an elderly man seen crying just after Low Thia Khiang's strong rally at Hougang</strong></span></span></blockquote>Perhaps, only now you begin to realise that 'commoners' know more than you think, and that your shallow helicopter view of what you deem 'commoners' mirrors the despicable and arrogant nature of the Ruling Party.<br><br>Even in obvious moral defeat they remain in <span style="color: red;"><strong>self-denial</strong></span>, insisting that the <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="color: indigo;">'STRONG MANDATE' </span></strong></span>target was achieved.<br><br>The figures don't lie.<br><br>Lim Boon Heng should receive the 'Party Whip' for first-class stupidity and plain complacency.</div>

However, please do remember and note, that it is US COMMONERS (you and I again) that gave those up on their high-chairs the power to RULE.<br><br>Yes, indeed make ends meet is our main concern. We make a pitance to get by, while those we elected draw exhorbitant salaries. Doesn't this at least give us some degree of RIGHT to question and comment on our Political Leaders???<br><br>By the way, based on your comments on people as "cannot make it people", you yourself don't sound like you have made it either.<br><br>It takes all kinds of people to make this world tick. If this world is made of "successful and intellectual people" like yourself, we'd likely be at WAR right about now...<br><br></div>

I shall just stay quiet and obedient from now on and let our great PAP royals decide on the fate of us the commoners. I shall blame all the high transport and medical fees, overpriced HDB housings  and unemployment due to cheap foreign competitions all on myself. The PAP knows best, and they really deserve the obscene salaries paid to them for taking care and planning for the future of a bunch of stupid and ignorant commoners like me.<br><br></div>
