I am sure if anyone in the group knows me the first person that would have come to your mind when seeing the word NKF is me.<br><br>Yes I do support Mr Durai, Why : Because I have worked there I know how relentlessly he worked for that organisation. Because I know if he had to work for a profit organisation he would have earned 10 times more than what he gets now.  And if you still don't believe me I have an article from the Chronicle of Philanthrophy hopefully you can form your own opinion after hearing what experts say : http://philanthropy.com/free/articles/v14/i24/24003301.htm.<br><br>Your ten dollars and my ten dollars do not mean a thing if they don't come together to help a needy.<br><br>40 years of his life when he worked relentlessly with little public support no one gave a thought to that.  The money is not in his coffers but in the NKF Fund.<br><br>He has one of the best business practices in NKF.  practices which are followed in large business houses like GE and Walmart and Nordstrom.<br><br>Training programs where an employee is taught practices which are taught in business schools like Harvard.<br><br>I understand he gets a huge amount of money but if you read the article you will know his counterparts in America earn much more than this.  Have offices larger than his and have perks he can't dream of.<br><br>His dream was to make NKF a global organisation.  Great personalities like Pele, Mr Jain (The Dean of Kellogs Business School), Infosys Chairman and the Mike G termed as the topmost direct mail fund raiser have visited and lauded NKF for its practices.  We had interns and employees graduated from the Harvard Business School, CEIBS, Insead working in NKF.<br><br>You get monkeys if you pay peanuts.  Will any one of us work for anything below our worth.  We don't mind remaining jobless till the time we don't get something substantial and we expect people with brains grit and determination to work for salaries not worth them.  Although<br><br>I am not working for NKF anymore I still support Mr Durai and I know Truth always prevails.  If you read the article you will know that the head of Red Cross was pressurised to leave as well because of the amount she earned and I am sure that's what we will do to heads of charity organisations.  We don't want our charity organisations to be as good as our Profit organisations where we hold shares as we don't get direct dividends on it.<br><br>I am sure you will have your own opinions about the salaries and the "Golden Tap".<br>and I am not sure if you are hating me for this.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ra8865:<strong><br>Hi Guys,<br>Being in the media industry I am sure everyone is aware of what is being splashed in the newspapers for the past couple of days.  I am sure <span style="color: red;">if anyone in the group knows me</span>the first person that would have come to your mind when seeing the word NKF is me. </strong>[/quote]<br>Unfortunately, none of us in THIS group know about you, or who you are.<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>Yes I do support Mr Durai, Why : Because I have worked there I know how relentlessly he worked for that organisation. Because I know if he had to work for a profit organisation he would have earned 10 times more than what he gets now.  And if you still don't believe me I have an article from the Chronicle of Philanthrophy hopefully you can form your own opinion after hearing what experts say : http://philanthropy.com/free/articles/v14/i24/24003301.htm.<br></strong></blockquote>Firstly, from the chronicle of events of Durai and the NKF, it will seem that during the 1970s - Durai was active in charity work while being an undergraduate at the NUS, and he went on to build up NKF with a group of like minded Doctors - who all had the vision of the possibility of "managing" the huge sums of monies that are available from the charitable hearts of Singaporeans.<br><br>From the now very obvious evasive nature of Durai, we should be asking - was his vision to help the kidney patients an altruistic one, or was it the opportunity to help himself as he manage a multi-million dollar charity ?<br><br>He should be working very hard at NKF to ensure his interests are protected - and that of all those who support him.<br><br>I remembered the ridiculous challenge that Durai and NKF made towards KDF when it was created to provide similar support to Singaporeans, which challenged and rival NKF for public charity and support.<br><br>If Durai and NKF could make all efforts to deride and belittle KDF, surely he must have seen a huge threat coming to dilute the revenues to NKF.<br><br>Why would he feel this threat from KDF unless his vision for NKF is less then charitable ?<br><br>Secondly, the refered Chronicle of Philanthrophy did not mention NKF as being a philanthrophic organisation.<br><br>NKF was and IS run as a BUSINESS - (see below), not as a charitable organisation - as it charges kidney patients $300 for the services used, which led to a revenue of $25Million dollars - despite the fact that charity funds had accumulated to $265Million in the NKF Reserves.<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>Your ten dollars and my ten dollars do not mean a thing if they don't come together to help a needy.<br><br>40 years of his life when he worked relentlessly with little public support no one gave a thought to that.  <span style="color: red;"><span class="large">The money is not in his coffers but in the NKF Fund</span>. </span>  </strong></blockquote>The money was given by the charitable hearts of all Singaporeans - from those who earned a meagre income as <strong>a Dishwasher at the hawker centre, the roadsweeper, garbage collector, as well as those retrenched workers, and <span style="color: red;">workers who received pay and CPF cuts</span></strong>, to those big hearts of those with fat wallets.<br><br>Surely the message is quite clear that the monies are there as a support from the PUBLIC - (who also contributed in unpaid services to collect public charity, including the Media Corp Stars performing at no fee), and this alone should disqualify your comment that he worked with "LITTLE PUBLIC SUPPORT".<br><br>"<strong><span style="color: red;">The money is not in his coffers but in the NKF Fund</span></strong>"<br><br>Perhaps you should look at the fact that the money was moved from the NKF Fund to his coffers by the "approved" movement of 12 MONTHS BONUS during 2003 and 2004 - when <strong><span style="color: red;">Singaporeans were experiencing PAY and CPF CUTS, and some with no bonus being paid </span></strong>during these years !!!<br></div><div class="quote_body">This is an outrageous scandal by itself !!!<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>He has one of the <span style="color: red;">best business practices</span> in NKF.  practices which are followed in large business houses like GE and Walmart and Nordstrom.<br><br>Training programs where an employee is taught practices which are taught in business schools like Harvard.<br><br>I understand he gets a huge amount of money but if you read the article you will know his counterparts in America earn much more than this.  Have offices larger than his and have perks he can't dream of.<br><br>His dream was to make NKF a global organisation.  Great personalities like Pele, Mr Jain (The Dean of Kellogs Business School), Infosys Chairman and the Mike G termed as the topmost direct mail fund raiser have visited and lauded NKF for its practices.  We had interns and employees graduated from the Harvard Business School, CEIBS, Insead working in NKF. </strong></blockquote></div></blockquote><strong>Finally this cold truth should be obvious to you by now <strong>that NKF operate as a BUSINESS and NOT as a CHARITY </strong>despite the fact that its money is from PUBLIC CHARITY.<br><br>It seems that his greedy dream knows no bounds - if he can accumulate $265Million from "Little Red Dot", one can understand his ambition to grow NKF globally.<br><br>Surely your comparison of NKF to Kellogs, Infosys is out of place; and the comments of NKF Services by those great names that you referred to had certainly praised the concept of public service of NKF to the needy patients and not about its business practises.<br>[quote]:<strong><br>You get monkeys if you pay peanuts.  Will any one of us work for anything below our worth.  We don't mind remaining jobless till the time we don't get something substantial and we expect people with brains grit and determination to work for salaries not worth them.  Although I am not working for NKF anymore I still support Mr Durai and I know Truth always prevails.  If you read the article you will know that the head of Red Cross was pressurised to leave as well because of the amount she earned and I am sure that's what we will do to heads of charity organisations.  We don't want our charity organisations to be as good as our Profit organisations where we hold shares as we don't get direct dividends on it.<br><br>I am sure you will have your own opinions about the salaries and the "Golden Tap".<br>and I am not sure if you are hating me for this.  But the only question, I am asking myself is<br><br>Would we work for a charity organisation at 1/3rd the salary we would be getting in a business organisation?<br>Would I work 10 - 12 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year for 13 years in the same organisation without any rewards or increments?<br></strong>It all depends on how big a monkey one wish to have with the peanuts that one pay.<br><br>Monkeys have been known to be trained with peanuts to climb up trees to pluck bigger coconuts - and those monkeys were more charitable in their hearts towards humans who mistreat and misunderstand them !!!<br><br>For 1/3rd the salary, if there are any openings at NKF, it will probably absorb all those who are presently jobless and have been looking for a job for the last ONE YEAR !!!<br><br>Surely with the "philanthrophic heart" of Durai toward the NKF staff, so as to ensure their undyingly blind loyalty, there will be many willing applicants to work in NKF !!!<br><br>Any openings ?<br></strong></div>
