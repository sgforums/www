            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guys,<br><br>Yes I do support Mr Durai, Why : Because I have worked there I know how relentlessly he worked for that organisation. Because I know if he had to work for a profit organisation he would have earned 10 times more than what he gets now.  And if you still don't believe me I have an article from the Chronicle of Philanthrophy hopefully you can form your own opinion after hearing what experts say : http://philanthropy.com/free/articles/v14/i24/24003301.htm.<br><br>Your ten dollars and my ten dollars do not mean a thing if they don't come together to help a needy.<br><br>40 years of his life when he worked relentlessly with little public support no one gave a thought to that.  The money is not in his coffers but in the NKF Fund.<br><br>He has one of the best business practices in NKF.  practices which are followed in large business houses like GE and Walmart and Nordstrom.<br><br>Training programs where an employee is taught practices which are taught in business schools like Harvard.<br><br>I understand he gets a huge amount of money but if you read the article you will know his counterparts in America earn much more than this.  Have offices larger than his and have perks he can't dream of.<br><br>His dream was to make NKF a global organisation.  Great personalities like Pele, Mr Jain (The Dean of Kellogs Business School), Infosys Chairman and the Mike G termed as the topmost direct mail fund raiser have visited and lauded NKF for its practices.  We had interns and employees graduated from the Harvard Business School, CEIBS, Insead working in NKF.<br><br>You get monkeys if you pay peanuts.  Will any one of us work for anything below our worth.  We don't mind remaining jobless till the time we don't get something substantial and we expect people with brains grit and determination to work for salaries not worth them.  Although<br><br>I am not working for NKF anymore I still support Mr Durai and I know Truth always prevails.  If you read the article you will know that the head of Red Cross was pressurised to leave as well because of the amount she earned and I am sure that's what we will do to heads of charity organisations.  We don't want our charity organisations to be as good as our Profit organisations where we hold shares as we don't get direct dividends on it.<br><br>I am sure you will have your own opinions about the salaries and the "Golden Tap".<br>and I am not sure if you are hating me for this.  But the only question, I am asking myself is<br><br>Would we work for a charity organisation at 1/3rd the salary we would be getting in a business organisation?<br>Would I work 10 - 12 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year for 13 years in the same organisation without any rewards or increments?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ra8865:<br><br>You dun seem to get it do you?<br><br>The educated masses aren't disputing his 25K salary. They are neither doubting that he has done much charity work for NKF and probably brought NKF to the level it is now.<br><br>But it is his ethics and conduct throughout the proceedings that have drawn disgust, along with the evasive and dishonest side he showed regarding the 1st class airfare and 12-month bonus issues.<br><br>Afterwards, he did not step down of his own accord or unconditionally; instead, he asked for 'advice' on whether he should step down from Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan. Does that indicate he was still <span style="color: red;">unwilling to do the 'right thing' </span>as Vivian Balakrisnan observed?<br><br>The fact that he also preferred to harp on his achievements of the past 37 years instead of accepting the real reasons why he was 'forced' into relinquishing his post had <strong>'brazen' </strong>and <strong>'arrogance'</strong> written all over it. Clearly he is still in denial. He believes he has done no wrong and that as CEO of trustee's monies, he was 'entitled' to such creature comforts without weighing best value or consequence.<br><br>Legally, he is in the clear and perhaps he set out with good intentions. But he was devoid of humility and morality, and for a man running a charitable organisation, this was inevitable.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></div>

Sometimes, going out with a minister on tea-break or long lunch 2-3hrs also consider working....<br><br>His salary and first class travel does not boil the singaporean's heart.. what boils the singaporeans' heart is the false statement they made to earn our empathy... such as... reserves going to last only 3 years.... a false report on the amt of pple... a false report on the cost of each treatment.... To this, how are you going to help him defend? This practice is common for evey company huh?<br><br>Do you know that all these false declarations are similiar to accounting irregularities... which will end up investigations by CAD and fined and jailed for 7 years....<br><br>Furthermore, although it is a pte charity group but they declare that the organisation is a non-profit organisation... if it is true in their declaration, how come Mrs Goh will say that they have a turnover of 100+ millions ~ And since they got so much reserves, how come many of the patients' applications are rejected? What are these reserves for? U mean future will have billions of pple get kidney problem then they will sudden come out with all the reserves to help.</div>

Whether he use these channels to divert $$ (legally or illegaly) for his own benefit, i do not know<br><br>3) There is a delibrate intent to deceive the public. White lie is also a lie<br><br>4) (reading the court transcript) There are lotsa other information that Durai refuse disclose. Which according toe Durai : "I cannot recollect", "Its not material"<br><br>5) (personal opinions) I hate people who keep ranting "Wo shi hao ren"<br><br>6) Professionalism isnt guage by how much time and effort you poured in.<br>Doing the thing right is totally different from doing the right thing.<br><br>7) As a lawyer himself, he plays around with words (read the court transcript), and try to bring out issues like "privacy", "I personally believe", "its unmaterial". "that is the way how we operate".<br>....<br>..<br>.</div></blockquote>maybe when he is at nkf he spend 4 hrs on nkf work and rest on his private interest !!! tats why need to OT so much. knn  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

He believes he has done no wrong and that as CEO of trustee's monies, he was 'entitled' to such creature comforts without weighing best value or consequence.<br><br>Legally, he is in the clear and perhaps he set out with good intentions.
