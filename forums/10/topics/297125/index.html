The business and income tax are low, streets are safe, infrastructure is excellent, and heaps of companies and business entities are there for u to deal business with.<br><br>there are some downsides particularly around stress, FT displacement in your profession, ageism etc.. but ultimately it is up to you to manage your expectation.<br><br>question is; do u wish to live a better life  and be ignorant to the politics? or be politically aware and live a frustrated live? if i come back to sg, i shall live like a foreigner and ignore all form of sg politics. our sanity is alot more important than all these helpless frustrations.</div>

It is legal and basically it takes out of your earnings before ATO eats your tax for lunch. It can save a person who earns 52k+ per year , at least 4-6k in tax alone.<br><br><blockquote><br>eg u pay interest  3.5% pa in SG and 7.3% in Oz.<br>For A$200,000,each year u have to pay about A$8000 more<br>interest.about A$650 pm. </blockquote>That is if you choose to pay it off slowly . Most people push more money into their mortgages to remove the debt.<br><br><blockquote><br>How much u earn in Oz and what is the pay increment than SG? </blockquote>God blessed certified agreements. They pay overtime if you are employed under a certified agreement. They also agree on pay increments over the time period of a certified agreement . My current employer increases the salaries by 4.25% per year til the end of  2010 when they start negotiating pay increments again.<br><br>You should see our leave benefits ...hahaha damn shiok.<br><br>of course , if someone asks you to sign an AWA for more money - you don't.<br><br><blockquote><br>2.Anyway,there are many factors u need to consider?<br>If u cant do well in a country u are familiar,are u sure<br>u can do well in a new place.<br><br>3.<strong><a href="http://www.yourmortgage.com.au/compare%2Dhome%2Dloans/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">your mortgage.com.au</a></strong>[/b]</blockquote>I am doing fine in a country I was not too familiar with .

All he/she sees is <span style="font-style: italic;">WHOA my money</span>!<br><br>There are some Singaporean students doing the mindless paper chase - when asked why do a degree - the answer mostly is "earn more money". Money seems to surround everything in Singapore . If you don't already notice, there are some Singaporeans even in this forum who define success by how much you earn and how much you own.<br><br>It's just freaky. I can speak to 10 Singaporeans and 6 are guaranteed to tell me that their study is geared towards monetary rewards only, not interest.<br><br>Sometimes people migrate for another reason - opportunities which Singapore unfortunately does not have. Be it career, economic, academic or even lifestyle opportunities.<br><br></div>
