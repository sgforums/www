Not the other states - so if you want to have house and land for the next 10 generations - buy in the other 6 states and 1 territory . Don't buy into ACT.<br><br>Difference of ACT though - the land lease renews at a 99 year duration again through the new owner  if I am not wrong. HDB no renewal.</div>
