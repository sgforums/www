            <div class='col-md body'>Currently studying in melbourne and keeping close to latest news on the election in Australia.<br><br>Personally, I could feel being an australian (even i am a "pure" singaporean) after engaging with the different views of the two main parties i.e. the coalition and the labor. I could feel for the future of Australia is at stake in this election and i finally understand what it mean by being a citizen of a nation. it is not about being proud of the stability of the nation, it is not about rushing to get this year's NDP tickets. It is about being able to engage in the future of the country and knowing that you are holding onto something powerful - a cast of vote.<br><br>It is time for singaporeans to think about the future of our nation. The future of a nation is not simply restricted to the economic well-being, but rather the political atmosphere. As i read through the Singapore parliamentary reports, and compare it with Australian federal parliament where the two parties exert their pressure onto each other, I yearn greatly for the day where Singapore could reach a two party system where the incumbent will have to fight for survival, not just being talented over whatever they are doing, but also endure the political onslaught during the election. Looking at the current list of Post 65 PAP members, I wonder how many of them are capable in achieving the latter.<br><br>Oh well, maybe it is time to change our constitution, from a nation "Singapore" to Temasek Holding and be listed under Nasdaq, if Singaporeans are not willing to give the opposition a chance in the next election. Once the GRC syndrome is overcome, talented personnel who aspire to be a politician will think twice during the PAP tea invitation, as he or she will have more options.<br><br>Lastly, with regards to the idea of opposing as being an opposition party is flawed. An opposition party does not necessary needs to oppose the incumbent on every single issue. I believe that an opposition party as an alternative party of possible different views and beliefs. Just take a look at this year australia election where "me-tooism" are part of the election compaign, the opposition labor party seem to be on its way of breaking the coalition hope of attaining the fifth term in government.<br><br>Let's embrace the term alternative over opposition in the next election.</div>

Buying power in Singapore is dropping, partly due to China. They are faced with either voting PAP or vote for an almost non-existant opposition. I believe alot follow the concept of "better the devil i know than the devil i don't". Alot may believe that if they vote opposition their buying power will dwindle. They know (or i hope they do) that there is a severe imbalance in the gahmen but most want fast gains and they do not think a change in gahmen will affect them this generation till they are old and it does not matter too much. They go fer the carrot ie watever $ they give out or watever upgrading they do fer their beloved HDB. Let the others vote opposition i just want my HDB upgrading (selfish thinking  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ) so i can sell fer a higher price. Sad ar but true i also selfish.... cant win mah so migrate to Melb lor when the political imbalance is addressed then see ba  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> till then i just watch and earn aud. Cannot tahan? Then wake up and start paying attention to politics and stop voting blindly. (Not intended to anyone in particular just venting my frustration)<br><br>Becoming competitive with China is important i agree with that. But i do not agree that the pay should reflect that. Can SG also compete with China in terms of cost of living? Does SG want to <span style="font-style: italic;">BE </span>china lol Then give us china pay and londons cost of land?<br><br>Anyway all this is intended to make sg peeps aware of the state of politics and its imbalance. All the drama i stated is exagerated. (quite proud my singlish still bery good ar) U think i want meh go abroad.... but things so cialat u think i siao? Other ppl selfish vote fer "HDB upgrading" good lar i vote fer my AUD $.</div>

              <p>I seriously like what the government have contributed to the growth of Singapore but recently, the standard really dropped like flies. Now Singapore have become a haven for the rich and hell for the poor. Middle class people is neither here nor there. Work hard just enough to pay for high living expenses.</p>
              <p>Feedback to government and they tell you to downgrade your lifestyle if you can't manage. Haiz...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The problem is... the check and balance in Singapore is almost non-existent. Take note that you guys here complaining about PAP or individuals from PAP may be facing defamation charges if those PAP individuals want to. The way laws are made and enforced in Singapore needs to be improve. I mean even some aspects of our Constitution are not been followed. Part 2 14) of the Constitution states that all citizens have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms. However, if you gather with too many people, you risk facing illegal gathering charges. wow....</p>
