The school building was another 50<br>metres away from the<br>gates. The gates were closed with two uniformed police<br>as security.<br>The lights in the open coumpound up to the building<br>were off but the<br>building lights were well on.<br><br>The counting should have started at about 8pm but we<br>took our<br>positions about 8.30pm.<br><br>We had one eye on the Anderson School counting centre<br>and another eye<br>ahead of us on the coffeeshop TV monitor perched a<br>little above our<br>heads. We could keep watch on the TV to see the<br>results as they came<br>in and also on the school.<br>At about 10.30pm we noticed a small closed van<br>approach the gates and<br>gates opened after some inquiry by the security police<br>and the small<br>van drove straight to the building. This was unusual<br>as the other few<br>vehicles that entered the building that we saw all<br>turned to the left<br>upon entering to park. But this van was allowed to<br>proceed to the<br>building entrance.<br><br>We were interested and watched closely the driver and<br>his assistant,<br>both in army uniforms, went to the rear doors of the<br>van and took our<br>some boxes and proceeded to carry them to the<br>building. They did a few<br>trips each with a box. The boxes looked like ballot<br>boxes.<br><br>We would be about 80 metres away and noted that the<br>van had no<br>markings but was of one colour which in the darkness<br>could have been<br>grey. After carrying the boxes in and immediatly<br>after, the van drove<br>off with the same two persons.<br>Nothing untoward occurred further that night.<br><br>We waited at the spot until all other results were out<br>and announced<br>but not Cheng San which completed at about 1.40am or<br>so.<br><br>We were known to one of the Cheng San opposition party<br>candidates and<br>we asked him what took so long as he was in there and<br>also with the<br>two other scrutineers of the opposition party. This<br>was after they<br>emerged from the counting centre.<br><br>They were surprised themselves and said that the<br>counting took some<br>time because there was recount after recount.<br><br>But they said that what was stranger was that they<br>were well into the<br>counting when the Rreturning officer on duty said<br>there were another<br>few boxes - 8-10 more to be opened as they had just<br>arrived. This<br>approximated to the time we saw the van driving up to<br>the school<br>building.<br><br>The scrutineers and the candidate said they checked<br>the unopened boxes<br>and found that the opposition party seals were not in<br>place.They<br>informed the Returning Officer who then said that the<br>absence of the<br>opposition seal did not render them invalid as the<br>responsibility for<br>having the seal in posiiton was that of the opposition<br>party.<br><br>The boxes contents (votes) were counted and they noted<br>that the votes<br>composition was very much in favour of the PAP unlike<br>the other boxes<br>where they votes more or less balanced out.<br><br>We drove the two lady scrutineers home and upon oiur<br>inquiries we<br>learned from them in all their innocence that the<br>extra ballot boxes<br>wre only opened and counted after the initial counting<br>had taken<br>place. Also that the preponderance of PAP votes in<br>those boxes were<br>not following the trend of the earlier countings. We<br>know somebody had<br>been had.<br><br>The Returnoing Officer is duty bound to ensure that<br>all ballot boxes<br>are in place before allowing counting to commence. "<br>UNQUOTE<br><br></div>
