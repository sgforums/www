Â— the maker of WilliamsÂ’ favorite brand, Marlboro Â— to pay Mayola $820,000 in compensatory damages and another $79.7 million in punitive damages. Oregon courts have twice upheld the punitive damage award, satisfied that the jury had reason to find that Philip Morris had perpetrated a fraud on Williams and other smokers in the state and that the companyÂ’s conduct was both profitable and reprehensible in the extreme.<br><br>Consider the case of a young uneducated and poor Thai mother, with two children, She is possibly the victim of placing trust in another individual for whom she carried a suitcase. She wasn't familiar with air travel warnings about carrying luggage you should pack yourself in your own suitcase. Her lack of awareness to the dangers involved she's charged and found guilty of heroin possession then executed having been deemed a drugs dealer by The Government of Singapore.<br>Can the World excuse such a sentence to ever be acceptable rather than illegal since it was such a horribly inhumane act causing two children a life time of painful memory.<br>Concluding the act illegal then both her family and her nation are owed a very substantial claim in damages. This should be addressed urgently<br><br>Limited liability does not necessarily protect you where criminal factors may be involved. Perhaps not only The Government of Singapore but also its Ministers should be held personally liable for failing to avoid life taking mis-carriages of justice especially if they introduced the law that caused the risk of life to be lost this way in the first instance (whenever the first case of this happening was). All that glossy squeaky clean plate glass tower of success hiding a filthy evil of unconcern for human life. Singapore doesn't impress me anymore<br>Harry do you remember Mr Mitsui ?<br>Well Mr Young I do remember meeting him a few times he went from cars to ships to banks and I though that's a good idea my family can do that as well<br>When was that Harry?<br>Oh well Mr Young that was back in the old days before 2004<br>I thought it was a bit longer ago than that Harry he knew my father they met in Switzerland. In fact I think I was there physically but my mind was somewhere else so I sort of vaguely remember him too. Never heard him mention your name though<br>Small world isn't is Harry<br>Harry where have you hidden the rest of our diary ? Its not a secret anymore you don't need to hide where are you Harry ?<br>Maybe he;s forgotten his name again..... Lee where are you.... Mr Yew<br>Damit he must have gone down the drain again<br>Where's that old firm of his Die-narod<br>Harry I need you to tell that Loong branch of yours to tell everyone to throw away their rope.

I just wrote to Dr. TaÃ¯eb ChÃ©rif The Secretary General of the International Civil Aviation Organization urging him to persuade the Aviation Industry to reroute all their Singapore stopover flights through Bangkok instead because Bob doesn't like people being executed<br>And Bob just made everyone in Singapore a Jehovas Witness so you won't have any staff for the Army Navy or Air Force anymore and they'll all have to leave Singapore because you banned Jehovas Witnesses<br>He's done what?<br>Sorry Harry all Bob said he thought it would be a great joke for us to play on you<br>Yew's World<br>Harry have you met my daughter Apinya's friend called Magic?<br>Oh the Nigerian she went mushroom picking with<br>That's right Harry<br>Well he's planning on opening a drug store on Orchard Road later in the year.<br>What sort of drug store ?<br>Oh Harry don't ask stupid questions<br>Yew's World<br>Harry you know that Swiss bank account you've got<br>Which one Mr Young ?<br>Oh for God's sake how do you expect me to know which one<br>Well Harry...

The HR Club<br>Anyway now Bob has made everyone in Singapore a Jehovas Witness everyone will have to leave because you went and banned them....they.re not door knocking to sell drugs to people Harry why in God's name did you do that to them. Most of them are quite nice people<br>Well Mr Young I was worried about having Witnesses around<br>Were you Harry? What a bit like keeping financial statements confidential for 30 years<br>Yes that's right Mr Young<br>So Harry whats the point in all those planes stopping in Singapore when nobody will be there<br>I hadn't thought about that what am I going to do?<br>Harry its easy for God's sake just join the club<br><br>Yew's World - Harry Lee Kuan Yew Loong<br>So tell me Harry how many people have you killed in your life time<br>Well Mr Young not quite as many as Mr Shinawatra had killed but definitely thousands<br>All of them 100% quite definitely guilty were they Harry?<br>Well Mr Young they must have been because we executed them<br>What even the poor uneducated Thai mother of two children who was deeply religious?<br>Why did you ban Jehovas Witnesses from Singapore Harry?<br>Well Mr Young I don't like witnesses<br>Yew's World - Harry Lee Kuan Yew Loong<br>You see Harry I found out about some of your dealings with the Burmese Drugs Barons<br>Well Mr Young they told me they were Chemists<br>God Dammit Harry how many times have I told you Chemist is the Burmese word for drugs dealer<br>Oh sorry Mr Young I forgot I was so influenced by the amount of money that could be made<br>So you forgot they're drugs dealers<br>I told you Mr Young "we're not corrupt we just have our own way of doings things"<br>Just like the organised crime unit called The Royal Thai Police.... Harry?<br>That's right Mr Young<br>So what about the Shinawatra deal Harry ? Well they are Chinese Thais so they can't be corrupt they are like our family Chinese<br>I see Harry so that was a clean ethical and moral deal was it<br>Well Mr Young it was'nt corrupt we just have our own way of doing things<br>Do you really Harry?<br>It's not surpising people riot in a country that has been run by a bunch of crooks who aided and abetted Burmese drugs barons and employ an organised crime unit they then title The Royal Thai Police.<br>There are over 10,000 corruption cases pending in Thailand and thousands of members of an organised crime unit called The Royal Thai Police who fit people up to make money. They are NOT policemen they are criminals<br>Well Mr Young we do have freedom of speech in Singapore..... you're allowed to say whatever you believe as long as you don't upset us<br>I see Harry Lee Kuan Yew Loong rather like making your financial statements transparent by concealing the accounts of a national company for 30 years<br>But that's my company Mr Young because I made Singapore... Temasek Holdings PTE Ltd is an anagram of our family name..... We're not corrupt we just have our own way of doing things"<br>What Harry like doing things with The Burmese Government and The Shinawatra's?<br>Harry Lee Kuan Yew and Long ...In the last 10 years of Temasek Holdings PTE Ltd investing into Thailand what have they done to help erase corruption ?<br>If you don't like corruption Harry why do you do business with corrupt leaders like The Shinawatra and the Burmese Government<br>Well Mr Young "We're not corrupt we just have our own way of doing things"<br>What Harry ? You mean like trading with Burmese drugs barons<br>Well Mr Young there not drugs barons they are Chemists<br>Oh for God's bloody sake Harry I told you before the Burmese word for drugs dealers is Chemist.... are you deaf as well as blind ?<br><br>The organised crime unit called The Royal Thai Police are responsible for thousands of problems... others call murder... in Thailand<br>Yew's World - Harry Lee Kuan Yew and Loong<br>And now Mr Singapore Lee Kuan Yew has locked the Singapore forum I published stories on because he doesn't like people getting angry with him because he killed/murdered a young Thai mother of two children who was fitted up by a Nigerian<br>Well Mr Young it doesn't matter she was only a Thai, they weren't children they were Thais<br>I see Harry so if they're not Chinese Singaporean like you they are a sub-human race are they ?<br>That's right Mr Young that's exactly why it doesn't matter that I had the Thai mother killed even if it was a mistake everyone will forget about it after a while so what's the problem<br>That's what the Yew's encouraged their new commrades the Shinawatra's to do... slaughter anyone that was a problem.....<br><br>Yew's World - Harry Lee Kuan Loong Shinawatra<br>Harry who's idea was it to get the organised crime gang called The Royal Thai Police to fit people up as drugs dealers or paedophiles ?<br>Umm I can't remember.....<br>So when they could'nt successfully fit someone up as a drugs dealer they tried to fit them up as a paedophile<br>That's right Mr Young how did you know<br>Because Harry I know many many things about the corrupt games the organised crime gang called The Royal Thai Police prey upon people to make money.<br>Well Mr Young they don't really do that do they?<br>Oh yes they do Harry, they have done things like this to thousands of people over the years<br>That 40% commission they wrere offered by your mate Shinawtra for catching drugs dealers made quite a few people have a career change and end up as drugs dealers<br>How did you knwo Mr Young they were promised up to 40% commission?<br>Because I have been investigating the organised crime gang called The Royal Thai Police and they are very very very dishonest corrupt and have done some thoroughly evil things to young people Thais and foreigners<br>I think the Army should show them what happened when an M72 is fired through the side wall of a building as a warning<br><br>Yew's World - Harry Lee Kuan Loong Shinawatra<br><br>Well Mr Young I had a feeling the organised crime gang called The Royal Thai Police were a bunch of crooked bastards<br>No Harry they're not bastards they are murders who have ruined the lives of thousands of Thai familes.<br>Well Mr Young it's not surpising the people have smashed down their barriers is it ?<br>Harry I am surprised the Thai public haven't smashed up their police stations too.... maybe they will soon unless the Army does it first with some M72 anti-tank missiles... which The Royal Thai Army have in their weapons armoury because I checked to see if they had any<br><br></div>
