I agree with you wholeheartedly on this sentence.<br><br>The rest I must assure you, the reason why the opposition is unable to field better candidates is due our Government's past actions on clamping down on the opposition. It is human nature to think about one's own ricebowl. The PAP will always tempt future talents with better wages and a brighter future.<br><br>I must admit the PAP did wonders for Singapore. But that is the past. I was disgusted by the tactics they used for the GE... some of their current policies and the explanations behind the introduction of the policies are just nonsense.<br><br>I will not comment further.

            <div class='col-md body'>Answer :See Tiggerific post part of the reason. And why cant voters be stupid after 40years of PAP? What is ur point? 99% of voters know nothing about governing the country, things like the reason GST and SOL of sgreans and stuff. So they are stupid in a way whereby they are no one to judge who to be and who not to be the goverment. Simply because they know almost nth. The reason the goverment give them a reason to vote is because they are singapore citizens. The goverment in trying to give everyone a sense of belonging. And we are a democratic country. And if they say no voting suddenly ppl will surly KBKP. Singapore image will also kana ruin. I said this in my post b4.<br><br>Answer : PAP do this to play safe. Its obvious that the PAP do not trust opposition in governing the country. So thus .. they made the system a way that winning is a 95%. And i dont think you can trust a brand new goverment that does not have much governing experience. PAP do not have the change the system at all. Its already a really good system to benefit themself. And ya they can be unfair to opposition at all cost. They dont have to even care much. Care for what? Because it wrong being unfair? They got to be a better host and play fair? They got to show to sg that they are the kind of goverment that will win even if its a fair election? No they dont have to. All they have to is to win at all cost and continue to govern sg. Who can sue PAP pants off and over turn them. In sg .. literally no one can.<br><br>Answer :No i did not say PAP wont win if the election is fair. But there is a chance that they may lose more areas. And what the PAP is trying to do is minimize this. There are stupid ppl around. Election is by voting so there are flaws in it. A more <strong>popular </strong>goverment does not make it a <strong>better</strong> goverment. So if ppl vote for some kind of dunnoe how to govern sg goverment but damm good at giving ppl unrealistic benefits? We just sit back and see sg sink? Or do you wana steady economic like what we have now? This one i also say b4 in my last post.<br><br>Next time dont ask question that i have answered in my post can?<br><br>Oh ya and you haven answer my question.<br>Is this for the sake of having a "fair election" or you strongly feel that opposition is able to do better then PAP? And you are at least 75% SURE that opposition can do better. If you are smart i dont think you will give me statistic like this.<br><br>If cant give me 75% you are telling me you are choosing option1. Which is retarded. The world is full of hypocrisy. You know i know everyone know. Nth is fair. Unless you 3year old kid.<br><br>Again i am not saying opposition is totally unable to govern the country. What i am trying to say is. With lack of experience, there is a high chance that they wont be able to do it as well as PAP. We can see many of the changes PAP made in the sg systems are from past experience.<br><br>At the very beginning a voting system is already flawed. What you wan?<br><br>PRP: All the question you ask obviously want me to say out all the dark side of the goverment. lol<br><br>PS: Sorry i cant feed you with new answers. Cuz the answer is somehow fixed. At least to my standard of knowledge. Sorry for bad english again.<br></div>

Sued some people along the way to prove his point. I am not saying nobody can raise the same kind of money that Durai did, but hey he did it best! He also paid himself alot of cash but hey he did his job didn't he? So what did he do wrong? Nothing, except to open the can of worms himself.<br><br>Sometimes we need watchdogs... but PAP does not even allow for the existence of watchdogs. This total extermination is uncalled for.<br><br>Regarding the quality of candidates, I hate to bring this up again, but I really cannot see how people like Mr Wee of AMK can relate to people on the ground. Do we really need top elites like him who probably cannot even relate to the common people in our government?<br><br>Top honchos at Temasek deserved to get hanged for the billions lost. I demand an explanation. I want answers, not for everything to be swept under the carpet.<br><br>But it's obvious isn't it. We will only hear what they want us to hear. Sometimes we need to question if there is anything wrong about a perfect system, because nothing stays perfect forever.</div>

It's precisely because of Lee and his son that I'm losing faith in the government. You should perhaps refrain from reading those history textbooks published by the Ministry of "Education" and reading or watching news from the Singapore media, whcih is ranked 146th in the world by Reporters Without Borders, with only communist states, despotic regimes and 3rd World nations just hovering above and right below Singapore's ranking.<br><br>Instead, watch TVBS's Taiwanese news, which is more entertaining complete with colourful captions and beautiful news anchors.</div>
