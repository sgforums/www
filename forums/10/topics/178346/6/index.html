            <div class='col-md body'>This thing about dressing/decorum is quite superficial but telling of the class divide and their  corresponding views...The slipper candidates may be seen as 'anti-establishment' or they themselves would like to project that image because they feel there are faults in the current system.  They connect with the underdogs, ready to engage in no holds barred discussions and get to the point. This antithesis is good in the all too often bureaucratic and not necessarily efficient systems that are present. And there are no signboards that give restrictions on slippers/singlets/dogs/cats/race/language etc? So why the big fuss. Either the status quo has become disengaged or complacent such that resentment sets in; e.g. time for a change. Think Gandhi in flowing robes and travelling on 3rd class train rides to get noticed. These rogue like appearance may be the robin hood character to some. At the other end of the spectrum, there are dandy chimps in white belt and white shoes as if ready for some tap dancing parade. Guess they hope to appear chic and impress the young or aspirant elite. Now, who they attract depends on the different values, attitudes, lifestyles you subscribe to.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PRP:</div><div class="quote_body">Wearing slippers to polling station doesn't mean that chap was a lousy candidate.Wearing a tie doesn't mean the person is a good candidate.<br><br>Why other coutries have strong opposition but we don't have?It has something relate to the govt.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>People cannot reason with a GRC-cornered one-party rule. It is an unequal contest. One-vote-one-man system has been denied as voters are prevented from choosing the best candidates in our election.<br><br>There are other ways to go about ensuring racial balance in election or economy of scale. People have to understand that GRC is an underhand tactic and not honourable and will serve to frustrate our people's right to choose the best to represent their aspirations and creativity. Just play along for the time being though as it is no use talking except to vote and get good people in in the best timing possible.<br><br>This time there are two reasons for voters to be happy in this year's nomination though:<br><br>(1) on nomination day there are enough candidates to humble the power that be into acknowledging people's power again after many years of arrogance.<br><br>(2) Voters can decide to humble the PM if necessary by giving him a little scare if needed so that he will not take them for granted that election is foregone. Only in this democratic way could people check on the government to keep it strong and people-oriented to serve the people.<br><br>Let us hope next time those ministers who keep denying people of the right to criticise or question the system will lose their seats in another election even in GRC. May be WP keep up the good work in this election to test their ground support for the next round. They should not give up their fighting spirit.</div>
