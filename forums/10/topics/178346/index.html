            <div class='col-md body'>there is no point in having an opposition in Parliament if he/she is not capable of delivering. In the end, the opposition will get the raw deal, and when it comes to upgrading etc, their wards will still be the last one to be done. We have reached a point where people clamoured for opposition in the Parliament, but are we having it just for the sake of having it? Besides the WP, other opposition parties like the SDA and SDP are not really saying what their manifesto is for the coming election. Obviously, they are not ready, despite claims that they are planning to fight for GRCs, and also for single wards. Do we want such parties to represent us, parties who are waiting till the last minute? I don't think so.</div>

In the end, the opposition will get the raw deal, and when it comes to upgrading etc, their wards will still be the last one to be done. We have reached a point where people clamoured for opposition in the Parliament, but are we having it just for the sake of having it? Besides the WP, other opposition parties like the SDA and SDP are not really saying what their manifesto is for the coming election. Obviously, they are not ready, despite claims that they are planning to fight for GRCs, and also for single wards. Do we want such parties to represent us, parties who are waiting till the last minute? I don't think so.</div></blockquote>The opp. parties are not good enuf,the ruling party can tell the ppl not to vote for them.But the election system should still be <strong>fair</strong>.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i also feel that elections ought to be fair.  it is the cornerstone of democracy.  if there are obstacles preventing the alternative voice from being heard, then we risk being controlled by a dictatorship.<br><br>fair elections and opposition quality actually goes hand in hand.  when elections are fair and more opposition gets voted into parliament, it signals to people that election is not entirely futile and more capable people would come forward to try to win.  if a barrier is set up so high, it'll simply discourage people from trying to climb it ... unless one is starving or suffering from severe injustice, one wouldn't risk one's rice bowl for a more equal society, especially when one is capable and successful and thus more equal ...<br><br>the rationale for a six-member GRC is bullshit.  we can have minority representation without the GRC.  how?  simply by assigning certain wards to minority contests and other wards to majority contests.  would the incumbents accept this alternative minority representation scheme?  no because the ultimate aim of the GRC is not minority representation.</div>
