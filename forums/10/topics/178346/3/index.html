            <div class='col-md body'>It's us my friend, it's us. Not the opposition, not the PAP. It's a freakin election, a facade of democracy left to us by our former colonial masters. Democracy in itself can never work if the people choose not to let it function. It is a choice for us to make and a choice we have to bear. I am disappointed by the mentality of most Singaporeans - why bother, it's just gonna be them again. I disagree. I'm always of the believe that one single vote is a fraction which determines our lives and lives of everyone around you, that empowerment, though subtle, justifies our right to exists. When all this die down, when people forget, the decisions take shape.<br><br>History will judge us, just as we study the struggle  which plagued the infancy of this nation, we applaude the fortitude shown by our early leaders for standing strong in the face of communism. Surely, our future generations will judge our decisions. In fact, the state of their existence depends upon the decisions we make today.<br><br>This is of non-partisan, but an urge for each one of us who has a chance to vote to take heed of the responsibility being entrusted upon our shoulders and to take the process seriously.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I should see in singapore we are taught the rightful rights &amp; wrongs.<br>if u get retrenched, in the eyes of law the the worker's union has no rights to fights for ur rights, but only to suggest ways to get the employer to consider giving u the retrenchment benefits but whether the company will gve u is another thing.<br><br>In Law a union has very limited power. In singapore many has been tamed as they nothing much they can do. we are too guai. we follow the law quite strictly. we are the only country when the company retrench in batches, we just accept whatever sum is given and go finding a new job taking into considerations that got better than nothing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>In other countries there would already by riots. but is with the riots they express their thoughts abt the issues. here we can   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  gumble and forget abt it because a riot in singapore can land u 7 yrs in jail which is almost the same as manslaughtering.None of the singaporean will dare to risk their career on it.<br><br>In the past, before singapore first started....It start with LKY going out on riot to speak to people mah.<br><br>Anyway there is similarity between singapore &amp; malaysia; Singapore &amp; thailand cos there are things we followed them. Eg in the history of malacca, tun perak is the man behind the throne. here we maybe have also. the man behind throne elected the king whom he has control over.<br><br>Then we have the free speech too compromise people who wishes to express their views. but it is not very effective as their speech requires a license which mean the contents of speech has to be evaluate first. No speech allow in races...else u land ur self in court.<br><br>we singapore should be granted a award for been nice children loh.there no citizens in any country tat guai as us. after all we have been told to work OT, or work on sat / sun when it is not official hours just to keep our jobs even if no OT premium or pay is given.<br><br>we already the best citizen le lah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>here's another take on the gerrymandering by Sean Chiang Nee of littlespeck.com:<br><br>Boundaries<br>Where am I, really!<br>I woke up and found myself in Aljunied where a hot battle is shaping up. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Mar 4, 2006<br><br>As a resident in Serangoon Gardens for 20 years, I am finding myself again on the move.<br><br>I flipped open the newspaper this morning and learned that I am no longer a voter in Marine Parade Â– but Aljunied. ItÂ’s going to take some time for this to sink in.<br><br>Like other senior citizens, I donÂ’t like too make sudden changes, especially when the government is telling me that everything is doing very well.<br><br>Four election shifts in less then 20 years, I think represents three too many.<br><br>See, I started as a voter in, what else but Serangoon Gardens, enjoying my one-man-one-vote right to choose my own Member of Parliament and quite happy to elect the best person to represent me.<br><br>Which, in those days, was unquestionably someone from the PeopleÂ’s Action Party (who polled 70% of the votes). Then my journey began without my physically moving my butt an inch.<br><br>I became a voter in Braddell Heights, followed by Marine Parade (which promptly rendered me a Â‘non-voterÂ’) where I remained for 10 years.<br><br>Now IÂ’m in Aljunied, where they say a hot battle is shaping up.<br><br>Luckily I have not developed any geographical loyalty in my place of residence, or else all this spinning could make me schizophrenic. I think the trick is not to take it too seriously.<br><br>I just wonder how many voters in the outside world go through the same thing. I supposed I couldnÂ’t complain; at least I have a chance to vote this time.<br><br>Sadly, I somehow donÂ’t see the election really stirring up the new generation.<br><br>Too many Singaporean youths have a Â‘boh chapÂ’ (Â‘donÂ’t careÂ’) attitude about politics and elections and donÂ’t seem at all bothered about who wins or who losses - or why.<br><br>Â“The coming election wonÂ’t change anything, anyway. The government will still be controlling as it had doneÂ” seems to be a popular sentiment. All these frequent boundary changes simply contribute to the cynicism among young and old.<br><br>I must say it is quite prevalent in the estate where I live.<br><br>At a coffee shop breakfast this morning, an elderly gentleman asked me why was I surprised. Â“You should know better. Next time Serangoon Gardens may well move to Ang Moh Kio!Â”<br><br>Impact<br><br>Whatever the reason, incorporating Serangoon Gardens, a generally pro-PAP ward of 20,000, into Aljunied is likely to be a plus for the ruling party.<br><br>So may well be for the other switched wards. The exercise has forced the major opposition parties to review their laid out plans, making it harder to reach full agreement to avoid three-corner fights.<br><br>In hot contention are the nine single constituencies, for which there is an excess of opposition candidates.<br><br>It will be a real test of their combined resolve to cooperate for the larger good, which is to give Singaporeans an opportunity to vote.<br><br>With fewer resources, the smaller parties can only indulge in the smaller fights - not the big constituencies.<br><br>The media spin is that the changes are 'surprisingly' minimal, but the public may not share this view.<br><br>It is small only for two reasons: firstly, people had expected a far larger change and secondly, if the number of new voters has increased substantially nationwide.<br><br>I believe neither is true. I don't think people had anticipated a massive delineation exercise; if there were, the mainstream reporters or the Internet would not have missed it.<br><br>Secondly, the increase of new registered voters in the past five years - 45,000 or 9,000 a year - is the lowest in history. So is the switching around of so many (reportedly 175,000) voters really necessary?<br><br>One perception is that recent measures have probably prevented a major upset to the People's Action Party. That it will win the election handsomely is never in doubt.<br><br>The question is how many seats and how many votes can the opposition win?<br><br>The public perception is that while the $2.6B budget goodies may have raised popular votes by at least a few points, this boundary delineation may help the People's Action Party retain some vulnerable seats.<br><br>True or not remains unclear. It is hard to read the minds of the voters in their collective wisdom.</div>
