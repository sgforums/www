Why?<br><br>Singapore's majority is Chinese. Now, what if an Indian MP tried to get elected in a constituency, let's say, 60% Chinese, 30% Malay and 10% Indian? I know anyone with brains would put this aside but MOST PEOPLE WILL NEVER DO SUCH A THING. THEY WOULD VOTE FOR THE CANDIDATE THAT THEY THINK THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH. And to put it matter of fact, no matter how kind-hearted this Indian MP-wannabe is, he/she will never have a chance (well, a long shot if he/she knows Chinese). WHY WOULDN'T THOSE CHINESE VOTE FOR HIM OR HER? BECAUSE HE/SHE IS NOT CHINESE.<br><br>It is just that simple why we have to have GRCs so that we can get them mixed with Chinese and allow them to get into Parliament.<br><br>What's worse, a parliament with two opposition or a parliament with two non-Chinese? </div></blockquote>I think jeyaretnam won in the Chinese dominant constituency so it defeats whatever you have said. I think perhaps the worst racist is PAP themselves because they keep saying they Singaporeans would only vote for their own race. They ply on people's fear to maintain the GRC system.<br><br>Your message is nothing new, just something regurgitated by the ST Propaganda.<br><br></div>

Under democrazy, creativity flows naturally. Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong are all cultural powerhouse and also known for their savvy business man. Singapore has progressed, but differently from the rest.</div>
