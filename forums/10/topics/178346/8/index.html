            <div class='col-md body'>A system run on conceptual ideas or assumptions is anti-progress. Very often, views and suggestions made are countered by control-based mentality without fully addressing wider range of issues in the name of pragmatism or some leadership ability or insight. Actually when the assumptions and leadership insight were not working no one could point out they are not working. Even ex-civil servant like Ngiam Tong Dow has openly admitted this shortcomings of the leadership system.<br><br>Solution more in line with the educated work force is collective leadership, accountability and transparency but this view was largely ignored or stonewalled for years. At the end, Singaporeans missed many opportunities to govern its economy with a greater strategy involving mass participation of all talents in every field. They do not know what they had missed given the greater choices and perspectives denied.<br><br>Our most critical problem today facing the whole population is not a few weak opposition candidates who did not know how to submit a proper form but whether the governing elites could understand the need for greater choices versus autocratic assumptions which do not work as well in later years.<br><br>After the prolonged recessions which lasted from 1997 to 2002, Singapore might have finally climbed out of the recession, it is still very much in the backwater among the Asian tigers or the more entrepreneurial first league nations but our leaders want us to compare with Thailand or Indonesia to show that our leaders have been successful in the past 40 years to build up a nation from third world to first world.<br><br>This is like admitting that there is no more solutions to upgrade Singapore except in heading down the road of chaos experienced by these countries being compared. Our leaders hesitated to compare with better run nations so obvious reason that we have lagged behind in entrepreneurship and advanced technology application.<br><br>If they are truly first world leaders they should keep competing with more advanced economies like Switzerland and Finland and not with the worse countries. Citizens' mass participation in political renewal and knowledge application hold the key to our future success. Those ministers who are still arrogant and cannot see new challenges and the necessary changes and only know how to keep singing their past successes have missed many opportunities to groom our own capabilities and upgrade our economy to value-adding technology driven model.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quoted from sammyboy website in their coffeeshop forum (nt porn)<br><br>"<br>Well, in a rather obscure place much away from the peering public, had this breakfast with this very well regarded senior journalist/ editor from SPH. Here are the journalist's personal (because this person is a known rebel amongst the SPH folks) views/opinion and assessment (not in any particular order). Given that this journalist has had top level access to a lot of people this is perhaps not only interesting but has a ring of credibility.<br><br>PAP worried that this time they were not returned on nomination day.<br><br>Many are really concerned with the kind of damage that LKY is doing with his interviews (CNA, Foreign media etc.). A very seasoned media personality had to tell LHL about this on friday, that LKY needs to be more subdued. Will the PM tell his Mentor father?<br><br>The entire ISD is busy trying to dig up something on Sylvia. WKS is personally supervising it. They want to destroy her before she becomes big. There is a big chance that they could have stumbled something about her. The PAP will use it during the closing stages.<br><br>Actually GCT didnt want to be part of electioneering and wanted to play a laid back role. He got pitchforked into this to his own surprise. It sounds like a conspiracy to have him discredited. What is not clear is whether GCT screwing up by making confusing statements is intentional or accidental. GCT is not even invited or even consulted for some of the strategy meetings. He gets his information from secondary sources. By end of this year, GCT would be out of the cabinet and sent to Batam to retire or would be called as Travelling Minister, because he would be constantly made to travel.<br><br>The PAP big guns are going to land up in Aljunied from Tuesday, and it will see a flurry of activity, threats (both covert and overt). LKY himself may be seen there, though a section of the PAP dont want him, because he is pissing off people.<br><br>PP may be a close shave, but looks like the odds favour CST, because of the stupid, contradictory and disparaging statements made by GCT.<br><br>Additional precautions are being taken to prevent outbreak of rioting, violence, shouting on the streets or stadiums on thursday and friday. Riot police have been asked to be on standby. They do expect (or even want) some violence or rioting so that they can make a few arrests, and put the fear into the hearts of the people. so, make sure that the AP urge people not to become violent at their rallies repeatedly.<br><br>I think if CST and LTK were to stand on the same stage and speak the same language, especially at PP, Aljunied and CCK, the PAP would be pissing in the pants.<br><br>PAP actually happy that WP havent aggressively touched the core issues yet -- Jobs, CPF cuts, HDB window rivet, NKF, cost of living etc. Their strategy is to keep the WP busy with the Gomes issue, so that other important issues get less airtime. APs, should just move on and raise the bigger issues.<br>"<br><br>by Serenditpity</div>

Like I say before all PAP stress in this or other elections is about upgrading. Elections should be more on policies making and how u lead singapore to a new level not on personal attack on the personality, experience etc. That's why I think our election is still 3rd class</div>

Is that the reason why Balestier is having so many many problems from illegal parking to poor town planning, factory pollutions, dengue and illegal activities.</div>

PAP should debate on the bread and butter or some important issues that face the nation if they want to win! MRT and SBS were making tons of money and in the past yet they still allow them to increase fare. This time round they still make profit and only they made slightly less, will the PAP government still allow them to increase fare and betray the poor heartlanders?If the PAP can promise them in the rally and keep to their promise that such incident will not happen, they may be able to win points! If they still try to make our lives more miserable, soon the so called Wayang Party will take over and rule Singapore!<br><br>MPs and Ministers are earning big peanuts of more than hundred of thousands or even millions! How much they knew about the hardship of the heartlanders? How often you see them around to understand your livelihood?You only see them during election time trying to put out some smiles, will that helps?They are staying in big bungalows or expensive landed property,how much they know the difficulties you face every day trying to cope?By throwing some peanuts for you once in a blue moon will make you happy?Think again!</div>
