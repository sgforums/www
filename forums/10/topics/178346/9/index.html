Our CPF employer's contribution has not been restored to 20% even in a period that the government claims that our economy is on the rise again.  Companies are hiring non-Singaporeans because we are getting higher wages and I believe this is especially so in the IT-related fields.  There is no employment protection for Singaporean workers.<br><br>Whenever a policy is brought up for discussions, the one putting forward the policy will always have a stand.  Whatever justifications that the proposer show, they would be supporting 'the stand'.  The proposer may not tell you the negative impact but that does not mean such impact does not exist.  Then again, the proposer is NOT lying as NOT telling is not the same as lying.<br><br>"Put in this way, there is something that I can do that no one else can (I may not have the exact quote though)."
