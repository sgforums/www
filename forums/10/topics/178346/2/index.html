            <div class='col-md body'>Very surprising that you mention 'comfortable'. Give another 10 years, I am sure the income gap will widen and all sorts of dissent will result.  Without doubt, the current policies are ineffective to cope with the bigger challenges ahead. Don't ask me how...I am not paid a million bucks to resuce some sinking ship and guess I would rather not make it easy for others to take credit if I ever had a solution. While one shouldn't put a bandaid on a gushing wound, one thing sure is just don't pinch so much of everyone's money. It is happening everyday even if you coop yourself up at home and take 1 meal a day to skim expenses. Once in a while, you still get to part a few K when some bright spark comes up with idiot ideas and decided that every hbd household needed a lift in every fllor just in case they got too weak to walk. Then you get a glorified pigeon hole that serves no purpose.  A personal valet next? Well, there are the gullible fools of which many of them were once seduced into home ownership and now being reproached as those who can't manage their finances and better chew the humble pie? But who's idea in the first place? It becomes ever more pathetic when such ownership were once equated with being patriotic and having a piece of Singapore.  One must remember not to jump over the moon over a few hundred dollar goodies into your pocket. It goes back to where it came from. Just that such schemes get clouded in  very refined and systematic styles so you don't see them clearly. You see, old broken records played at different speed still come up with the same annoying tune.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">and what let people who have no clue muck up our comfortable lifestyle??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hi hero,<br><br>Many countries have been a victim of their success, it is precisely at the peak of their glory is where the decay sets in. That is my prime worry.<br><br>Personally, I have been grateful to the PAP for the great governance and leadership for Singapore. I know they are an efficient party. However, in some countries, power is held on for too long in some families and trouble starts to surface. (there are already some, s'poreans, you know them.) I serve Singapore, so ultimately I put Singapore above PAP.<br><br>My concern is that, many MPs in government are not battle-tested. Not wishing to risk defamation, but I feel in theory they can feel free to implement policies without inquiring the unhappiness or views of the people because they will never get elected out. They can play a wild card although they have been very careful. I always felt Singapore resembles the system in ancient China where you sit for the examinations and get a post in the government. Its a known fact that many PSC scholars score straight As and S paper dist, go into the government, go through a walkover election and get a post.<br><br>I feel that, now that we have a mature educated population, stable political climate and economic growth, it is a good time to open up the political environment in Singapore. Its a good opportunity now. If Singapore is not ready in 20-30-40 years, then when???<br><br>The PAP always say the Opposition failed to field good candidates. I hope the political system can be more open. With that, more educated people will join an opposition and provide an effective check to the ruling party. Personally, I hope there can be a strong opposition in the next GE. I mean, if people speak up against flaws, why must they be seen as purely troublemakers?</strong><br><br>well said and i agree with you totally. PAP could be enjoying their best years in power since last election and opposition party are at its lowest point since last election. history does tell us decay start setting in if the ruling party become complacent and implement policy to stifle democracy or prosecutingt the opps party to such level that they are not able to compete or no one dare to compete anymore.<br>kindoms after kingdoms since ancient china toughts us it happens. PAP should seriously reduce the nos of GRC and let its new MP to stand on its own and fight a real battle of election with the opps party. if they are good they get elected. stop hiding behind some minister and fight on your own. by going through the battling election can some MP knows the needs of the people in your area and most impt, it will hinder those potential MP to use the election win as a stepping stone to further their career because GRC is a almost sure win.<br><br>citizens like us can also make a difference with your piece of paper come election day</div>
