If according what one of you had said, there 30<br>% to 40% voting for oppositions, then you could expect more MPs of the oppositions to be in parliments.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

To improve on the coverage of the non-ruling parties, they might wanted to take the initiative to talk to local reporter and photographer for more coverage if resource is there. They may also invite the reporters to be a part of their campaign to improve on their good publicities. I think reporters will be glad to be invited too.<br><br>It will be the interests and the operating guideline of the local press to decide what they wanted to do with it for commercial or social values. However, the non-ruling parties may keep a proper records of their activities, campaign and even ideas proposed in case they are interested to follow up with the local press later.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I had seen election in UK which had an more opened climates, with difference papers (Daily Mirror, Sun, Times, The Thremes, and so on..etc) giving coverage for various parties for the interest of difference readers.
