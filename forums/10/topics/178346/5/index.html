            <div class='col-md body'>Personally how I felt........PAP should keep up with their effort in convincing voters to give more votes to them of their concerted effort that had been putting in building of singapore and giving better lives in future to come.  But........as professionals in PAP, I think they should not despising the oppositions in that manner.  Instead, PAP should tell, show and prove how genuine they are to help those people that are fallen behind.   But todate...I haven't seen any genuine help to the lower income people or the unemployment of the ageing populations.  They rather bring in new blood from overseas. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br><strong>Why I say that...<span class="large"><span style="color: red;">One example</span></span>....in many ways they can help by lowering the rates of utilities charges to people whom live in different types of housing.</strong>   Of course...if you tell LKY about this..he will suppress you down first before you could urgue further.</div>
