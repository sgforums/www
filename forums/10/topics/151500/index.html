            <div class='col-md body'>Activist files complaint against national broadcaster<br><br>Agence France Presse<br>September 2, 2005<br>SINGAPORE<br><br>A SINGAPOREAN activist has filed a police complaint against national broadcaster MediaCorp for allegedly violating the island's Films Act banning political advertising using film or video.<br><br>The complaint, filed by Yap Keng Ho, accuses MediaCorp of screening two programs about ruling People's Action Party leaders and is meant as a protest against Singapore's stringent censorship, Yap said.<br><br>Yap told AFP Friday, Sept 2, he wanted to expose a pro-ruling party bias in the legislation banning political films with his complaint, which comes as police investigate independent Singaporean film maker Martyn See for making a documentary about an opposition leader.<br><br>The Films Act bans political advertising using films or videos, as well as movies directed towards any political end such as promoting parties.<br><br>"I feel that it is a very unfair and biased legislation," Yap, a 44-year-old information technology consultant, told AFP. "I want to show the world whether law enforcement (in Singapore) is going to be fair or not."<br><br>Yap's complaint alleges that MediaCorp had violated the Films Act by screening two programs in 2002 and this year featuring Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew and his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, respectively.<br><br>A spokesman for the Singapore police confirmed they received the complaint "and are currently making the necessary checks with the Media Development Authority (MDA)."<br><br>A spokesman for MediaCorp said they were unaware of Yap's complaint.<br><br>On Monday, filmmaker See surrendered to police his camera and remaining tapes of the documentary "Singapore Rebel" about Chee Soon Juan, secretary-general of the opposition Singapore Democratic Party.<br><br>Chee, the most vocal opposition politician in Singapore, is facing bankruptcy after the High Court ordered him to pay S$500,000 (US$300,000) for defaming PAP leaders.<br><br>Affluent Singapore has often been criticised by human rights groups for maintaining strict political controls despite its rapid modernisation since becoming a republic 40 years ago last month. Singapore has been ruled by the PAP since independence.<br>----<br><br>Sounds fair enough to me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is our Judicial System flawed when handling cases brought up by the Ruling Party a.k.a the Singapore Government against those who opposed them ?<br><br>LKY had also lost in another legal tussle between him and Jeyaratnam, when Jeyaratnam appealed against the unlawful conviction of charges of accounting misappropriation brought against him and the Worker's Party.<br><br>LKY had challenged Jeyaratnam that if the Privy Council in UK can find the judicial process to be wrong, LKY will plead on Jeya's behalf for a Presidential pardon.<br><br>The Privy Council did find the High Court decision to be wronged, and upheld the earlier decision of the District Court Judge to be correct in initially throwing out the charges by the Singapore Government.<br><br>For his decision, the District Court Judge - Mr Michael Khoo - was demoted from the District Court, and made a Deputy Public Prosecutor in the Attorney General Chambers.<br><br>For their decision, the Privy Council was no longer made the Last Court of Appeal for the Singapore Legal Process - when it was so proudly touted in the beginning, that the Privy Council will serve as a benchmark to judge the standards of the Singapore Judiciary System.<br><br>LKY claimed that the Privy Council was wrong in making their views that included the criminal aspects of the judgment, which was not part of the scope of the review by the Privy Council - (the Privy Council had expressed that both charges against Jeyaratnam were wrong in Law, and the convictions were necessarily wrong ) .<br><br><strong>Extract from the following referenced site:</strong><br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw01/010720ai.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw01/010720ai.htm</a><br><br>Following his re-election in 1984, J B Jeyaretnam was charged for alleged financial impropriety related to the collection of party funds.<br><br><strong>In 1986 he was acquitted by a District Court of all charges save one.</strong><br><br>The prosecution appealed the acquittal and the then Chief Justice allowed the appeal, with the direction that a re-trial be heard by a District Court.<br><br>At re-trial JB Jeyaretnam was found guilty and sentenced to three months in jail, which was reduced by the High Court but with the addition of a S$5000 fine. The imposition of a fine of over S$2000 resulted in the automatic disqualification of JB Jeyaretnam as a member of parliament and the conviction also triggered a Law Society hearing that resulted in him being disbarred.<br><br>JB Jeyaretnam's earlier application for the re-trial to be heard before the High Court rather than a District Court, which would have allowed any subsequent appeal to be pursued up to Singapore's then highest court, the Privy Council located in London, had been refused.<br><br>After his conviction his appeal to the Privy Council was limited to consideration of his disbarment.<br><br>In its judgement the Privy Council concluded that JB Jeyaretnam and a co-accused had been <strong>"<span style="color: blue;">fined, imprisoned, and publicly disgraced for offences for which they were</span> <span style="color: red;">not guilty</span>"</strong> and directed the Law Society to reinstate JB Jeyaretnam.<br><br>The government refused to heed the Privy Council's advice to facilitate a pardon for JB Jeyaretnam on the grounds that the criminal convictions had not been the subject of the Privy Council appeal.<br><br>JB Jeyaretnam was subsequently re-instated as a lawyer, but prevented from standing again for election until 1997, when he ran and was returned as a non-constituency member of parliament.<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkred;">The Politics of Judicial Institutions in Singapore</span></strong><br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/1028judi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/1028judi.htm</a><br></div>
