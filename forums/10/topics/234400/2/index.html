It's good to stand infront of a mirror to look at oneself before criticizing others. Can't blame the PRCs for failing their English, they have a different educational curriculum compared to ours, likewise an Indonesian, Japanese, Russian, African, etc will not be as good when conversing in English. If you think that you are superior to them, you should try picking up Japanese, Russian, Latin, etc and try excelling in that.<br><br>All your analysis is narrow in perspective, you live in your secluded world and make distorted analysis of the world, you fail to recognize and appreciate the differences between races.<br><br>Live and Let Live.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The root of the problem is that Australia (and the UK) have commercialized their undergraduate education system as far as accepting international students is concerned. The point is not about training students to be qualified members in the professional or academic world. It is about maximally getting their money by accepting as many students as possible. Except for first rate schools, I've always found Australia and UK to be crappy places to study in.</div>
