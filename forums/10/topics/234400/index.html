"I've done a lot of interviews with employers, and we've all reached the same conclusion: no matter what their work ethic, (the students) are not equipped for professional-level work in Australia."<br><br>He said some Australian universities offered courses, particularly in accounting and computing, designed to require minimal English. Students in other courses coped using means ranging from "tutorial help to outright plagiarism".<br><br>The level of English required to gain an Australian visa varies. Applicants for a higher-education student visa must score at band-six level, rated as "competent", under the International English Language Testing System, if based overseas when they apply.<br><br><strong>But international applicants can avoid the testing by basing themselves in Australia earlier to complete either year 12 or an intensive language course. Dr Birrell found that about 40 per cent of overseas students followed this path.</strong><br><br>Students wanting a permanent residency visa sit the<strong> IELTS after graduating but need to score at only band five, which reflects a "partial com- mand of the language Â… likely to make many mistakes".</strong><br><br>Dr Birrell found slightly more than a third of applicants reached band five, but not band six. He called on the Government to lift the minimum English standard for permanent residency to the same needed to go to university.<br><br>The number of overseas students at Australian universities surged by about 40 per cent in the first half of the decade, mostly in business and management.<br><br>This followed the Government's relaxing of entry laws for skilled migrants, and universities and TAFEs launching campaigns to recruit more international students. Universities have become increasingly reliant on upfront fees from foreigners.<br><br>Universities and TAFEs do not independently test the English levels of students before they start study, but Dr Birrell said this should change.<br><br>"This is an appropriate juncture for universities to ensure that the students they enrol are actually equipped to undertake tertiary-level training," he said.<br><br>Professor Gerard Sutton, the president of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, said it was possible the students who had failed to reach a band-six score had scored poorly in the speaking component of the test, which may not have been a critical skill in the course they were taking.<br><br>"I don't accept that there's a problem in universities in terms of soft marking of international students," Professor Sutton said.<br>With HARRIET ALEXANDER</blockquote>2.What is the passing rate of SG graduates?<br><br>3.Is it wise to send kids to overseas to study and their English<br>still not up to standard after graduated?</div>

So much so that they can't string a coherent english sentence together? o.0  Singaporean students may not speak or write perfect english, but I find they're still way ahead of most other SE Asian students.
