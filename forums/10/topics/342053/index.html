              <p>This morning while having breakfast with my parents, I heard the most ridiclous activities organise by the RC.</p>
              <p>The RC have as my parents to do spring cleaning at the RC office because they have no money to employ cleaners for it. My parents are over 60 yrs old, even I their son do not dared ask them to do spring cleaning in our flats. How dare the RC ask them to do this? Imagine seeing your old parents climb up the ladder to clean ceiling, I feel real angish when I heard about this. I discourage my parents to go but they insist on going due to peer pressure. I feel like going to the RC to beatup the idiotic chairman, is this the leadership that the government trying to build up at the grassroot level?</p>
              <p>Is this the supposing Healthy activities that the RC organise for senior citizen? What happen if these senior citizen fall and injured themselve? Will the RC bared the medical expenses?</p>
              <p>It is really very sad to see this happen in Singapore, respecting the elderly is an very important part of the asian culture and it seems to me that $$$ is more important then these elderly that had contributed to the success of building Singapore.</p>

              a club is there for its members to enjoy life. 
              
              if I'm one of those senior citizens, I would never do spring cleaning. those organisations always like to ask people to do free labour in the name of "team-building", "charity", "karma".
              
              fortunately, I don't buy those crap.

              <p>I hope that the thread starter can consolidate the necessary information and feedback to the MP during the meet the people session.</p>
              <p>If the MP refused to act on the issue, please write to the press.</p>
              <p>The RC have obviously exploited the residents in asking them to perform the spring cleaning.</p>
              <p>The RC owed the thread starter a proper explanation on why his parent is being tasked to perform the cleaning.</p>
              <p>The citizens of singapore have duly submitted the town council fees every month.</p>
              <p>The reason of no budget is not acceptable.</p>

              see, join those RC clubs for "social life", you ended up being a free labourer!!
              
              When I'm old, I rather enjoy life myself than to join what clubs and what nots.
              
              no money to pay workers for springcleaning? Another suggestion: Ask the MP to pay, he is so rich, draw such high salary. why MP cannot pay???

              <p>I do not want to bring the matter up to the MP as these people are staying near me, I am seeing them when I goto the copitiam or so.  I dont want to be force to move away from a place I stay for 20yrs becos pple have become unfreindly due to this.</p>
              <p>I believe this is just some bad RC Chairman that is trying to perform and show that they help the gov to save $$$ so they can get medals during national days.</p>
              <p>I started this topic becos of my anger and since my parents have came back in one piece, I dont feel like escalating the issues.</p>
              <p>However, take this a as a feedback on whats is happening at the grassroot level. How good is the leadership here, what are the objective of these pple. (trying to become MP?)</p>

              <p>If you condone a wrong act out of fear, then there is nothing to feedback about.</p>
              <p>But, please take into serious consideration that if any of senior citizens are injured during the process, there will not be any medical compensation.</p>
              <p>The money saving effort is done to boot lick or there was a serious mis-use of public funds ?</p>

              <p>We would appreciate it if you could come down to the RC office and see for yourself the activities the members and seniors citizens partake before you comment in sgForums. Please also don't imagine senior citizens climbing ladders, and cleaning ceilings, and falling down. We have younger members, who will do the serious stuff.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you could also volunteer your services and help oversee the activities, and also offer your valuable expertise to the RC members instead of complaining online.</p>
