              <p><strong>Travel Biz Monitor, 10 Jul 2009</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Travel agents ‘sell away’ from zero commission to offer full support to national carriers trying to bail out with help of GoI </strong></span><br> <br> According to a press release from Travel Agents Federation of India
              (TAFI), with the ongoing fight on the zero commission issue between the
              travel agents fraternity and Singapore Airlines (SIA) not resulting in
              any solutions,<br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>in a major show of solidarity most travel agents across India have now refused to sell tickets for SIA. </strong></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The
              matter had also been taken up by the Directorate General of Civil
              Aviation (DGCA), which in turn had issued an ultimatum to SIA and other
              airlines which have abolished commission to explain the rationale
              behind their actions.<br> </strong></span> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>On the other hand airlines like Jet Airways,
              Kingfisher Airlines and Air India have come out in support of the
              travel federations and have re-instated their commissions. Moreover,
              airlines from Hong Kong and China are also espousing the agents cause. </strong></span>In
              a recent development travel agents have thus decided to sell away from
              foreign carriers as the agent-airline relationship seems to have been
              struck at its root. They will henceforth promote Indian carriers like
              Air India, who are trying to bail themselves out with help from the
              Government of India (GoI). The travel agents community has decided to
              support the national carriers.<br> <br> “Discussions are on with senior officials of the national carriers and
              the CMD of Air India has been most pro-active in his approach and has
              expressed his willingness to consider any constructive proposal from
              the travel agents which will help Air India to improve its bottomline,”
              said Pradip Lulla, President, Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI).
              In a reciprocal gesture, the travel agents have been rooting for a
              bailout package for airlines, particularly Air India, hit by the global
              economic downturn. <span style="color: red;"><strong>“It
              is downright unacceptable for foreign carriers who enter our country to
              hike their profits, exploit the local parties involved and dictate
              terms to them.</strong></span> We won’t stand for it. Rather, we’ll do business with Indian carriers now,” added Lulla.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>“It is heartening to note that the
              DGCA has taken cognizance of the mater and has directed the foreign
              airlines to adhere to the law of the land. We are not asking for a
              bailout, merely a protection of our basic right to livelihood,”</strong></span> stated Ajay Prakash, National General Secretary, TAFI.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Compared to the first two quarters
              of 2008, SIA has registered a 72.5 per cent fall in ticket sales in
              2009. Though it is partly because of the global slump, withdrawal of
              agents’ support has also contributed considerably towards this
              unfavorable trend. At the same time, others like Thai Airlines have
              fortunately benefited from the feud. They are now the leading carriers
              from India for flights bound to South East Asia and Australia. Also,
              Cathay Pacific Airlines now lead in ticket sales to the US especially
              sectors to San Francisco Airport (SFO) and Los Angeles (LA) as
              Singapore Airlines sees its revenues on this route whittling down to a
              two per cent vis-à-vis 2008.</strong></span><br> <br> ------------------------<br> <br> <strong>Latest @ <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.

              <p>When the CEO is paid $120,000 monthly - a 10 percent cut is only $12,000 - they still take home $108,000.</p>
              <p>When the an average worker gets a paycheck of $3,000 - a 10 percent paycut is $300 - and after the CPF cut of another 20 percent - the take home pay is $2,160.</p>
              <p>When an Agent's revenue is based on 2 percent from every ticket sold - the revenue from a ticket that is worth $3,000 will generate only $60 for the agent.</p>
              <p>For the Agent, every cent that contributes to their revenue will help pay for the overheads incurred in rent, utilities, wages, and ancilliary operating costs.</p>
