              Most people don't know abt the subsidies because it is very insignificant.  Malays have no need to pay school fees, which are only a few dollars a month. But we do pay misc fees. For poly and uni, will be subsidised by Mendaki, and mendaki funds are donated by Malay/Muslims people.

              <p><strong>As refer to by Angel7030 that Mr nobody from UN....</strong></p>
              <p>a paragraph of what he highlight some of the issued in Singapore....</p>
              <p>There exist several legislative provisions which prohibit the promotion of feelings of "enmity", "ill-will" or "hostility" between members of the different ethnic groups in Singapore. It appears that these restrictions aim to frame and limit any public debate or discourse on an issue considered as highly sensitive. Given Singapore's historical legacy, the concerns of the authorities with regard to ethnic conflicts are understandable. However, it is absolutely necessary in a free society that restrictions on public debate or discourse and the protection of racial harmony are not implemented at the detriment of fundamental human rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. Many interlocutors assured me that Singaporean society had evolved substantially from the days of the violent confrontations 45 years ago, so as to have open public debate on a sensitive issue like ethnicity in a dispassionate and fruitful manner. I therefore believe that time is ripe for the authorities to review any legislative restrictions that may exist in the statute books in order to allow Singaporeans to share their views on matters of ethnicity, to identify potential issues of discomfort and above all, work together to find solutions.</p>

              <p>There exist several legislative provisions which prohibit the promotion of feelings of "enmity", "ill-will" or "hostility" between members of the different ethnic groups in Singapore. It appears that these restrictions aim to frame and limit any public debate or discourse on an issue considered as highly sensitive. Given Singapore's historical legacy, the concerns of the authorities with regard to ethnic conflicts are understandable. However, it is absolutely necessary in a free society that restrictions on public debate or discourse and the protection of racial harmony are not implemented at the detriment of fundamental human rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. Many interlocutors assured me that Singaporean society had evolved substantially from the days of the violent confrontations 45 years ago, so as to have open public debate on a sensitive issue like ethnicity in a dispassionate and fruitful manner. I therefore believe that time is ripe for the authorities to review any legislative restrictions that may exist in the statute books in order to allow Singaporeans to share their views on matters of ethnicity, to identify potential issues of discomfort and above all, work together to find solutions.</p>

              <p>I do disagree with some local not welcoming we, the foreigners to your land, i mean who will welcome a stranger to his house?? but bear in mind, we dun come in without any invitation, and that is what exactly is happening in Singapore, your govt goes around the world, set up road shows to welcome peoples to Singapore, road shows with mini esplanade, IR, merlion toys to give away and videos of warmth and caring Singaporeans toward foreigners who are said to come and help Singapore society and economy. But when a foreigner sign up and arrive here with all his/her asset sold in China or taiwan, bring along lots of cash and buy a 4 rooms HDB flat in hoping to contribute and produce our decendants for Singapore. The locals are not welcoming us, it is total different from the Videos show by your govt during their roadshows promotion of SINGAPORE.</p>
              <p>So, in conclusion, the Govt of Singapore failed to understand the sentiment of it own peoples, on the other hands, the citizens of Singapore failed to comprehend the work that the govt is doing for them. In another words, is a mismatch</p>

              <p>It is normal to think that Singapore is religiously and racially in harmony. Not entirely wrong, coz after all we havent had racial riots since 1960s.

              <p>They complained to me about the lowering of MT Weightage marks. more often than not, Malay students score the most marks in malay language and lesser in english/math/science. If the MT weightage is lowered, then Malays would lose out the most. Malays also mostly speak their own MT at home, which gives them more exposure to it, unlike Chinese and Indians.</p>
              <p>It is funny how ST talks about malays who migrate to overseas are coming back due to not being able to get used to the conditions there. but they don't talk about why malays go overseas in the first place.</p>
              <p>Malays, to me, are the best of friends. they're the most friendly, the most understanding and kind. they are great guitar companions and soccer teamates. It is sad that the govt has spent very little effort into helping them both financially and socially.</p>
              <p>I think LKY, being a Confucian and a great fan of China, tried to push Singaporeans towards a more Chinese Cultural influence, because of its morals such as 'obeying authority, filial piety, elitism'. To him, the weakest link of the country in terms of its culture are the Malay people.Malays are the weakest race financially, and contribute less to the economy (that the govt ranks as the most important over anything else) than the other races. being a minority, they also do not have much say and are therefore not a threat to his rule.</p>

              <p>Face value has a high standing in the Malay culture. Being easily pacified is another habit. I dont see any Malay/Muslim MP pushing this issue broadly or doing on the ground work on how to tackle issues such as teenage pregnancy, school dropouts etc. All they do is make a statement on how disappointed he or she is on the current situation. but do nothing at all. End of the day the Malay community do not get who they want to represent them. They get all the yes-man like the rest of us Chinese or Indians.</p>
              <p>The same can be said for the uneducated NSF of any race not only Malays. Mixed with other guys from different backgrounds and education levels, they tend to be surlish and rude. If you treat them as uneducated fellas, then you get uneducated response. Treat them the same as anyone else and they  tend to respond positively and in fact loyally then the educated group who tend to think for themselves more than as a group.</p>

              <p>Yes this might seem to be a small matter, or one that is too sensitive to be discussed (by Angel7030). </p>
              <p>It is normal to think that Singapore is religiously and racially in harmony. Not entirely wrong, coz after all we havent had racial riots since 1960s. But i have many many malay friends/schoolmates/classmates who are really quite disturbed by certain govt policies meted out to them and their parents. However, they don't say it loud coz they're ashamed to talk about it. </p>
              <p>They complained to me about the lowering of MT Weightage marks. more often than not, Malay students score the most marks in malay language and lesser in english/math/science. If the MT weightage is lowered, then Malays would lose out the most. Malays also mostly speak their own MT at home, which gives them more exposure to it, unlike Chinese and Indians.</p>
              <p>It is funny how ST talks about malays who migrate to overseas are coming back due to not being able to get used to the conditions there. but they don't talk about why malays go overseas in the first place.</p>
              <p>Malays, to me, are the best of friends. they're the most friendly, the most understanding and kind. they are great guitar companions and soccer teamates. It is sad that the govt has spent very little effort into helping them both financially and socially.</p>
              <p>I think LKY, being a Confucian and a great fan of China, tried to push Singaporeans towards a more Chinese Cultural influence, because of its morals such as 'obeying authority, filial piety, elitism'. To him, the weakest link of the country in terms of its culture are the Malay people.Malays are the weakest race financially, and contribute less to the economy (that the govt ranks as the most important over anything else) than the other races. being a minority, they also do not have much say and are therefore not a threat to his rule.</p>

              <p>The exposure of Singapore for foreign talents by placing singapore expo in top China cities already tell you alot of stories. Not mean to be sensitive to any race here, the minortiy group, ie the Malays are producing more than any other races here, its a blessing to Singapore and to Islam teaching. Therefore, Govt foreseen a reduction of other races in near future, and this races are mostly the elites and brainchild of this country. So, to the govt, that is threading on dangerous water if something is not done. On the other hand, the other races are not producing, given so much incentives in rebates, tax relief, babies bonus etc etc, govt see no progress for the past 10 years. And that worrying them.</p>
              <p>"We have tried all our resources and ideas to promote the birthrate of this country, however, beside the Malays, which also reducing in a sense, we see no improvement, and in fact, detoriation in the birthrate statistics of all other races, and especially so, the Chinese. We can blame it on our economy progression, our education, our earlier 2 is enuf policies, our workalcholic society created, our preferances on singlehood life etc etc..but if you dun produce, that is the end of Singapore</p>
              <p>And since the citizens are not producing, we have no choice but to take and pick from the outside, this is not something you can build or plant like industrial and farm, there is no 2 or 3 ways to this problem,  it is something which no one can control, and when we start to take in from the outside, be prepare and bear yourself for a culture shock and a racial discontention."</p>
