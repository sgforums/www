            <div class='col-md body'>Like the issue of ministers' pay, if there is going to be any comparison, comparison should be fair and above board and should have been benchmarked against the wage or remuneration and not the capitalist or boss categories.<br><br>There has been a fundamental error in the way ministers have made comparison of their pays with those of CEOs or successful entrepreneurs in the private sector.<br><br>Similary, if Singaporeans indeed must expand overseas and go regional there has to be certain accountable and transparent guidelines and principle.<br><br>If government must use the public taxes to invest them in overseas projects, like Shin Corp, Global Crossing or Bangalore, or Russian Townships, ministers must exercise great care to make sure that it will not result in huge losses as has happened in Shin Corp.<br><br>No companies or governments in this world will ever retain the services of any of their CEOs or managers who have caused such huge losses and yet go on to promote them in higher offices or grant them bonuses after such disastrous records.<br><br>So something is seriously wrong in the present investments of public taxes in overseas project. There will be more losses and disasters if there is no action taken to redress such huge losses.<br><br>Moreover a policy should be implemented to benefit all or majority of citizens. If such foreign investments should benefit only the government in hoarding surpluses to look good and give more bonuses to their own MPs, ministers and civil servants, the country will not gain the support of the people.<br><br>For the past 41 years, the government only governs to tax and recover all costs to the fullest degree even by way of creative accounting, double-charging on lands or rentals on public buildings or transport or utilities.<br><br>There has been a lack of accountability and transparency in the running of the government so far in public taxpayers' investments overseas.<br><br>There has to be clear policy to benefit the people in such areas of government. If there is none, and everything has to depend on summary statements of ministers or insight or foresight of leaders, there is no point to go on investing their tax monies in such overseas projects.<br><br>If government must practise avoidance of welfarism, fine. Then if such a policy is adopted, then government must take care not to over-tax and recover all costs. It should try to let citizens survive on their own economic competitiveness and not jeoparidize their retirements or medicare. The principle in a non-welfare state should be spelt out - if government does not help its people in creating jobs or social and cultural benefits then don't over tax and squeeze them dry.<br><br>But Singapore seems to have gone to the other extreme of taxing the citizens fully such as double charges on land or triple charges on vehicles and recovering all costs of essential services against the people by corporatization of such services to give them excuses in increasing fees and charges.<br><br>In a welfare state, government has the right to tax and recover all costs to pay for welfare. In a anti-welfare state like Singapore, its government spends only the minimum on citizens so there is no justification on principle or facts to charge the citizens more than nominal administrative fees.<br><br>In a non-welfare state, it would be immoral then for the government to refuse to help the citizens to keep increasing taxes and recovering all essential expenditures as Singapore has done and has been doing.<br><br>Let the comparison be fair if Singapore ministers want to quote welfarism as the excuse for its policy of not helping citizens in times of crisis.<br><br>It surely cannot have the cake and eat it. It is now enjoying all the benefits of not having to help its citizens and at the same time accumulating all the taxes into surpluses and reserving all rights to squeeze the citizens through all forms of taxes, direct, indirect and using excuses of all kinds to get them to pay.<br><br>So think again if anyone wants to talk about the danger of welfarism as practised in Australia, UK, Europe. We are certainly not having a welfare state but we may be producing a monster of government which keeps increasing its own surpluses while not lifting a finger to help them and squeezing them dry.<br><br>Even if we need to recover some costs the govenment should first only be entitled to recover only the consumption items but it has reserved its fullest right to recover any costs it likes until the citizens cannot survive resulting in so many family problems now ...suicides, low child birth, migrations, family disharmony, divorces etc.<br><br></div>
