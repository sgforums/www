              <p>Investors at Speakers' Corner (photo by Reuters)</p>
              </div>
              <p>About 600 investors in Lehman-linked derivatives held a public meeting in
              Singapore on Saturday to protest about the way banks sold them the
              investment products and to discuss ways to get compensation.<br><br>Held
              at Speakers' Corner, the only outdoor area in the city-state where
              public meetings can be held without a permit, the crowd included
              several people who were sold products in July, when there were already
              concerns about Lehman's health.<br> <br>"They never told me the issuer was Lehman and I told the manager I
              was afraid of American banks," said Lin Ling, who bought S$60,000
              ($40,900) worth of Lehman-linked "Minibonds" from a Singapore finance
              firm that had marketed the structured notes as a safe alternative to
              fixed deposits.<br><br>Public protests are rare in Singapore.<br><br>Lin
              said she was persuaded to buy the notes when she went to renew a fixed
              deposit account. She and other investors showed Reuters brochures
              printed by the finance company which did not say the products were
              structured by Lehman.<br><br>A few elderly investors broke into tears saying they had lost a large portion of their retirement savings.<br><br>"I
              didn't know it's Lehman. There's no Chinese explanation," said a lady
              in her 60s who identified herself as Madam Lee. "I don't want interest,
              I just want my deposit back."<br><br>Investors in Hong Kong, Singapore
              and Indonesia have over the past month complained the bond-like
              products they purchased from banks were actually complex derivatives
              and that they stood to lose most or all of what they had invested. <br><br>Both
              Singapore and Hong Kong have rules that say banks must ensure that
              clients purchase investment products that were consistent with their
              needs and risk profiles.<br><br>The products included Minibonds which
              were sold in Hong Kong and Singapore and DBS Group's High Notes 5
              series, which would lose most of their value should anyone of eight
              underlying firms, including Lehman, go bankrupt.<br><br>These structured notes offered modest returns of between 4 and 6 percent per annum.<br><br>The
              Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said about 9,700 people had
              bought Lehman-linked structured notes worth over S$500 million. Hong
              Kong authorities meanwhile said they have received more than 7,000
              complaints from investors alleging banks improperly sold them
              Lehman-related investment products.<br><br>MAS has said that while it
              can impose fines and suspend the licenses of financial institutions
              found to be in breach of its rules, it does not have the power to order
              banks to compensate investors.<br><br>According to Tan Kin Lian, one of
              the protest organisers, Saturday's gathering was to allow investors to
              meet and organise themselves so that they could get take collective
              action against the sellers or petition their Members of Parliament.</p>

              <p>If only Opposition could have such rallying power. sigh...</p>
              <p>Its strange.</p>
              <p>TOC organized events at HLP seems effective (they get ST reporters interview and report on them in MSM, can see ST reporters mingling with TOC people at the RALLY, TOC people invited to appear on CNA BlogTV and PRIMETIME Morning etc....) while last time chee did was just to do a peace march and based on the vid uploaded in youtube, it showed that it was very difficult for Chee to organise anything. Yes, ANYTHING .</p>
              <p>WP, what have u been doing?</p>
              <p>Cycling also cannot?</p>
              <p>So what are you Opposition guys up to?</p>
              <p>Wait for christmas and then hope for win in next election?</p>
              <p>These are questions. Questions based on extreme disappointment.</p>
              <p>Some people able to create competition in private sector like create telcos to compete with each other so that can say there is competition.</p>
              <p>I wonder can they also .... ?</p>

              <p>If only Opposition could have such rallying power. sigh...</p>
              <p>Its strange.</p>
              <p>TOC organized events at HLP seems effective (they get ST
              reporters interview and report on them in MSM, can see ST reporters
              mingling with TOC people at the RALLY, TOC people invited to appear
              on CNA BlogTV and PRIMETIME Morning etc....) while last time chee
              did was just to do a peace march and based on the vid uploaded
              in youtube, it showed that it was very difficult for Chee to
              organise anything. Yes, ANYTHING .</p>
              <p>WP, what have u been doing?</p>
              <p>Cycling also cannot?</p>
              <p>So what are you Opposition guys up to?</p>
              <p>Wait for christmas and then hope for win in next election?</p>
              <p>These are questions. Questions based on extreme
              disappointment.</p>
              <p>Some people able to create competition in private sector like
              create telcos to compete with each other so that can say there is
              competition.</p>
              <p>I wonder can they also .... ?</p>

              <p>Haiz, you pointed out a very important thing here. That point is the same point that alot of ppl knows and have always been trying to explain why the opposition's voice have always been muffled. Do you think CSJ would have been able to successful hold a public meeting like that without police intervening? Even holding a dinner at hotels ballroom there would be police all round interfering. Why is it that the opposition never get new converage like this public meeting? I think you will understand........</p>

              <p>And since when did the opposition really address the issue of what solution should be given to resolve such issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Come on, the oppostion should show us what they want to do as the government, not just the people running a consistuency...we want a opp that can lead the whole of singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only real opposition party that wants to be the government, and actually give us something concrete in their planning is the Worker's party.</p>

              <p>Please go youtude or google to do some searches, it has always been like this. Even now. It has never change. Although sg law states a gathering of 5 is considered illegal gathering, when speeches were done in 4s, they were rounded up saying any gathering that might harm internal security is considered illegal. The magic is not in the number 5.</p>
