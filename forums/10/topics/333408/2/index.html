              <p>1. TOC and Tan kin lian are not the opposition parties like Ah Pak has mentioned, so they have no reason to interupt but i can reasure you if they had been talking about opposition awareness or rallies anything in regards to that they will definitely be stopped.

              speeches were done in 4s, they were rounded up saying any gathering
              that might harm internal security is considered illegal. The magic

              <p>As mei mei said earlier, nobody put a damn gun in yr head to buy an investment product. You can alway opts not to buy after eating their free buffets, coffees and teas. This is economy is driven by a free market condition, you cannot blame the sale person, he can talks hell and heaven just to get you to buy the products. And most importantly, when you bought the product, your greed is the 5% interest gain, the greater the gain, the riskier is the game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In every economy downturn, someone somewhere somehow is going to get burnt more serious than others. We can be pity to those old Uncles and Aunties having lost their so call whole life saving, but pitiful is not the name of the game in investment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unless Political importance play a role in the investment, nothing is left.</p>

Unfortunately, buyers sign black and white. Whether the agent lied/misrepresented will be their words against the agents' words. Next time when I meet these agents, I bring recorder!</p></div>
