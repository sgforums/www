I don't see such a need. Since every industry and company is different, the government can't possibly cater to every industry and tie up with the different institutions to train the workers.<br><br>Only the industry and company themselves would know what skills set are necessary  and will be in a better position to judge.<br><br><blockquote>Providing aid to those who need it until they can be trained and placed in a job where they can provide for themselves.</blockquote>There's no welfare in Singapore. If the government is really to provide it, the burden on the citizens will be greater. There's also a what if. What if they can't be bothered to find a job and get themselves trained for it? The risk too big, especially for a non-welfare state like us.<br><br><blockquote>A grading system can be implemented to monitor how well the less able people are able to perform their jobs after placement.

Being less able-bodied doesn't mean one can't do a job. If an elderly able-bodied person is able to get train and get a job and paid 100% while in training, why can't it be the same for the disabled?<br><br>Assuming my above paragraph is rubbish and that this system is applied to everybody who wants to receive training after getting a job, I feel that it is carried out too far.<br><br>Since the private sector doesn't want to hire them because of certain biasness, having this system further shows how immature the government is.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The aim is to take what the private sector considers as "less able" and turn them into productive, contributing citizens for singapore.  Essentially teaching or giving opportunities for these people to provide for themselves and at the same time benefiting the government with their pool of talent.
