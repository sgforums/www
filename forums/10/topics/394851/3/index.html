              <p>LKY cannot afford to have CSJ, or JBJ, or Francis Seow, or Tang Liang Hong to succeed in getting into the Singapore Parliament - as he know that LHL is not capable nor has the health to handle the robust politics in Parliament.</p>

              <p>How do you think LHL learnt to say that "he need to spend time to fix the opposition" if any get elected into Parliament ?</p>

              <p>Uncle,</p>
              <p>Do u fully the meaning of karma before u using it?? As i said many times, a good politician is one who can deal with his opposite, ruling is simple, any tom and dick like you can rule a family, but to stay in power, u need to deal with your opposite and that is a skilful politician, nothing to do with karma, if the opposition fails to see what is coming and how to go about it, ending up in jail, rotan or life sentencing without trial, that is a karma to them. Aren't oppositions going into politic also have greed, hatre, anger, dissatisfaction and revengefulness in their mind, the result is bad karma will happen to them.</p>

              <p><br>Dr Chee is not a doctorate - but he certainly has a doctorate qualification, with his field of study being in Psychology - which is not necessarily about the "brain" that can only be a specialty field of Psychiatry.</p>
              <p>Do you know the difference between Psychology and Psychiatry ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if you can be shrewd - can you outsmart LKY when he is determined in his acts to exterminate you ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was only after CSJ's first election against GCT - that LKY had seen CSJ as an obvious and serious threat, when he considered CSJ's age bringing CSJ on a parallel trajectory which will surely cross the path that LKY had planned for LHL.</p>
              <p>Throughout the 1990s - LKY was sweeping the path clear of all obstacles that will pose any threat to the ascension of LHL to the Premier Seat - as anyone had seen throughout the 1990s, all the urgent acts of sheer aggression by LKY towards JBJ, Tang Liang Hong and Francis Seow.</p>
              <p>LKY's acts of political aggressions took on a very personal and ugly tone that is totally unbecoming of a Democracy that LKY had advocated when he was a member of the Opposition in the 1950s.</p>
              <p>It clearly showed the hypocrisy of one who welcomed the recognition as an Elder Statesman, which is relished when basking in the limelight of foreign attention, but has no qualms to unleash the raw power of an Autocrat to ensure the political safety of one's plans for the succession of one's progeny.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can one plan for one's own disqualification ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps you are showing your unique ability to plan for your own disqualification with this kind of obviously self-defeating arguments that you wish to propagate ?</p>

              <p>Do you know the difference between Psychology and Psychiatry ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if you can be shrewd - can you outsmart LKY when he is determined in his acts to exterminate you ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was only after CSJ's first election against GCT - that LKY had seen CSJ as an obvious and serious threat, when he considered CSJ's age bringing CSJ on a parallel trajectory which will surely cross the path that LKY had planned for LHL.</p>
              <p>Throughout the 1990s - LKY was sweeping the path clear of all obstacles that will pose any threat to the ascension of LHL to the Premier Seat - as anyone had seen throughout the 1990s, all the urgent acts of sheer aggression by LKY towards JBJ, Tang Liang Hong and Francis Seow.</p>
              <p>LKY's acts of political aggressions took on a very personal and ugly tone that is totally unbecoming of a Democracy that LKY had advocated when he was a member of the Opposition in the 1950s.</p>
              <p>It clearly showed the hypocrisy of one who welcomed the recognition as an Elder Statesman, which is relished when basking in the limelight of foreign attention, but has no qualms to unleash the raw power of an Autocrat to ensure the political safety of one's plans for the succession of one's progeny.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can one plan for one's own disqualification ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps you are showing your unique ability to plan for your own disqualification with this kind of obviously self-defeating arguments that you wish to propagate ?</p>

              <p><br>Personal Verbal Abuse - calling them political gangsters / liar ?</p>
              <p>Do you even know "who did what to whom" - or are you putting new details to faded memories on events that you come to know from what were printed in the PAP controlled print and broadcast medias ?</p>
              <p>Did CSJ call LKY and GCT political gangsters and liar at the same venue ?</p>
              <p>Were these words uttered by CSJ to both GCT and LKY at the same time during the 2001 election ?</p>
              <p>Could all three main characters be present at the same time as suggested in your posted statement - when it was only reported that CSJ had raised his voice at GCT - when both happened to be at the same venue campaigning ?</p>
              <p>Surely, you are not acting as a liar to embellish the past events with a new twist of lemon into your preferred cocktail of your concoction of PAP facts ?</p>
              <p>The truth of the ruckus that transpired was that - it was LKY who called CSJ a "political gangster" - when LKY saw the intimidaing Straits Times photograph showing a "non-too-photogenic" CSJ leaning forward while standing on a stool - to be seen over the crowd, and shouting out his question to GCT - in a very noisy and busy hawker centre setting that was excited to see two rival candidates at the same venue.</p>
              <p>The question asked by CSJ was a relevant question - "Where was our US$10 Billion" - which then PM GCT had publicly stated will be used - as Stand-by Credit - to bail out the Indonesian government of the late President Suharto during the 1997 financial melt-down that first spread like wild fire across Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>Was the word "liar" used at that confrontation ?</p>
              <p>Or has it not been typical of the PAP in creating "a lie" based on their own preferred interpretation of the event - to read more then the facts - so as to justify their own acts to persecute the targetted victim - (as had been used in the countless suits against JBJ, Francis Seow, Tang Liang Hong, as well as the many foreign news publications that reported the events in Singapore) ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the word "liar" had been used - can you be certain that the word "liar" has not been appropriately used - considering that the whole truth has seldom been told in all its entirety to Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Since when will LKY and his cronies hold themselves accountable to anyone - when they will not even be accountable to the Elected Presidency ?</p>
              <p>If you care enough to remember the saga between the late President-Elect Ong Teng Cheong vs LKY / GCT / PAP Government - when the PAP Government was not even prepared to reveal the entire truth of what Singapore assets can be for the President-Elect to guard with its second key - how much truth can be told to Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Almost nine years later, are Singaporeans being given the truth about the US$100 Billion that was lost by GIC and Temasek ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If any "political gangster" label was given - it surely did not come from CSJ - and is more likely to have come from LKY - who is articulate and creative in the art of character assassination.</p>
              <p>LKY did call JBJ, Francis Seow, Tang Liang Hong, James Gomez, Dr Lee Siew Choh with some very creative labels - "liar, charlatan, cheat, avarice, gangster, communist".</p>
              <p>Ironically, every label that he created for his political opponent seems to fit himself and his cronies too - as there were those in his rank that were found to be liars and cheats - some of whom have been tried in open court when they refused to step down quietly, others have absconded from justice, and at least one had preferred to kill himself.</p>
              <p>Sadly, the biggest gangster is LKY himself who claimed that he will wait for his political opponent at a <em>'cul-de-sac'</em> and will use knuckle-duster to fix things right.</p>
              <p>He is the one who claim that he is prepared to use the hatchet against anyone who will stand in his ways - and he has proven it on numerous occassions with the ISA as his hatchet to lock all those who will inconvenience his ambitious plans.</p>
              <p>After 53 years, with so many Singaporeans having been accused to be communist and locked up by the ISA, the real Communist remains in power applying the methods that Stalin had creatively used to establish a monolithic political party to rule over a pseudo-country based on extracted and refined Communist and Capitalist ideology.</p>

              to know from what were printed in the PAP controlled print and
              broadcast medias ?</p>
              <p>Did CSJ call LKY and GCT political gangsters and liar at the
              same venue ?</p>
              <p>Were these words uttered by CSJ to both GCT and LKY at the same
              time during the 2001 election ?</p>
              <p>Could all three main characters be present at the same
              time as suggested in your posted statement - when it was
              only reported that CSJ had raised his voice at GCT - when both
              happened to be at the same venue campaigning ?</p>
              <p>Surely, you are not acting as a liar to embellish the past
              events with a new twist of lemon into your preferred cocktail of
              your concoction of PAP facts ?</p>
              <p>The truth of the ruckus that transpired was that - it was
              LKY who called CSJ a "political gangster" - when LKY saw the
              intimidaing Straits Times photograph showing a "non-too-photogenic"
              CSJ leaning forward while standing on a stool - to be seen
              over the crowd, and shouting out his question to GCT - in a
              very noisy and busy hawker centre setting that was excited to see
              two rival candidates at the same venue.</p>
              <p>The question asked by CSJ was a relevant question - "Where
              was our US$10 Billion" - which then PM GCT had publicly
              stated will be used - as Stand-by Credit - to bail out the
              Indonesian government of the late President Suharto during the
              1997 financial melt-down that first spread like wild fire across
              Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>Was the word "liar" used at that confrontation ?</p>
              <p>Or has it not been typical of the PAP in creating "a lie" based
              on their own preferred interpretation of the event - to read more
              then the facts - so as to justify their own acts to persecute the
              targetted victim - (as had been used in the countless suits against
              JBJ, Francis Seow, Tang Liang Hong, as well as the many foreign
              news publications that reported the events in Singapore) ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the word "liar" had been used - can you be certain that the
              word "liar" has not been appropriately used - considering
              that the whole truth has seldom been told in all its
              entirety to Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Since when will LKY and his cronies hold
              themselves accountable to anyone - when they will
              not even be accountable to the Elected
              Presidency ?</p>
              <p>If you care enough to remember the saga between the late
              President-Elect Ong Teng Cheong vs LKY / GCT / PAP
              Government - when the PAP Government was not
              even prepared to reveal the entire truth of what Singapore assets
              can be for the President-Elect to guard with its second key - how
              much truth can be told to Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Almost nine years later, are Singaporeans being given the truth
              about the US$100 Billion that was lost by GIC and Temasek ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If any "political gangster" label was given - it surely did not
              come from CSJ - and is more likely to have come from LKY - who is
              articulate and creative in the art of character assassination.</p>
              <p>LKY did call JBJ, Francis Seow, Tang Liang Hong, James
              Gomez, Dr Lee Siew Choh with some very creative labels -
              "liar, charlatan, cheat, avarice, gangster, communist".</p>
              <p>Ironically, every label that he created for
              his political opponent seems to fit himself and his
              cronies too - as there were those in his rank that were
              found to be liars and cheats - some of whom have been tried in open
              court when they refused to step down quietly, others have absconded
              from justice, and at least one had preferred to kill himself.</p>
              <p>Sadly, the biggest gangster is LKY himself who claimed that he
              will wait for his political opponent at a <em>'cul-de-sac'</em> and
              will use knuckle-duster to fix things right.</p>
              <p>He is the one who claim that he is prepared to use the hatchet
              against anyone who will stand in his ways - and he has proven it on
              numerous occassions with the ISA as his hatchet to lock all those
              who will inconvenience his ambitious plans.</p>
              <p>After 53 years, with so many Singaporeans having been
              accused to be communist and locked up by the ISA, the real
              Communist remains in power applying the methods that Stalin
              had creatively used to establish a monolithic
              political party to rule over a pseudo-country based on
              extracted and refined Communist and Capitalist ideology.</p>

              <p><br>what ever happen to JBJ and Chee, they set the precedents for the younger opposition to follow, stop being too impulsive and dun just knock on the wall. Even the junior JB of RP also knows that he is not going to be head on with PAP as his father did, that was a lesson well learned.</p>
              <p>If opposition is to convince the public to sway toward them, they need to prove something in common, in the 50s and 60s, independency was the key in motivating PAP success, it is at that particular time, place and conditions, that the whole nation thinks as one, to get independent and oust the communist. Peoples on the street believe in it because they got nothing to loose, living in poor condition and jobless with everyday social unrest lead them to want to change for the better.</p>
              <p>But today, childrens got maid to order here and there, most got a roof on top of their head, go tour, shopping and eating like no tomorrow, get used to the ever prices increasing here and there, are they ready want a change. Frankly, they will tell you, please dun disrupt our good life here ya.</p>
