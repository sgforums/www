              <p>But whatever it is, we must analyze the facts given.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1:) Mdm Chiam said that those CEC were too proud of themselves, believing that they can win in the next GE and possibly forming their own government.</p>
              <p>Why? Because CST had such proud feeling, more or less.</p>
              <p>What? Evidence: Actually, I could say that the reason why 1991 was a huge success for the oppositions who won 4 SMCs and many near to win a seat (40% and above was common) , the highest record ever, was because apart of isolated incident such as Lady MP wiped her hands after shook her hands with a fishmonger or whatever "peasants", the disqualification of the late JBJ. Yes, because the last election prior to 1991 was 1988, which was a shocking election / sudden election / early election but not a by election where effectively bar JBJ from election, which the effect for JBJ's conviction will be ended after 1991/2. Thus, people are not happy with the fact that the ruling party is using such tricks to bar JBJ and vote for the oppositions.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can this be considered evidence, or simple speculation based on personal preferred interpretation of what events were then ? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>2:) It was more or less Chiam's fault for recruiting Chee in, because the very fact that the response from GCT, the then PM to public's anger, was to hold a by election in Marine Parade GRC, which was his consitiutency. GCT said that he will hold all the responsibilities should he lost his seat. However, the oppositions was not in united, and resulted into SDP wants to fight GCT, WP should have sent JBJ and his team to fight GCT, and 2 other smaller parties (NSP and SJP --- a more or less defunct party by now since most of the people had switched to SPP) also want to contest against GCT. Lol! This is why Chee is in, and created a lot of fuss. And, obviously, the reason for SDP to fight GCT is because should the WP wins, 1MP (Hougang -- won in 1991) + 4 MP from this GRC = 5MP from WP and the opposition leader's position is given to Low instead (Since SDP had 3 seats back then, Chiam is the official opposition leader). Anyway, it was Chiam's folly to create such a mess. It was his over confidence that led to his downfall since such effects was spreaded to the whole SDP.</p>

              <p>However, the above seemed to be critizing Chiam a lot, now let's look at why Dr Chee should be "Chee Bye Kia" or Dr Cheezy.</p>
              <p>1: A hunger strike is a hunger strike. It is not supposed to use Glucose to replenish body, except, possibly, water. While people can say this is a disgrace to himself, what is certain is that "CBK" is an iconic figure for SDP, people will naturally associate this with SDP, despite it was not SDP's protest against PAP but rather a personal retaliation against his senior on NUS. I think that a 16 year old boy can do better than him in this regards. (I got even tried to save $8 a day, by skipping lunch and dinner and even water, which the water was drank minimally, although I did have some milo ONLY at late night at home lol!)</p>

              <p>Before calling anyone a CBK - have you tried to survive on water -minus the glucose - for thirty days ?</p>
              <p>If you have not then you may wish to wear a tag by dropping the letter "K" and replacing it with a "M" - that will spell you accurately as another "CBM".</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>2: It seemed that CSJ is manipulating the CEC. If not why would the then vice chairman needs some "bodyguards" to block their members for observing the hearings? Neither is such acts a democratic act!</p>
              <p> </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Were you present at the event in 1993 - when the CEC was preventing members for observing the hearings, or are you simply depending on Mdm Chiam's version of what events were then ?</p>
              <p>It seems to be such an irony that CST - who created Singapore Democratic Party - had preferred a mirror image of the non-democratic CEC model used in the PAP to control his SDP.</p>
              <p>It resulted in his CEC kicking him out of the SDP - with him and Mdm Chiam now crying "Foul".</p>
              <p>Since the departure of CST, the CEC in the SDP has been made more open, and nothing similar to the old PAP style CEC.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, CST had continued to prefer this non-democratic CEC method of controlling his minions in his new SPP.</p>

              <p>What is this again??!! Fact is fact, fact is that the Marine Parade by election in 1992 was meant for the late JBJ to participate in the elections and the 're-rise' of him, because the GE held in 1991 instead of 1992 / 1993 and the intention is no clearer than to prevent him from rising again from a GE! Sadly, Chiam failed to see this point and insisted on fighting GCT in 1992 Marine Parade BE, and the reason is no obvious than he is self-fish, worrying that he will lose his 'opposition leader' position, after the win by JBJ (IF) in this BE, with a clear of 5 WP and 3 SDP (Including Chiam) MP in parliment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is because Chiam's selfishness / lack of tactics, that results in a folly to recruit CBK, who have a CBM supporter like you. However, even if how CBK is he, still better than a Puppy Bolt dog anyway.</p>

              <p>No -- All these are not my interpretion and copyrights attributed to me. There was an article pointed this very fact somewhere. By the way, the then DPM Lee, did mentioned in private that Chiam was not that smart regarding the Marine Parade BE. So afterall, the downfall of SDP and the opposition can only blame on CST and CSJ, while the former make the opposition's image looked not as smart and capable while the CSJ made the opposition's image looked like a crook, ...., and dishonest --- Since a hunger strike is still a hunger strike, should go without glucose at all, probably not for 30 days but 4 days surely can.

              <p>How did a "zwei-siao-Hog" come to know that tits have brains ?</p>
              <p>Could such a belief come about from the hours of feeding on your mother's tis that spurred you to believe that your brain rest in the tits ?</p>

              <p>Perhaps no,but the PAP ministers are using a magnifying glass to enlarge the dispute between various opposition party members.</p>

              <p>Good job done by the resident noisy pussy - fanning the ambers when the fire has been doused.</p>
              <p>What is the agenda of the noisy pussy in bringing out a moot point that was settled 17 years ago ?</p>
              <p>Is Mdm Chiam attempting to win sympathy votes when she is bankrupt of any ideas in dealing with the political challlenges in tangling with the PAP ?</p>
              <p>With CST planned retirement from politics - it is obvious that she needs the $15,000 a month MP allowance to continue with her lifestyle that CST has been collecting every month.</p>
              <p>Sadly, she and CST seems to have forgotten that the $15,000 is not considered a MP's wage but allowance from the State to help with the MP's expenses incurred in running the affairs in the constituency.</p>
              <p>Are those expenses now being paid from the collection of conservancy charges and not from the MP's allowances ?</p>
              <p>Mdm CST should look again to find if she is up to the task to represent the interests of the residents in Potong Pasir when CST can hardly make any dent against the hard hide of LKY and his PAP - which surely will need sharp big spurs to dig into their sides.</p>

              <p>Nope. I think what Chee is doing is just go according to standard procedures, but maybe demote to an ordinary member is a suitable punishment, since Chiam did wrong as well apart of Chee, as said by Sin Kek Tong and the other SDA guy on Wanbao.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But mark my words, with such incidents, I doubt Chiam can win in a GRC contest, regardless on Mah or Wong's seat. Neither can SDP send anybody to the parliment, and even a risk of losing deposit when it is involved in a 3 cornered fight, or garnered less than 25% of the votes, so long as it is leaded by Chee.</p>
