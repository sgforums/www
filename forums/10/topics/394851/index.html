              <p>out of the Party!! Chiam ,the Founder of SDP ,once lost the membership</p>
              <p>in the Party,he then lost the seat in Parliament. <br><br>Mrs Chiam said Chee staged the hungry strike without approval of the Party.</p>
              <p>CSJ created the joke of drinking health drink in hunger strike</p>
              <p>secretly but exposed!</p>

              <p>It is not really lie, it is just hide up. Look, we did lose money in GIC &amp; Temasek -- a fact. But people will say we have lost &gt; $4billions of Singaporean Tax payer's $ in GIC &amp; Temasek -- another fact.</p>

              <p>Is it true that CST could not recruit any talent into his SPP - and had to get his wife to takeover his Secretary-General post when he step down from politics during the next GE - due to his heart condition ?</p>
              <p>If that is true, it explains quite clearly the need for Mdm CST to hit the headlines with her kind of controversy - so as to satisfy her need to attract attention to herself.</p>
              <p>Surprisingly, the issues were not exactly mentioned in the same way that Mdm CST had narrated to the Chinese medium gossip paper - when one look at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiam_See_Tong">‘Wikipedia for CST’  </a></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">In 1992, Chiam recruited </span></em><a title="Chee Soon Juan" href="/wiki/Chee_Soon_Juan"><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Dr Chee Soon Juan</span></em></a><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">, a psychology lecturer at the </span></em><a title="National University of Singapore" href="/wiki/National_University_of_Singapore"><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">National University of Singapore</span></em></a><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">, to be an SDP candidate for a by-election in the </span></em><a title="Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency" href="/wiki/Marine_Parade_Group_Representation_Constituency"><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency</span></em></a><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">. Although the SDP was unsuccessful in the by-election, the recruitment of Chee as a candidate generated considerable public interest. However differences between Chiam and Chee soon emerged. Chee was sacked from his job as a university lecturer in 1993, and publicly claimed that he had been the victim of a political vendetta by the governing </span></em><a title="People's Action Party" href="/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party"><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">People's Action Party</span></em></a><em><span style="color: #0000ff;"> (PAP). Chiam wanted to censure Chee for these comments, but <span style="color: #ff0000;">the party's Central Executive Committee backed Chee and later that year voted to oust Chiam as Secretary-General and to replace him with Chee</span>. They also appointed Ling How Doong to replace Chiam as the party's parliamentary leader. The Central Executive Committee attempted to expel Chiam from the party, but he won a court case to prevent them from doing so on procedural grounds.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chiam left the SDP in 1996 and accepted an invitation to join the Singapore People's Party, which was formed by a breakaway faction of the SDP in 1994, and became its Chairman. </span></em></p>

              <p class="root"><em>However the rise of the SDP was not to be, as differences soon emerged between Chiam and Chee.

              <p>It seems only one hand each was extended to the other, and that each kept one hand behind the back - are there volumes to be spoken about CST's feelings - as much as there is to be read for Chee ?</p>
              <p>Should it not be a cautious approach of two adults that showed sincere respect for the occassion - then displaying any kind of hypocritical warmth laced with the artificial boisterous "ruh-ha-ha" - given the history between them ?</p>

              <p>If CSJ was LKY - or the present SDP is the PAP - Singaporeans will be entertained by a high profile law suit taken by CSJ against Mdm CST - for the uncalled for and very personal attacks made more then 10 years late - and which the noisy pussy has claimed Mdm CST to have made.</p>
              <p>A legal suit in an open court would have straightened events and allowed everyone in Singapore to find out the real events within the SDP that led to the majority of the members to cast their vote of no confidence towards CST - who was the SDP founder and leader then.</p>
              <p>The events are less then 14 years ago, and many of the members are still around and the historical events are still fresh in their minds.</p>
              <p>Will CSJ and SDP behave as the Lee's and the PAP - to cut someone else down to save their own face ?</p>
              <p>It maybe of interest to the ignorant noisy pussy that democratic practices are more evident in the SDP then in any other political party that maintain a 'kiasi-and-kiasu' mentality to protect the position of the party founders and leadership.</p>
              <p>Election to the SDP Executive Committee is open to the entire membership of the SDP - while the PAP and the SPP (led by CST) share common features that are undemocratic - featuring three classes of membership, and access to be a member of the Executive Committee is selective and closed door.</p>
              <p>Is there any political party that will willingly offer a level field to its members ?</p>
              <p>We can hardly depend on a noisy pussy to be honest even with its pretentious self.</p>

              <p>CST is already retiring from politics - why will he attend the forum in 2009 - when he had a stroke then and had undergone some medical treatment then ?</p>

              <p>Civil disobediance is only a tool to educate the 'kiasi-kiasu' mentality of an already apathic Singapore population that has been depoliticised by the deliberate schemes of LKY so as to allow himself full control.</p>
              <p>The fact that CSJ was prepared to be in the forefront to act out his social leadership role in civil disobedience will speak alot for himself - in being prepared to do what he preach unlike LKY's who prefer that Singaporeans does as he direct, and not do what he does for himself.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzex2Q9ST1o&amp;amp;feature=related">‘Tan Kin Lian’  </a>and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qggV07aiFIY&amp;amp;feature=related">‘Chia Ti Lik’ </a>were also at the SDP Forum and both advocated the continued public education of the Citizenship Rights to Singaporeans - to awaken the Singaporeans from their deep political slumber as their political future is at stake.</p>

              <p>But whatever it is, we must analyze the facts given.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1:) Mdm Chiam said that those CEC were too proud of themselves, believing that they can win in the next GE and possibly forming their own government.</p>
              <p>Why? Because CST had such proud feeling, more or less.</p>
              <p>What? Evidence: Actually, I could say that the reason why 1991 was a huge success for the oppositions who won 4 SMCs and many near to win a seat (40% and above was common) , the highest record ever, was because apart of isolated incident such as Lady MP wiped her hands after shook her hands with a fishmonger or whatever "peasants", the disqualification of the late JBJ. Yes, because the last election prior to 1991 was 1988, which was a shocking election / sudden election / early election but not a by election where effectively bar JBJ from election, which the effect for JBJ's conviction will be ended after 1991/2. Thus, people are not happy with the fact that the ruling party is using such tricks to bar JBJ and vote for the oppositions.</p>
              <p>2:) It was more or less Chiam's fault for recruiting Chee in, because the very fact that the response from GCT, the then PM to public's anger, was to hold a by election in Marine Parade GRC, which was his consitiutency. GCT said that he will hold all the responsibilities should he lost his seat. However, the oppositions was not in united, and resulted into SDP wants to fight GCT, WP should have sent JBJ and his team to fight GCT, and 2 other smaller parties (NSP and SJP --- a more or less defunct party by now since most of the people had switched to SPP) also want to contest against GCT. Lol! This is why Chee is in, and created a lot of fuss. And, obviously, the reason for SDP to fight GCT is because should the WP wins, 1MP (Hougang -- won in 1991) + 4 MP from this GRC = 5MP from WP and the opposition leader's position is given to Low instead (Since SDP had 3 seats back then, Chiam is the official opposition leader). Anyway, it was Chiam's folly to create such a mess. It was his over confidence that led to his downfall since such effects was spreaded to the whole SDP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the above seemed to be critizing Chiam a lot, now let's look at why Dr Chee should be "Chee Bye Kia" or Dr Cheezy.</p>
              <p>1: A hunger strike is a hunger strike. It is not supposed to use Glucose to replenish body, except, possibly, water. While people can say this is a disgrace to himself, what is certain is that "CBK" is an iconic figure for SDP, people will naturally associate this with SDP, despite it was not SDP's protest against PAP but rather a personal retaliation against his senior on NUS. I think that a 16 year old boy can do better than him in this regards. (I got even tried to save $8 a day, by skipping lunch and dinner and even water, which the water was drank minimally, although I did have some milo ONLY at late night at home lol!)</p>
              <p>2: It seemed that CSJ is manipulating the CEC. If not why would the then vice chairman needs some "bodyguards" to block their members for observing the hearings? Neither is such acts a democratic act!</p>
