              <p>I agree that WP need to be on full alert now.</p>
              <p>Before, there were not many opposition parties.</p>
              <p>Only WP and Chiam are accepted by the people so far.</p>
              <p>Now, time has changed.</p>
              <p>There could be new players in the market.</p>
              <p>Depending on which Party the Activists or Independents join (or not join), the outcome can be shocking. There are also conspiracy theories for the rise of these characters.</p>
              <p>not until the last minute, no one knows which party these Activists will join or not join.</p>
              <p>The Opposition's future is more uncertain than ever.</p>
              <p>1. more opposition parties joining the fray could possibly mean less votes go to one particular Opposition party.</p>
              <p>2. more surprises in the last minute could change the game entirely. I recall the interesting character called Gomez.</p>
              <p>Yes, I am convinced beyond doubt , there is more uncertainty than ever before.</p>

              <p>No. Think about it for a moment, if our dear Mr. Low parades around holding banners and dressing themselves in anti-PAP T-shirts, they'll most probably get sued for whatever restrictions the government comes up with nowadays.</p>
              <p>Now, what use will Mr. Low be sitting in solitary confinement? Have you not thought of how much more helpful he will be <strong>out</strong> than <strong>in</strong>?</p>
              <p>Politicians are to think rationally before speaking, not attract unwanted attention like Dr. Chee and his group of attention-seeking maters. Of course, I'm not trying to say that what Dr. Chee did was wrong. He was, doubtlessly trying to create awareness of what tyrants we have as governers in the most... peculiar fashion.</p>
              <p>I'm sure if Dr. Chee were to be elected, he would concentrate on his political zone instead of marching before the Istana or the High Court.</p>
              <p>Just because Mr. Low doesn't have a vibrant, colourful website doesn't necessarily mean that he isn't doing a job.</p>
              <p>Perhaps he is counting to Dr. Chee to fall the current monarchy before taking action?</p>

              <p>No. Think about it for a moment, if our dear Mr. Low parades around holding banners and dressing themselves in anti-PAP T-shirts, they'll most probably get sued for whatever restrictions the government comes up with nowadays.</p>
              <p>Now, what use will Mr. Low be sitting in solitary confinement? Have you not thought of how much more helpful he will be <strong>out</strong> than <strong>in</strong>?</p>
              <p>Politicians are to think rationally before speaking, not attract unwanted attention like Dr. Chee and his group of attention-seeking maters. Of course, I'm not trying to say that what Dr. Chee did was wrong. He was, doubtlessly trying to create awareness of what tyrants we have as governers in the most... peculiar fashion.</p>
              <p>I'm sure if Dr. Chee were to be elected, he would concentrate on his political zone instead of marching before the Istana or the High Court.</p>
              <p>Just because Mr. Low doesn't have a vibrant, colourful website doesn't necessarily mean that he isn't doing a job.</p>
              <p>Perhaps he is counting to Dr. Chee to fall the current monarchy before taking action?</p>

              <p>Bro, verbosity not necessary here lol. I agree with you and I never said WP shd apply those of CSJ's tactics. Do more walkabouts - simple. Organise more activities, let it be known thru their webpage. Re-design their drab looking website. Update with political news (Singapore, regionals or the world) daily. This will arouse interest and jolt apathetic Sinkies out of their domain. Do podcasts etc etc.</p>
