              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">The great divide. The Lee Kuan Yew Administration and the people of Singapore</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The Lee government of Singapore and the
              people of Singapore cannot be further apart from where they are now.
              And with time, something has got to give. Either the people would show
              their unhappiness in more robust ways than they do now, or this
              government has to accept reality and democracy. Whatever it is, the
              present status <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">quo</span> cannot last.<br><br>Lee
              Administration by their everyday actions have made it clear that they
              are not concerned about what the people think. If not, which
              politicians anywhere in the world, in their sane minds, would think of
              paying themselves salaries of $3.7 million per year each, which happens
              to be the salary of the Prime Minister of Singapore and his father Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, each! Despite knowing full well that every Singaporean is fuming
              mad about this shameless theft of Singapore's assets, they do it
              anyway, regardless of the people's wishes!<br><br>Then you have the poor. About a third of the population are earning less than $2,000.00 per month. Yet the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">HDB</span> house rent has gone up to several hundred dollars a month; deliberately
              increasing food prices and denying any responsibility by blaming
              foreign countries for it; deliberately refusing to pay the old people
              their <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">CPF</span> retirement payments as required by law; totally neglecting the old and
              the unskilled Singaporean; deliberately lowering their wages by
              bringing peasants from Bangladesh and India who will work for $400.00
              per month. These Indian peasants and others can live in their countries
              for $100.00 per month, therefore the $400.00 they get in Singapore is a
              windfall; whereas for the Singaporean, this is not a living wage at all.<br><br>As
              a result of the government's total neglect of the realities in
              Singapore, the poor are driven to suicide, living in void decks because
              they cannot afford to pay rent. On the other hand, these impoverished
              peasants from India and other places live rough; 25 to a <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">HDB</span> room; since their only concern is to send their entire salaries to
              their impoverished relatives in India and other parts of the Third
              World. Unlike them, the Singaporean has rent to pay, electricity bills,
              transport costs and children to send to school, all of which costs a
              lot of money. They cannot live on $400.00 per month. They cannot
              compete with cheap labor Indians. Not being able to survive, they are
              driven to suicide.<br><br>This government is not not only misguided,
              they are downright determined not to budge from their ridiculous
              philosophy, which is this. Their philosophy, which also happens to be a
              cunning way for them to deny any basic assistance to their needy
              citizens, is this. They say, conveniently for them in the
              circumstances; that any welfare payments to the poor will result in
              their becoming lazy and unproductive. Therefore no help will be given
              to those unable to support themselves.<br><br>The people know that this
              excuse, not to give any assistance to the poor, is not genuine. They
              see it as a deliberate attempt to ignore their plight. We have seen the
              world over where caring governments who provide a lending hand to the
              needy, does not necessarily create a dependant population.<br><br>Instead
              the people appreciate and are grateful to their governments, learning
              new skills and improving themselves and turning out in no time to be
              valuable proud upstanding members of their societies. Whereas, in
              Singapore, as the government is determined not to help anyone, the poor
              starve or are forced to wait at tables in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">HDB</span> food courts, or reliant upon their children if they can.<br><br>This
              breeds bitterness and hatred in the hearts of the aged poor against
              this government; which in the end, will only cause further instability,
              lack of productivity and the eventual fall of this uncaring government.
              The French Revolution comes to mind. King Louis just like the Lees
              failed to understand his subjects.<br><br>This government fails to
              understand that it serves no purpose to tell an old uneducated Chinese
              woman of 58 to go out and learn new skills. She cannot. She is <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">illiterate</span>.
              It is too late for her. If the government does not help, she cannot be
              saved. She too is a human being. A Singapore citizen. The Prime
              Minister pays himself $3.7 million. Giving her a reasonable sum every
              month will not change anything. It will not result in the decline and
              fall of Singapore. He can pay a small portion of the $3.7 million. It
              will not hurt him even a bit. There is no compassion or even wisdom on
              the part of this government. None at all.<br><br>In the end, the
              government is helping the illiterate peasant from India. Instead they
              should be helping the old Singaporean woman.<br><br>And all these
              grievance cause a divide which cannot be resolved. The government and
              the people are at odds. The situation is untenable.<br><br>Who are the
              rich? They form a very small number. Just as in the military junta of
              Burma, they are all connected to the government. These are the
              Ministers, the judges, the presidents of large government linked
              companies, the top civil servants, the editors of the state controlled
              newspapers, the commissioners of the police and such like. The poor is
              the rest of society, made up of the ordinary civil servants, the
              ordinary policemen, the ordinary office worker and the ordinary factory
              hand. The former are paid millions. The latter are paid $2,000.00 or
              less a month.<br><br>And these Singapore poor are kept at bay, from
              attacking the rich, through fear. Fear of loss of jobs, fear of
              retribution, fear of libel suits, fear of benefit loss, an all
              embracing fear like a blanket which lies over this entire island.<br><br>But now you see cracks in this standoff. On March 15, 2008 at 2 pm, the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Tak</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">Boleh</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Tahan</span> protest was successfully held by 50 determined people in front of the
              heartless Parliament House, which is responsible for their misery. It
              was a protest against rising food prices. These proud admirable
              courageous men women and children stood hand in hand, peacefully crying
              for justice while Lee's police came to arrest them. Undaunted, defiant,
              encouraged with truth on their side, one by one they went, dragged to
              waiting police vans in front of countless aghast outraged Singaporean
              passers by, without resistance, to be arrested and put on trial.<br><br>There
              is no doubt about it. These 50 are going to be 500 next. The tolerance
              level of the poor is has already reached. There is no doubt about it.
              The government of Singapore is no longer representative. It has begun
              to rule by force. Not by law. The time has come for action. And with
              action, there can only be one outcome. And you know what that is.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>
