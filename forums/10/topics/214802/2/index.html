Is there a difference between learning calculus at an age of 15 over the rest of your schooling life and learning it at an age of 19 over 2 to 3 years? Yes. For one, many of us prefer that we do the 19-year style. Not that calculus is too difficult, but it is absurd that we Singaporeans are so kiasu that a few of us teach ourselves quantum physics just so we can attend the astronomy competitions held in certain schools. At an age of 15.<br><br>justcooler: well, you are right. I cannot argue that...</div>
