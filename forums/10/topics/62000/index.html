            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people,<br><br>I have been reading all your posts in this forum. Recently, i chanced upon the topic regarding Singaporeans in Perth. The Australian ethos of "FAir go" where every individual is given a fair chance in life. Well, the article fascinated me and certainly piqued my interest and curiousity in seeking a better life outside Singapore. I am still a student studying in a polytechnic. Life has been rather low for me ever since i went into a polytechnic. It has never been a choice for me to consider a polytechnic education(not that i look down on poly), just that i have always been brought up with this notion of "being somebody" when you follow the trodden path, of going to a good secondary school, then to a junior college and finally secure a foot in the local university. Yes, though it might sound cliche, but subconciously, if one does not follow this route, naturally one might be inclined to feel inferior. Many times i have pondered and worried what is there left for me in Singapore. If i am not academically inclined, what can i do? Set up a business? Like many said, Singapore is only where the big boys play. I do not see myself just getting a normal white collar job and slog my ass off for another 30 years, paying bills and more bills, and when its "time" to retire, my CPF savings can hardly sustain me.<br><br>I have been considering life overseas after my NS to work and live overseas. Some might call me an escapist, whatever you might think, but i find it really tiring living here, despite the superb medical facilities and standard of living we have here. But i just find there is hardly time to even stop for a breather. I have considered US and more often than not, down under, solely for the fact that we geographically closer to Australia. Perth sounds like less uninhabited place compared to Melbourne or Sydney. I do have friends here in Singapore, very few though, and many times or not, i just find the people of my age harder to click with. And yes, it does not mean seeking a life elsewhere naturally offer greater things, as one brings his or her own problems along there. But upon thinking about my life here in Singapore in the years to come, i really do not have the courage to think any further, simply for the fact that i more often than not, very average academically.<br><br>I would love to hear your views , especially from people like "the Bear", "Atobe" and "CX" just to name a few, as from the posts you guys have posted, i appreciate your insights that you could enlighten me with on my future plans.<br><br>cheers</div>

The gahmen did not realise it but by setting up the JC path as the direct entry route to university, they subconsciously annexed those who preferred a polytechnic eduction by dictating that only the top 5% would be allowed entry into local universities.<br><br>Those top 5%, those of whom i have met during my own university days have indeed displayed the ability and knowledge of capable students.

Most of the poly grads are down-to-earth people with rational thinking and a great sense of humour.<br><br>And as atobe has already mentioned, some of them have gone on to greatness.<br><br>Now that you have begun to link our education with our current situation, i see no reason why emigration should become a difficult choice. People who emigrate does not mean they are quitters, rather if life ouside of singapore suits you, why not?<br><br>Make that choice, but do it with your conscience clear. Every decision must have a reason. But always remember: you answer to yourself and no one else.<br><br>And if you're worried abt the NS thingy, don't bother. The best recalling methods in the world would not succeed if the person on the other end didn't have the courage and desire to defend his homeland. Judging by your write-up, i believe you are not one of the "rats" who would desert a sinking ship.<br><br>On a separate note, while overseas, i once asked an israeli immigrant working as a salesman how the IDF would recall him in the event of hostilities. His answer was frank but simple:<br><br>They do not need to recall me, i will go back myself.<br><br>I thrust that is not lost on any level-headed singaporean.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Insightist,<br><br>as the others have mentioned already, the poly route is not as bad as some have thought it to be. I'm from a local polytechnic myself, despite my O-Level results qualifying me for a good JC. I was unable to get into the local Unis on the basis of my results not being in the top 5% (not that I was that keen on local Us) and then went on to a uni Down Under. I don't think my taking the poly route has made me a worse person, in fact, it has given me much more in my field of study as it has given me more hands-on knowledge as well as getting me into my vocation in NS which has increased my chance to get hands-on experience on what I've studied.<br><br>As for emigration, I spent 4 years in Australia, and immensely enjoyed my life there (Melbourne). Initially my thoughts were always with the line that Australia was a stopover, and that I'll always return to Singapore, work, start a family and grow old. However the more time I spent there, the more I questioned the wisdom of that logic, as I found myself disagreeing with more aspects of life in Singapore (social, economic and political) and finding out that I increasingly enjoyed life Down Under. I've made the decision to leave and will certainly apply for PR status once my work experience is sufficient to qualify me. If anything, I've regretted not getting a PR before returning to complete my NS, due to misconceptions about Aussie residency requirements then.<br><br>Whether its the path for you, nobody can decide but yourself. But from what you've typed so far, you and me seem quite alike. We have specialised interests that do not get much mileage in Singapore, and would prefer a less hectic, more carefree life that Singapore neither accepts socially or permits. My advice for you is to make the decision carefully, as obviously, life there is not suited for everyone. IMO your best bet would be to spend some time there (studying?) or to speak with people who have lived, or are living there for a while. I've been to 3 different Australian cities, as well as did research and spoke to people who've lived in others. For me, my choice would be Melbourne, as it offers to me a slower pace of life, yet one which is not overly slow (a common complaint with Perth). Melbourne also has a rich cultural and historical heritage, and is easily the events capital of Australia. In short. its a modern cosmopolitan city, yet offers enough for people with all kinds of interests.<br><br>My take on the pros and cons of Australia (mostly from my experiences in Melbourne but mostly applicable elsewhere):<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pros</span><br>- Cars/Houses are cheaper<br>- A friendly, welcoming people (mostly)<br>- Slower pace of life (how much slower depending on where you are)<br>- A much more carefree political and social system (and more forgiving and tolerant - this one can cut both ways)<br>- Much more space and places to go on your free time<br>- 4 seasons (in the case of Melbourne, in one day!)<br>- Lots of medical and social benefits<br>- Driving does not significantly increase blood pressure<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cons</span><br>- Security not as good as Singapore. but not much worse<br>- Public transport not as efficient or cheap.<br>- Not as clean as Singapore (some say not as "sterile" - good or bad? Your call)<br>- You're the racial minority (though rarely noticeable)<br>- Cost of living higher (Melbourne/Sydney especially)<br><br>Generally, as a Singaporean who speaks good English, you'll be almost universally accepted and welcomed there. And you'll have no trouble integrating. While I was there, I've been mistaken more than once for a local by the Aussies I've come in contact with (and no, not because I speak with an Aussie accent but due more to my command of English). The "racism" issue that rears its head often in the local press (and in the mind of many Singaporeans) here is way overblown, the anger at immigrants is by and large directed towards the economic refugees from the Mid-East and S Asia who claim political asylum to get in, then refuse to integrate and become a burden on the state's welfare system<br><br></div>

The friends I've spoke to about Perth have lived and studied there for a few years, and by and large are not the "cheonging" type, and "boring" was a common term they used to describe Perth to me. Those that have been to Melbourne from Perth liked it more there, saying that<br><br>Yeah the weather in Melb is pretty dodgy at times, but for me the cosmopolitan life, wonderful events calender and the exciting lifestyle makes it my choice.<br><br>As for more locals, personally I'm planning on leaving Singapore to experience a different lifestyle and mix with more different types of people. To me, it kind of defeats the purpose when you move to a place with so many Singaporeans. Might as well stay here....<br><br>As for the makan, make your own! In my 4 years in Melbourne, I've made all manners of local foods, ingredients which are available there anyway!<br><br>Anyway, for each their own. One man's meat is another man's poison, for anyone planning to leave, I would suggest checking out that place for themselves before making any decision.</div>

I used to be neutral about such matters in Singapore, but I no longer am.'<br><br>But for Miss Nora, the choice is clear.<br><br>'I feel like I still haven't learnt enough,' she said.
