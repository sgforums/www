              <p>I
              have come to know that famiLEE LEEgime's dogs had purchase a
              significant quantity of Tak Boleh Tahan T-shirts. This became very
              obvious because famiLEE LEEgime's dogs can be told very clearly apart
              from opposition supporters that we are very familiar.<br><br>I
              wouldn't reveal how many had the famiLEE LEEgime dogs purchased, nor
              when, nor from where. But it is now necessary for me to preempt what
              they might do with these Tak Boleh Tahan T-shirts. :-)<br><br>They are
              simply up to getting themselves dressed in these Tak Boleh Tahan
              T-shirts to do something silly hoping to create backlash to the on

              <p>Thanks for bringing this to the public's attention.</p>
              <p>This
              psyops tactic is nothing new. They did it before during the 70s. Tan
              Wah Piow was a student leader then, and during one negotiation with the
              PAP, some troublemakers present (Tan didn't think they were from his
              group) started smashing things up. That gave the PAP the perfect excuse
              to label Tan as a law breaker and to further clamp down on those with
              democratic ideals.</p>
              <p>Now that the Tak Boleh Tahan campaign has made
              progress, they (PAP) probably want to hijack the symbol and turn it
              against the democracy movement.</p>
              <p>What can we do? Spread the news
              around. Warn everyone. Assure everyone that the SDP, activists and
              their supporters are well-behaved law-abiding citizens. Please do not
              confuse us with the State-trained gangsters who are planning to hijack
              the Tak Boleh Tahan symbol.</p>

              <p><br>I do strongly believe that what you did is despicable and irresponsible. Simply because you did not back up those wild statements with facts or even a shred of evidence.</p>
              <p>On what evidence did the author based on to allege that a certain political party bought such T-shirts?</p>
              <p>Secondly, being the political party whom used such T-shirts for identification, they should be aware of the fallout they will cause. Is this allegation another way to wash their hands and not be held responsible for users of the T-shirt who does acts detrimental to society?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't even want to mention unsubstantiated allegations of the past.</p>
