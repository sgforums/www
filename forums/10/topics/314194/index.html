              <h1 class="title">The iceberg of Singapore politics</h1>
              <p>Written by Ng E-Jay<br> 12 April 2008</p>
              <p>Icebergs partially float on water with the top part jutting out of
              the water’s surface because ice is around 9% less dense than water.
              Some icebergs are huge, and only a small fraction of their total volume
              is visible above water. The rest is submerged beneath the water’s
              surface, its true destructive force on vessels and ships hidden from
              plain sight.</p>
              <p>This is precisely the situation confronting Singapore. While the
              government tries to attract an increasing number of foreigners to
              Singapore, little do the outsiders know that Singapore is on a
              collision course with a political iceberg whose tip is visible but its
              enormity is obscured beneath an ocean of propaganda.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s productivity has fallen in recent years, and the
              government has tried to make up for declining birth rates and the brain
              drain by importing a huge number of foreigners. The growth in
              Singapore’s GDP has been due to the expansion of the population by
              foreign talent import rather than through real gains in competitiveness
              and productivity.</p>
              <p>The government has turned our nation into a mere hotel where
              visitors can come in, milk our jobs, and then move on to greener
              pastures whenever they decide to. Singapore is no longer a nation for
              Singaporeans. Singapore males still have to serve National Service, but
              in return they face hardship and even discrimination at work due to
              their NS liabilities. Foreigners on the other hand enjoy most of the
              privileges afforded to citizens, but none of the associated liabilities.</p>
              <p>The indiscriminate import of foreign workers has depressed real
              wages in Singapore for the lower income class, and wages as a whole
              have not kept pace with inflation. Till today, there is no minimum
              wage, and cleaners are still earning little more than three to four
              hundred dollars per month, same as what they earned a decade ago.
              Octagenerians are seen making their rounds at coffeeshops and hawker
              centres collecting drink cans or wiping tables. Escalating costs of
              living due to government policies like the GST hike have only made
              matters worse.</p>
              <p>The PAP government likes to portray Singapore to the world as a
              shining example of a nation under good governance, with prosperity for
              all. In reality, only the ruling clique is benefiting from Singapore’s
              economic growth, with GLCs deeply entrenched in all parts of the
              economy and minister’s salaries pegged to the highest private sector
              wages.</p>
              <p>Working class Singaporeans are being squeezed till the point of
              suffocation by rising HDB property prices because HDB flats are only
              granted a market subsidy rather than a cash subsidy. This is a prime
              example of the government’s blatant neglect of its own people and
              profiteering from the most basic survival needs of its own citizens.</p>
              <p>As a direct result of Singaporeans’ putting in a large portion of
              their CPF savings towards their home, many do not have enough to retire
              on, and the government has to invent schemes like CPF Life in a frail
              attempt to plug the holes of this sinking retirement ship.</p>
              <p>Even in policies like CPF Life, the government carefully designs it
              to ensure that it will profit from the scheme over the long run no
              matter how life expectancies or return on investments change. The risks
              arising from mortality changes or changes in investment gains are
              entirely borne by Singaporeans, who ultimately still have to depend
              solely on each other rather than on the government for their retirement
              funding. That is how callous and mercenary the government has become.</p>
              <p>The PAP government however continually uses its own state-sponsored
              media to obscure these facts with a steady stream of propaganda that
              has become a mighty ocean of hogwash.</p>
              <p>It is high time for activists and politicians to unite and expose
              the full extent of this political iceberg that if left unchecked will
              ultimately sink the great ship of our nation’s destiny.</p>
