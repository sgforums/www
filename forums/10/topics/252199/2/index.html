Actually, the US government did not intervene because of Suu-Kyi.

Was he criticizing Singaporeans in his retirement, or was there an underlying tone criticizing the manner that LKY's Government is driving Singaporeans in this direction ?<br><br>As each of this first generation passed, memory fade, LHL's job is made even easier until CSJ had to step in to challenge his legitimacy.<br><br>CSJ may yet change to show his intellectual brilliance in the pristine Civil environment of Parliament, unless the Law of the Concrete Jungle that rule the Political Environment in the streets are brought into the holy house of Parliament - as dictated by LKY.<br><br>LKY was not persecuted by the Colonial Government - in the same manner that LKY's government had persecuted CSJ, which explains for the unblinking and unapologetic ruthlessness that LKY used the Law to persecute others.<br><br>We can have hope that CSJ having experienced the bitter persecution will be more magnanimous in victory and will proceed to change the political environment for a better Singapore.<br><br>There is cause to believe that CSJ can and will do it, as Mandela and Kim Dae Jung have been similarly persecuted and suppressed by vicious governments in their respective countries. Both have turned out to be magnanimous towards the entire government system in liberalizing the entire political system, and allowing a more Open Society to blossom.<br><br></span><br></div>

Is he deserving of your favoritism ?<br><br>JBJ has also locked horns with the Ruling Party in the same manner as CSJ - he had also been as reckless, if not even more so than CSJ.<br><br>Why are you viewing CSJ in such a prejudicial angle more so than Chiam or JBJ, and on some miscellaneous non-specifc 'ACTIONS' ?<br><br>What is your expectation from an Opposition Member - passiveness, inaction, quiet submission, co-operation with the Government to maintain the unfair status quo on Singaporeans ?<br><br>It is odd that you will give credit to JBJ for all his similar pro-active confrontation against the Government on each and every policy that this government has created to burden Singaporeans, which are nearly identical to that of CSJ's activism.<br><br>We can only wonder why the propaganda machinery has been so successful in casting CSJ in such a different view compared to JBJ ?<br><br>Could it be that it has been more then 20 years since the last propaganda was made to cast JBJ in a different light, and memory of JBJ has changed since he became more mellow and older with age ?<br><br>You may yet have the opportunity to see JBJ in action - if he is able to get himself off the Bankruptcy List with his latest efforts to clear his name. You will then see how close an operating style between JBJ and CSJ. Let us hope then that you will change your views about CSJ, or worst still that you do not change your favorable views of JBJ.<br><br>Singaporeans should learn to give themselves the opportunity to let the Opposition Members represent us in the present ciircumstances when so few dare to speak up on our behalf.<br><br>My views on CSJ is based on this line of thought, and I will defend the position of the under dog opposition members from whichever party they may come from. Unfortunately, the brunt of the negative attention is continuously directed at CSJ, and yet nothing positive has been said at the same time about the activities of other Opposition members. I wonder why ?<br><br>Is CSJ beginning to make some kind of impression on Singaporeans, the political awareness that he said he has set out to achieve amongst Singaporeans - to be concious of their lost Political Rights ?<br><br>Is the present upsurge in character assassination and negative views raised towards CSJ, a consequential reaction to the level of positive awareness and growing support, amidst the realisation that what he has been warning us about - for the last 20 years - is turning out to be true ?<br></span><br><br></div>
