            <div class='col-md body'>It is not difficult to understand why our government has become arrogant?<br><br>It is because 66.6% of citizens are easily brainwashed by daily fear tactics and selective comparisons by self-centred ministers and their controlled newspapers by cleverly making selective with countries (much like selective benchmarking of their ministers' salaries to a few lottery winning CEOs in the private sector) which for historical reasons are experiencing problems or going through a bad patch.<br><br>But sadly the citizens are easily swayed into believing the ministers that by following democracy like Taiwan or Thailand or Philippines there will be chaos and instability.<br><br>The fact is how many selfishly run autocracy is not experiencing worse chaos and suppressions and even large-scale genocides.<br><br>So it is important people must be independent in their thought and intellect to be able to check on abuses which is the biggest cause of instability and chaos.<br><br>Without such quality, they will easily be brainwashed into believing all the selective comparison and lies that there will be instability if people are allowed freedoms to express their views or criticize wrong policies of the government..<br><br>At one time our leaders have regularly regarded India and China poorly managed countries suffering from rampant problems but at least their ministers are not trying to write their own pay cheques and are properly elected unlike ours which claim to be elected when they cleverly set up GRC to create walkover or no contest and claim to have mandate of 66.6% to do as they like.<br><br>Now look at how they restructure the economies over the last three recessions.<br><br>They have not created real value-adding and technology-driven industries among its own domestic sector but are claiming success all because the world finally recovers to give our IR a chance to show off some GDP and property growth which only shallow minded talents would claim as success.<br><br>What is so talented about our ministers if none of them could succeed in restructuring the industries or motivating its citizens to come up with world beating products like the Toyota or Nokia with better education and technology start-ups and making the country more efficiently run.<br><br>Now they have even tried to copy new technology start-up investments from India and China. What a bull all the talk about leadership and talents worth being paid another million every few years.<br><br></div>

They are less independent-thinking and lack in initiative. It does not bode well for the emergence of future leaders in politics and business.
