              <p><strong>Democratic Voice of Burma, 7 Aug 2009<br> </strong> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Goh says Suu Kyi ‘is part of the problem’</strong></span></span><br> <br> Aug 7, 2009 (DVB)–<span style="color: red;"><strong>Aung San Suu Kyi “is part
              of the problem” in Burma’s political crisis because she still believes
              she is the government, said former Singaporean prime minister Goh Chok
              Tong yesterday.</strong></span><br> <br> The comment, reported yesterday in Channel NewsAsia, was made during
              the inaugural Asia-Middle East Media Roundtable in Singapore yesterday.<br> <br> Goh Chok Tong, now a Senior Minister in Singapore, had previously urged
              the ruling junta in Burma to hold free and fair elections next year
              following a meeting with Senior General Than Shwe in June.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The comments have stirred unrest among Burma
              observers, with the foreign affairs coordinator of the National League
              for Democracy-Liberated Areas, Nyo Ohn Myint , saying he was “very
              upset” by it.</strong></span><br> <br> “She has been under house arrest for 14 years and has never had a
              chance for dialogue or to show her ability to reconcile with the
              junta,” he said.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>“[Goh] should have a look at the real problem, which is not the democracy icon, but is the military junta.”</strong></span><br> <br> Singapore is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
              (ASEAN) bloc, and follows the ASEAN policy of non-interference in
              internal matters of member states.<br> <br> But, said Nyo Ohn Myint, the relationship runs deeper than straight diplomacy, with Singapore a significant investor in Burma.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>“I think Singapore is protecting its business interests,”</strong></span> he said. “Singapore, and ASEAN countries, always try not to side with the opposition but stick with the ruling generals.”<br> <br> Burmese political analyst Aung Naing Oo said however that the problem is “a conflict between idealism and pragmatic action”.<br> <br> “[Singapore] wants the country to move forward, and they see Aung San
              Suu Kyi as the obstacle, mainly because the military is not moving,” he
              said.<br> <br> “In a conflict that is not going anywhere, it is normal for anybody to
              look for alternatives. From a moral idealisitic point of view, then Goh
              Chok Tong is not right, but from pragmatic thinking he may be right.”<br> <br> He added that the comment symbolizes the conflict between Eastern and
              Western countries on what action to take on Burma, with the likes of
              China and India refraining from condemnation while the United States
              and European Union hold tough sanctions on the regime. <br> <br> --------------------<br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Latest update @ <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:<br> </strong></span><br> 1.

              <p>GCT actually said that <em>"Aung San Su Kyi is part of the problem - because she still  believes she is the government"</em> -</p>
              <p>It seems that the PAP ways of re-writing History is again revealed in GCT ignoring the fact that Aung San Suu Kyi had led her National League for Democracy Party to an election victory in Myanmar's last election held in 1990.</p>
              <p>Mynamar's Military Junta simply ignored the election results and arrested Aung San Suu Kyi and placed her under house arrest ever since.</p>
              <p>With GCT and the remaining PAP leadership in a state of self-denial over historical fact, how will they lead Singapore to be a signatory to ASEAN's upcoming Human Rights Charter.</p>
              <p>This is going to be another wayang party led by the experts from the Singapore PAP Political Leadership.</p>

              <p><br>Actually we have no business to be inside Myanmar - with the santions already imposed for quite a long while.</p>
              <p>The commercial interests of the Singapore PAP Government takes precendence over common sense in what is human principles in differentiating right and wrong.</p>
              <p>When the UN and ASEAN placed sanctions on Vietnam for invading Cambodia in the late 1970s, the Singapore Government owned APB and Intraco was already operating in Vietnam - even as Singaporeans were prevented from pursuing any commercial interests from private initiatives.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Now is Mr Goh’s turn to regret for his own statement he made about Aung San Su Kyi and Burma. First of all Singapore and ASEAN do too little in Myanmar’s democracy process, Mr Goh may not deserved at this position to make unfair statement of what he think about Burma. Singapore Government’s own already-flaw-ridden policy of “non interference” is contradicting with his statement. </span></span></p>

Sad thing is politician especially in Asia are afraid of admitting this even though fundamentally no choice but accepting the fact. </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr. Goh should have gone deeper to the issue of fair and legitimate election in 2010, more than a word, what are the actions? The first national elections in Cambodia was administered by United Nations Transitional Authority for Cambodia (UNTAC) in July 1993. Should that had been your opinion to convey message to Mr. Ban during meeting in Singapore? If Mr Goh believed western view on Aun San Su Kyi and Myanmar is flaw so that ASEAN should form an independent elections committee for Myanmar?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Is ASEAN and Singapore government ready to admit that “non interference” policy is not working? The result of “non interference” had served as “regional ignorance” policy that allows Myanmar’s rough government led to nuclear ambition state. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Now is time ASEAN to get together in Myanmar’s politics for the sake of regional stability and security. Mr Goh statement should not stop there and lay further foundation to tackle the issue as responsible leader in the region.</span></span></p>

              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">The Strait of Malacca,
                  linking the Indian and Pacific Oceans, is the shortest sea route
                  between the Persian Gulf and China. It is the key chokepoint in Asia.
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>More than 80% of all China’s oil imports are shipped by tankers passing
                  the Malacca Strait. The narrowest point is the Phillips Channel in the
                  Singapore Strait, only 1.5 miles wide at its narrowest.</strong></span> Daily more than
                  12 million barrels in oil supertankers pass through this narrow
                  passage, most en route to the world’s fastest-growing energy market,
                  China or to Japan.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">If
                  the strait were closed, nearly half of the world's tanker fleet would
                  be required to sail further. Closure would immediately raise freight
                  rates worldwide. More than 50,000 vessels per year transit the Strait
                  of Malacca. The region from Maynmar to Banda Aceh in Indonesia is fast
                  becoming one of the world’s most strategic chokepoints. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Who controls

                  																	waters on the other. "It is at the tapering end of waters through which oil

                  																	<br> <br> The Strait of Malacca connects the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea. This 
                  																	narrow waterway is crucial to maritime trade - it is one of the busiest ocean 
                  																	highways in the world. Its traffic density is projected to increase from 94,000 
                  																	ships in 2004 to 141,000 in 2020. A quarter of the world's oil shipments pass 
                  																	through this waterway every day. Half of China's imported oil and 95% of the 
                  																	oil shipped to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan pass through the strait.</p>

              This man is really a disgrace to Singapore!
              
              Aung San Suu Kyi is actually the rightful govt of Burma:
              
              Ruled by the British from 1886 to 1948, the Burmese people went through great hardship during the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945. The infamous Death Railway was built over River Kwai during that time, at the costs of countless lives.
              
              After the Japanese surrendered, Aung San, Suu Kyi's father, became the deputy chairman of the executive council of Burma, a transitional government in 1947. But in July that year, political rivals assassinated Aung San and several cabinet ministers.
              
              On Jan 4, 1948, the nation became an independent republic, named The Union of Burma. In 1961, U Thant was the first Asian to be made the secretary-general of the United Nations, a post he served for 10 years. He made many Asians proud. Among the Burmese who worked under him in the UN, was a young Suu Kyi.
              
              In 1962, democracy died in Burma when General Ne Win led a military coup and took power for 26 years. In 1990, the military government held the first free general election for the first time in nearly 30 years.
              
              The National League for Democracy (NLD) led by Suu Kyi won 382 of the 489 seats. The military junta refused to yield power and annulled the election results.
              
              In 2006, The International Labour Organisation ILO announced it would seek prosecution of the military junta at the International Court of Justice for crimes against humanity â€“ specifically for forced labour of 800,000 people in the country.
              
              Nearly five decades under military dictatorship has taken its heavy toll on the people, while the generals get fat on the gems and natural resources, as well as from the drug trade gushing out from the Golden Triangle.

Singapore government and leader are wise and way-forward. But, people views are still lagging behind. In long term view looking only in natural resources and rice will get back-fired. That was what happened before world war II in Europe. What if now Burma’s nuclear planning becomes reality? Mr Goh seems aware of the future regional threat and he is thinking out aloud now. Politics is much more than rice and natural gas.</span></p></div>
