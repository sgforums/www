              <p>while i got that etc etc at the back of my posting ya...not only nuclear, it can be an objective to align Singapore with China in terms of economy, Mynamar can be another alternatives to China for Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taiwan..USA</p>
              <p>S Korea...USA</p>
              <p>Japan..USA</p>
              <p>HongKong...already China</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So Singapore have to be deviate itself abit from the USA perspective on mynamar inorder to create a solid International relationship with China. Afterall, our govt should have lost some faith in US economy with the lately crisis.</p>

              <p>Aung is USA educated, she is partly USA, the junta can anytime sentence her to death, but they are just keeping her as a pawn to frustrate US. During her boom period before election, she should have focus n controlled the army, but her focus was on the peoples, which are weak in gathering and co-operation. Therefore tho she was said to won the election in the early 90s, the junta can overule it with the army in their hands.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you study Mynamar peoples, they got lots of self interest in each individual, and in Mynamar, there are lots of different groups and tribes, that makes cooperation difficult and therefore revolution is totally out of the question. So much so that the west can pity their one democrat student in mynamar, they did nothing much except pressuring Asean to breakaway from Mynamar. And do you really think the west gives so much damn about her..i dun think so, they can get 2 US journalists out of N korea but cannot get her out of mynamar, that is the sad sorry for her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Morever, big Brother China is not an advocate of democracy, and yet they enjoyed Mynamar natural resources in exchange for their present there. I feel sad about her, but there is nothing much you can do, and the west only knows how to grumble and post news of all sort of nonsense. As I said, the junta can kill her anytime.</p>

              <p>Quite sad and unfortunate for Singapore to have this type of filth such as Lee Kuan Yew to be a political leader for 50 years.</p>
              <p>Other countries have political leaders where people can take pride in, can cite inspiring speeches etc, but with Lee Kuan Yew you can only cite filth.</p>
              <p>Luckily we still have some heros like JBJ, Tan Kah Kee, Lim Chin Siong, Chia Thye Poh, Ho Piao, Said Zahari etc, to inspire future generations of political leaders.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bastards like Lee Kuan Yew, who go and collaborate with Japanese, go and hide his ang moh name, go and pretend to be chinese, go and suppress the language of the majority group in Singapore, this type of filth such as Lee Kuan Yew is worse than a dog to me.</p>

              <p style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Hey! What’s happening here? George Yeo doesn’t know the Myanmar’s history, again here someone self-claimed “SE Asia Political Analyst” said Suu Kyi is US educated. No, she is not US educated; she is Oxford-educated. Oxford is in UK for those who do not know this.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">After all, fundamentally, it is not about any country base, it is about human race. The evaluation of human race becomes getting more and more polite over the thousands years. Our accentors had fought for and there are sacrifices for right against the might. One best example in human history is Jesus Christ faith in the “right” against mighty Romans and Jewish aristocrat of that time. It is not about US, UK, China nor Singapore. It is about our human race and inspiration for our generation and future generation.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We, with our clean spirit should analyst ourselves whether we are “loving the right” or “lobbying the might”. On the other hand, we selfish instinct align to the might for our own comfort and excuses. That is where the question arises to your courage of standing for the right.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ethically mind personality would not have discrete thought if someone can kill other just because one is mightier than other. Actually, No! they can’t, because back-fired will be bigger to suffer. Foolish act of mistake may do that and that ensure lead them to the destruction path. When the conflict bigger there will be innocent victims as well. That is why we need political leaders, regional leaders, world leaders and regional organizations are responsible to foresee and prevent those conflicts before they arise. </span></p>

              <p>from the start, Singpore's stance (regarding Ang Sang...) has been rather lukewarm and subseqeunt to the trial, the local media reported that Singapore's (govt) was 'dissapointed' at the outcome.</p>
              <p>What a joke! They relegated principles to the dustbin so as to benefit or not lose out economically.</p>
              <p>For, goodness sake - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't preach</span> about good governance, principles, accountability, the rule of law and so on so forth to Singaporeans. It is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">insulting and downright hypocrisy</span>.</p>
              <p>PS - One who knows that a crime is taking place and not doing anything about is simply put are guilty to the crime of complicity.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I noticed Singapore is still seeing politics much like business. Singapore government and leader are wise and way-forward. But, people views are still lagging behind.</span></p>

              <p>No,u are wrong!!!Its the exact opposite,most Singaporeans thinking are way forward,but Singapore government n leaders are lagging behind.This is particularly true in all dictatorial or communist countries.</p>
              <p>I dont know why u want to say the opposite.Judging from your forum name,my guess is that u are probably Westerners.Why u want to side our dictator government?You will get benefit from our corrupted PAP government?What is your intention?Is it becoz u Western countries already liberated,now all becomes democracy,thats why u want Asian countries ppl to suffer in dictator ruling?</p>
              <p>Let me tell u,if dictatorship can work in Asian countries,n those dictators find out a way to do it.It will soon spread like a "Virus" towards Western countries as well!!!History tells us that nothing will remain unchanged,so if we remain slaggish n contented,we will get replaced.Look at Athen,the most ancient democracy state,they also thought that their democracy will last.But also get defeated by dictatorial state like Sparta n Macethonia.</p>
              <p>So,if dictatorship can work here,sooner or later,some greedy n selfish ppl from your "Homeland" will copy the exact "formula" n implement in your countries.And u will taste the exact feeling of how we feel!!!Dont forget,this is the age of "Globalisation",even if Westerners thought that their democracy foundation is solid,but like i said before,nothing will remain unchanged.And if given a chance,Western democracy can fall if they feel contented n reluctant to help the rest of the world to shake of the influence of autocracy.</p>
