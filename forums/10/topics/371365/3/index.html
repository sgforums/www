              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I noticed Singapore is still seeing politics much like business. Singapore government and leader are wise and way-forward. But, people views are still lagging behind. In long term view looking only in natural resources and rice will get back-fired. That was what happened before world war II in Europe. What if now Burma’s nuclear planning becomes reality? Mr Goh seems aware of the future regional threat and he is thinking out aloud now. Politics is much more than rice and natural gas.</span></p>

              <p>And also,Burma will more likely to develop nuclear weapons in autocracy government than it is under democracy government.Look at what Iran n North Korea trying to do now,n u will know what i mean.</p>
              <p>And if Burma militia do develop nuclear weapons,it will cause more threats to the world stability in the hands of autocracy government than democracy government.So,u better think twice before siding them!!!</p>

              <p><br>Do not get misled with what you see from outside the glass window, which will be different when actually seen from behind the glass.</p>
              <p>A piece of glass distort the view, and with clever engineering into the glass, your perspective can be altered to suit someone's agenda.</p>
              <p>"Fair election" in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>This will be the biggest joke if you understand what Singapore Election involves.</p>
              <p>Firstly, the list of Citizens eligible to vote in Election 2006 - was 2,147,840 Citizens, and yet only 52.3 per cent will have the opportunity to participate in the Election.</p>
              <p>Second, the Election cannot be fair when the election boundary to determine the perimeter limits of the Constituency is only finalised less then 7 days before the final date for the Election is announced.</p>
              <p>Third, the boundaries of the various constituencies are secretly determined after careful study of the results from the last election. The size and actual demarcating lines of the constituency will be determined with the purpose of diluting the supporters for the Opposition Partes as seen from the last election.</p>
              <p>Fourth, can any Election process be fair when after dissolving the Government and Parliament - the incumbent party continue to exercise Executive Powers to place the print and broadcast medias under political controls, denying the other Alternative Political Parties fair access to reach out to the Electorate, and not allowing the News Reporters the space and liberty to write honest news reports.</p>
              <p>Does a population of 3.5 Million Citizens need 85 Members of Parliament - all in an island Republic that is no bigger then the City of New York ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What the eyes see - may not necessarily be the real thing.</p>

              <p><br>Do not get misled with what you see from outside the glass window, which will be different when actually seen from behind the glass.</p>
              <p>A piece of glass distort the view, and with clever engineering into the glass, your perspective can be altered to suit someone's agenda.</p>
              <p>"Fair election" in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>This will be the biggest joke if you understand what Singapore Election involves.</p>
              <p>Firstly, the list of Citizens eligible to vote in Election 2006 - was 2,147,840 Citizens, and yet only 52.3 per cent will have the opportunity to participate in the Election.</p>
              <p>Second, the Election cannot be fair when the election boundary to determine the perimeter limits of the Constituency is only finalised less then 7 days before the final date for the Election is announced.</p>
              <p>Third, the boundaries of the various constituencies are secretly determined after careful study of the results from the last election. The size and actual demarcating lines of the constituency will be determined with the purpose of diluting the supporters for the Opposition Partes as seen from the last election.</p>
              <p>Fourth, can any Election process be fair when after dissolving the Government and Parliament - the incumbent party continue to exercise Executive Powers to place the print and broadcast medias under political controls, denying the other Alternative Political Parties fair access to reach out to the Electorate, and not allowing the News Reporters the space and liberty to write honest news reports.</p>
              <p>Does a population of 3.5 Million Citizens need 85 Members of Parliament - all in an island Republic that is no bigger then the City of New York ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What the eyes see - may not necessarily be the real thing.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>First, only those 21 and above are eligible to vote</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, the one who holds the power speaks otherwise chaos will take over.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Third, the one who currently holds power have the rights to play a home game thereby determine the consituencies partisan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fourth, when parliament dissolved, the President shall overlook all issues, all laws and orders shall be maintain as per se until the next govt is form and 1st meeting is called upon to elect the PM and so on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fifth, with more MPs, we can be closer to you and look after all in a more efficient condition. In a way, we make sure that all can be taken care of. Comparing of political condition with other countries is not a wise action as others have their own problems and issues.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally, the eyes is only the window to your soul, if your brain dun agree with what the eyes see...bless your soul.</p>

              <p>I have to highlight this.</p>
              <p>Good administration?No,we dont have.If u setup a small business of your own or have some problems with NEA n HDB these type of government department.They will simply ask u to follow their rules(which their rules changes from time to time n are unreasonable n usually inflexible),or they will ask u write in to those ministers n even so,they will still reject your requests.</p>
              <p>As for jobs seeking,they will ask u to attend some stupid skills upgrading programme n obtain a certificate(mind u,even a security officers nowadays also must have a cert lol).And these programme are usually not "on job training",meaning after training,there is no guarantee that u will have a job.And also,it need around 2 weeks then u will get notified whether u have sucessfully apply for the course n another 2 weeks then can attend the course n around months before u can re-enter the job markets again.</p>
              <p>So your so-called "Good Administrations" are lack of efficiency n flexibility,and also,unreasonable n stupid from time to time.</p>
              <p>As for fair election,i believe some forumers here have already told u that we dont have one.</p>
