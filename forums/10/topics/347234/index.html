              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: No playgrounds or covered walkways in new
              HDB estates. Nor any barbecue pits. New flats should have very basic
              floor tiles, meanwhile.</p>
              <p>It
              is hardly the usual call from Members of Parliament (MPs), who tend to
              push for upgrading in their constituencies. But two among their ranks
              are making the call for “no—frills” housing.</p>
              <p>According to Dr Lim
              Wee Kiak and Ms Lee Bee Wah, this should be an option for home buyers
              and one way to provide more affordable housing.</p>
              <p>Dr Lim’s
              residents in Sembawang, for example, have told him HDB flat prices are
              high and younger residents who want to move out of their parents’ homes
              after marriage find it hard to do so.</p>
              <p>“Many of them have just
              started work and may not have so much cash,” he told TODAY. “You’re
              giving them a chance to build something simple, and over the years when
              their salaries increase, they may want to improve their homes.”</p>
              <p>When
              he first raised this in Parliament on Friday, Dr Lim gave the example
              of flat prices in the 1970s: S$15,000 and S$20,000 for a three—room and
              four—room flat respectively. A graduate with a starting salary of
              S$1,000 could pay off his apartment with 15 to 25 months of his pay, he
              said.</p>
              <p>But today, though their starting salaries are three to five
              times higher, the prices of new flats have shot up “10 to 30 times”, he
              added.</p>
              <p>“A high cost of housing has many repercussions as it
              results in higher costs of living, reduction of resources for other
              pursuits such as education and investment,” he said.</p>
              <p>His solution, he envisions, would lower construction costs and allow flats to be sold for “well below S$100,000”.</p>
              <p>But covered link—ways, playgrounds and other upgrading works can be done later when the estate is more mature, he added.</p>
              <p>Echoing
              his views, Ms Lee (Ang Mo Kio) said HDB “should avoid building flats
              with too many value—added features”, which should be left to private
              developers.</p>
              <p>When contacted, other MPs had mixed feelings,
              however, about whether there is a place for no—frills flats in
              Singapore’s public housing spectrum.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir
              Ris—Punggol) said the biggest gripe, instead, among couples he has
              spoken to is the long waiting time for a new flat.</p>
              <p>The no—frills
              idea may also not appeal to younger buyers, who aspire more and are
              more demanding. “They’re more well informed and have specific demands
              for the quality of life they want,” said Mr Teo.</p>
              <p>Mr Zaqy Mohamad
              (Hong Kah) was concerned that owners who do not like having the bare
              minimum might “start hacking and doing it up all over again”.</p>
              <p>“I
              don’t think people are saying 'give me no—frills’, but they’re asking
              for cheaper alternatives,” he said, and suggested that three—room flats
              — with quality — would be good for younger couples.</p>
              <p>“I think we should create more supply in that segment,” he said. “They can always look at upgrading options later.”</p>
              <p>In
              his Parliamentary reply on Friday, National Development Minister Mah
              Bow Tan said HDB will launch about 3,000 flats for sale in the first
              half of this year, of which 1,400 will be studio apartments, two— and
              three—room flats. There will be 4,000 of such flats launched over the
              next two years.</p>
              <p>“We’ll increase the supply of smaller and
              lower—priced flats further if necessary to meet the demand from the
              lower income group,” he said.</p>
              <p>Dr Lim had other suggestions as
              well: Price homes based on cost rather than matching them to market
              conditions, and shorten the lease from the current 99 years.</p>
              <p>Some home hunters welcomed his call for no—frills flats.</p>
              <p>Technician
              Chen Yi, 29, got married in November and is staying in a Woodlands
              executive flat with his wife, parents and two siblings.</p>
              <p>Mr Chen
              has been looking for a matrimonial home but has been unsuccessful
              because prices of resale flats have been out of reach, and he does not
              want to wait several years for a new flat.</p>
              <p>“I don’t mind if my
              home has just one bedroom and a hall,” he said. “Even if it’s cramped
              like those apartments in Hong Kong, I don’t care. I just want a place
              where I can have privacy.” — TODAY/yb</p>

              Yes, HDB's policies should change to basic like those in 1970s. The flooring of the flats had no tiles.  There were children playground with just swings and seesaw. Most tenants laid mosaic tiles in the kitchen and vinyl tiles in the living and bed rooms. Tenants were not allowed to change the main doors, iron grilles which were already provided by HDB.  They were other restrictions too. These flats were heavily subsidized according to HDB and meant only for Singaporeans. Every few years, the prices would increase and only after the approval of parliament.  Newly married couples like me in 1970s were happy to own the flats.  
              Fulltime National Servicemen were given priority in the allocation of flats.  
              I urge HDB to seriously reverse their policies back to basic.
              Singaporeans with higher expectations can book private condos.  HDB flats should be meant for the masses with lower expectations.

              <p>SINGAPORE: No playgrounds or covered walkways in new HDB estates. Nor any barbecue pits. New flats should have very basic floor tiles, meanwhile.</p>
              <p>It is hardly the usual call from Members of Parliament (MPs), who tend to push for upgrading in their constituencies. But two among their ranks are making the call for “no—frills” housing.</p>
              <p>According to Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Ms Lee Bee Wah, this should be an option for home buyers and one way to provide more affordable housing.</p>
              <p>Dr Lim’s residents in Sembawang, for example, have told him HDB flat prices are high and younger residents who want to move out of their parents’ homes after marriage find it hard to do so.</p>
              <p>“Many of them have just started work and may not have so much cash,” he told TODAY. “You’re giving them a chance to build something simple, and over the years when their salaries increase, they may want to improve their homes.”</p>
              <p>When he first raised this in Parliament on Friday, Dr Lim gave the example of flat prices in the 1970s: S$15,000 and S$20,000 for a three—room and four—room flat respectively. A graduate with a starting salary of S$1,000 could pay off his apartment with 15 to 25 months of his pay, he said.</p>
              <p>But today, though their starting salaries are three to five times higher, the prices of new flats have shot up “10 to 30 times”, he added.</p>
              <p>“A high cost of housing has many repercussions as it results in higher costs of living, reduction of resources for other pursuits such as education and investment,” he said.</p>
              <p>His solution, he envisions, would lower construction costs and allow flats to be sold for “well below S$100,000”.</p>
              <p>But covered link—ways, playgrounds and other upgrading works can be done later when the estate is more mature, he added.</p>
              <p>Echoing his views, Ms Lee (Ang Mo Kio) said HDB “should avoid building flats with too many value—added features”, which should be left to private developers.</p>
              <p>When contacted, other MPs had mixed feelings, however, about whether there is a place for no—frills flats in Singapore’s public housing spectrum.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo Ser Luck (Pasir Ris—Punggol) said the biggest gripe, instead, among couples he has spoken to is the long waiting time for a new flat.</p>
              <p>The no—frills idea may also not appeal to younger buyers, who aspire more and are more demanding. “They’re more well informed and have specific demands for the quality of life they want,” said Mr Teo.</p>
              <p>Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah) was concerned that owners who do not like having the bare minimum might “start hacking and doing it up all over again”.</p>
              <p>“I don’t think people are saying 'give me no—frills’, but they’re asking for cheaper alternatives,” he said, and suggested that three—room flats — with quality — would be good for younger couples.</p>
              <p>“I think we should create more supply in that segment,” he said. “They can always look at upgrading options later.”</p>
              <p>In his Parliamentary reply on Friday, National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan said HDB will launch about 3,000 flats for sale in the first half of this year, of which 1,400 will be studio apartments, two— and three—room flats. There will be 4,000 of such flats launched over the next two years.</p>
              <p>“We’ll increase the supply of smaller and lower—priced flats further if necessary to meet the demand from the lower income group,” he said.</p>
              <p>Dr Lim had other suggestions as well: Price homes based on cost rather than matching them to market conditions, and shorten the lease from the current 99 years.</p>
              <p>Some home hunters welcomed his call for no—frills flats.</p>
              <p>Technician Chen Yi, 29, got married in November and is staying in a Woodlands executive flat with his wife, parents and two siblings.</p>
              <p>Mr Chen has been looking for a matrimonial home but has been unsuccessful because prices of resale flats have been out of reach, and he does not want to wait several years for a new flat.</p>
              <p>“I don’t mind if my home has just one bedroom and a hall,” he said. “Even if it’s cramped like those apartments in Hong Kong, I don’t care. I just want a place where I can have privacy.” — TODAY/yb</p>

              Good idea! Some people like simplicity. Use your creativity to decorate the place.
              
              No frills means cheaper. Can pay housing loan faster so more savings for old age, more money for babies etc. If one's income increases, then upgrade later.

              <p><br>ya, upgrade again and govt earn again, save all money to go with you into yr coffer. After more babies, upgrade again, then govt earn again...might as well be more daring and buy one landed property, stay there and hv decendents, price will go up and can sell at good prices, and when old, decendents will look up to you as a wise old rich papa or grandpa with asset and cash in hand to give away.</p>

              <p>Look at those poor ah peks, most got childrens, but all neglected them, cos he no saving, no asset, childrens also dun care, no money, no daddy.</p>

              Some people are against reversing back to basics like in 1970s.  But most of us,then, did not have debts except the mortages with HDB flats.  Before we retired, all the loans with HDBs were settled.  Most of us, have extra cash to withdraw when we reached retirement. 
              Look now, HDB flats are so expensive that most of you cannot even retire.  The mortages will eat up all your CPF moneys.  Is this is what you want?  Work until you died just because you want bigger HDB flats with frills, etc. 
              Think my dear young people.  Live according to your means and walk with pride.  Retire gracefully with no money problem.

              20 yrs ago, my 5-rm (mais) HDB costs $114K plus, comes with ceramic tiles, playground etc, within a few yrs. we manage to settle our housing loan.  
              Nowadays 5-rm costs over $400K ($600K if built by pte. developer), salary don't increase much, work your whole life to pay, nothing left for retirement.
              That's why Singaporeans are asset rich but no $$$$
