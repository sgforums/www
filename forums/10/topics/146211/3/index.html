Let's put it in this way: there's no real system of a reward moltivation system. Plus in order to be an officer, they dun look at ur leadership ability, they actually look at your education cert! So ITE people will get nowhere coz they onli hv ITE diplomas!<br><br>And nowadays NS pple very bo chap. They dun give a fark about things. they do things, yes but coz they dun have a choice. If there's a war, these are the people who will run away first. Why? Because they don't give a flying fark at the 1st place.<br><br>Why defend a system that discriminates you by your background at the 1st place? Even I'd refuse to defend this govt in times of war. For my family and friends, yes. But for LKY and his PAP idiots? No way in hell will I do that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I never said once that NS wasn't benefictal. I only said we need to respect Singaporeans who are in NS.<br><br>My view is that NS soldiers should get paid more for their service to the nation, period. As simple as that. We know that NS is a service to the nation, we know that it has benefits for men in Singapore. We all know all of that.<br><br>The only thing I'm asking of you is this: NS people need a fairer system. They need more pay. They need something to motivate them. This system doesn't give them enough respect and enough money for survival. What's wrong with giving them more money each month to survive?<br><br>Is that wrong? Sure they will learn things in the army, as I will do, but they deserve to eat and survive as anyone else does. That's why we need to increase the pay of NS men in the army- the first and foremost of any reform in the NS system.<br><br>And where to get the money? Simple- cut down on the salaries of the bloated civil service and the government itself and use the saved money for the salaries of the NS men. In addition, the over-investment of excess military hardware can be diverted to help increase the salary of every NS men.<br><br>I don't believe in <strong>allowances</strong>. As long as you are servicing the nation, it also means you work for the nation. And as long as you work for the nation and its people, you deserve a <strong>salary</strong> as any other citizen would do.<br><br>Its as simple as that.</div>
