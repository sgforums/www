            <div class='col-md body'>Does anyone feel that NSF are underpaid? Why do we serve NS? Some people think that to make sound nicely is to defend our country, but to make it sound bad it is that we are being used by the government as cheap labour. Singapore do not the manpower to run the entire army operations and therefore use cheap labour such as us to help run the army for 2 years. We are paid allowances with our own money! through taxes. Government is smart to ultilise the NSF to consistency run the army at a cheap budget. Therefore do you people think that NSF should be paid at least 75% salary of the job nature he is doing depending on which vocation and post and appointment in professional term. Our 2 years of youth are being abused by the government to help their understaffed army maintain its operational readiness, do you think we should be paid more fairly? Please advise</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are lucky that you are now paid $500 for being a corporal. My bro was paid only $300 plus half a decade back and he had to serve 2.5 years. But I do agree that SAF should pay according to the qualifications of the NSF. This will boost the economy and hopefully encourage professionalism. For the very simple fact that most employers do not recognise army time as work experience, the NSF should be compensated.<br><br>But of course the above is just wishful dreaming.<br><br>Your wish will not come true.
