'Some of the crops are practically ready to eat, but I guess safety is more important.'<br><br>Farmers on five other plots were facing the same heartbreaking task, one that will eventually see 200 tonnes of vegetables dumped.<br><br>The farm plots in the Lorong Semangka area of Sungei Tengah were collateral damage from a Republic of Singapore Air Force training exercise on Nov 23.<br><br>The elite Black Knights aerial display team was testing red dye used to create a plume of smoke from the exhausts of their F-16C jets, but some was blown over crops, trees and vehicles.<br><br>Mr Wong discovered the problem last Tuesday when he saw that his farm netting was speckled with red spots.<br><br>The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) stepped in and told farmers on Friday night that all their crops had to be disposed of.<br><br>Dr Paul Chew, AVA's deputy director of veterinary public health, said: 'We have to take the precautionary measure...as the dye is not meant for consumption.'<br><br>Vegetable prices are not expected to be affected. The 200 tonnes of produce - about 10 lorry loads - that will be incinerated in Tuas comprise less than 1 per cent of Singapore's consumption, said Dr Chew.<br><br>Farmer Tan Bock Tat, 40, will lose 1.3ha of crops but he remains business-minded: 'The price of vegetables is very high now and I hope we will be compensated at market rates.'<br><br>A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'We are in direct contact with the affected farms. All reasonable claims...will be considered and compensation paid accordingly.'<br><br>Vehicles were also affected. Mr Jason Sia, 29, unemployed, said his white Honda Civic was covered with droplets.<br><br>'I might have to polish it, which will cost $60 to $100. Worse still, I might need to repaint it,' he said.<br><br>Four other vehicles in the area were also affected.<br><br>Mindef has a hotline for queries: 1800-760- 8844.<br><br>shulis@sph.com.sg<br><br>mavistoh@sph.com.sg<br><br>Safety is uppermost<br><br>'It's such a waste.

I felt reassured when Mindef officers visited my farm to see how they could help,' he said.<br><br>Talk of a cash payout comes amid continuing efforts to uproot and destroy crops such as kai lan, kang kong and cabbage at the six affected farms in the Lorong Semangka area in Sungei Tengah.<br><br>The AVA said that workers began clearing vegetable plots last Saturday and work should be completed tomorrow.<br><br>Mindef has extended a helping hand to residents who live around the RSAF's largest fighter aircraft base, which is in Lim Chu Kang.<br><br>Colonel Darius Lim, Mindef's director of public affairs, said Mindef's hotline has received 27 calls since the incident. Most callers asked how the red spots could be removed.<br><br>The red dye was released on Nov 23 when, at around 2pm, the engine of an F-16C on the ground was left running for about 20 minutes, so that the effects of the red smoke could be seen.<br><br>The plume that emerged was blown south-east across the fenceline by strong winds.<br><br>Straits Times readers who live as far away as Dunearn Road in Bukit Timah and the Teck Whye area also complained of cars and clothes speckled with red spots.<br><br>A resident of Jalan Jambu Ayer, off Dunearn Road, was so alarmed that she called the police. This resulted in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), togged up in air-tight suits designed to handle hazardous materials, showing up at her doorstep to check the mystery stains.<br><br>An SCDF spokesman confirmed the incident and said that investigations showed that the dye had come from the RSAF air base.<br><br>Addressing health concerns, Col Lim said that trials have been suspended. He assured the public that 'the amount of red dye deposited will not cause adverse health effects when inhaled or when in contact with the skin'.<br><br>Mr Jason Sia, 29, said the stains remained even after he had hand-washed his white Honda Civic twice. 'The spots are too many to count,' he said.<br><br>When told about Mindef's helpline for car owners, Mr Sia said: 'It's better than nothing.'<br><br>dboey@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>
