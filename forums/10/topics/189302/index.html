As long as the PAP plays dirty 3th world politics, we will never have the best government in power. So we must make a stand and vote in the opposition so that Singapore can progress and we can, for the sake of our children, have the best government in power.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>things might not be as good as pap in continous power, but didn't pap start from that too? with passion and commitment to serve the people? what the government is lacking are these attributes. if the opposition can provide the same sincere desires than there is always room to learn and progress when they are in power (together with the people), i feel its better than the stalemate pap is having.</div>

What's so different about not-WP compared to opposition? They have PHDs and Masters and Honors. Now opposition also have what. They work for Singapore. You mean opposition won't work for Singapore meh?<br><br>I tell you the only difference. The not-WP has governmental experience. 40 years worth of it. That can be a good thing or a bad thing. Good thing is, they know all about the problems of running a country. Bad thing is, they've been there so long, we don't know if all the problems are resolved or some policy time bombs are waiting to blow up in the future (remember Suzhou?). Also they've become complacent. We _are_ grateful to them. But they should not take our support for granted.<br><br>I ask you, which political party in anywhere in the world is not business friendly nowadays? Even Communist Party of China machiam become Capitalist Party of China already.<br><br>Why do people, as you say, engage in this 'game of chance'? It is a by-product of the brilliant strategy of GRCs. The not-WP is entrenched in these super-constituencies, so people feel that a seat or two is inconsequential. If you need someone to blame, you only need to look in the mirror.<br><br><blockquote><br>What are the differences bewteen citizens of spore and other banana third<br>world countries?<br><br>Spore is a free country.Feel free to vote lah.<br><br>Whatever will be,will be.<br><br>May the Almighty give the wisdoms to voters,even free thinkers.<br></blockquote>Sorry hor, I atheist.</div>
