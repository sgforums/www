              <p>If you want to make the comparison i'd say the Malaysian Chinese tend to prefer Singapore to Malaysia (at least those that i've talked too) for the simple reason that they're not discriminated here and can progress on their own merit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I won't say that the minorities are being marginalized but they are being neglected by the PAP government since they want us to move towards being more China friendly. They naturally have a disadvantage to the local Chinese because of that.</p>
