            <div class='col-md body'>If the situation is such that our public transport system is crap...for eg: bus always arrives late, bus always arrives in pairs, driver is rude, accident statistics are high etc etc, then we have every reason to complain over such frequent fare hikes.<br><br>Nobody like an increase in prices but let's face it. Improvements in technology, cost of living and capital purchases are combining to make public transportation a seriously expensive industry. Coupled with the increase of oil prices, you have rising costs battering down your turnovers.<br><br>Upping the prices is merely the next logical step. While we can do away with items like TV mobile (i consider it a complete failure as the end product does not justify the previous mark-up), we should not ignore the new 3G buses with added safety features to protect passengers and (possibly) more spacious leg room, larger capacity, smoother ride etc.<br><br>2.4% increase when computed with 60 cents works out to a 1.44 cent increase. Take that factor and compare to various prices will show abt a 2 cent mark up.<br><br>For the price we pay and the improvements SBS transit and SMRT are lobbying, it is a reasonable proposal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps, public transport fare increases may not be such an illogical thing if, service standards of buses improve. Currently, buses still arrive late, or come in double, and there is never a seat in shuttle services. And bus drivers are still very inconsiderate by driving irratically, such as applying brakes hard causing passengers to loose balance.<br><br>All these technological advances in bus service amounts to nothing if the drivers employed are rude, speaks only Mandarin  or Hokkien, and are generally impatient with pasengers. Where is the advance then?<br><br>Like this, we pay more and more for the same crappiness.<br><br>Next, Taxi.<br><br>Just look at the way most taxi drivers drive on our roads; cutting into lanes of other motorists, stopping suddenly to pick up passengers or dropping passenger off. Not signalling, tailgating, speeding and weaving in between lanes on the expressways. Currently accident rates for Taxis are still high. Where's the advance?<br><br>Why should we be paying more for more of the same crap??</div>
