              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Dear Singaporeans,<br> <br>I have been reading the comments in the Temasek Review and here are some of my thoughts on democracy.<br> <br>Democracy exists in several shades and hues – from liberal to sinister to diabolical.  Ask Robert Mugabe or Kim Jong-il.  Democracy is characterized by:<br> <br>·         “majority rule”;<br>·         rule of law; and<br>·         separation of powers.<br> <br>Within the 3 characteristics we find:<br> <br>a.      Freedom of expression<br>b.      Social and political tolerance<br>c.      Civil society and<br>d.      Accountability and transparency<br> <br>An essential process in liberal or representative democracies is competitive elections that are fair both substantively and procedurally. Freedom of political expression, freedom of speech and freedom of the press are essential so that citizens are informed and able to vote in their personal interests.<br> <br><strong>Liberal democracy</strong><br> <br>Liberal democracy or constitutional democracy is the dominant form of democracy in the 21st century. The term “liberal” in “liberal democracy” refers to adherence to the ideology of political liberalism.   Liberal democracies feature constitutional protections of individual rights from government power.<br> <br>There is general agreement that the states of the European Union, Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Canada, India, Israel, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand are liberal democracies.<br>Structure<br> <br>According to the principles of liberal democracy, the elections should be free and fair, and the political process should be competitive. Political pluralism is usually defined as the presence of multiple and distinct political parties.<br> <br>The liberal democratic constitution defines the democratic character of the state. The purpose of a constitution is often seen as a limit on the authority of the government. The  European and American political traditions emphasize the separation of powers, an independent judiciary, and a system of checks and balances between branches of government. <br> <br>Many European democracies emphasize the importance of the state that follows the principle of rule of law. Governmental authority is legitimately exercised only in accordance with written, publicly disclosed laws adopted and enforced in accordance with established procedure.</p>
              <p><strong>Political stability</strong></p>
              <p>One argument for democracy is that it is a system where the majority can remove administrations, without changing the legal basis or the constitution. Democracy reduces political uncertainty and instability.  It assures citizens that they will be given a regular chance to change the government, or policies they disagree. This is preferable to a system of violent political changes.<br> <br>Some think that political stability is excessive or undesirable when a group remains in power the same for too long.<br> <br>In the past, it was feared that democracy could be easily exploited by leaders with dictatorial aspirations. However, the actual number of liberal democracies that have elected dictators into power is low.<br> <br><strong>Loyal Opposition</strong></p>
              <p>The notion of a “loyal opposition” exists in various Commonwealth realms.  In the United Kingdoms it is termed formally as Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition and informally as the Official Opposition, with the head of the largest opposition party – that which holds the second largest number of seats – typically designated as the Leader of Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition.<br> <br>Some other advantages of democratic government structure<br> <br>1.      The freedoms and rights of the citizens in liberal democracies are usually seen as beneficial.2.      Democracies are more often associated with a higher average self-reported happiness in a nation.3.      Democracy correlates with a higher score on the human development index and a lower score on the human poverty index.4.      Democracy, parliamentary systems, political stability, and freedom of the press are all associated with lower corruption.5.      A democratic system may provide better information for policy decisions.</p>
              <p><strong>Democracy in Singapore</strong><br> <br>Mr. Daniel Adelman, US Ambassador-designate to Singapore has admitted that Singapore is not a democracy and replied that the United States must engage Singapore on these issues:<br> <br><em>“My view is the United States must engage Singapore on these issues. You identified the area where, quite candidly, Singapore needs the most improvement if it were to live up to the ambitions Americans have for democracy. Make no mistake, currently Singapore is not a multi-party democracy, and I intend, if confirmed, to use public diplomacy to work towards greater press freedoms, greater freedom of assembly and ultimately, more political space for opposition parties in Singapore to strengthen Singapore into a multi-party democracy.”</em></p>
              <p>The Economist Democracy Index ranks Singapore as 82nd in the world in terms of democratic development, below neighbors such as Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.<br> <br>Reporters Without Borders ranks Singapore 133rd out of 175 for press freedoms. </p>
              <p>Quoting one founding father, Lee Kuan Yew:<br><em> <br>“But we either believe in democracy or we not. If we do, then, we must say categorically, without qualification, that no restraint from the any democratic processes, other than by the ordinary law of the land, should be allowed… If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally. If you believe that men should be free, then, they should have the right of free association, of free speech, of free publication. Then, no law should permit those democratic processes to be set at nought, and no excuse, whether of security, should allow a government to be deterred from doing what it knows to be right, and what it must know to be right… “-</em> Legislative Assembly Debates, April 27, 1955<br><strong> <br>Conclusion</strong><br> <br>In conclusion, Singaporeans understand the necessity to democratize Singapore; the advantages of an open society – freedom of expression, social and political tolerance, civil society and rule of law, separation of powers, loyal opposition and finally happiness.  Can we make it happen?<br> <br>Yours sincerely,</p>

              <p>Dear Mr Richard Lu,</p>
              <p>A too open liberal society can bring a society in it knees, freedom is dangerous if one cannot handle it properly, it can destroy 50 years of national building to a chaotic society of tomorrow. Everything had it limitation, if you give your childrens too much freedom, they can turn bad, on the other hand, too strict can make them rebellion, simply applying it in our society, we need to set limit, abit freedom, a bit strictness, even the US of A cannot deny that they must have certain restriction to everything, freedom, democracy and liberalisation applied differently across the Globe, as long as work and show result within a framework of non violence and prosperity for all, that every country is consider successful.</p>
              <p>If the American are good democratic peoples or named themselves as leader of democracy, there will not be so much psychotic and willow peoples around,there, and in america, a lawyer is a good job, because the openess of rights had lead to so much libel suits here and there for sake of money and not democracy. How they treated the red indian of american and the blacks of New Orlean can truly tell you they are a pack of wolves, if that Hurricane Katrina had striked on NY, all would be saved. No wonder, Ayotallahs of Iran use to say, American have the biggest mouth. And yet you as a typical Singapura citizens dare to quote a an US envoy, who has all the immunity in his rights. He can said what he likes, and fart what he love.</p>

              <p>There does not exist any country in the world which can fit these (textbook) definitions of "democracy", which are based on outdated views.</p>
              <p>The political system in each country is so nuanced, the culture and people so diverse that trying to impose these terms onto a particular country would result in a distorted view of their political system.</p>
              <p>In any case, why is "democracy" deemed the preferable political system for every country, besides the fact that "democracy" can be defined as well as the "sublime" can be defined? Why do majority of people associate "democracy" with "good", with maybe another textbook political system as "bad", falling into the primitive duality of good vs evil?</p>
              <p>As is most of our social institutions, the concept of "democracy" only exists in textbooks and in the minds of human beings. I'm not sure what your stand is but labeling the US a "democratic country" is a bad joke even if we consider the emptiness of the term.</p>
              <p>Consider the revolving door between American corporations, especially the financial sector and the government, the culture of militarism in the US, and the blatant disregard the people in the government have for the working Americans. That sure isn't a country where the People is in charge.</p>

              <p>if we r fully democratic on Pastor Rony's case...we r right that he deserved punishments (but it must be politically and socially calculated) ....and if we were to base on personal anger and affections or biases toward certain religions...we are in fact leading ourselves towards a dangerous path - accumulating religious hatred of all kinds....the majority must see the security and stability society in terms of communal, racial and religious harmony as first and foremost than to allow, say, netizens or any lobbyists to raise "majority veto" without in depth social considerations....</p>
              <p>this would be no end...and the line divided will be wider...social and religious harmony would, in the long run, be stuffed with deep seated hatred amongst each other...</p>
