            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, just like to take this opportunity to voice out my frustrations and bad encounters with an optical shop in Tampines.<br><br>Here is what happened:<br>I patronised the shop last December 2004 and I purchased an Oakley spectacle with lenses.  1st time I went to collect my specs was on 17 Dec 04 and found out that there was a scratch on the left side of the lens when I reached home. I returned the spectacle to the optical shop the next day.  The staff said they would replace for me.<br><br>2nd time, one week after, I went to collect and was then told that the left side of the len had a black spot on it.  They said will replace for me again and was told that it would be ready before Christmas.<br><br>3rd time,  I went to collect my spectacle and found that there was a scratch on the right side of the len. At that point, I requested to speak to the branch manager, but the staff told me that she was off that day and could not be contacted. The staff said gives them another chance to redo the spectacle and I agreed for them to redo a new spectacle, with a new frame and new lens, and have it delivered to my home or office when it was ready.<br><br>4th time, a few days after, the branch manager delivered the new spectacle to my office. I checked and found that a small lens logo was imprinted on the left side of the len and the frame had a manufacturing defect. Can anyone tell me whether they have any len logo on their spectacles?  I rejected it and requested for a refund. The branch manager said they will use another new Oakley frame and redo the lenses and if there are any more defects, she will give me a satisfactory compensation. I agreed.<br><br>5th time, 16 Jan 05, I went to optical shop to collect the spectacle, only to find out that the fitting of the lens were not done properly.  The branch manager attended to me and helped me to re-fit the lenses but ultimately the lenses do not fit with the new frame.  She said she will give me the full refund but I felt that it is not a fair compensation because of the time and effort spent in collecting the spectacle and even after a month the spectacle is not ready.<br><br>Sigh, I will not go to any of this chain of optical shop anymore.  And I urged those ppl who wants to patronise this shop to think twice.  The quality of lenses are of such poor standards.<br><br>Am I being treated fairly?  I wonder....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just look at it from the shop's perspective. They spend hours on you having to make 5 different spectacles for you and finally had to refund you. In the whole process, they have wasted time as much as you do and have wasted $$ because the rejected goods cannot be sold. So, they did not gain out of this deal. In fact, they probably lost more than you do.<br><br>So, given this, do you think they have handled the whole thing quite well (putting aside from the question of workmanship)?<br><br>In fact, I think they are service-wise great, but technical skill wise doubtful.</div>
