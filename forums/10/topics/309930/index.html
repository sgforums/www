              <p>"alamak, there was a very minor incident at upper boon keng hawker centre today but it was very sad there were two OLs at the next table from mine and one of them had ordered a jia jia liang teh to wash down her lunch barely had she poured the drink into her plastic cup when an old man appeared and tried to take the can but when he realised the can still had liang teh, he put it back and waited fpr her to finish her drink the OL was quite annoyed because she thought the old man's hands were dirty and dirtied her drink, so she didn't want the rest meanwhile, the old man kept waiting</p>
              <p>then another oldie, this time a woman, came and tried to take the
              can, and the two old folks started arguing with each other over who saw
              the can first the OLs got fed up and left without finishing their meal then the char siew rice stall owner came out and scolded the two old folks for making a scene and chasing customers away</p>

Frankly they could have put in a little more effort of at least asking - can i have the empty can !!! <br><br>Next is some of these collectors have a very bad habit - they take the can and just step it beside you ... yep they trying to flatten it so more space for cans in plastic bag .... !!! Can't they collect a few then go somewhere further to flatten them ? <br><br>Also those selling tissues .... man !!!

              <p>unfortunately, this is a common malaise. not sure why they are a neglected lot. i am in china now for work for the week, and a common sight i see in the last 5 days when i am on the pavement walkways are old folks rummaging trash bins for plastic bottles.</p>
              <p>in some ways, it depresses me. here they co-exist in a country where the young are so expressive and aggressive in their day to day life. they are left behind as china go forward. these old men/women who go about their slow pace rummaging from 1 bin to another are invisible to the rest of the people. they are sadly forgotten and neglected.</p>
              <p>who's responsible and what is the right thing to do? i sadly do not know as well.</p>

              <p>young ones too...i have encountered young school girls (12-13 years old) pretending to be out of cash and need $2 for the ride home. best part is, they seems to be out of cash ever so often because i see them at the same location every other day preying on the unsuspecting. and they asked you point blank too.</p>
              <p>very bold.....</p>

              <p>Hi guys and gals,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any idea where to find can collectors in Singapore? We are thinking of doing a documentary on what happens in a typical can collector's day.</p>

              <p>can frequently see at macritchie bus stop... got someone come over, take apart the rubbish bin, then dig out cans or magazines/newspaper, put into a plastic bag he's carrying, then continue on to other dustbins... Then walk off to the next bus stop...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>or near old clementi interchange, got 1 big big hawker centre... Frequently can see 1 old man collecting, teeth half gone one... Then he will also stamp the cans flatter so that he has more space to carry in his plastic bag.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are the places I frequent more often...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do send me a video when you finish your documentary. It would be enriching to watch. Thanks.</p>

              <p>What to do ?</p>
              <p>Our very efficient and caring gahment.. forget .. to implement the Equal Employment Opportunity Act to protect age discriminated hiring mah.</p>
              <p>In the US of A. It is illegal to ask the interviewee's age.</p>
              <p>So employers look at their experience.. capabilities and proper fit in the organization.</p>
              <p>Unlike Singapore.. if you lose your job after your mid life crisis.. be prepared to collect  cans or drive a Taxi for as long as you need.</p>
