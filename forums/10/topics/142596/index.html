He would do so every day at about 6.30am.<br><br>The father of two young children would coast down the ramp on his bicycle. But that morning, his ride came to an abrupt end.<br><br>He reportedly didn't see the inverted U-shape metal frames until it was too late. He rammed straight into them and landed heavily on the ground.<br><br>Blood flowed from his head and seeped into the cement ground.<br><br>He was not able to get up as he had damaged his spinal cord.<br><br>A kind stranger called for the ambulance.<br><br>The Singapore Civil Defence Force confirmed that it received a call at 6.53am and arrived at the scene three minutes later.<br><br>The man was taken to a hospital and admitted into the intensive care ward.<br><br>His wife was too distraught over his critical condition to talk.<br><br>She requested that he not be named.<br><br>'We're already facing a lot of pain and pressure. We don't want people to keep coming to us.<br><br>'The doctor says he has to be determined in his own mind (to walk again), so I don't want him to know too much about his condition,' she said wearily.<br><br></div>

By the time I passed by, I saw only the pool of blood. I guess he was hurt badly,' she said in Mandarin.<br><br>'The authorities shouldn't do this. In the early morning, it's too dark to see. There should be flickering lights and warning signboards,' said Madam Ngoh, who uses the bridge daily to get to Pasir Ris Park for her morning exercise.<br><br>After hearing about the accident, she told newspaper vendor Ng Eng Chai, 49, who immediately rushed to the bridge to warn other cyclists.<br><br>Mr Ng said in Mandarin: 'There was an 80-year-old man who was going very fast. If I hadn't stopped him, he would have been hurt.<br><br>'What about students? They like to race down. The height of the barriers is just right to take off a child's head.'<br><br>He took the injured man's bicycle, which has been left next to a nearby lamp post to demonstrate what could have happened. There was still a patch of blood where the victim fell.<br><br>Another resident, Mr Goh Peng Hoon, 63, said he could easily have become a victim.<br><br>'My friend asked me to talk to him at the coffeeshop, if not, I would also be cycling past here early in the morning,' said the retiree, who has been living in the area for 10 years.<br><br>About 200 people use the bridge every day, said residents</div>

I've ran across roads that I'm not supposed to.  I've tripped and fell across a chain barrier at the Tampines mall too because of that.   I don't blame the LTA for that chain being there.<br><br>I take the blame for not seeing that chain because I was jaywalking.<br><br>Simple as that  -  Don't place blame on someone else's shoulders when you get hurt doing something you're not suppose to do.<br><br>If a traffic cop had run out and stuck his foot out in front of me, that's a diff story.<br><br>Same in this case, it's not like the LTA hired someone to hide behind a bush with a rod.
