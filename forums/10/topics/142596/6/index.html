I give a 50% chance of a runnig into that steel barrier and multiply by the probablity of getting head or upper body injury when colliding into such "safety device".<br>Unlikely something advese will occur ?

Its about the FACT that such barrier is, will and had done serious damage to an ordinary bridge user.
