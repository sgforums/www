If you feel it's "poorly installed", then how would you install it?  Any lower and a bicycle can't be pushed under.  Any higher and these bull-headed, irresponsible idiots will just cycle under.  Any further out and they'll cycle around it.  Any softer and within a week someone would have broken it so they can keep cycling there.<br><br>So what?  Status quo?  We are to rely on the signs that have already been there for the last 4 years at least telling them not to ride on the bridge?   That obviously did not work.<br><br>My point is that people should learn to take responsibility for their own actions. If they choose to do things they are not supposed to and get hurt in the process, do not go pointing fingers in all other directions.<br><br>It is tragic that that man got hurt, but he would be home with his family now had he pushed his bike like he was supposed to.<br><br>Think back on how many times you've read in the papers of people gettng hurt by cyclist on pavements, etc;  Places they aren't supposed to be cycling.  Even all that still failed to appeal to these cyclists who will bend the rules to suit themselves.<br><br>When my shoulder got dislocated by a damn cyclist on that bridge, do you think he stopped?  Do you think he offered to pay for my medical bills?  No, he just picked himself up, barely mumbled a sorry and left.  What if I was an older person?<br><br>So no, it is time to take enforcement of that "no cycling on the bridge" rule one step higher than just signs on BOTH sides of the bridge, which these idiots ignored for the last 4 years.</div>

A barrier so high they can cycle right under it, or so low that they can't push the bikes under?<br><br>2) It's a ramp.  Of course if someone was to cycle down it, which I have to reiterate they are not supposed to, they will pick up speed.<br><br>3) All your arguements circle around the same thing, they will get hurt if they cycle where they shouldn't.<br><br>4) Don't give ridiculous arguements about minefields, the barrier isn't hidden ready to pop up infront of an unsuspecting cyclist who is cycling somewhere they are allowed to.<br><br>5)If anything, this would be the same as you making an illegal turn and driving so fast that you don't see a lowered gantry and hit it.</div></blockquote>1) Well, speed bumps + Lower barriers at the top +  middle of the bridge would do, i think. The person who came up with the idea surely had more time to think.<br><br>2) Yes, can't argue with gravity. Hence my remark about it being foreseeable that people will be coasting down the ramp at great speeds.<br><br>3) And what do you perceive the 'thing' is? I do not agree that people should get hurt if they cycle where they should not. That is the point i was trying to make.<br><br>4) Sorry, i really meant to say "are they going to be deploying <strong>Clearly Sign-Posted</strong> AP mines on all public roads next?". My fault.<br><br>5) Not really, no. It would be akin to driving so fast that you did not see that a road is being blocked off with a <strong>clearly sign-posted</strong> mine field.<br><br></div>
