            <div class='col-md body'>The barrier should not be so high imo, from the height of it, it looks like it can seriously injure the throat and neck area if someone were to hit it, even if its not at high speed. In fact this is an odd looking contraption as most bars to prevent cyclists from riding through are about waist height and there are 2 on each side, to allow only pedestrians to slide in between them. And lights or warning signs should be put up way before the bar to prevent such accidents from happening.<br><br>I suppose the reason for barriers is that there are some cyclists (black sheep) are just too inconsiderate. First of all, why a ramp instead of steps? Its obviously for people who are on wheelchairs or old folks who find climbing stairs hard. I dont think its for younger able bodied cyclists to zoom around in their bikes just to save time / energy. And going down the ramp is more dangerous as they have less control and cause danger to not just old folk or handicapped but normal walking pedestrians. A civic minded cyclist should get off his bike and push it across the bridge, but of course it is human nature to think about himself first before others and the way Singapore is, restrictions (similar to fines) is put in place to discipline us; because some of us dont have the brains to behave...<br><br></div>

I suppose that cyclists might be deterred from the pedestrian lane cus it moves 'slower' than the cyclist lane. I mean You're a cyclist, you come to the split into the lanes, you'd probably take the cyclist lane cause there would be people on the pedestrian lane and probably no cyclist on the cyclist lane, given the relatively low number of cyclists here anyway. Also maybe certain deterrances could be put in place like fines for cyclists who use the wrong lanes etc. etc. Of course I guess there'll always be blacker sheeps no matter what solutions we come up with ba.<br><br>Edit: I just thought of something, the cycle lane needs to allow for 2 way movement, haha... or we could just get cyclists to "Bike overhead!" when an opposing cyclist comes this way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>It is to my experience that there are many novice cyclists who, despite their dismal skill in manipulating a bicycle, still do stupid things like cycle on busy roads, cycle on pavements with many pedestrians (including women pushing prams and old folks wobbling feebly). These same black sheep (the cyclists, not the old folks), would resort to shouting and swearing to bully their way thru the crowd.<br><br>I feel that the barrier should have been installed on both sides of the ramp and not one today, and another one whenever you are free. Also, for safety, the barrier should have bright (preferbly luminous) markings on it before being painted a bright and distinctive colour rather than waiting for the price of paint to drop before painting it.<br><br>It is slipshot work on the part of the contractor to cut cost and negligence on the part of LTA on overseeing the installation.<br><br>The reason why I feel LTA should oversea the installation or removal of all equipment what so ever used for safety is because lives are at stake. If no lives are at stake, then it won't be for safety.<br><br>You can put up a multitude of signs to inform ppl not to speed, not to cycle on ramps, not to spit. You can threaten them with fines, jail and caning, but there is a difference between passing a law and enforcing it... stating a rule and ensuring it.<br><br>The barrier was supposed to ensure ppl dun cycle on the ramp. It does so by blocking the ramp, not by killing the offender. Its supposed to be easily distingushable from far and in poor lighting to deter, not to stop cyclists by making them bang into it.<br><br>I cycle up and down ramps regularly and I consider myself an advanced cyclist. I can control my bicycle in emergencies but I know this is no excuse for breaking rules.<br><br>In my capacity as a cyclist, I know that putting a barrier on a ramp will result in me having to dismount and mount, thus putting it on both ends of the ramp WILL adequately deter me. Putting it up on only 1 side means that once I'm past it, I will still cycle on the ramp. Sad but true. This is common sense. There are times when the pramatism of the real world situation voids all armchair speculations and rules.<br><br>If roads are for cars and motorcycles and pavements are for people, then bicycles can only be used in parks with the designated lanes? Then why bother getting a bicycle? Why bother getting rollerblades? In fact, why stop there? There should be designated pram lanes and old folks and wheelchair lanes least someone get hurt! What bullsh!t. Cyclist haters should try to dignify their arguments with logic and real situations, not scenes they plucked out of thin air and cartoons.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's really sad that someone have to pay such a heavy price for not heeding warnings.<br><br>LTA is as guilty as the victim for not considering carefully all the safety factors when installing those barriers. The barriers should be installed, at one go and before both ends of the ramp, so that cyclists would have to dismount from their bicycles before they get onto the ramp. And as safety, not aesthetics, is the main reason for the barriers these should be in striking colors with luminous markings.<br><br>ln fact I find some of the govt organisations really careless with safety. The slippery tiles on the newly upgraded lift landing of my block were only replaced after several accidents. Some pedestrian crossings are also situated at places where motorists least expect. I wonder whether those involved in installing fittings and fixture for public use have gone through any safety course.<br></div>
