If you feel it's "poorly installed", then how would you install it?  Any lower and a bicycle can't be pushed under.  Any higher and these bull-headed, irresponsible idiots will just cycle under.  Any further out and they'll cycle around it.  Any softer and within a week someone would have broken it so they can keep cycling there.<br><br>So what?  Status quo?  We are to rely on the signs that have already been there for the last 4 years at least telling them not to ride on the bridge?   That obviously did not work.<br><br>My point is that people should learn to take responsibility for their own actions. If they choose to do things they are not supposed to and get hurt in the process, do not go pointing fingers in all other directions.<br><br>It is tragic that that man got hurt, but he would be home with his family now had he pushed his bike like he was supposed to.<br><br>Think back on how many times you've read in the papers of people gettng hurt by cyclist on pavements, etc;  Places they aren't supposed to be cycling.

Do you think he offered to pay for my medical bills?  No, he just picked himself up, barely mumbled a sorry and left.
