We may have depended a lot on Indra Shadan, and that's why we can't score when he is not around. But give players like Shahril Ishak, Fazrul Nawaz, Ashrin Shariff, Khairul Amri a chance. They are still young, and in 5 years time, when they are around 27-28, which is the prime age for a footballer, who is to say they cannot deliver?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The success of EPL and other Major European league is that, they are expert in advertising their league. The players do tiny whiny little action, it will make the headlines of their newspaper. (Like Rooney go clubbing etc etc etc). Then when a certain Singapore talented player return late for training, he just disappear from the national team, like vanishing into the thin air.<br><br>I watched the beginning of S-League. (yea, the time when Geylang United was invincible) Then after the first season, I was like, "NB, damn sian leh. Don't have the excitement of M'Cup". So that is the time I stopped watching S-League.<br><br>During the M'Cup days, whenever there is a match, expect it to hit the headlines. Now, the result just occupy a very small section of the newspaper, it is the interest that mainstream newapaper cultivate, it is also the mainstream newspaper that killed the interest.<br><br>What can we do about this?</div>

Yet, when we look at overseas stars like Robbie Williams or Rain, we cheer them machiam like crazy. Its the same here.People tend to compare the S-League with EPL. How to fight like that?

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's face it, everything tt is wrong abt SG soccer is there to be seen:<br>1. SG is too small to have a soccer league of its own. And if it's serious about it, it has to invest in the infrastructure and put the foundation in place. Firstly, when u have a team called Geylang based in Bedok and Sengkang based in Hougang, you don't have a base fan to start with. The stadiums are not football friendly. Field is in terrible shape to allow attractive football to be played and seats are too far to allow spectators a closer-up to the action.<br>2. Administrator are run by half baked civil servant who has little knowledge about the game. Imagine a national team that couldn't even get a decent apparel sponsors in the last few years. FAS has to `cook up' a story about how Tiger beer's sponsorship was so great that it warrant having it's logo on the jersey. It's laughable and that they have not done anything to correct this embarrassment is an embarrassment in itself.<br>3. Players too are demotivated. Imagine 3 quarters of the national team consisting of Mats wearing a jersey with a logo from a liquor company. All of them sinned against their religion, man. How to play well when your conscience isn't even clear?<br>4. There is no conscious efforts to engage the citizens. Most of the time, nobody knows what's happening with the national team. Everything is by the way type of information, so the support is like-wise. However, given the number of FTs here in Singapore that diluted the loyalty and passion to the game, Singapore realistically cannot garner the type of support anymore.<br>5. As a nation of gamblers, how can the fledgling league thrive especially when it is on shaky ground....kelong here, there....soccer purists do not have faith in SG soccer.<br><br>Singapore soccer will be in the doldrums for the next 20 years or so. it will take a man of vision and conviction to wake Singapore soccer out of its sumber....</div>
