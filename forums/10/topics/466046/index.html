              <p>SINGAPORE: A comprehensive review, or a complete do—away with the Medisave, Medishield and MediFund schemes?</p>
              <p>These were some of the questions raised at a forum on Singapore’s healthcare policies.</p>
              <p>The
               forum, held at the National University of Singapore’s Tembusu College, 
              saw a panel of health experts speak on the challenges and gaps in the 
              Singapore healthcare system.</p>
              <p>Medisave, Medishield and MediFund, or
               the 3Ms, cover between 10 and 15 per cent of Singaporeans’ total 
              healthcare expenditure, said Dr Phua Kai Hong, who is from the Lee Kuan 
              Yew School of Public Policy.</p>
              <p>Some at the forum asked if coverage should be increased to lower citizens’ out—of—pocket spending.</p>
              <p>Singapore
               currently spends about <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>4</strong></em></span> per cent of its GDP on healthcare every year. 
              This is compared to an average of <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">9.6</span></em></strong> per cent for other advanced 
              economies.</p>
              <p>Several panellists called for a thorough review of the healthcare system.</p>
              <p>"There’s
               far too much emphasis on the financial sustainability of the system. 
              Often this is to the detriment of the individual patient. So the patient
               has to struggle with means testing, with going to family members to tap
               on their Medisave accounts In this national conversation, how can we 
              ensure better financial protection of the individual, even if the state 
              assumes a little bit more of this risk? If we can do that, I think many 
              Singaporeans (would be able to) genuinely have that peace of mind," said
               Dr Jeremy Lim, who is a principal consultant with Insights Health 
              Associates.</p>
              <p>"Healthcare is a basic human right; most of us do not 
              choose to get sick As a society we need to pull our risk together and 
              that’s why we believe a compulsory health insurance system, administered
               through central means, is the best way of doing this," said Paul Ananth
               Tambyah, who is an associate professor at the National University of 
              Singapore’s Yong Yoo Lin School of Medicine.</p>
              <p>However Dr Lam Pin 
              Min, who is chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for
               Health, said that there was no perfect healthcare system.</p>
              <p>"Having
               had the 3M system for the past 20 years, we (know) what they can do and
               what they cannot do. If the Ministry of Health is able to have a 
              thorough review, the 3M system (could) evolve (into) a better system," 
              said Dr Lam.</p>
