'evergreen' is actually moving part of his shipping lines back to singapore because of PSA's good port service, unlike malaysia who has got less berths than singapore. besides.. if malaysia wants to move on, i think they should stop being biased to the malays, and show equality to every group of ethical groups in the society. furthermore, i believe that, malaysia still has a long way to go, just like singapore, to establish a very stable economy and society.<br><br>need i say more? singapore's biggest enemy is the world itself, especially when China enters WTO.. it's another issue once again. in terms of cost-competitiveness, many countries would lose out to China, as it currently still has abundance of resources. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

The current economic model of Malaysia is basically a direct copy of Singapore model (undenial fact). It main economy rely heavily on foreign investment, aka as a cheap manufacturing base, but in view of other even cheaper, more abundance cheap manpower/cost-centre manufacturing base say China and Vietnam. How can Malaysia with ever increasing manufacturing cost compete?!? Facts already show that plants are moving out of Singapore and Malaysia to cheaper places in China and Vietnam. Sooner or later the AMD athlon/intel chip will show ASSEMBLED IN CHINA/VIETNAM.<br><br>In short timespan, Malaysia will also go the same route as what Singapore is experiencing now, unless it tansform itself totally into a new economic model. BTW don't rely on too much on palm oil as the commondity price is going south for the last decade. Also no need to bet too much dream as a transport hub as China become an even more important manufacturing base they will expand their own seaport/airport and do direct shipping from there, bypassing traditional seaport hubs, like what Taiwan sea/airport is experiencing now.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore has been complacent. Its not that Malaysia has "suddenly" become the next ASEAN superpower. Its just that we have not progressed up the value chain fast enough.<br><br>Take for example our entire economy. What are the pillars. We have electonics manufacturing, entreport shipping, tourism, banking, R&amp;D (just started) and retail.<br><br>Each of these sectors is under competition from Malaysia. Shipping they have Northport, Westport and PTP. Tourism, they are now able to be a niche market for Arabs. Manufacturing, just visit penang .. plenty of MNC factories there. Retail, they have sales 3 times a year. Banking .. we may have 400 banks (international) but they have a bigger client base and also an off short banking centre. (not to mention, ambitions to develop the world number 1 islamic banking centre)<br><br>On top of that, they have already started on the road to develop Education as a top revenue earner, with the number of overseas universitites setting shop. And they have Oil exports, a car industry, F1 race, Palm oil, rubber, tin and pepper.<br><br>We are still stuck on first gear .. all of our industries (except for R&amp;D in bioscience) was around during the time of independance in 1965.<br><br>They are an economic threat due to us not moving up fast enough... dare we just have wishful thinking that their Malay problems will hold them back? We better pull up our socks and move on, before we cause our own downfall.</div>

They are trying to open many sectors of industry now, manufacturing, trade, etc... and their Tanjong Pelapas already score 2 VERY well publicised victories..<br><br>However, i do not think Singapore gonna hang around and say, here, have all my clients and business.  Singapore's gonna fight back for every inch of the market.  Fr example, the IT market getting a wee bit too much already, Singapore branching out into life science, which is a very wide but expensive-to-start industry.  However, Singapore is already pouring its funds into the industry and already got so many big names here.  From the current outlook, it is very hard not to succeed in the life science industry(unless no one in singapore want to work in it)<br><br>And for those who say Singapore not developed, how come go for International Scout Jamboree a few years back Singapore scout gotta pay extra... (for those who dun understand, scouts from countries such as US, Britain, Singapore, Japan, and other developed countries have to pay extra to help sponsor the event and fellow scouts from poorer countries, and i didn't go for that if you r wondering, just that i was a scout then, back in primary school)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To euphratis<br><br>China's economy divided by its land and population also is less than Malaysia .. but no one doubts in the future that it will be the biggest in the world ..  While Malaysia is actually underpopulated compared to Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia .. and there can be greater growth potential compared to Singapore.<br><br>They are probably 1-2 years behind Singapore .. but each time they improve, we end up looking bad.<br><br>To laser51088<br><br>Singapore should have moved on to more capital intensive industries long ago. However, due to the complacency of the current PAP government (i.e sleeping rabbit vs slow and steady tortoise) we have allowed the Malaysians to catch up.<br><br>To Orcishwarrior<br><br>Multimedia Super Corridor version 1 was a failure. That model seeked to compete head on with Singapore as the regional HQ for all the MNCs.<br><br>MSC version 2 is a newer, less grand model. It seeks to "quietly" take away regional HQs from Singapore of companies that do lots of business in Malaysia. E.g DHL, Shell, Exxonmobil, BMW, GE all have shifted or will be shifting datacentres to Cyberjaya soon.<br><br>We may not be wanting to sit still and let them take away our business .. but face facts. Its NOT our decision. Its the decision of the MNCs who decide where to invest. Problem is that our small 3+1 million population is too small to sustain any business. With all these MNCs adopting a go-direct-to-customer model, the importance and reliance of Singapore will be diminished each coming year.<br><br>In Summary<br><br>Malaysia has become a threat to Singapore because we have never been an end-user. We are just a transhipment point. We have plenty of FDI because we are the best of the lot and there was no alternative. But now, there is an alternative .. so there is a threat to our existance.<br><br>Socially, we are already taking a big hit as the income gap between the elites and the middle class is growing. While our neighbours middle class is growing. They have got cars and houses. They have got plenty to eat. They have got political choice. Not bad for a third world country.<br><br>Economically, the Malaysians are able to surprise many by the sheer dedication of making progress in many fields.<br><br>The traditional industry of Malaysia was that of tin, rubber and palm oil. Indeed, the GLOBAL trading centre of the 3 commodities is in KL. But they have now branced out into tourism, car manufacturing, banking, IT &amp; electronics and education. And these happened within the last 20 years. We have lost all our head start<br><br>If Malaysia was in Europe, it would have been admited into the EU. Its economy is definately better than Hungary and Romania and those two are next to be admitted.</div>
