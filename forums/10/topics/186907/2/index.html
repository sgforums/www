            <div class='col-md body'>ST Forum<br>April 22, 2006<br>Grassroot supporters led minister away from resident who had much to complain about<br><br>I refer to the report "When 6 kids turned up at Meet-the-People session" (ST, April 19). Minister Raymond Lim was quoted as saying that what matters most to people are bread-and-butter issues rather than greater freedom and self-expression.<br><br>Grassroot supporters led minister away from resident who had much to complain about<br><br>This notion was also implied by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew in his televised dialogue "Why my vote matters" with young Singaporeans, and it was echoed by some readers who wrote to the Forum.<br><br>It appears that Mr Lim, MM Lee and the letter writers were making the assumption that freedom of expression and sustenance are two mutually exclusive issues.<br><br>I want to put forth that such an assumption is erroneous. The two are separate and orthogonal issues. We do not have to forgo one in order to have the other. Many nations have achieved both. What is preventing us from having them too?<br><br>Next, I want to focus in the same report which implied that Mr Lim learnt about what he thought the people wanted through his house-to-house visits.<br><br>I live in Block 183 Bedok North Road, which was one of the flats Mr Lim came calling a few months ago. Part of his entourage went ahead of him to knock on doors and alert residents of his arrival.<br><br>Upon finding out that I had much to complain about, they suddenly gave the excuse that Mr Lim had an urgent matter and would have to cut short his walkabout. After they left my door, I found them still going on their rounds.<br><br>I have since heard from friends who are involved in grassroots organisations that this was the usual modus operandi used by some MPs.<br><br>John Tan Liang-Joo<br></div>
