              <p><span class="postbody">In
              the first place, if the government is a responsible and caring
              government premised on a more proactive balance of needs and
              aspirations will there by so many problems like what we are seeing now
              with the rich becoming richer and the ordinary and middle-class
              citizens finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet? Will we
              reach a situation where our first-world government has to turn to
              citizens to raise charities and pay lips service to help so many fellow
              poorer citizens.
              <br> <br>If we have a more balanced type of government one which believes in
              'no free lunch" then there will be minimal taxes since people have to
              look after their own basic needs and necessities and government not
              being responsible for such services.
              <br> <br>Based on such minimalist government the spending on the people will
              be lesser and taxes could be set aside to build up a certain reserve
              from tax saving or hoarding from recovering of costs at market prices
              by all the GLCs.
              <br> <br>With such a minimalist government we could have proceeded to build
              up the reserve of a certain size by now to create jobs and restructure
              the economy to value-adding technology-based economy very much like
              Venture Manufacturing is doing.
              <br> <br>VM is only having a few good committed managers who are well guided
              in keeping a close look-out on world trends in manufacturing and coming
              up regularly with innovations to keep up with challenges.
              <br> <br>Given a more balanced minimalist government with minimal taxing and
              passing back of taxes to facilitate growths and vibrancy of the economy
              as Venture is doing we could have arrived at a truly first-world
              economy by now one which is able to sustain on its own creativity and
              innovations through motivating the people in practical knowledge
              applications in all fields.
              <br> <br>Yet we have so far taken the route of elitism promoting only a few
              so-called talents neglecting mass participation and practical knowledge
              applications (posted to Feedback Unit since 2002).
              <br> <br>If LKY is more open and inclusive he would definitely have arrived
              at a more entrepreneurial government one which is more balanced in
              collecting taxes only for what it needs while passing back maximal
              benefits to the people to facilitate restructuring to a competitive
              global economy.
              <br> <br>Have any of our ministers in charge of trade or economic
              development got their acts together before they are being branded as
              talents and being paid their million-dollar salaries and allowing them
              to make all kinds of claims as first-world government success?</span>   <span class="postbody"></span></p>

              <p>The country seems to be governed by all kinds of hypocrisies and selfish assumptions and lack of accountability as seen in issues and problems like the NKF, Mas Selamat lame escape, Shin Corp, careless and unaccountable losses of people's hard-earned monies in UBS and Merryl Lynch etc.</p>
              <p>What is so great about the ministers' so-called world-class talents and leadership in all these fiascos. There is no attempt at honesty or integrity or accountability to address all these problems.</p>
              <p>In the face of all such problems the great leaders who claim to be world-class are seen as repeating stereotyped past success stories as their forte.</p>
              <p>Let all with eyes and ears see and hear all the scams and start getting the leaders to relent and repent and do what are right for once to give all justice and equity.</p>
              <p>Like what the ordinary citizens have always said one can tell some lies some of the time to some people but not all the lies all the time to all people. The IBA has started telling our great leaders to amend and relent by not using civil defamation laws to persecute citizens for dissenting against wrongful NKF practices in running of the country.</p>
              <p>Read the thread "Minimalist taxing and Maximalist Facilitator Government" in the context of such problems as stated in the overall larger perspective and reply me if you like on logic and rationale.</p>

              <p>NKF has nothing to do with the gov... Shin corp is really losing money but it is one example... UBS and Merryl Lynch r very big banks and they r not gonna collapse soon. Lets give tis investment a few years to see if it yield or lose.</p>
              <p>Seem Shin corp is the only one deserving of notice from your example. When they r buying the share, it is not wrong because we r buying the shares from the thailand prime minister, and there is nothing illegal in the dealing, and telecommunication is a rising star worldwide. However who can expect a coup detat to arise in thailand ?</p>
              <p>It is easy for u to mention tis problem but then wat r your suggestion ? Nothing. Wat should we buy ? Wat should we invest ? How to make money in the long term ? Obama and hillary name out policies tat can help US become richer during their debate. McCain also propose how to solve the problem of the country in the debate. Now it is the time u dish out the possible good policies to help the country. Other than saying idealogical things, wat r the concrete steps to take ? Let not talk about PAP now. Lets talk about the opposition party. Wat r the concrete steps to take for singapore to make money ?</p>

              <p>I appreciate and respect how hard you are trying to make your stand robert.</p>
              <p>But the people, especially the middle class are highly educated now and would want to see and hear concrete alternatives, not constant ranting on what is. It's like complaining local oil prices are rising when it's a global phenomenom(sp?). We want to hear what we can do about it.</p>
              <p>Granted the Shin Corps thing is a debacle but it's just one of those things that you can say the government did wrong only on hindsight. Who could predict the military coup?</p>
              <p>From a financial investment standpoint, it's natural to buy low and sell high, there's not really much profit in buying the shares of a bank whose business is already booming isn't it ? Like what stupidissmart has said, give it a few years and let's see how it goes it's still too early to say they wasted the people's money.</p>
              <p>Minimalist taxing and Maximalist Facilitator Government is a nice word to throw around but it's just like the supposedly 3G army, easy to say hard to implement. I can say all races and religions should hold hands together and sing kumbaya all day long but it's not something that would happen automatically yes?</p>
              <p>You want more people to sit up and listen, then bring up issues and present concrete alternatives or better yet see if you can bring up the arguments from the oppositions which the main stream media refuse to show us. It's a lot productive than what you're doing now.  </p>

              <p>Stevenson 101,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually the issue facing the citizens today after what have happened in NKF, Shin Corp, Mas Selamat etc is whether we are still governed effectively for the good of all citizens or are we having a government which only seeks to govern on its own selfish agendas benefiting itself and the rich for its own political expediency.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at the larger picture. Is this sort of governing sustainable and good for all in the longer term.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If in the larger perspective, you can still say our present leaders are still governing well and there will be no problem at all with our rising costs being caused by an expedient government going all out to serve its own agendas, there will be no need for me or us to belabor ourselves with any suggestions or putting up any more constructive concrete plans at all. After all as you will no doubt be able to see from many feedbacks so far no citizen no matter how constructive has been able to penetrate the hypocrisies put up by the self-proud and self-aggrandizing leaders to deny any shortcomings. It seems to the end of the world they will still be biting the bullet and taking the expediency route and shove all problems down the throats of simpletons.</p>

              <p>Must I offer all the alternative solutions to the many problems like taxing and hoarding of monies and negative anti-progress and anti-people policies before I give my views on government's policies and behavior problems?</p>
              <p>Yet it is so characteristic of the government which claims itself world class to deny problems and refuses to accept responsibilities even for fiascos like NKF, Shin Corp or Mas Selamat which is merely the tip of the iceberg of problems people are currently facing.</p>
              <p>True the government has certain successes in the initial years up to perhaps the 1970s.</p>
              <p>After that it is no longer the same government but has become one which only cares for its own selfish agendas to stay in power and reward itself despite failures to restructure the economy to the value-adding and knowledge-based economy talked about for years.</p>
              <p>Read my alternative solutions to many problems as posted in another thread "minimalist taxing and maximalist facilitator government is what we want" for constructive suggestions.</p>
              <p>The truth is many alternative solutions have been put up by people over the years which are more than worthwhile to look into but has the government ever been bothered to listen or pay attention.</p>
              <p>It is the attitude of the government which is now the real issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is now found beyond all doubts that it is a government of hypocrisy of the first order.</p>
              <p>On the one hand, the leaders in international conferences often lamented our people lack of interest in politics and even wondered why our own journalists are mum in forums MM Lee was speaking in and on the other the same government will be resorting to all kinds of hypocrisy to deny answering to problems and issues.</p>
              <p>It is nothing new in what you are asking. It is the same negative government which will continue to say it will be open to views and opinions but when people do come forward to give them they will start pushing away problems and issues when confronted resorting to methods like selective comparisons with worse case scenarios in other countries or throwing back the problems at people challenging to come up with alternatives or to stand for election if they can.</p>
              <p>What sort of feedback process is this? What sort of sincerity or openness is this?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what you are asking is the same sort of hypocrisy in dealing with people's feedback processes that is all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why not just own up and so that the government has been overly paranoid and negative in its attitude towards accepting their responsibilities for failures in running of the country.</p>
              <p>It is this negative and overly paranoid attitude which causes many of our current problems like rising costs of living and our losing economic competitiveness and it is the same negative attitude which causes so much problems found in NKF, Mas Selamat or Shin Corp which in the final analysis is only the tip of the big iceberg of poor attitude characterising the whole government.</p>

              <p>If as sgdiehard has admitted it is in the final analysis a government which is governing not by rationality or interest of the people but one believing in using its power including use of civil libel laws to sue opposition politicians then it is in the final analysis of not much use giving any views or constructive criticisms at all don't you think so?</p>
              <p>So is PM Lee honestly telling the people he will work towards openness to bring about an inclusive government ?</p>
              <p>What will be the point in asking for examples of which government policies have failed as requested whenever you could not answer to the failures brought up.</p>
              <p>Obviously it is the same hypocrisy characterizing the whole government the way you are countering views critical of government policies. Where any point of criticism is of merit you will say something like talking about past success or worse case scenarios to deny the problems.</p>
              <p>To the point which catches it by the throat like Mas Selamat the reply will be "who does not make mistake let's move on" or "it cannot be equal to failure in running of a country"</p>
              <p>What else is this sort of views if such views are not sheer hypocrisy to deny problem?</p>

              <p>Let the views stand on their own merit like you said in so many posts. Do not try to intimidate any one by insinuation or name calling. If you think like sgdiehard there is no equal playing field because as government it has the right to use its power to get to what is wants then you do not need to convince us by any pretentious reasoning all will be able to see as sheer hypocrisy. Just say so there is no freedoms to give views over the net criticising the government so that all will stop posting here or replying to one-sided propaganda of  yours.</p>
