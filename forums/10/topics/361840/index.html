              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam has said it is not realistic to expect Temasek Holdings to outperform in every cycle or to avoid losses on every individual investment, or its overall portfolio when the markets go through sharp corrections.</p>
              <p>Speaking in Parliament in response to MPs questions on Temasek’s sale of its Bank of America (BoA) shares, Mr Tharman said Temasek saw a S$58b decline in value between March and November 2008.</p>
              <p>But this was after a much greater gain of S$114b in its investment portfolio over the preceding five years, from the time the market cycle began in 2003.</p>
              <p>He told the House that even after taking into account the recent sharp market declines, Temasek’s portfolio had in fact grown by S$56b based solely on returns from investments made.</p>
              <p>The Finance Minister described Temasek as a long—term investor, and stressed that that by being so, did not require Temasek to be locked into every individual investment, regardless of major changes in the environment or a new investment proposition.</p>
              <p>He told Parliament that Temasek has performed respectably compared to any relevant market indices, and even other reputable institutional investors with its total shareholder returns of an average of over 15% per year.</p>
              <p>Mr Tharman added that Temasek has operated successfully over the last six years, and it will continue to keep to its discipline, maintain a diversified portfolio, and keep its sights on achieving long term returns.</p>
              <p>—CNA/sf</p>
              <p>+++++++++++++++++++++</p>
              <p>If it is his money that Temasek is losing I don't think he will talk like that.    So to say there is no need to have any accountability.</p>
              <p>Botak tharman is another substandard product by PAP.     Since he took over as Finance Minister, all we hear is noise from him.     Good for nothing!</p>

              <p>The botakhead is forgetting that the money he is talking about is PUBLIC MONEY, Yes losses is unavoidable in a turmoil market. But what about transparency? They had to be pressurised and lambasted then they decide to reveal losses, if that is the true figure. Any corporation whose CEOs or CFOs or any type of management will be fired if they make huge losses. What about Temasek? I only see a "retirement" and a medal given for the idiot who is responsible fully for the losses: its CEO</p>

              <p><cite>Channel NewsAsia - <span><strong>Thursday, May 28</strong></span></cite></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam has said it is not realistic to expect Temasek Holdings to outperform in every cycle or to avoid losses on every individual investment, or its overall portfolio when the markets go through sharp corrections.</p>
              <p>Speaking in Parliament in response to MPs questions on Temasek’s sale of its Bank of America (BoA) shares, Mr Tharman said Temasek saw a S$58b decline in value between March and November 2008.</p>
              <p>But this was after a much greater gain of S$114b in its investment portfolio over the preceding five years, from the time the market cycle began in 2003.</p>
              <p>He told the House that even after taking into account the recent sharp market declines, Temasek’s portfolio had in fact grown by S$56b based solely on returns from investments made.</p>
              <p>The Finance Minister described Temasek as a long—term investor, and stressed that that by being so, did not require Temasek to be locked into every individual investment, regardless of major changes in the environment or a new investment proposition.</p>
              <p>He told Parliament that Temasek has performed respectably compared to any relevant market indices, and even other reputable institutional investors with its total shareholder returns of an average of over 15% per year.</p>
              <p>Mr Tharman added that Temasek has operated successfully over the last six years, and it will continue to keep to its discipline, maintain a diversified portfolio, and keep its sights on achieving long term returns.</p>
              <p>—CNA/sf</p>
              <p>+++++++++++++++++++++</p>
              <p>If it is his money that Temasek is losing I don't think he will talk like that.    So to say there is no need to have any accountability.</p>
              <p>Botak tharman is another substandard product by PAP.     Since he took over as Finance Minister, all we hear is noise from him.     Good for nothing!</p>

              <p>Interestingly enough, the stellar growth in portfolio from S$100 million (1960s) to the current S$127 billion is not entirely due to investment growth, it's more like capital injection from MAS (CPF funds). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note that on the balance sheet side of CPF we have a loan of S$118 billion to MAS, MAS then loans the money to Temasek and GIC. We can't really determine the exact amount because of secrecy with Temasek's account. Somehow or rather Temasek and MAS has to make goods those interest of CPF members in the future. Then one has to also consider where does the money from over priced HDBs go to?</p>
