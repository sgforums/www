His ways of governing spore is only suitable in the 70s to early 90s.The pool of talented sporean will not submit and buy his idea so easily.

Wouldn't it have looked funny that he voted to dismiss himself? Unlike certain thick-skinned Ministers who sit on the Board of Directors of certain companies while negotiating for the Employees of the same company against the management and claiming "absolutely no conflict of interests", I think Capt Goh recognised his connundrum here.

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, a gentle reminder before reading the following text: Judge the message, not the messenger. I myself don't like CSJ, and don't agree with everything he says. But he does have a point here.<br><br>===============<br><strong><br>SDP blasts Govt on pilot's PR revocation </strong><br>10 March 2004<br><br>The revocation of Captain Ryan GohÂ’s permanent residence status brings the PAPÂ’s infamy for vindictiveness and pettiness to a new low. The pilot was well within his rights as a member of the Alpa-S to do whatever he could to influence the decision-making process of the union.<br><br>Whether he is a Singaporean or not, has a house in Perth or not, or has sold his HDB flat for a profit or not is no business of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his ministers. What matters is whether Mr Ryan Goh acted within the parameters of his role as a member of the pilotsÂ’ union.<br><br>Will the Government tell Singaporeans whether Captain Goh has trespassed any law in Singapore or was his offence merely one in which he crossed the Senior Minister? What are the deeds or misdeeds of Mr Goh that led the Government to say that he is an Â“undesirable immigrantÂ”?<br><br><span style="color: red;">Should the mere fact that he is only a Singaporean PR but having a say on issues affecting Singaporeans matter? If it does, then what about the foreigners (who may not even have PR status) who sit on the board of the National Wages Council to determine the wage levels of workers in Singapore? Does the hypocrisy even occur in the mind of the Government or has PAP become so callous through all these years of having no opposition to challenge its unjust ways? </span><br><br>Not only have the authorities not have the guts to tell Singaporeans the real facts but it now absurdly asserts that the pilotÂ’s Â“(PR) status does not have anything to do with his role in last yearÂ’s ouster of the pilot unionÂ’s executive committee.Â” Singaporeans may have been silenced. But they are not dumb. The day will come when the voices of the people will be heard and the PAP will have much to account for.<br><br>It is inconceivable that in this present time when Singaporeans need to think independently (and yes, this includes disagreeing with the PAP Government) and act on oneÂ’s belief, the Government remains so pig-headed and resorts to petty nit-picking and personal vendettas. This will no doubt intimidate Singaporeans even more, if that is possible, and give the PAP yet more control but it will drive another nail into the coffin that carries the entrepreneurial can-do spirit of the country.<br><br>The PAP would do well to remember the old adage: You reap what you sow.<br><br>Chee Soon Juan<br>Secretary-General<br>Singapore Democratic Party<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am apalled by the fact that LKY can get his hand on so much information even before the meeting. I believe he had conducted thorough studies into the private lives of the people involved in this matter. He can even tell whether his daughter is comfortable studying in Australia or not... Now I am wondering if he is conducting studies on people that had expressed their views freely here...<br><br>I don't know how you all feel by is getting PR of other countries really that "unloyal" ? Can we really classified singapore citizens with PR status of other countries as bad sheeps ? Does getting PRs while maintaining his own citizenship indirectly mean one cannot be a leader of union or leader of a society in Singapore ?</div>
