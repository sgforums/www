The 'smear campaign' is always employed as and when it is an opportune time to do so. In any organisation, so long as you have been blacklisted for whatever reasons, the management reserves the right to sack you with extreme prejudice. That includes covering you in whatever dirt they can dig up, even if it means invading yur personal life.<br><br>In this case, the gahmen has activated the clause of 'undesirable character' inside a section of the permanent resident's fine print to remove Cpt Goh from living here.<br><br>As it is, 'undesirable character' is extremely general and could mean a variety of things; clearly our gahmen is not at liberty to humour us with details or how they came to that decision.<br><br>It only serves to highlight the high-handed nature of several ruiling politicians within our inner cadre who will not permit 'instubordination within the ranks'.<br><br>Perhaps this issue will serve as a stark reminder to our emerging youths not to place too much future support in our govt so freely.<br><br>Oh by the way atobe, it's chiang kai shiek airport (i know it in mandarin but think i got the spelling wrong here)</div>

Which no less than President Ong failed to get the PAP to finish.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>i haf quite alot of confidence tt the government is not corrupt and not mis-using funds,<br></strong></blockquote>I reserve my judgement on that either way, until more accountability is inbuilt into the system.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>although they r not doing a real good job in their PR and showing accountability (they may be accountable, but not showing as such). the veil of secrecy should perhaps be lifted. they need not be so defensive all the time. i think singaporeans r mature enuff to noe more.<br></strong></blockquote>Well said, and as events have seen, ours is a Ruling Party which cannot be relied on to reduce its paranoia and secrecy unless pushed, and pushed very hard. And that is the reason why Singaporeans must continue to keep pushing for greater accountability and transparency in the system. And to do that more awareness must come from Singaporeans. For too long, we have assumed OUR MONEY is safely in the right hands, with nothing in the way of concrete proof, other than the promises from the government, that this is happening.<br><br>I believe Singaporeans are ready for this as a people, the problem is, is the Ruling Party?<br><br></div>
