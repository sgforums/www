              <p><span class="postbody"> The government has over the years been using propaganda to paint a picture as if without the authoritarian leadership of LKY everything will fall into
              chaos. </span></p>
              <p><span class="postbody">Nothing can be further from the truth. Today people have matured
              with education and travel etc and they do know what are rights and
              wrongs although they do not generally express them in public.
              <br> <br>Just talk to a group of reasonably educated people and you will be
              surprised they have quite good ideas what were right and wrong with our current government policies and what would be good for the nation going
              forward.
              <br> <br>What are need now is active ongoing political evolution to a model which will capture the good and reject the bad. It will take some years before people will fully realize the goodness of democracy. It is only with democracy all citizens can play a greater part in nation building and we could again feel the confidence and buzz in every aspect of our national life.</span></p>
              <p><span class="postbody">Active
              citizens play an important role here. As a young nation we have yet to
              be given the chance to mature and benefit from the full goodness of
              democracy such as that of the Westminster model.
              <br> <br>We should stop blindly listening to all the past and current propaganda of the government that western democracy is no good which will cause instability. Such
              propaganda has been driven into our national consciousness so much over
              the past 40 years that many have believed in such propaganda.
              <br> <br>Look at the democracy being followed by Scandinavian countries,
              Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan or Hong Kong. They have achieved much progress without causing so much problems to their ordinary citizens because their citizens are motivated to play a greater role in contributing to nation building which in our case is totally claimed to be the achievement of the power that be.</span></p>
              <p><span class="postbody">system of government
              people are more motivated and more civic minded and contributing to
              greater stability and progress to their nations.
              <br> <br>On the other hand more and more tyrannical and authoritarian
              regimes everywhere are causing oppressions and great suffering and even
              genocide. <br> <br> I am afraid our authoritarian rule is too deteriorating by the days
              with the press media timidly reporting good news while active citizens
              are giving up playing their positive role as seen in the more advanced
              democracies which our leaders carefully avoided comparison with.
              <br> <br>Our brand of authoritarian governing system disguised as
              Westminster democracy is bringing about a deeply divided and fractured
              society and people are frustrated with all the power play and arrogance
              and callousness of the whole system relying only on power to get its
              way.
              <br> <br>If unchecked it will lead to instability, explosions
              or implosions. At least 10 citizens who have the means are migrating
              every day as they see little or no future in such an authoritarian
              rule.
              <br> <br>Even foreigners who took up PR or citizenship here may not stay
              cohesive or loyal being interested in coming here for their jobs as
              they eventually will be just as unhappy with oppressions seen every day
              in the way government is running this place for its own selfish
              interests and agenda.
              <br> <br>If our leaders sincerely want to avoid chaos they should ease off their suppressions and oppressions and let citizens be free to play their role in upholding justice and equity or freedoms of choice in electing their government. <br> <br>What solution do we have as a people? I have suggested in other thread we should go back to the original
              institutional Westminster model which will work better balancing the
              need for leadership with accountability and responsbility.
              <br> <br>People will stay as master not the servants in such a system. They will be empowered to exercise their role again to vote good MPs of their free choice but be forced by GRCs into all the walkovers and from such people power we will proceed to evolve our own best political system most suitable for us.</span></p>
              <p><span class="postbody">and give power to MPs to choose
              their best to be PM and there should be no hidden power in anyone to
              diectate deviations from such institutional safeguards against abuse
              for whatever leadership or paranoid reasons.
              <br> <br>Let us active citizens ponder over the full goodness of
              institutional Westminster Model which contains all the proper check and
              balance which is the only way to motivate all the work together to
              build our own good model eventually.
              <br> <br>Abolish the GRC. Expose all the selfish or self-centred propaganda
              against democracy. Open up and let all citizens have equal opportunity
              to participate in election or be freely permitted to stand election
              without all the impediment from the GRC.
              <br> <br>For those who constantly rail against democracy as being the cause of stablility and chaos I will say that this is only a propaganda or excuse to continue the authoritarian rule which does not benefit the ordinary people.Â  On the other hand if any system is the cause of instability it is not difficult to see that authoritarian is the most likely to bring ruins and chaos and not stability.</span></p>
