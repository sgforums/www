              <p>One thing is for sure, most literature, both anti- and pro- PAP establish Lim Chin Siong's faction to be pro-Communist. Whether Lim was a Communist or not, that is probably something we won't find out for sure.</p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thum.org/oxon/archives/000592.html"> ‘ Evidence at the Colonial Archives shows the British officials admitting he wasn't a communist. To them, however, he was something worse: an extremely popular Singaporean patriot who was fiercly anti-colonial and would not ensure the protection of British interests and security after independence.’  </a></p>
              <p>During the 1950s, the British Colonial Government in Singapore - with the advise from the British Internal Security Department - had determined that Lim Chin Siong was NOT a Communist.</p>
              <p>The bogey of Lim Chin Siong being a Communist has been LKY's often used method of dealing everyone who pose a political threat to his political legitimacy since the 1950s and the practice continue till this day - (ref: the Catholic Marxist Conspiracy).</p>
              <p>LKY's method is getting stale as the archives in the British Colonial Office will reveal more of the real History that debunk his 'ONE Man perception of how Singapore History should be written for Singaporean perception of his legacy'.</p>
              <p>If there ever was a Communist in Singapore, it will be LKY - as seen in the way he has shaped the PAP to govern Singapore with all the Stalinist Communist methods to ensure the legitimacy of only a ONE-Party Rule, the use of the Police to prevent the growth of political opposition and public political dissension, the false charges against political opponents that lead to their imprisonment, and the false political education of an equal society that stops at the door of Politics.</p>

              <p>Lim Chin Siong was first imprisoned under the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Operation_Coldstore">“Prevention of Public Security Order (PPSO).”. </a>with the arrest carried out by ISD officers following the Hock Lee Bus riots with the support from other industrial strikes and the Chinese Middle School protests.</p>
              <p>While Lim Chin Siong's arrest was disguised as a legitimate process of ridding Singapore of trouble-makers, it was nothing more then a political process of shutting honest voices against those who prefer to create political schemes to achieve dubious political ambitions.</p>
              <p>Prior to the formation of the Malaysia, the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya - Tunku Abdul Rahman - had insisted that those whom he sees as "Communists" in Singapore should be neutralized, and that the British Colonial Government should give up Sabah and Sarawak before agreement will be given to have Singapore as part of the Federation of Malaysia</p>
              <p>The Internal Security Council was formed with a majority of its representatives being from the PAP Government, while there was only one British Colonial Government Representative.</p>
              <p>The Colonial Archives now reveal that LKY had suggested that the British Colonial Government take full responsibility for the arrest of Lim Chin Siong and other political antagonists - so as to absolve the PAP from being resented by Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>It also reveal that the Hock Lee Bus riots was instigated by Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock with the Trade Union activist Lim Chin Siong being largely blamed for the riots and led to the detention of Lim Chin Siong.</p>
              <p>Such diabolical political schemes and double dealings are not uncommon that will lead political partnership amongst the most unlikely rivals.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articlelimchinsionghistory_part1.html"> “A declassified British memo revealed that Lee Kuan Yew was secretly a party with Lim Yew Hock in urging the Colonial Secretary to impose the ‘subversives ban' </a></p>
              <p>After a short detention from his first arrest in 1956, Lim Chin Siong was released, arrested again prior to the formation of Malaysia, and re-arrested again under Operation Coldstore for the third time in 1961 - after he broke off from the PAP which he and LKY had founded.</p>
              <p>Was Lim Chin Siong exiled by the British Colonial Government ?</p>
              <p>No.</p>
              <p>During his long detention mostly in solitary confinement and taunted with release if he signed a confession - in the same manner as Chia Thye Poh had revealed - Lim then suffered mental depression and negotiated with LKY to be exiled to Britain with his own volunteered commitment never to return to Singapore politics.</p>

              <p>After a short detention from his first arrest in 1956, Lim Chin Siong was released, arrested again prior to the formation of Malaysia, and re-arrested again under Operation Coldstore for the third time in 1961 - after he broke off from the PAP which he and LKY had founded.</p>
              <p>Was Lim Chin Siong exiled by the British Colonial Government ?</p>
              <p>No.</p>
              <p>During his long detention mostly in solitary confinement and taunted with release if he signed a confession - in the same manner as Chia Thye Poh had revealed - Lim then suffered mental depression and negotiated with LKY to be exiled to Britain with his own volunteered commitment never to return to Singapore politics.</p>

              <p>One thing is for sure, most literature, both anti- and pro- PAP
                                                          establish Lim Chin Siong's faction to be pro-Communist. Whether Lim
                                                          was a Communist or not, that is probably something we won't find
                                                          out for sure.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>There is no evidence to show that Lim Chin Siong was communist.</p>
              <p>He is a socialist, a left wing politician.</p>
              <p>PAP when they talk about the left wing faction inside their party they always use the term "pro-communist" to demonise them when in fact they were acutally the more left wing faction and Lee Kuan Yew was the right wing faction.</p>
              <p>But PAP was set up as left wing party, but later Lee Kuan Yew betrayed the original cause and turned right wing and supported british interests, so the left wing split from the PAP.</p>
              <p>The story is this you see, there were two important elections in history of Singapore, one was in 1959 and the other in 1963.</p>
              <p>When the PAP came to power in 1959, the people voted for them based on their left wing and anti-colonial credentials.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew used the left wing people such as Lim Chin Siong to gather votes.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew himself was not that popular at the time. He was baba, couldn't speak dialect, got ang moh name.</p>
              <p>According to declassified documents, Lee Kuan Yew was already scheming inside the party to get rid of Lim Chin Siong and the left wing as they were by then too popular and posed a threat to his power.</p>
              <p>Later after Lee Kuan Yew became prime minister in 1959 he began to cooperate more closely with the british and serve their interests. The left wing faction within the PAP did not agree with this and there was a struggle for power, like the AWARE saga.</p>
              <p>In 1961, the left wing finally split and Lim Chin Siong set up his own party, the Barisan Socialis. The PAP at the time of this split was actually greatly weakened.</p>
              <p> The next general elections was in 1963.</p>
              <p>But on Feb 2 1963, the entire left wing movement in Singapore was crippled by the operation cold store, the important memebers were all arrested.</p>
              <p>This gave an advantage to Lee Kuan Yew to win in the 1963 GE.</p>
              <p>So, we can say that in the history of elections in Singapore, this Lee Kuan Yew always resorted to unfair and dirty tricks to win.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chin Peng, the secretary general of Malayan Communist Party said that Lim Chin Siong had no contacts with his party.</p>

              <p>The differences between Lee Kuan Yew rule of Singapore and Lim Chin Siong rule of Singapore is not that difficult to imagine.</p>
              <p>One is a baba, cannot speak native dialect, got ang moh name. Due to these insecurities, he later suppressed dialects, closed down chinese schools and imposed alien language, alien culture on the people, content to see dialect die off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lim Chin Siong was a native Hokkien, had immense popular support and defended local culture and dialects.</p>
              <p>He wouldn't go and suppress dialect.</p>
              <p>He wouldn't go and close down chinese schools.</p>
              <p>He wouldn't impose alien language, alien culture in the way Lee Kuan Yew did.</p>
              <p>In other words, he would had forged a stronger Singaporean identity based on local culture, not alien language and culture.</p>
              <p>The nation building process would had strong roots, strong foundations.</p>
              <p>Singapore would had developed maybe into a Taiwan-like society, since the Hokkiens were dominant in both countries.</p>
              <p>We would had been proud of such a state, of such a society, of such an identity.</p>
              <p>But then where would anglo dogs like Lee Kuan Yew be in such a society?</p>
              <p>That is a good question.</p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>The two men also discussed the issue of culture, he added.<br></em></p>

              <p><em>"Singapore now is economically advanced, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but politically backward</strong></span> ...
