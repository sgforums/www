              <p>He is just an old anglo bastard dog to me.</p>
              <p>He is the cancer of Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Former president criticises suppression of dissent</strong></p>
              <p>IN the Singapore of the early 1980s, Lee Kuan Yew was
              the captain and Devan Nair his loyal lieutenant. Mr Lee, independence leader,
              then prime minister and now senior minister of the tiny Southeast Asian
              city-state, laid down the law. Mr Nair followed it. As head of the national
              trade union congress, then president of Singapore, he loyally parroted
              the "LKY" line on the importance of social order, the dangers
              of Western-style democracy and the evils of littering.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Then, in 1985, came a shocking break. Mr Lee told Singapore's parliament
              that Mr Nair had resigned because he was an alcoholic, a charge Mr Nair
              now calls a baseless slur.</strong></span> Three years later, he left Singapore for good
              after publicly quarrelling with Mr Lee over the arrest of a well-known
              government critic. Then he dropped from sight.</p>
              <p>For the past few years, Mr Nair has been living quietly in Hamilton,
              Ontario. He has given no interviews and made few public statements. "I
              thought it was unseemly for a former president to go whacky-whacking his
              country," he says.</p>
              <p>Those days of silence are over Mr Nair has decided to speak out against
              the continuing suppression of legitimate dissent in his country. And so,
              last week, he sat down in the sun-lit drawing room of a friend's house
              near Hamilton to talk about Lee Kuan Yew, how they drew apart and what
              he thinks of Mr Lee's Singapore today.</p>
              <p>Now 75, Mr Nair is a compact man with a mischievous smile. Sipping a
              glass of water, he speaks in a plummy baritone that commands attention.</p>
              <p>Mr Nair got to know his "captain" when the two were fighting
              to free Singapore from British colonial rule in the 1950s. A teacher whose
              father emigrated from India, Mr Nair taught Shakespeare while he was a
              member of the Anti-British League, an irony he still savours. When the
              British threw him in jail as a subversive, holding him for a total of five
              years, Mr Lee was his lawyer.</p>
              <p>The two remained close after Singapore won its freedom from Britain.
              Together, they fought off an attempted communist takeover, weathered Singapore's
              ejection from the neighbouring federation of Malaysia and transformed their
              country from a run-down sea port to an economic dynamo bristling with skyscrapers.
              "I supported him because he was an eloquent champion of the dreams
              I had for Singapore," Mr Nair says.</p>
              <p>But as Singapore grew prosperous and stable and the communist threat
              faded, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mr Nair began to have doubts about his captain's iron-fisted methods.
              Perhaps sensing his ally's doubts, Mr Lee asked Mr Nair to leave his power
              base as head of the trade union congress and move into the presidential
              palace. As Mr Nair puts it, "He kicked me upstairs."</strong></span></p>
              <p>Being president, he says now, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>was "the silliest job in the world.
              All you had to do was cut ribbons." His frustration grew.</strong></span></p>
              <p>But before he could speak out, Mr Nair found himself at the centre of
              a rumour-mongering campaign that labelled him a drinker and womanizer.
              He says he was neither, and he suspects that Mr Lee had government doctors
              slip him hallucinatory drugs to make him appear befuddled.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"Lee Kuan
              Yew decided: This man is going to be a threat, so I'd better begin a total
              demolishment of his character. He's very good at that."</strong></span></p>
              <p>A case in point: the recent battering of Singapore's most determined
              dissident, J. B. Jeyaretnam. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore doesn't lock up its critics any
              more; it sues them, instead.</strong></span> Mr Jeyaretnam has faced countless libel suits
              from Mr Lee and other members of his government. If the party doesn't pay
              the damages in the most recent suit, the government hints it will ask the
              courts to shut it down, a move that would oust Mr Jeyaretnam from parliament.</p>
              <p>That, says Mr Nair, is an outrage. Mr Jeyaretnam has shown "indomitable
              courage and dignity in the face of the vilest persecution."</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why didn't Mr Nair challenge his leader at the time? That question has
              haunted him ever since. </strong></span></p>
              <p>"I was prone to hero worship and he was our
              captain," he says, lowering his head. "Even when I began to feel
              uneasy, loyalty to the captain superseded all other feelings. That was
              my weakness."</p>
              <p>Mr Nair is not bitter. He gives Mr Lee credit for making Singapore a
              wealthy, stable place, an accomplishment in which he is proud to have shared.</p>
              <p>But how much greater that accomplishment would be if Singapore were a wealthy
              stable democracy.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>To him, Singapore today is a soulless place whose only
              ideology is materialism.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Whether he could have changed that, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mr Nair wishes
              now he had spoken up earlier.</strong></span></p>
