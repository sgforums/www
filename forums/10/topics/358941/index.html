              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">When it was clear to me <a href="/forums/8/topics/270654">(from 2006/2007 "click to link")</a> that there will be major upheavals in Singapore's economy and the PAP government was more interested in making policies to benefit self and party, I was one of their fierces critic (to put it mildly).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">While the economy is still very weak and might get worse.... the stock market has rebounded, meaning the economy might get better even if we see sluggish activities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Singaporeans are known to care only whether they have a job.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If they have a job, they will vote PAP.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>

              <p><br> Fact remains that the opposition haven't been able to present much
              other than the blame game. I'm not interested in knowing what the
              PAP did wrong, i'm only interested in knowing what the opposition
              intend to do different when they're in place.</p>
              <p>Instead of expecting that the mentality of the locals
              change to suit some Western ideal of freedom, equality and
              liberty which frankly is unreasonable, perhaps the opposition
              should change their tactics to suit the expectations of the
              locals.</p>
              <p>LKY will die sooner or later, given his age that's going to be a
              fact. And i doubt LHL has the stones to hold PAP together after
              that.</p>
              <p>The people i mix with are not interested in when the
              PAP will be oust out of power, but rather the aftermath
              - what the Opposition (Now the Dominant Party) will
              do AFTER they get in power?</p>
              <p>No one really likes the PAP, but the opposition
              has done little to show that they are capable
              of better ideas.  The anti PAP here thinks
              by posting the dirty linen of the PAP we would all suddenly be
              enlightened and embrace the opposition.</p>
              <p>The majority of Singaporeans i think are not stupid, all
              are capable of voicing their own opinions and capable of
              identifying propaganda and facts, they are not at all surprised at
              how dirty the PAP and the Lees can play. </p>
              <p>The Opposition are not good enough because they are taking the
              wrong strategy. They assume by exposing the ill dealings of the PAP
              we would support them when the fact is most have already expected
              it.</p>

              <p>In general, singaporeans are just too conservative to allow new party to take over them.  They just whine, crap and that is it.    I have a friend who voted for the opposition and yet commented that the oppositions are not good enough.    For a new party to take over, the mentality of the locals have to change.   </p>

              <p><br>Conservative? Why should SIngaporeans let another political party which is just as hopeless as PAP take over? This is 21st century but we are still stuck in 19th century politics. The mentality of the locals does not have to change, it's the quality of the alternative parties have to change. What is wrong with expecting quality when there is a political changeover?</p>

              <p><br>cool down.  there is nothing wrong to expect quality for political changeover.   that is why I am expecting opps to do more than protest.  they need show more of what they can do for the people.  </p>
