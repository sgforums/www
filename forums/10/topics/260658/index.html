The recent case where several barges and tugboats were detained by the Indonesian authorities, one of the Singaporeans is my friends dad. He is held in jail without protection. He is beaten everyday, not by the police but by the fellow prisoners. The indon separated the sinkaporeans into different cell with more than 30s other prisoners. Imagine the fear they have to go through. My friend's dad begged the authorities to give him some form of protection, yes they can provide but with a price. Its US$1000 per night of protection. After some arrangements, the official took US$10K and for days no one lay hands on the poor dad. But after 7 days he got transfered to another cell and got beaten up again. This time the first cell officer said, the new cell doesn't belong to him so he cannot control. Its madness!<br><br>So more bribes $$$ were presented but his dad's health and mental suffered.<br><br>What I want to put across is! If Sinkapore government cannot give any form of protection or guarantees to us why ask us to go there for work? His dad is just a worker doing his job, he doesn't know that granite chips with some sand is ban!<br><br>Our country is small and constantly bullied by our neighbours but we still have to be "friendly", givein to their demands. Its time Indonesia get their pay back, stop all our charity and reduce our trade with them. Its not that we don't help them as Nation but just don't be too eager to help!<br><br>As for my friend's dad, he is back in Sinkapore and this experience leaves a very deep scar in his heart. Never go work in Indon! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>C'mon Sillypore is smart to keep quiet...whether the country does things quietly to get back at Indonesia is open for debate but certainly you will not have open war....<br><br>Anyway, many of us have packed our bags and left should anything happen here....but do note this....Indonesia is not to be trifled with....corruption is a way of life there and the sooner you accept this the better....in fact...it keeps things going and makes life easier for us businessmen....<br><br>Indonesia may look week but bear in mind just this one fact....their Kopassus..or indonesian marines are trained to swim the 80 odd km in full pack from batam to here should anything happen...now consider that</div>
