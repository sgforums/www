              SDP used to be good and strong under the leadership of Cham See Tong.  It spiral downwards since Chee Soon Juan took over.

              <p>Â Was the SDP ever strong under the leadership of Chiam See TongÂ ?</p>
              <p>He never healedÂ the long running internal strife between himself and his Chairman Ling Howe Doong that split the party into twoÂ camps.Â </p>
              <p>The Chairman and the Party Members hadÂ resented ChiamÂ for his soft stance and lack lustre performance in Parliament towards PAP policies, and not giving much needed supportÂ to JBJ when there were 2 or 3 Opposition members in Parliament.</p>
              <p>Chiam was criticised by his own SDPÂ rank and fileÂ for his unusually warm andÂ cosy relationship with the PAP that became obvious in his performance as the leader of the Opposition after JBJ was knocked out of Parliament.</p>
              <p>In fact, the internal resentment spilled out into the public arena with the recruitment of CSJ into the SDP as the Assistant Secretary-General to Chiam.</p>
              <p>Chiam did not even give his support to defend CSJ - when CSJ was accused by his Faculty Head forÂ dubious corruption chargesÂ for claiming more then the usualÂ taxi fares by $1.50+ Â andÂ postages that cost no more then $30 over disputed contents mailed to some foreign universities - and all approved ONE YEAR BEFOREÂ  CSJ entered the political arena on the side of the Opposition.</p>
              <p>Chiam's actions drove a wedge between himself and his SDP members, and they gave him a vote of No-Confidence - which led to Chiam to respond in his own unique ways that led the SDP Chairman, the SDP Executive Council and the General Membership to collectively vote him out of the SDP.</p>
              <p>Did Chiam build a strong SDP ?</p>
              <p>Without challenging the PAP - can Singaporeans be politicallyÂ educated, or will Singaporeans commit political suicide by evolving into political apathy, go into deep political slumber and allow the PAP to do as they like ?</p>
              <p>It is through SDP'sÂ strong willedÂ political activismÂ that has resulted in the inch-by-inch regaining of political grounds being returned to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Without the political battles fought - and the political embarrassment caused to the PAP Government for the hypocrisy of their propagandaÂ claims to an Open SocietyÂ - would there have been the Speaker's Corner at Hong Lim Green ?Â </p>
              <p>Without the organised threat of outspokenÂ agitation by the SDP -Â would there have been changes made to allow Singaporeans a bigger say in our own lives by the PAP Leadership awakening to the fact that Singaporeans want to be involved in the politics that affect us ?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the PAP's sly response was to divest political responsibility into two parts - giving Singaporeans a say in electing whoÂ will form the managementÂ in theÂ Town Councils thatÂ manage our environment and our daily lives; while we have no say on national policies that affect us.</p>

              <p>Who are the average Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Are the SDP supporters notÂ average Singaporeans also ?</p>
              <p>If the average Singaporeans supporting SDPÂ are dumb - are you suggesting that most average Singaporeans areÂ similarly dumb ?</p>
              <p>If the actions of CSJ or the SDP are irking Singaporeans - it is surprising to see the increasing number of newÂ and younger faces amongst those being arrested by the Singapore Police at the various SDP events held around Singapore.</p>
              <p>If the actions of the SDP are irking Singaporeans and are driving them away from the Opposition - it is surprsing to see an ever increasing number of participants at Opposition events, with exchanges that are more lively then the PAP / Government Meet-the-People sessions.</p>
              <p>If the actions of the SDP are driving Singaporeans away from the Opposition - the Workers' Party would have a hard time recruiting new members, and yet - with CSJ's and SDP's seemingly suicidal acts since the 1990's, the WP had been able to present politicalÂ new faces that even threatened LHL in his own GRCÂ Constituency in ElectionÂ 2006.Â </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Before you proceed further into a new area of discussion, and to continueÂ your previous line of thought that Chiam had build a strong SDP, your current statement will require Chiam's performance to be examined again.</p>
              <p>If the WPÂ is seen by you to be a better opposition party - what has happened to Chiam's newly formed SDA Party ?</p>
              <p>Should Chiam not become a more experienced political leader to have grownÂ his new Political PartyÂ to be a better and strongerÂ party than the SDP that he lost, and with his experience to make the SDA to be even stronger than the WPÂ ?</p>
              <p>The present success of the presentÂ WPÂ can be attributedÂ to JBJ's reputation and his effortsÂ in the 1970s -Â which the present WP Leadership benefitted fromÂ the historical track records established by JBJ.</p>
              <p>It was and remainsÂ obvious that JBJ could not possibly takeover the helm of the WP, the moment whenÂ JBJ had freed himself from over 10 years of political cold storage -Â as a result ofÂ the deliberate schemesÂ created byÂ LKY and the PAP to bankrupt him.</p>
              <p>It was a politically correct move for JBJ to form a new Political Party and not jeopardise theÂ modestÂ political gains that WP had achieved under theÂ present political leadership without JBJ's involvement for the preceding 10 years.</p>
              <p>There will always remain the debate as to how effective the WP can be on the National Stage - as long as it keepÂ to its preferred low profile inÂ not competing for the public stage and leaving the PAP to monopolise daily politics in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The WPÂ will pay the price at each election fought, as electioning must take place from Day 1 after the last election.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Though PAP has been implementing unpopular policies and screwing up recently, I doubt the opposition will be able to cause a big swing of voters towards them.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>During the last election, the PAP could only garner 66.6% from only 33% of the registered Electorate list that actually could participate in the process - that 66.6% will probably be lower if 100% of the Electorate couldÂ exercise their votes.</p>
              <p>Even in LHL's GRC constituency, the six new, unknown, andÂ young faces from WP stole 33.9% of the votes from LHL - despite LHL's confidence that he will garner at least 70% if not more.</p>
              <p>Yet, this was in 2006 - when Singapore was supposed to be on the road to recovery after the economic downturn from 9/11, SARS and Birdflu.</p>
              <p>Are you certain thatÂ you will want to <em>"doubt theÂ opposition will be able to cause a big swing of voters towards them"</em> in the next election ?</p>
              <p>You have not considered the new political ammunition that the Opposition has to throw at the PAP since the last 2006 Election - one major political hot potato topicÂ will be the loss of US$100 BILLION from the Singapore Reserves managed by GIC under the watch of LKY and Temasek under his daughter-in-law.</p>
              <p>The loss would have been more acceptable if the PAP had been more charitable towards Singaporeans instead ofÂ being so generous in bailing out failed foreign banks and financial institutions,Â whileÂ chastising Singaporeans for our callsÂ for more generousÂ Social Welfare support during the hard times of massive retrenchment in Year 2004.</p>
              <p>If the PAP leadership is as confident as you are in doubting <em>"no major vote swings towards the opposition"</em>, they will be calling for an earlyÂ election in lateÂ 2009 or early 2010. The unusual caution in delaying an early electionÂ can be seen in the delayÂ in carving out and regrouping those HDB blocks that gave their votes to the Opposition during the last 2006Â election. This redistribution andÂ re-carving is to dilute the areas with concentration of voters leaning towards the opposition.</p>
              <p>It there are no majorÂ swings to the opposition, it is due very much to the PAP manipulation of the electoral boundaries to break-up and dilute such concentrations of opposition leaning voters; and the continued use of legislations to raise the stakes to prevent the Opposition and Singaporeans from participating in a true democratic election exercise.</p>
              <p>If the USA with a population of over 100 million can have almost 90% participating in their election process, it is pathetic that Singapore's registered voters of slightly over 1 million had resulted in only 33% participating in theÂ process.</p>
              <p>Â </p>

              <p>To us, the younger generation, we view oppositions in Singapore like a man with no direction, fragmentised and lack of team work and very individualistic. There is no consideration of defending each other faults and lack of support for each other. We wish to see a united opposition, because unity, trust and support gives a strong pillar instead of 3 or 4 fragmented ones that may fall anytime. Argueing and power struggler inside the opposition while drying their dirtyÂ laundry in public couldÂ only help to demerit them further from being a good governor of Singapore.</p>

              <p>Tho PAP are producing mistakes on and off, they also produce credits in certain areas, however the key point here is that they dun condemn each other in the public, they support each other views even tho one may hv spoken wrongly eg. "mee siam mai hum" had become the joke of the decade and aÂ daily householdÂ phraseÂ instead of taking it into a serious considerationÂ in regard to the Â mental health of our PM. They stood as a team, united and respect their leader/chief who alway cover them in time of trouble, just like Wong Kan Seng, he was completely shielded by his leaders. Yes, it shown abit of bais in it, but the leadership is superb.</p>

              <p>Of course Singapore will survive without PAP, its 2 sides of a coin, it can be good, it can be worst, but life goes on. Philipines goes on without Marcos, but life get worst, Indonesia goes on without Suharto, but life get worst. Why? because some greedy opposition who won the seats start to manipulate the economy to it knees. A normal average person on the street would know that in Singapore, u cannot survive a revolution of civil unrest as we are a small red dot only, why look for trouble if we can still enjoy peace and harmony even without the old man. His Legacy will live on. My lau hero, LKY. YEAH!!</p>

              <p><br>As i said a few times already, a fragmented opposition is not going to stir anything up, PAP will only changeÂ from within, whereby someone who took over LKY or LHL may change the shape of our system with a different party symbol. When? we dunno. But changes there must be, as we are belong to part of change even in our everyday life.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>I had a feeling that when i read LKY books from the 1st to the 3rd world, he mentioned that whenever he visited other countries during his PM days, he wasÂ constantly asked by the host and local media as to why singapore have no oppositions or credible oppositions in the parliament. And guess what, after a few years, oppositions started wins seats in the parliament. My feeling tell me that the oppositions are make there to look good so that the next time he goes to other countries, he dun get mocked again by the same question which look suspcious in way of One Man Rule ALL theory.</p>

              <p>Â </p>
              <p>For the sake of some accuracy, your various points will be
              addressed in their respective parts :-</p>
              <p>Â Was the SDP ever strong under the leadership of Chiam See
              TongÂ ?</p>
              <p>He never healedÂ the long running internal strife between
              himself and his Chairman Ling Howe Doong that split the party into
              twoÂ camps.Â </p>
              <p>The Chairman and the Party Members hadÂ resented
              ChiamÂ for his soft stance and lack lustre performance in
              Parliament towards PAP policies, and not giving much needed
              supportÂ to JBJ when there were 2 or 3 Opposition members in
              Parliament.</p>
              <p>Chiam was criticised by his own SDPÂ rank and fileÂ for
              his unusually warm andÂ cosy relationship with the PAP that
              became obvious in his performance as the leader of the Opposition
              after JBJ was knocked out of Parliament.</p>
              <p>In fact, the internal resentment spilled out into the public
              arena with the recruitment of CSJ into the SDP as the Assistant
              Secretary-General to Chiam.</p>
              <p>Chiam did not even give his support to defend CSJ - when CSJ was
              accused by his Faculty Head forÂ dubious corruption
              chargesÂ for claiming more then the usualÂ taxi fares by
              $1.50+ Â andÂ postages that cost no more then $30 over
              disputed contents mailed to some foreign universities - and all
              approved ONE YEAR BEFOREÂ  CSJ entered the political arena on
              the side of the Opposition.</p>
              <p>Chiam's actions drove a wedge between himself and his SDP
              members, and they gave him a vote of No-Confidence - which led to
              Chiam to respond in his own unique ways that led the SDP Chairman,
              the SDP Executive Council and the General Membership to
              collectively vote him out of the SDP.</p>
              <p>Did Chiam build a strong SDP ?</p>
              <p>Without challenging the PAP - can Singaporeans be
              politicallyÂ educated, or will Singaporeans commit political
              suicide by evolving into political apathy, go into deep political
              slumber and allow the PAP to do as they like ?</p>
              <p>It is through SDP'sÂ strong willedÂ political
              activismÂ that has resulted in the inch-by-inch regaining of
              political grounds being returned to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Without the political battles fought - and the political
              embarrassment caused to the PAP Government for the hypocrisy of
              their propagandaÂ claims to an Open SocietyÂ - would there
              have been the Speaker's Corner at Hong Lim Green ?Â </p>
              <p>Without the organised threat of outspokenÂ agitation by the
              SDP -Â would there have been changes made to allow Singaporeans
              a bigger say in our own lives by the PAP Leadership awakening to
              the fact that Singaporeans want to be involved in the politics that
              affect us ?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the PAP's sly response was to divest political
              responsibility into two parts - giving Singaporeans a say in
              electing whoÂ will form the managementÂ in theÂ Town
              Councils thatÂ manage our environment and our daily lives;
              while we have no say on national policies that affect us.</p>
              <p>Who are the average Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Are the SDP supporters notÂ average Singaporeans also ?</p>
              <p>If the average Singaporeans supporting SDPÂ are dumb - are
              you suggesting that most average Singaporeans areÂ similarly
              dumb ?</p>
              <p>If the actions of CSJ or the SDP are irking Singaporeans - it is
              surprising to see the increasing number of newÂ and younger
              faces amongst those being arrested by the Singapore Police at the
              various SDP events held around Singapore.</p>
              <p>If the actions of the SDP are irking Singaporeans and are
              driving them away from the Opposition - it is surprsing to see an
              ever increasing number of participants at Opposition events, with
              exchanges that are more lively then the PAP / Government
              Meet-the-People sessions.</p>
              <p>If the actions of the SDP are driving Singaporeans away from the
              Opposition - the Workers' Party would have a hard time recruiting
              new members, and yet - with CSJ's and SDP's seemingly suicidal acts
              since the 1990's, the WP had been able to present
              politicalÂ new faces that even threatened LHL in his own
              GRCÂ Constituency in ElectionÂ 2006.Â </p>
              <p>Before you proceed further into a new area of discussion, and to
              continueÂ your previous line of thought that Chiam had build a
              strong SDP, your current statement will require Chiam's performance
              to be examined again.</p>
              <p>If the WPÂ is seen by you to be a better opposition party -
              what has happened to Chiam's newly formed SDA Party ?</p>
              <p>Should Chiam not become a more experienced political leader to
              have grownÂ his new Political PartyÂ to be a better and
              strongerÂ party than the SDP that he lost, and with his
              experience to make the SDA to be even stronger than the
              WPÂ ?</p>
              <p>The present success of the presentÂ WPÂ can be
              attributedÂ to JBJ's reputation and his effortsÂ in the
              1970s -Â which the present WP Leadership benefitted
              fromÂ the historical track records established by JBJ.</p>
              <p>It was and remainsÂ obvious that JBJ could not possibly
              takeover the helm of the WP, the moment whenÂ JBJ had freed
              himself from over 10 years of political cold storage -Â as a
              result ofÂ the deliberate schemesÂ created byÂ LKY and
              the PAP to bankrupt him.</p>
              <p>It was a politically correct move for JBJ to form a new
              Political Party and not jeopardise theÂ modestÂ political
              gains that WP had achieved under theÂ present political
              leadership without JBJ's involvement for the preceding 10
              years.</p>
              <p>There will always remain the debate as to how effective the WP
              can be on the National Stage - as long as it keepÂ to its
              preferred low profile inÂ not competing for the public stage
              and leaving the PAP to monopolise daily politics in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The WPÂ will pay the price at each election fought, as
              electioning must take place from Day 1 after the last election.</p>
              <p>During the last election, the PAP could only garner 66.6% from
              only 33% of the registered Electorate list that actually could
              participate in the process - that 66.6% will probably be lower if
              100% of the Electorate couldÂ exercise their votes.</p>
              <p>Even in LHL's GRC constituency, the six new, unknown,
              andÂ young faces from WP stole 33.9% of the votes from LHL -
              despite LHL's confidence that he will garner at least 70% if not
              more.</p>
              <p>Yet, this was in 2006 - when Singapore was supposed to be on the
              road to recovery after the economic downturn from 9/11, SARS and
              Birdflu.</p>
              <p>Are you certain thatÂ you will want to <em>"doubt
              theÂ opposition will be able to cause a big swing of voters
              towards them"</em> in the next election ?</p>
              <p>You have not considered the new political ammunition that the
              Opposition has to throw at the PAP since the last 2006 Election -
              one major political hot potato topicÂ will be the loss of
              US$100 BILLION from the Singapore Reserves managed by GIC under the
              watch of LKY and Temasek under his daughter-in-law.</p>
              <p>The loss would have been more acceptable if the PAP had been
              more charitable towards Singaporeans instead ofÂ being so
              generous in bailing out failed foreign banks and financial
              institutions,Â whileÂ chastising Singaporeans for our
              callsÂ for more generousÂ Social Welfare support during the
              hard times of massive retrenchment in Year 2004.</p>
              <p>If the PAP leadership is as confident as you are in doubting
              <em>"no major vote swings towards the opposition"</em>, they will
              be calling for an earlyÂ election in lateÂ 2009 or early
              2010. The unusual caution in delaying an early electionÂ can be
              seen in the delayÂ in carving out and regrouping those HDB
              blocks that gave their votes to the Opposition during the last
              2006Â election. This redistribution andÂ re-carving is to
              dilute the areas with concentration of voters leaning towards the
              opposition.</p>
              <p>It there are no majorÂ swings to the opposition, it is due
              very much to the PAP manipulation of the electoral boundaries to
              break-up and dilute such concentrations of opposition leaning
              voters; and the continued use of legislations to raise the stakes
              to prevent the Opposition and Singaporeans from participating in a
              true democratic election exercise.</p>
              <p>If the USA with a population of over 100 million can have almost
              90% participating in their election process, it is pathetic that
              Singapore's registered voters of slightly over 1 million had
              resulted in only 33% participating in theÂ process.</p>
