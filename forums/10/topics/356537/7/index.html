              <p><strong>Persian Language and Culture is Under Attack!</strong></p>
              <p>By Ali Maisam Nazary<br><br>In
                  the last two centuries the status of Persian has been decreasing in
                  Afghanistan and in other countries around the region. In Afghanistan,
                  Persian, the language spoken by the majority of people, is being
                  limited in all parts while Pashto, a tribal language spoken by the
                  minority, is being enforced all over the country. The Persian words for
                  institutions such ‘hospital,’ ‘University,’ ‘pharmacy’ as well as many
                  others have unreasonably been replaced by Pashto words. All
                  governmental documents are being written in Pashto and the National
                  Anthem is sung in Pashto instead of Persian. It is quite ironic for the
                  people of a country to not understand their own National Anthem.<br><br>In
                  February 2007 Patman, an official in the Ministry of Education who is
                  also an active member of the Afghan Mellat Party, was participating in
                  a round table discussion on Ariana TV. He proposed new plans of
                  Pashtunizing Afghanistan's education after the upcoming New Year in
                  March. These new policies have opened a new chapter of chauvinism and
                  fascism in Afghanistan which will destroy the country instead of making
                  it prosper. However, it comes as no surprise. This article will
                  highlight how the Persian language and culture has been oppressed
                  throughout history from the time of Alexander to the present.
                  The region has seen great conquerors come and go. One of the first was
                  Alexander of Macedonia who plundered and pillaged the region with his
                  savage-like army from Greece. The Greek invasion ended a chapter of
                  glory and prosperity for the Persian culture and civilization. During
                  his time, Alexander tried eradicating anything associated with Persian.
                  He burned the magnificent capital of Persipolis, which was built by the
                  Acheamanid Dynasty. When Alexander reached Herat, the core of the
                  Persian Empire, he encountered fierce opposition led by Satibarzan.
                  Though Satibarzan waged fierce guerilla warfare against the invaders in
                  ancient Aria, he was ultimately defeated and Alexander headed towards
                  the Hindu Kush to Balkh were he defeated Satrap Bessus. Afterwards,
                  Alexander moved on to ancient Samarkand where he burned down most of
                  the city and massacred half of the population. For hundreds of years
                  afterwards, his descendants tried to force their Hellenistic culture on
                  the natives. However, they failed and a strong opposition grew and the
                  Parthians liberated all of "Ancient Iran" from the Greeks and thus the
                  second era of the Persian Empire commenced. But the land can never
                  erode the tell-tale signs of pain felt at the hands of Alexander and
                  his horde of mercenaries. History shows that the Persians fought until
                  the end to keep their culture, language, and identity from being
                  deracinated by the Greeks.<br><br>The
                  second era of the Persian culture and civilization ended when the Arabs
                  invaded during the time of the Sassanid Empire of Iran. The Arabs
                  entered Iran like animals on a desperate hunt for prey. They destroyed,
                  burned, and pillaged the great cities and towns. They killed all
                  intellectuals, burned great books of literature and science and
                  enforced their culture, language, and religion on the people of the
                  region. There are legends of the Arabs invasion of Kabul led by "Shah e
                  du Shamshera" i.e. "The King with two Swords." At the hands of the
                  Arabs, the Persians faced genocide far worse than that of the Jewish
                  Holocaust during World War II. Arabic replaced the Persian language and
                  anyone caught teaching or learning Persian was put to death. Though all
                  non-Arabs were mistreated, the Persians were treated far worse during
                  the Arab occupation. Mu'auiyah in a famous letter addressed to Ziyad
                  ibn Abih, the then governor of Iraq, wrote:<br><br>“…Be watchful of
                  Iranian Muslims and never treat them as equals of Arabs. Arabs have a
                  right to take in marriage their women, but they have no right to marry
                  Arab women. Arabs are entitled to inherit their [the Persians’] legacy,
                  but they [the Persians] cannot inherit from an Arab. s far as possible
                  they are to be given lesser pensions and lowly jobs. In the presence of
                  an Arab a non-Arab shall not lead the congregation prayer, nor are they
                  to be allowed to stand in the first row of prayer, nor to be entrusted
                  with the job of guarding the frontiers or the post of a qadi…”<br><br>The
                  hatred that the Arabs and their rulers had towards the Persian language
                  and culture was no secret. This anti-Persian policy continued for at
                  least two centuries. During the Umayyad dynasty the Persians were
                  called Mawali. The excerpt is taken from the work of an Arab historian
                  named Obid:<br><br>"The Mawali were not allowed to lead the prayers or
                  receive booty even if they had participated in battles and
                  distinguished themselves. They were not allowed to ride horses, marry
                  into Arab families, or administer governmental or religious affairs.
                  Even the offspring of mixed marriages were not exempt. The Mawali did
                  not have the right to walk alongside an Arab; if a Mawali met an Arab
                  carrying a load, he had to carry that load to the Arab's home without
                  expecting any payment. If a Mawali were riding a horse and saw an Arab,
                  he had to dismount and allow the Arab to ride instead. In fact, he had
                  to take the Arab to his destination. Furthermore, the Mawali did not
                  have the right to marry their daughters without prior permission from
                  their Arab masters. Even in death rituals, there was a distinction. As
                  a rule, Arabs did not participate in funerals held for the Mawali and
                  the Mawali were not allowed to perform funeral prayers for a deceased
                  Arab”<br><br>The Persians were not able to do anything under Arab rule;
                  they suffered under these oppressive rules and all of their
                  accomplishments were used to educate the Arabs. The Persian Language
                  was forbidden all over the Arab Empire and its literature was banned.
                  Hallaj ibn Yusuf had ordered that the language of the ‘divan’ in the
                  eastern regions of the Empire be replaced by Arabic. In Beruni's From
                  the Remaining Signs of Past Centuries, it is written:<br><br>"…When
                  Qutaibah bin Muslim under the command of Al-Hajjaj bin Yousef was sent
                  to Khwarazmia with a military expedition and conquered it for the
                  second time, he swiftly killed whomever wrote the Khwarazmian native
                  language that knew of the Khwarazmian heritage, history, and culture.
                  He then killed all their Zoroastrian priests and burned and wasted
                  their books, until gradually the illiterate only remained, who knew
                  nothing of writing, and hence their history was mostly forgotten…"<br><br>Dark
                  times had indeed been cast down upon the Persians. But the time came
                  when the Great Persians rose once more against their enemies and
                  defeated them and sent them back to their deserts. The great
                  civilization of the Egyptians had all but disappeared and they lost
                  their identity, culture, language to the aggressive Arabs while the
                  Persians strove for justice and victory, seeking a sort of immunity
                  from such invading viruses. Heroes such as Behzad Khorasani (Abu Muslim
                  Khorasani), Babak Khurramdin, Yaqub Saffari, Saman Khudah, like their
                  forefathers before them, fought for and liberated the Persians and
                  revived the Persian identity once again. Works produced by great
                  personalities such as Ferdowsi, Saadi, Hafez, and Mawlana helped the
                  Persian culture and language flourish. As a result of the hard times
                  faced by the Arab occupation the Persians were adamant about not going
                  through such tribulations again and so they were able to defeat the
                  invading Turko-Mongols who came from the east.<br><br>When the
                  Turko-Mongol forces first entered Khorasan they were able to easily
                  adopt the Persian culture and language because of they lacked culture
                  and a proper tongue of their own. Ghaznavids, Seljuqs, Khaharezm Shahs,
                  Timorids were patriarchs of the Persian culture and language. They
                  financed works like the Shahnama, one of the most spectacular Epics
                  ever written in history. At that point in history the Persian language
                  was the Franca lingua, its influences reaching from the Middle East to
                  the Indian subcontinent. When the second round of Turko-Mongol savages
                  led by Genghis Khan came the Persians faced massacre and bloodshed once
                  more. Historical sources claim that sixty percent of the Persian
                  population in Central Asia was killed during that time. Because of the
                  hordes of marauding Turko-Mongols Mawlana, Hafez, and Saadi were forced
                  to flee from their homeland while others who opted to stay, like Attar,
                  were killed. The Turko-Mongols pillaged and destroyed the great
                  cultural centers like the regions of Merv and Balkh. Unlike the Greeks
                  and Arabs before them, who had their own language and culture, the
                  Turko-Mongols attached themselves to the Persian culture and language.
                  Most of their rulers could not speak their own mother tongue and had no
                  choice but to speak Persian. Timorids used the Persian language when
                  they ruled India; Ottoman Empire spoke Persian in their courts. Today,
                  in the 21st Century, because they are embarrassed of their ancestors’
                  attachment to Persian, Uzbekistan and the Pan-Turkist movement is
                  working against the Persian culture and language. They have banned the
                  usage of the Persian language in the great cities of Samarqand and
                  Bukhara and are “Uzbekizing” the 11,000,000 Tajiks in Uzbekistan. They
                  have started a process of stealing Persian history, culture, and
                  personalities; Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan have started claiming
                  Rumi, Saadi, Avicenna, Al-Farabi and others as theirs, claims that are
                  as wrong as they are ridiculous.<br><br>After the Afsharid Empire, an
                  Afghan by the name of Ahmad Khan Abdali came to power in Qandahar and
                  started the Durrani Dynasty in Khorasan. He and his descendants
                  preferred to speak the Persian language over their mother tongue,
                  Pashto. During their time, the Persian language was the language of
                  communication and the Franca lingua of Khorasan. Durrani and his
                  descendants used Persian titles like ‘Shah’ and referred to their
                  Empire as Khorasan rather than Afghanistan or Pashtunistan. Pashtun
                  chauvinism started in Afghanistan after Habibullah Kalakani's brief
                  nine month rule as King. As he rose to power after tricking and killing
                  Kalakani, Nadir Khan, a Muhamadzai Pashtun, massacred native Persian
                  speakers in the north and granted a lot of northern land to tribal
                  Pashtuns from the NWFP of British India. At the same time he promoted
                  Pan-Pashtunism and laid the foundations of an ethno-centric
                  Afghanistan. When Nadir Khan was killed in 1933, his successor
                  continued the oppressive process by first changing the national
                  language from Persian to Pashto and Pashtunizing the Persian city of
                  Kabul. Though the royal family couldn’t speak Pashto themselves, they
                  started promoting the primitive language which was spoken by tribal
                  Pashtuns. They changed Farsi/Persian to Dari so as to create divisions
                  between Persian speakers in Iran and Afghanistan and other regions.
                  They stopped printing textbooks in Persian and instead, they
                  distributed Pashto textbooks to schools throughout the country.
                  However, there was a lack of interest in Pashto and because everyone,
                  including the royal family, was a native Persian speaker, this
                  promotion of Pashto failed and they had no choice but to turn back to
                  Persian again. But their tribal jealousy and hatred did not dissipate;
                  anti-Persianism in Afghanistan continued through the Taliban era. The
                  Taliban torched Persian books and closed Universities which used the
                  Persian language. There were reports that the Taliban would go to
                  libraries and bookstores and demand all books in the Persian language
                  and they would burn them in front of the booksellers or Librarians.
                  They beat anyone whom they heard speaking Persian and they blew up the
                  Buddha statues which symbolized the rich history of the region. They
                  very much wanted to tribalize the entire nation.<br><br>After the fall
                  of the Taliban, a new Pashtun group emerged by the name of ‘Afghan
                  Mellat.’ They started took advantage of the fragile government and
                  started imposing their own agenda. Their first step was to declare the
                  title "Afghan" as a national identity and to remove all other
                  identities i.e. Tajik, Hazara, Uzbek, etc. Their next step was creating
                  a National Anthem in Pashto rather than in the Persian language. They
                  had Persian professors replaced in Kabul University and, as stated
                  earlier, forcefully placed Pashto words for institutions like
                  University, governmental institutions, etc. while banning all the
                  Persian words. It is a wonder just how much the Persian people can take
                  with all this ethno-centrism plaguing their home.<br><br>For the last
                  3,000 years,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> the Persian speakers and their culture and language have
                  been under constant bombardment from those who wish to make others pay
                  for their own insecurities. </strong></span>The Persian speakers need to once more wake
                  up and defend their identity, culture, and language which have seen
                  enough oppression throughout its history. There will be no end to this
                  sort of oppression once the oppressors are allowed to impose their
                  tribal ways on the Persian speakers. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The time to start raising
                  awareness and claiming discontentment and injustice is now.</strong></span> Predecessors such as Satibarzan, Ariabarzan, and the Parthians fought
                  for their rights during the Hellenistic period; Abu Muslim Khorasani,
                  Babak Khurramdin, and Saman Khuda fought during the Arab occupation of
                  Iran and Khorasan; Kartas of Herat and Safavids of Persia fought the
                  Mongol invasions. The Persian speakers of today need another Abu Muslim
                  to get rid of Afghan Mellat and Pan-Turkism.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> But in today’s world, even
                  a simple man can become a hero just by standing up for justice and
                  equality.</strong></span> History will always repeat itself if the mistakes are allowed
                  to be repeated.</p>
