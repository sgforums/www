              <p>anyway, with the nice example of philipines which is poor, won't it emphasis that singapore executed it nicely, since it is not poor? I think you should come up with examples of countries that become very rich to show that singapore execute it badly.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span>I have been in this forum for a
              while, sometimes I am pissed by those people who is close minded,
              not willing to accept different opinion. There are nice people in
              Singapore, but unfortunately I did not meet many, so this post is
              composed just vent my resentment and unhappiness, and I am not
              mocking some people in particular but Singaporean in general, If
              you are not happy with the title, and content of the post, please
              ignore it, like that since when Singapore is importing a lot
              foreigner, and more and more of different voice will appear, that’s
              the pitfall of that policy, hope you can understand, and please
              don’t veto my account, anyway, we can see, whether Singapore is
              open or not here.</span></strong></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p><span>Seeing singapore from another perspective</span></p>
              <p>To be honest , I didn’t develope any affection in the several
              years I live in singapore, but rather some resentment, which I will
              discuss later, see whether, the reason is because of my fault, or
              singapore is really not so perfect place as many perceived.</p>
              <p>When you need to know someone, you need to someone else, and
              make a comparision, singapore is clean, safe organised, as in the
              ads which attract tourist and student.</p>
              <p>But besides which, singapore also have many common bad thing
              like many other developed cities.</p>
              <p>I cited some example, singapore suicide rate is as high as
              japan, singapore homosexual rate is as high as in US, singapore
              divorce rate is as high as in US, singapore sexual satifaction rate
              is as high………, no I would say that,I think singapore sex
              satifaction rate is not as high as other country, I think singapore
              guys and girl didn’t enjoy satifactory sex, see, you are developed
              than african country, but in terms of sex, singapore is less
              developed than them, just see how long is the penis of black
              people. Most of asian will bow to them, so though many singaporean
              have more fortune than less developed country, but in terms of sex,
              or family tie, family relationship, singaporean should realy
              reexamine what happen to the socalled developed city, or first
              class, is the first class so first class?</p>
              <p>Franch should be proud of their romance, british should be proud
              of the large empire they ever build, American should be proud of
              the super power them own, even iraq egypt should be proud of the
              tradition they have, jewish say they are blessed and chosen by god.
              But singapore, I don’t know what they can be proud of, may the
              cleaness on the street, which is as clean as in hospital.</p>
              <p>Singapore have excellent people, like lee kuan yeo, and many
              business man, but many people comdemn lee kuan yeo, I think I can
              understand, because lee kuan yeo’s government is big governemtn,
              they do many thing good to people, but they are thinking in the
              way, that they have the right to decide thing for citizen, like
              raise the tax for alchol and cigar, which two, is the most
              important item discovered, to bring enjoyment to people, and relief
              pressure,</p>
              <p>So in the stressfull society like in singapore, I don’t
              understand why, government cannot allow people to indulge
              themselves in drink couples of beer, and smoke some cigarret.</p>
              <p>And they propose some idea like joggin to replace them, smoking
              and achohol is about to maximise your happiness in an allowed
              extend, which like a person, earn 2000, which is an average salary
              in sinagpore, imagine if the cigarette price, is not 10 dollar,
              instead, it’s 2 dollar, which is the price in other country, or the
              beer is not 6 dollar, but 1 dollar, do you feel much relief in
              consuming the commodity?</p>
              <p>Smoking doesnot hinder your health to that extend as publicised,
              as long, as you don’t chain smoking often , and do regular
              exercise, most important be happy,</p>
              <p>Then you will be just like the rest of guys, who smoke the whole
              life, but keep in a good shape.</p>
              <p>Being in the developed city, I hope singaporean could be more
              open minded, and accepted different mind, most of singaporean I
              encountered, are cynic, and touchy, many people even when they say
              sorry, they don’t mean it, just looks like they are banged by
              reality, suffer bad relationship, raised up in a bad family. Being
              nice is an art, when you have shit in your heart, you saw
              everything look like shit,</p>
              <p>Keep a right mentality, I advice you</p>
              <p>To be honest, singapore doesnot have a rich culture, many
              singaporean is short sighted as well,</p>
              <p>They have seldom knowledge about literature ,art, and history,
              one of the singapore minister said history is burdon, but I say is
              history make who you are. Singapore don’t have many culture to bond
              citizen, just like chinese in singapore, their culture is from the
              fact , they are chinese, just like the cantonese in singapore is
              just like cantonese in china, beside, singaporean cantonese speak
              english, I don’t know what’s their difference.</p>
              <p>One policy applied by singapore government underhandedly, is
              fool people, fool people is just an astonishing title, but in
              nature , they are really dcing this,</p>
              <p>PAP, knowing that knowledge make people smart, they educate
              people with engineering, saying engineering is good, engineering is
              good in the way of make a stable profitable career, but most of
              engineer are timid, did not developed independent thinking, easily
              being persvaded and manipulated. I once heard from friend, in
              school they don’t teach history or philosophy, they education
              system in singapore are pragmatic. And they are now wandering why
              singapore don’t developed enteurpreneur spirit, of course, if a
              person is not cultured with idea about life, and confidence about
              what he do, how he can set up a career and take the risk by
              themselves.</p>
              <p>Singapore provide good manager, but not good founder, there are
              not many sound local brand, I only know creative, ST, and the
              coffee maker supermix,</p>
              <p>I think singapore is overwhelmed by the good infrasture, the
              money they have, the rank in the world by other agency.</p>
              <p>But to be honest, singapore don’t have many space to develop,
              singapore major in export and import, when the rest of country is
              opening up, because the heritage they have, they will catching up,
              the new power house is in Asia, sooner or later, singapore will
              feel the heat of the pressure from his competitor.</p>
              <p>Today, I have said enough, if some day else I feel have to add
              something, I will do that,</p>
              <p>And at last, I will use a word used by many US people</p>
              <p>Peace dude.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>chinese have been practise ancestor worship for a long time, i
              am sure whether what you said is true, it sounds like conspiracy
              theory, but i think PAP have successfully isolate singapore from
              china, from china's influence,</p>
              <p>Long time ago chinese seek shelter in Nanyang, which is
              singapura in chinese, because the political turbulence, but no
              one  consider nanyang as their home, sooner or later they want
              to get back to china, and Nanyang at that time is equivalent to a
              horrible place, rumoured among chinese,</p>
              <p>many prostitute have been traffic to nanyang , and  they
              fear so much of going to nanyang, singaporean chinese at that time
              is similar to a diaspora jewish during world war, and jews in world
              promtly go back to Israel when the country of israel is formally
              established.</p>
              <p>and i am not familar with the history, during which singapore's
              economy grow tremendously. and PAP successfully establish a so
              called singapore spirit, which is similar to hongkong spirit, means
              working hard, and striving for success,</p>
              <p>and the new generation is born in singapore, who enjoy first
              class infrastructure, and stable political enviorment, and after
              the successfully education and building of singpapore identity, the
              new generation consider them to be singaporean for the first time,
              and singaporean chinese become a name of different being with china
              chinese.</p>
              <p>but although offending, but i would say, the first generation of
              chinese come to singapore are mostly not educated people. THey may
              not be familiar with the classical chiense culture, which is the
              reason they don't develope firm bond with china,</p>
              <p>and now after the english is being accepted as official
              language, no one willing to read difficult chinese classics, and
              the only tie between singaporean chinese and china is blocked,
              that's the reason why singaporean chinese despise china chinese,
              although speaking same language, and looks the same.</p>
              <p>Singapore have made a miracle, after British formly withdraw
              from singpapore, they predict singapore will not survive without
              the aid from british side.But singapore successfully, building it's
              economy for post colony period, and successfully
              establish,"singapore" brand ,in world market in terms of 
              entre port economy,</p>
              <p>now singapore have been on the right track of development, but
              seems the development of economy never satisfy the appetite of
              singaporean, and the more and more stressful life, triggered by
              globalisation, and shortage in local market itself, to build up a
              self sufficient economy.</p>
              <p>after economic booming, steady peiord of development,
              singaporean feel that they are as good as US ,Uk, and proud of it's
              singapore identity. After the long time to struggle for survival,
              singaporean become more and more crave to become first class in
              every aspect, the PAP government already lagging behind to fulfill
              the need of singaporean's appetite for more transparent and
              democratic government. And the autocratic government model already
              become outdated to maintain a efficient and acceptable governance,
              just like a script in movie, they are looking for something more
              extraordinary.</p>
              <p>being exposed to more more about western life, especially the
              life in europe, where the human right, is greatly respected, where
              they have longer maternity leave, and less time in working,
              singaporean are not satisfied to be lecture by PAP, what is the
              next step, after the booming time, people realise that there are
              something more extraordinary, which is democracy, and realise that
              for so long time, they have been brainwashed, and behave like a
              working maching.</p>
              <p>The shift from making survival concern to have more quality
              government and life in education, medical, insurance, and social
              welfare, mark a great breakthrough from post colony to new
              singapore identity.</p>
              <p>And this is the driving force, of calling for a political
              reform, we not only need money, and respect at the same time, it's
              the end of singapore's modernisation and westernisation, and the
              beginning , singapore creation.</p>
              <p>i hail for what singapore have achieved, but after all this , we
              need to think what is the next step, going western way, or going
              your own way. SIngapore need democracy, or authoritarian with
              singapore characristics.</p>
              <p>this question is what singapore will face during, next10 to 20
              years.</p>
              <p>And the dead of old singapore and the born of new singapore will
              prove whether, singaporean is capable of facing the new era of
              economy, which is the ending of  one polarisation to
              multi  polarisation, and the decline of old world order, the
              rise of new  world order, which, the asia and asia market will
              become a big role in world economy.</p>
              <p>this the question, singapore need to provide answer for , and we
              will witness, whether singapore will uplift itself from first class
              hardware, to first class "software", from hard power to soft power.
              it's time to take break, and think what is the next step for
              singapore.</p>

              <p>dialect has to be passed on by teaching the next generation, you don't get that from the govt. dialects are usually spoken within the local community. and yes the singapore govt didn't encourage dialects but if your own parents don't teach your own dialects is that actually the govt's fault?</p>
              <p>if you're brought up by your parents you naturally speak their language be it english or dialect. mine choose to bring us up in mandarin despite being cantonese and i can only speak hokkien. but my parents never thought much about it much less blame your <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Baba Siao". </span></p>
              <p>they just felt that they didn't bring us up in a cantonese speaking enviroment thats all.</p>

              that actually the govt's fault?</p>
              <p>if you're brought up by your parents you naturally speak their
              language be it english or dialect. mine choose to bring us up in
              mandarin despite being cantonese and i can only speak hokkien. but
              my parents never thought much about it much less blame your
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Baba Siao".</span></p>
              <p>they just felt that they didn't bring us up in a cantonese
              speaking enviroment thats all.</p>
              <p>its not like hk dramas in cantonese would help me in my
              situation when i'm not going to use the dialect at all.</p>

              <p>For singaporeans to speak english is only a necessity, for commerce communication and to be better than our inhumane conquerors, forced to give up colonnisation after realizing asians are equal human and not animals after being kicked by the japs and forced by Roosevelt for aid to save their homeland.</p>
              <p>To speak in any other lingo would only be for endearments, as a sense of cultural belonging to an ethnic group to partake in its heritage, a heritage of a society that lost its right to survive when it was subjugated and perhaps replaced by an allegience to a better and newly created society - such as cantonese from Kwangtung being replaced with Mandarin for commerce and administration.</p>
              <p>Utimately - a lingo is ONLY for communication with another, as meant by our blabbering and finger jabbing cavemen ancestors.

              <p><br>Uncle, Whether u oppose or not, they are the ruling party, by hook or by crook, you have to admit that they get the most vote and are under consitution of election, the ruling party, even 51% is still the ruling party. Of course there are other votes and also other who dun agree that should be the one ruling, but most hv to submit to it as the most of their other relatives, friends and fellow citizens voted the PAP, they respected that votes by them.</p>

              <p>So, in a nutshell, even if you dun like PAP, you hv to respect Singaporeans decision and vote. Tho i may be eligible to vote this coming election, i might vote opposition, but if PAP wins, i pay my respect to my fellow citizens and agree defeat in the most charming lady aspect. It should be something like when you lost, you start to criticise and harbour a non satisfactory mindset, dun look at PAP, look at the Singaporeans who voted them, do you respect them.</p>

              <p>The elections are not fair.</p>
              <p>PAP monopolised the mainstream media to spread propaganda, opposition censored.</p>
              <p>Campaign period only a few days for opposition to hold rallies, while for 5 years PAP daily spread their bullshit propaganda to brainwash.</p>
