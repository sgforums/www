              <p>teaching in english is the last thing PAP want to do, because the multi racial population here, you have to teach in english, but i don't think it's a good thing, even the poorest people is proud about who they are, they don't have to imitate others,</p>
              <p>How about promote english as an official language worldwide, since it's an international language, no , no one would do that, they cannot despise their own culture, and embrace a foriegn language.</p>
              <p>Learning english, and speaking english, you could never be better than american or british, and you are following their foot step. It only can make US and UK think you are protectorate.</p>
              <p>So better no to raise it as an contribution for wat PAP have done</p>

              <p>the decision of an official language, is happen through history, because of historical reason,</p>
              <p>And  i am not so familiar with the history of singapore, but did PAP make english as offical language after it's independence, in 60s, before that, the chinese here is educated in chinese, and Nanyang university, which become NTU later, and teach in english,</p>
              <p>i think there are nothing to been done, like making english to be the official language, or you suggesting, the indias malay all speak chinese, it's not fair to them, upon this stage of time, i think the most reasonble decision is to make english as official language. It give singapore some advantage and some pitfall</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I have been in this forum for a while, sometimes I am pissed by those people who is close minded, not willing to accept different opinion. There are nice people in Singapore, but unfortunately I did not meet many, so this post is composed just vent my resentment and unhappiness, and I am not mocking some people in particular but Singaporean in general, If you are not happy with the title, and content of the post, please ignore it, like that since when Singapore is importing a lot foreigner, and more and more of different voice will appear, that’s the pitfall of that policy, hope you can understand, and please don’t veto my account, anyway, we can see, whether Singapore is open or not here.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p><span>Seeing singapore from another perspective</span></p>
              <p>To be honest , I didn’t develope any affection in the several years I live in singapore, but rather some resentment, which I will discuss later, see whether, the reason is because of my fault, or singapore is really not so perfect place as many perceived.</p>
              <p>When you need to know someone, you need to someone else, and make a comparision, singapore is clean, safe organised, as in the ads which attract tourist and student.</p>
              <p>But besides which, singapore also have many common bad thing like many other developed cities.</p>
              <p>I cited some example, singapore suicide rate is as high as japan, singapore homosexual rate is as high as in US, singapore divorce rate is as high as in US, singapore sexual satifaction rate is as high………, no I would say that,I think singapore sex satifaction rate is not as high as other country, I think singapore guys and girl didn’t enjoy satifactory sex, see, you are developed than african country, but in terms of sex, singapore is less developed than them, just see how long is the penis of black people. Most of asian will bow to them, so though many singaporean have more fortune than less developed country, but in terms of sex, or family tie, family relationship, singaporean should realy reexamine what happen to the socalled developed city, or first class, is the first class so first class?</p>
              <p>Franch should be proud of their romance, british should be proud of the large empire they ever build, American should be proud of the super power them own, even iraq egypt should be proud of the tradition they have, jewish say they are blessed and chosen by god. But singapore, I don’t know what they can be proud of, may the cleaness on the street, which is as clean as in hospital.</p>
              <p>Singapore have excellent people, like lee kuan yeo, and many business man, but many people comdemn lee kuan yeo, I think I can understand, because lee kuan yeo’s government is big governemtn, they do many thing good to people, but they are thinking in the way, that they have the right to decide thing for citizen, like raise the tax for alchol and cigar, which two, is the most important item discovered, to bring enjoyment to people, and relief pressure,</p>
              <p>So in the stressfull society like in singapore, I don’t understand why, government cannot allow people to indulge themselves in drink couples of beer, and smoke some cigarret.</p>
              <p>And they propose some idea like joggin to replace them, smoking and achohol is about to maximise your happiness in an allowed extend, which like a person, earn 2000, which is an average salary in sinagpore, imagine if the cigarette price, is not 10 dollar, instead, it’s 2 dollar, which is the price in other country, or the beer is not 6 dollar, but 1 dollar, do you feel much relief in consuming the commodity?</p>
              <p>Smoking doesnot hinder your health to that extend as publicised, as long, as you don’t chain smoking often , and do regular exercise, most important be happy,</p>
              <p>Then you will be just like the rest of guys, who smoke the whole life, but keep in a good shape.</p>
              <p>Being in the developed city, I hope singaporean could be more open minded, and accepted different mind, most of singaporean I encountered, are cynic, and touchy, many people even when they say sorry, they don’t mean it, just looks like they are banged by reality, suffer bad relationship, raised up in a bad family. Being nice is an art, when you have shit in your heart, you saw everything look like shit,</p>
              <p>Keep a right mentality, I advice you</p>
              <p>To be honest, singapore doesnot have a rich culture, many singaporean is short sighted as well,</p>
              <p>They have seldom knowledge about literature ,art, and history, one of the singapore minister said history is burdon, but I say is history make who you are. Singapore don’t have many culture to bond citizen, just like chinese in singapore, their culture is from the fact , they are chinese, just like the cantonese in singapore is just like cantonese in china, beside, singaporean cantonese speak english, I don’t know what’s their difference.</p>
              <p>One policy applied by singapore government underhandedly, is fool people, fool people is just an astonishing title, but in nature , they are really dcing this,</p>
              <p>PAP, knowing that knowledge make people smart, they educate people with engineering, saying engineering is good, engineering is good in the way of make a stable profitable career, but most of engineer are timid, did not developed independent thinking, easily being persvaded and manipulated. I once heard from friend, in school they don’t teach history or philosophy, they education system in singapore are pragmatic. And they are now wandering why singapore don’t developed enteurpreneur spirit, of course, if a person is not cultured with idea about life, and confidence about what he do, how he can set up a career and take the risk by themselves.</p>
              <p>Singapore provide good manager, but not good founder, there are not many sound local brand, I only know creative, ST, and the coffee maker supermix,</p>
              <p>I think singapore is overwhelmed by the good infrasture, the money they have, the rank in the world by other agency.</p>
              <p>But to be honest, singapore don’t have many space to develop, singapore major in export and import, when the rest of country is opening up, because the heritage they have, they will catching up, the new power house is in Asia, sooner or later, singapore will feel the heat of the pressure from his competitor.</p>
              <p>Today, I have said enough, if some day else I feel have to add something, I will do that,</p>
              <p>And at last, I will use a word used by many US people</p>
              <p>Peace dude.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I have been in this forum for a while, sometimes I am pissed by those people who is close minded, not willing to accept different opinion. There are nice people in Singapore, but unfortunately I did not meet many, so this post is composed just vent my resentment and unhappiness, and I am not mocking some people in particular but Singaporean in general, If you are not happy with the title, and content of the post, please ignore it, like that since when Singapore is importing a lot foreigner, and more and more of different voice will appear, that’s the pitfall of that policy, hope you can understand, and please don’t veto my account, anyway, we can see, whether Singapore is open or not here.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p><span>Seeing singapore from another perspective</span></p>
              <p>To be honest , I didn’t develope any affection in the several years I live in singapore, but rather some resentment, which I will discuss later, see whether, the reason is because of my fault, or singapore is really not so perfect place as many perceived.</p>
              <p>When you need to know someone, you need to someone else, and make a comparision, singapore is clean, safe organised, as in the ads which attract tourist and student.</p>
              <p>But besides which, singapore also have many common bad thing like many other developed cities.</p>
              <p>I cited some example, singapore suicide rate is as high as japan, singapore homosexual rate is as high as in US, singapore divorce rate is as high as in US, singapore sexual satifaction rate is as high………, no I would say that,I think singapore sex satifaction rate is not as high as other country, I think singapore guys and girl didn’t enjoy satifactory sex, see, you are developed than african country, but in terms of sex, singapore is less developed than them, just see how long is the penis of black people. Most of asian will bow to them, so though many singaporean have more fortune than less developed country, but in terms of sex, or family tie, family relationship, singaporean should realy reexamine what happen to the socalled developed city, or first class, is the first class so first class?</p>
              <p>Franch should be proud of their romance, british should be proud of the large empire they ever build, American should be proud of the super power them own, even iraq egypt should be proud of the tradition they have, jewish say they are blessed and chosen by god. But singapore, I don’t know what they can be proud of, may the cleaness on the street, which is as clean as in hospital.</p>
              <p>Singapore have excellent people, like lee kuan yeo, and many business man, but many people comdemn lee kuan yeo, I think I can understand, because lee kuan yeo’s government is big governemtn, they do many thing good to people, but they are thinking in the way, that they have the right to decide thing for citizen, like raise the tax for alchol and cigar, which two, is the most important item discovered, to bring enjoyment to people, and relief pressure,</p>
              <p>So in the stressfull society like in singapore, I don’t understand why, government cannot allow people to indulge themselves in drink couples of beer, and smoke some cigarret.</p>
              <p>And they propose some idea like joggin to replace them, smoking and achohol is about to maximise your happiness in an allowed extend, which like a person, earn 2000, which is an average salary in sinagpore, imagine if the cigarette price, is not 10 dollar, instead, it’s 2 dollar, which is the price in other country, or the beer is not 6 dollar, but 1 dollar, do you feel much relief in consuming the commodity?</p>
              <p>Smoking doesnot hinder your health to that extend as publicised, as long, as you don’t chain smoking often , and do regular exercise, most important be happy,</p>
              <p>Then you will be just like the rest of guys, who smoke the whole life, but keep in a good shape.</p>
              <p>Being in the developed city, I hope singaporean could be more open minded, and accepted different mind, most of singaporean I encountered, are cynic, and touchy, many people even when they say sorry, they don’t mean it, just looks like they are banged by reality, suffer bad relationship, raised up in a bad family. Being nice is an art, when you have shit in your heart, you saw everything look like shit,</p>
              <p>Keep a right mentality, I advice you</p>
              <p>To be honest, singapore doesnot have a rich culture, many singaporean is short sighted as well,</p>
              <p>They have seldom knowledge about literature ,art, and history, one of the singapore minister said history is burdon, but I say is history make who you are. Singapore don’t have many culture to bond citizen, just like chinese in singapore, their culture is from the fact , they are chinese, just like the cantonese in singapore is just like cantonese in china, beside, singaporean cantonese speak english, I don’t know what’s their difference.</p>
              <p>One policy applied by singapore government underhandedly, is fool people, fool people is just an astonishing title, but in nature , they are really dcing this,</p>
              <p>PAP, knowing that knowledge make people smart, they educate people with engineering, saying engineering is good, engineering is good in the way of make a stable profitable career, but most of engineer are timid, did not developed independent thinking, easily being persvaded and manipulated. I once heard from friend, in school they don’t teach history or philosophy, they education system in singapore are pragmatic. And they are now wandering why singapore don’t developed enteurpreneur spirit, of course, if a person is not cultured with idea about life, and confidence about what he do, how he can set up a career and take the risk by themselves.</p>
              <p>Singapore provide good manager, but not good founder, there are not many sound local brand, I only know creative, ST, and the coffee maker supermix,</p>
              <p>I think singapore is overwhelmed by the good infrasture, the money they have, the rank in the world by other agency.</p>
              <p>But to be honest, singapore don’t have many space to develop, singapore major in export and import, when the rest of country is opening up, because the heritage they have, they will catching up, the new power house is in Asia, sooner or later, singapore will feel the heat of the pressure from his competitor.</p>
              <p>Today, I have said enough, if some day else I feel have to add something, I will do that,</p>
              <p>And at last, I will use a word used by many US people</p>
              <p>Peace dude.</p>

              <p><br>yes singapore levy high tax on beer and cigarrete, actually one pack of malbroe, sorry for the wrong spelling , you know what it means, cost 2 sg dollar roughly, but in signapore the price is 10 dollar, and keep increasing, i have said in the post, if the tax is not so high, the feeling of consuming them is different, you could smoke 5 pack instead of one pack, of course no one will do that,</p>
              <p>when i am not happy, i feel much relieved when smoking ,or drinking, though i don't drink alot.</p>
              <p>if you travel in south east asia, i know that, the price of those item is cheaper in other country, like some ppl have to smuggling cigarette to singapore, because it's profitable.</p>

              <p><em> In spite of
              their
              language, the Baba considered themselves Chinese, retained
              Chinese
              kinship patterns and religion, and even when speaking
              Malay used a
              distinct Baba dialect of Malay with many loan words from
              Hokkien.
              Never a large proportion of Singapore's Chinese
              population, in the
              late nineteenth century they took advantage of
              opportunities for
              education in English and promoted themselves as loyal to
              Britain. </em></p>
              <p><em>In Singapore, many Baba families spoke English as a first
              language
              and produced many of the leaders of Singapore's

              Malay or English as their first language and identified more
              closely with Singapore and Malaya than with China. After
