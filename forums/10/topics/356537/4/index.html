              <p>yah, doing homework, disguise as forum debate right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">
              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">PAP have successfully isolate singapore from china, from china's influence,</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Long time ago chinese seek shelter in Nanyang, because the political turbulence, but no one  consider nanyang as their home,  Nanyang at that time is equivalent to a horrible place.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">many prostitute have been traffic to nanyang , and  they fear so much of going to nanyang, singaporean chinese at that time is similar to a diaspora jewish during world war, and jews in world promtly go back to Israel when the country of israel is formally established.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">and i am not familar with the history, during which singapore's economy grow tremendously. and PAP successfully establish a so called singapore spirit, which is similar to hongkong spirit, means working hard, and striving for success,</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">and the new generation is born in singapore, who enjoy first class infrastructure, and stable political enviorment, and after the successfully education and building of singpapore identity, the new generation consider them to be singaporean for the first time, and singaporean chinese become a name of different being with china chinese.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">the first generation of chinese come to singapore are mostly not educated people. THey may not be familiar with the classical chiense culture, which is the reason they don't develope firm bond with china,</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">questionable</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">and now after the english is being accepted as official language, no one willing to read difficult chinese classics, and the only tie between singaporean chinese and china is blocked, <span style="font-weight: bold;">that's the reason why singaporean chinese despise china chinese, although speaking same language, and looks the same.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">elaborate</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Singapore have made a miracle, after British formly withdraw from singpapore, they predict singapore will not survive without the aid from british side.But singapore successfully, building it's economy for post colony period, and successfully establish,"singapore" brand ,in world market in terms of  entre port economy,</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">now singapore have been on the right track of development, but seems the development of economy never satisfy the appetite of singaporean, and the more and more stressful life, triggered by globalisation, and shortage in local market itself, to build up a self sufficient economy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">after economic booming, steady peiord of development, singaporean feel that they are as good as US ,Uk, and proud of it's singapore identity. After the long time to struggle for survival, singaporean become more and more crave to become first class in every aspect, the PAP government already lagging behind to fulfill the need of singaporean's appetite for more transparent and democratic government. And the autocratic government model already become outdated to maintain a efficient and acceptable governance, just like a script in movie, they are looking for something more extraordinary.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">being exposed to more more about western life, especially the life in europe, where the human right, is greatly respected, where they have longer maternity leave, and less time in working, singaporean are not satisfied to be lecture by PAP, what is the next step, after the booming time, people realise that there are something more extraordinary, which is democracy, and realise that for so long time, they have been brainwashed, and behave like a working maching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">The shift from making survival concern to have more quality government and life in education, medical, insurance, and social welfare, mark a great breakthrough from post colony to new singapore identity.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">And this is the driving force, of calling for a political reform, we not only need money, and respect at the same time, it's the end of singapore's modernisation and westernisation, and the beginning , singapore creation.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">i hail for what singapore have achieved, but after all this , we need to think what is the next step, going western way, or going your own way. SIngapore need democracy, or authoritarian with singapore characristics.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">this question is what singapore will face during, next10 to 20 years.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">And the dead of old singapore and the born of new singapore will prove whether, singaporean is capable of facing the new era of economy, which is the ending of  one polarisation to multi  polarisation, and the decline of old world order, the rise of new  world order, which, the asia and asia market will become a big role in world economy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">this the question, singapore need to provide answer for , and we will witness, whether singapore will uplift itself from first class hardware, to first class "software", from hard power to soft power. it's time to take break, and think what is the next step for singapore.</p>

              is less stressful elsewhere, for example in Australia, and less costly, why not

              in Singapore, as shown by the recent decision to increase bus and MRT fares. In 
              Australia, on the other hand, the cost of living was very low - property was 
              cheap, cars were cheap, and parking in most places was free.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">Are these two potential emigrants so sure that the cost of 
              living will never go up in Australia? Which other country will they run off to 
              next, when bus fares go up in Australia? </span></p>

              <p>I not sure why you would want to turn your lan jiao. What do you want me to believe ? That he chose english because he was english educated ? Come on man. There was a need for a common language..not only to unite the population but also assimilate us into the world.</p>
              <p>Perhaps. I can agree with you that it is also partly because he wanted to "kill off" political opposition. I would do the same. Without stability we wouldn't have moved forward.</p>
              <p>That said, there will be side effects ultimately. You'll end up killing creativity and liberty and end up with a population who cannot manouvre, thinking too straight with all sorts of bias in their head. Some of which post an average of 16 posts in a forum a day and lamenting about his situation instead of going out and do something about it.</p>
