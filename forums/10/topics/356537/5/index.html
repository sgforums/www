              <p>I don't know, he asked me if i was Chinese before. I suspect it is because he don't quite believe that as a chinese i would have replied to one of his posts in the way i did.</p>
              <p>Similarly, perhaps he was suspicious about the fact that i'm effectively bilingual, possibly because he hasn't met one in Singapore that is like that.</p>
              <p>That said, maybe he belongs to one of the categories of friends i would not like to have, those that are hiding in a shell. Nothing personal against him but it's just my preference. I can of course be wrong about him/her.</p>
