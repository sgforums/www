There are nice people in Singapore, but unfortunately I did not meet many, so this post is composed just vent my resentment and unhappiness, and I am not mocking some people in particular but Singaporean in general, If you are not happy with the title, and content of the post, please ignore it, like that since when Singapore is importing a lot foreigner, and more and more of different voice will appear, that’s the pitfall of that policy, hope you can understand, and please don’t veto my account, anyway, we can see, whether Singapore is open or not here.</span></span></p>

              </span></p><p>Seeing singapore from another perspective</p>
              <p>To be honest , I didn’t develope any affection in the several years I live in singapore, but rather some resentment, which I will discuss later, see whether, the reason is because of my fault, or singapore is really not so perfect place as many perceived.</p>
              <p>When you need to know someone, you need to someone else, and make a comparision, singapore is clean, safe organised, as in the ads which attract tourist and student.</p>
              <p>But besides which, singapore also have many common bad thing like many other developed cities.</p>
              <p>I cited some example, singapore suicide rate is as high as japan, singapore homosexual rate is as high as in US, singapore divorce rate is as high as in US, singapore sexual satifaction rate is as high………, no I would say that,I think singapore sex satifaction rate is not as high as other country, I think singapore guys and girl didn’t enjoy satifactory sex, see, you are developed than african country, but in terms of sex, singapore is less developed than them, just see how long is the penis of black people. Most of asian will bow to them, so though many singaporean have more fortune than less developed country, but in terms of sex, or family tie, family relationship, singaporean should realy reexamine what happen to the socalled developed city, or first class, is the first class so first class?</p>
              <p>Franch should be proud of their romance, british should be proud of the large empire they ever build, American should be proud of the super power them own, even iraq egypt should be proud of the tradition they have, jewish say they are blessed and chosen by god. But singapore, I don’t know what they can be proud of, may the cleaness on the street, which is as clean as in hospital.</p>
              <p>Singapore have excellent people, like lee kuan yeo, and many business man, but many people comdemn lee kuan yeo, I think I can understand, because lee kuan yeo’s government is big governemtn, they do many thing good to people, but they are thinking in the way, that they have the right to decide thing for citizen, like raise the tax for alchol and cigar, which two, is the most important item discovered, to bring enjoyment to people, and relief pressure,</p>
              <p>So in the stressfull society like in singapore, I don’t understand why, government cannot allow people to indulge themselves in drink couples of beer, and smoke some cigarret.</p>
              <p>And they propose some idea like joggin to replace them, smoking and achohol is about to maximise your happiness in an allowed extend, which like a person, earn 2000, which is an average salary in sinagpore, imagine if the cigarette price, is not 10 dollar, instead, it’s 2 dollar, which is the price in other country, or the beer is not 6 dollar, but 1 dollar, do you feel much relief in consuming the commodity?</p>
              <p>Smoking doesnot hinder your health to that extend as publicised, as long, as you don’t chain smoking often , and do regular exercise, most important be happy,</p>
              <p>Then you will be just like the rest of guys, who smoke the whole life, but keep in a good shape.</p>
              <p>Being in the developed city, I hope singaporean could be more open minded, and accepted different mind, most of singaporean I encountered, are cynic, and touchy, many people even when they say sorry, they don’t mean it, just looks like they are banged by reality, suffer bad relationship, raised up in a bad family. Being nice is an art, when you have shit in your heart, you saw everything look like shit,</p>
              <p>Keep a right mentality, I advice you</p>
              <p>To be honest, singapore doesnot have a rich culture, many singaporean is short sighted as well,</p>
              <p>They have seldom knowledge about literature ,art, and history, one of the singapore minister said history is burdon, but I say is history make who you are. Singapore don’t have many culture to bond citizen, just like chinese in singapore, their culture is from the fact , they are chinese, just like the cantonese in singapore is just like cantonese in china, beside, singaporean cantonese speak english, I don’t know what’s their difference.</p>
              <p>One policy applied by singapore government underhandedly, is fool people, fool people is just an astonishing title, but in nature , they are really dcing this,</p>
              <p>PAP, knowing that knowledge make people smart, they educate people with engineering, saying engineering is good, engineering is good in the way of make a stable profitable career, but most of engineer are timid, did not developed independent thinking, easily being persvaded and manipulated. I once heard from friend, in school they don’t teach history or philosophy, they education system in singapore are pragmatic. And they are now wandering why singapore don’t developed enteurpreneur spirit, of course, if a person is not cultured with idea about life, and confidence about what he do, how he can set up a career and take the risk by themselves.</p>
              <p>Singapore provide good manager, but not good founder, there are not many sound local brand, I only know creative, ST, and the coffee maker supermix,</p>
              <p>I think singapore is overwhelmed by the good infrasture, the money they have, the rank in the world by other agency.</p>
              <p>But to be honest, singapore don’t have many space to develop, singapore major in export and import, when the rest of country is opening up, because the heritage they have, they will catching up, the new power house is in Asia, sooner or later, singapore will feel the heat of the pressure from his competitor.</p>
              <p>Today, I have said enough, if some day else I feel have to add something, I will do that,</p>
              <p>And at last, I will use a word used by many US people</p>
              <p>Peace dude.</p>

              themselves.</p>
              <p>Singapore provide good manager, but not good founder, there are
              not many sound local brand, I only know creative, ST, and the
              coffee maker supermix,</p>
              <p>I think singapore is overwhelmed by the good infrasture, the
              money they have, the rank in the world by other agency.</p>
              <p>But to be honest, singapore don’t have many space to develop,
              singapore major in export and import, when the rest of country is
              opening up, because the heritage they have, they will catching up,
              the new power house is in Asia, sooner or later, singapore will
              feel the heat of the pressure from his competitor.</p>
              <p>Today, I have said enough, if some day else I feel have to add
              something, I will do that,</p>
              <p>And at last, I will use a word used by many US people</p>
              <p>Peace dude.</p>

              <p>I think homosexual is a disease in modern society, it's a distortion in humanity, from genetical point of view,  there are people born to be homo, because of mutation from heredity. And some is born with both male and female genital ,</p>
              <p>Besides those who are born to be like this, i think the more active or increase in number of Homo is because stress, or abused by former opposite sex partner,</p>
              <p>which i think it's the reason that there are some homo in singapore, though i don't know many, because they always make them secluded.</p>
              <p>However, on this front, i think singapore can not be blamed ,because it's a disease of modern society. Family valued is no longer respect, or in another way, you could say, the diversity of human value is respected.</p>

              <p>you are right, i think some of PAP's policy is very paternalistic.From economic point of view, import FT is important, it will keep singapore competitive in international level.</p>
              <p>But too many FT flood in, and locals feels that they are invaded. Isn't the government should think for it's citizen, and look after it's citizen, since, many local are not happy with flood in of FT, PAP should reexamine the policy on it, anyway, GDP is not all of what we should looking for. Stay happy is most important.</p>
              <p>And as i have explained in my thread. In a stressful enviorment, alcohol and ciarette, is important for make people feel relieved, i don't know why government should think they are the right to decide what is good and bad for people.</p>
              <p>Singaporean are hard worker, and good learner, although on the way to westernize, singapore lost it's cultural identity, compare to Hongkong, whose film industry is booming, and cultural product export is massive, singapore should not just imitate what the west done, but be more creative about it's own culture.</p>

              <p>you know the spirit of open mindedness, is every voice is accepted although may not be agreed. I think if you want a acurate number of those rate, it need alot of manpower and alot time, but statistics is not the only source of our judgement, you would know it by common sense, i know it may sound offend to you.</p>
              <p>i am just saying besides GDP growth, people should really be concern about, am i better than last year, or am i happier, more contented?</p>
              <p>Though under a paternalistic government, you can expect nothing more from the government, the only thing we can do is to seek a way out, have the right mentality.</p>
              <p>People are not pawns of government to make there GDP figure looks better, if PAP really want to earn singaporean's heart, they should care more about what do we need, or maybe another way is be less active, less make decision for ordinary people.</p>

              <p>this is what i mentioned in my post, PAP try to fool people. Make them more subjugated, because PAP seldom teach politics history, or philosophy in education, which will educate more independent spirit, of course in terms of subjugation, they are less easier to be controled. But in terms of improve the welfare of the society as a whole, independent thinking is important.</p>
              <p>PAP are composed of some elite, they are good in making money,  the biggest local company is controlled temasek group, they make singapore to be international trade center, and appear to be everything is in order and disciplined.</p>
              <p>and everything the PAP decide is from economic point of view, not from historical or humanitical point of view, it's also becaused of the less training in history or political or phisolophical knowledge</p>

              <p><br>people often talk about survival, if you earn less like 100 or 200 bucks, does it make you survival impossible? Don't have to worry about survival, even in african country, which is hot, and food is in scarcity, people can survive, not to mention, in singapore, people is relatively rich,</p>

              <p>in the economic downturn, many people have lost their job, but as you said you have a choice to value family, how about borrowing some money from relative or parent or offsprings? Does it make things easier,</p>
              <p>and being in a job market like singapore where competition is hot, yes, you need to be prepared, but i think, if you have the right mentality, you could always have things done, there is always a jobs, like nanny, cleaner, if you are not capable for a good job, then if you survival is your priority, i think there is always a job there, as long as you could lower your pride. Even in the most developed country, there are people not employed, so it's not a matter of economy good or bad.</p>
              <p>there is no utopia , everyone could just seat there, and waiting for food. But i think working is joyful thing ,if you have the right mentality.</p>
              <p>I forget what we are arguing about, it's about survival, right?</p>
              <p>hum, so don't have to worry too much, i think PAP is subsidising poor people right? And family support is important during hard time.Let's get over it</p>
