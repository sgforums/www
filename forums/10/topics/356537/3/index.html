              <p>chinese have been practise ancestor worship for a long time, i am sure whether what you said is true, it sounds like conspiracy theory, but i think PAP have successfully isolate singapore from china, from china's influence,</p>
              <p>Long time ago chinese seek shelter in Nanyang, which is singapura in chinese, because the political turbulence, but no one  consider nanyang as their home, sooner or later they want to get back to china, and Nanyang at that time is equivalent to a horrible place, rumoured among chinese,</p>
              <p>many prostitute have been traffic to nanyang , and  they fear so much of going to nanyang, singaporean chinese at that time is similar to a diaspora jewish during world war, and jews in world promtly go back to Israel when the country of israel is formally established.</p>
              <p>and i am not familar with the history, during which singapore's economy grow tremendously. and PAP successfully establish a so called singapore spirit, which is similar to hongkong spirit, means working hard, and striving for success,</p>
              <p>and the new generation is born in singapore, who enjoy first class infrastructure, and stable political enviorment, and after the successfully education and building of singpapore identity, the new generation consider them to be singaporean for the first time, and singaporean chinese become a name of different being with china chinese.</p>
              <p>but although offending, but i would say, the first generation of chinese come to singapore are mostly not educated people. THey may not be familiar with the classical chiense culture, which is the reason they don't develope firm bond with china,</p>
              <p>and now after the english is being accepted as official language, no one willing to read difficult chinese classics, and the only tie between singaporean chinese and china is blocked, that's the reason why singaporean chinese despise china chinese, although speaking same language, and looks the same.</p>
              <p>Singapore have made a miracle, after British formly withdraw from singpapore, they predict singapore will not survive without the aid from british side.But singapore successfully, building it's economy for post colony period, and successfully establish,"singapore" brand ,in world market in terms of  entre port economy,</p>
              <p>now singapore have been on the right track of development, but seems the development of economy never satisfy the appetite of singaporean, and the more and more stressful life, triggered by globalisation, and shortage in local market itself, to build up a self sufficient economy.</p>
              <p>after economic booming, steady peiord of development, singaporean feel that they are as good as US ,Uk, and proud of it's singapore identity. After the long time to struggle for survival, singaporean become more and more crave to become first class in every aspect, the PAP government already lagging behind to fulfill the need of singaporean's appetite for more transparent and democratic government. And the autocratic government model already become outdated to maintain a efficient and acceptable governance, just like a script in movie, they are looking for something more extraordinary.</p>
              <p>being exposed to more more about western life, especially the life in europe, where the human right, is greatly respected, where they have longer maternity leave, and less time in working, singaporean are not satisfied to be lecture by PAP, what is the next step, after the booming time, people realise that there are something more extraordinary, which is democracy, and realise that for so long time, they have been brainwashed, and behave like a working maching.</p>
              <p>The shift from making survival concern to have more quality government and life in education, medical, insurance, and social welfare, mark a great breakthrough from post colony to new singapore identity.</p>
              <p>And this is the driving force, of calling for a political reform, we not only need money, and respect at the same time, it's the end of singapore's modernisation and westernisation, and the beginning , singapore creation.</p>
              <p>i hail for what singapore have achieved, but after all this , we need to think what is the next step, going western way, or going your own way. SIngapore need democracy, or authoritarian with singapore characristics.</p>
              <p>this question is what singapore will face during, next10 to 20 years.</p>
              <p>And the dead of old singapore and the born of new singapore will prove whether, singaporean is capable of facing the new era of economy, which is the ending of  one polarisation to multi  polarisation, and the decline of old world order, the rise of new  world order, which, the asia and asia market will become a big role in world economy.</p>
              <p>this the question, singapore need to provide answer for , and we will witness, whether singapore will uplift itself from first class hardware, to first class "software", from hard power to soft power. it's time to take break, and think what is the next step for singapore.</p>

              <p>chinese have been practise ancestor worship for a long time, i am sure whether what you said is true, it sounds like conspiracy theory, but i think PAP have successfully isolate singapore from china, from china's influence,</p>
              <p>Long time ago chinese seek shelter in Nanyang, which is singapura in chinese, because the political turbulence, but no one  consider nanyang as their home, sooner or later they want to get back to china, and Nanyang at that time is equivalent to a horrible place, rumoured among chinese,</p>
              <p>many prostitute have been traffic to nanyang , and  they fear so much of going to nanyang, singaporean chinese at that time is similar to a diaspora jewish during world war, and jews in world promtly go back to Israel when the country of israel is formally established.</p>
              <p>and i am not familar with the history, during which singapore's economy grow tremendously. and PAP successfully establish a so called singapore spirit, which is similar to hongkong spirit, means working hard, and striving for success,</p>
              <p>and the new generation is born in singapore, who enjoy first class infrastructure, and stable political enviorment, and after the successfully education and building of singpapore identity, the new generation consider them to be singaporean for the first time, and singaporean chinese become a name of different being with china chinese.</p>
              <p>but although offending, but i would say, the first generation of chinese come to singapore are mostly not educated people. THey may not be familiar with the classical chiense culture, which is the reason they don't develope firm bond with china,</p>
              <p>and now after the english is being accepted as official language, no one willing to read difficult chinese classics, and the only tie between singaporean chinese and china is blocked, that's the reason why singaporean chinese despise china chinese, although speaking same language, and looks the same.</p>
              <p>Singapore have made a miracle, after British formly withdraw from singpapore, they predict singapore will not survive without the aid from british side.But singapore successfully, building it's economy for post colony period, and successfully establish,"singapore" brand ,in world market in terms of  entre port economy,</p>
              <p>now singapore have been on the right track of development, but seems the development of economy never satisfy the appetite of singaporean, and the more and more stressful life, triggered by globalisation, and shortage in local market itself, to build up a self sufficient economy.</p>
              <p>after economic booming, steady peiord of development, singaporean feel that they are as good as US ,Uk, and proud of it's singapore identity. After the long time to struggle for survival, singaporean become more and more crave to become first class in every aspect, the PAP government already lagging behind to fulfill the need of singaporean's appetite for more transparent and democratic government. And the autocratic government model already become outdated to maintain a efficient and acceptable governance, just like a script in movie, they are looking for something more extraordinary.</p>
              <p>being exposed to more more about western life, especially the life in europe, where the human right, is greatly respected, where they have longer maternity leave, and less time in working, singaporean are not satisfied to be lecture by PAP, what is the next step, after the booming time, people realise that there are something more extraordinary, which is democracy, and realise that for so long time, they have been brainwashed, and behave like a working maching.</p>
              <p>The shift from making survival concern to have more quality government and life in education, medical, insurance, and social welfare, mark a great breakthrough from post colony to new singapore identity.</p>
              <p>And this is the driving force, of calling for a political reform, we not only need money, and respect at the same time, it's the end of singapore's modernisation and westernisation, and the beginning , singapore creation.</p>
              <p>i hail for what singapore have achieved, but after all this , we need to think what is the next step, going western way, or going your own way. SIngapore need democracy, or authoritarian with singapore characristics.</p>
              <p>this question is what singapore will face during, next10 to 20 years.</p>
              <p>And the dead of old singapore and the born of new singapore will prove whether, singaporean is capable of facing the new era of economy, which is the ending of  one polarisation to multi  polarisation, and the decline of old world order, the rise of new  world order, which, the asia and asia market will become a big role in world economy.</p>
              <p>this the question, singapore need to provide answer for , and we will witness, whether singapore will uplift itself from first class hardware, to first class "software", from hard power to soft power. it's time to take break, and think what is the next step for singapore.</p>

              <p>Baba, Nyonya, Peranakan, i think it is fair to consider them "half chinese", although some would say they are non chinese or "mixed" chinese.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew was raised as a baba chinese.</p>
              <p>Maybe half chinese is not proper term to use here, maybe "mixed" chinese is better or probably baba chinese is clearer.</p>

              <p><br>Don't get me wrong. I'm effectively bilingual and i still appreciate the chinese culture. I watch more chinese movies, listen to more chinese music than english ones. I just thought LKY was turning with the tides, with english and then the speak mandarin campaign.</p>
