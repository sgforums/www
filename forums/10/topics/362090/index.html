              <h1>Rudd presses for new Asia-Pacific community with summit</h1>
              <p class="byline">By Kate Hannon</p>
              <p> May 29, 2009</p>
              <div id="article-intro">UNDAUNTED by the mixed reaction to his
                      proposed new Asia-Pacific Community (APc), Prime Minister Kevin Rudd
                      plans to invite regional leaders to meet in Australia late this year to
                      discuss the idea.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Rudd first raised the idea of a new
                      grouping of nations aimed at bringing together the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">United States</span>,
                      China, Japan, India, Indonesia and Australia,</strong></span> among others in the
                      region, nearly a year ago. <br><br>His
                      special envoy appointed to explore the idea of the APc, former senior
                      diplomat Richard Woolcott, has reported support for discussion about
                      the community but no "appetite" for yet another forum or regular
                      meeting. <br><br>Revealing part of Mr Woolcott's report in a speech to the annual Shangri La conference in Singapore tonight, Mr <a class="media-search-keyword" title="Search for more about Rudd said  across the News Network" href="http://search.news.com.au/search//0/?us=ndmnews&amp;sid=29277&amp;as=news&amp;ac=ninews2&amp;q=Rudd%20said">Rudd said </a> Mr Woolcott found widespread recognition that a single forum for
                      leaders to meet and discuss political, economic and security challenges
                      together was lacking. <br><br>Mr Rudd said that without a vehicle such
                      as his proposed APc he was concerned about "the possibility of
                      strategic drift within our region" in the long term. <br><br>"Or even worse, strategic polarisation; polarisation which I believe serves nobody's interests," Mr Rudd said.</div>
              <div id="article-intro">
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He said he planned to invite leaders of nations in Asia, Oceania and
                      the eastern Pacific to Australia "to further explore the idea of an
                      Asia-pacific community" by 2020. </strong></span><br><br>While he gave no date or location for the conference, he said it would be held after the <a class="media-search-keyword" title="Search for more about East Asia Summit  across the News Network" href="http://search.news.com.au/search//0/?us=ndmnews&amp;sid=29277&amp;as=news&amp;ac=ninews2&amp;q=East%20Asia%20Summit">East Asia Summit </a> due in the Philippines in September and APEC which meets in Singapore in November. <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>Mr
                      Rudd has argued that bodies such as the Asia Pacific Economic Community
                      (APEC), the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the
                      East Asia Summit each have their singular focus. </strong></span><br><br>He said
                      Australia believed a new community could help shape the region which is
                      fast changing with the rapid growth of China and India. <br><br>"I do
                      not believe we can afford to sit idly by while the region simply
                      evolves - without any sense of strategic purpose," he said. <br><br>"In fact, I believe that is potentially dangerous. <br><br>"We do not bring to the table a misty-eyed idealism about some pan-regional utopia." <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But Mr Rudd said Mr Woolcott's discussions with regional leaders found little agreement on how to proceed. </strong></span><br><br>Although
                      they did agree that the current structures did not provide a relevant
                      forum to discuss security, political and economic issues. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"Thirdly, it was clear that no one wants more meetings. There is no appetite for additional institutions," Mr Rudd said. </strong></span></p>
              <p>"It is difficult enough for leaders to make it to the range of meetings we already have." <br><br>Mr Rudd said he had an open mind on "where we end up".</p>

              <p>Kevin Rudd, there are already too many of such organisations already.</p>
              <p>Endless summits and meetings already.</p>
              <p>And I also oppose the idea of USA butting into asian affairs.</p>
              <p>Thank you Kevin Rudd.</p>

              <p>The United States never misses any opportunity to take a hand in international organizations involving U.S. interests. Another way to put it is that the United States consistently sees the actions of all international organizations as being closely related to U.S. interests.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>No matter whether the nature of the international organization is European, American, Asian, for some other region, or worldwide, the United States always strives to get involved in it, and manipulate it.</strong></span> The 1996 U.S. Department of Defense Report put it straightforwardly, "To protect and achieve U.S. interests, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the U.S. Government must have the capability to influence the policies and actions of other countries. </strong></span></p>
              <p>This requires the United States to maintain its overseas involvement, especially in those areas in which the most important interests of the United States are endangered."</p>
              <p>For example, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>regarding the establishment of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization, the initial idea of its conceptualizer, Australian Prime Minister Hawke, was that it would only include Asian countries, Australia, and New Zealand. </strong></span>However, this idea immediately <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>encountered strong opposition from President Bush, and it was then expanded to include the United States and Canada. </strong></span></p>
              <p>At the same time, so as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>to check the momentum of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation, the United States spared no effort in instigating some Asian countries to sign independent agreements with the North American Free Trade Area. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Not only did the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> United States make its way in, it also dragged others out.</strong></span>..</p>

              <h1 class="section-heading">Barack Obama's man Kurt Campbell junks Kevin Rudd's Asia-Pacific plan</h1>
              <p class="intro"><strong>KEVIN Rudd's proposal for an Australian-led
                  Asia-Pacific community similar to the European Union has been slapped
                  down by the top envoy chosen by Barack Obama to represent US interests
                  in the region.</strong></p>
              <p>Kurt Campbell yesterday raised
                  serious difficulties with the Prime Minister's plan, declaring that
                  Asians hated to be compared with Europe.</p>
              <p>Speaking at US Senate confirmation hearing before his expected
                  swearing-in as assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the
                  Pacific, Dr Campbell said multilateral diplomacy in Asia was still
                  "very shallow", and the success of any Asia-Pacific union would require
                  deeper roots.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He made it clear that the US, rather than Australia, would see its
                  role as harnessing and directing any large new institution that
                  involved China and Japan. </strong></span></p>
              <p>In a surprise move, Mr Rudd announced 12 months ago that he wanted
                  Australia to spearhead the creation of a regional institution spanning
                  the Asia-Pacific region. Appointing veteran Australian diplomat Richard
                  Woolcott to lobby regional leaders, Mr Rudd said his proposed union
                  would include the US, China, Japan, India, Indonesia and other
                  countries in the region. While the EU should not provide "an identikit
                  model", the Prime Minister said he believed the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Asia-Pacific region
                  could learn much from the European grouping. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Only a fortnight ago, Mr Rudd demonstrated that his enthusiasm for
                  setting up an Asia-Pacific union by 2020 remained undiminished, telling
                  the annual Shangri La conference in Singapore that without a go-ahead
                  for his proposal, he was concerned about "the possibility of strategic
                  drift within our region".</p>
              <p>Dr Campbell, a highly regarded policy expert who knows Australia
                  well and is close to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, told the US
                  Senate committee on foreign relations yesterday that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Asia was "full of
                  these meetings, both multilateral and mini-lateral", saying:
                  "Everyone's got these." </strong></span></p>
              <p>He said he had met representatives of the Prime Minister when they
                  were in Washington, and he was concerned about what growing numbers of
                  such groups were asked to do.</p>
              <p>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I know Asians hate to be compared with Europe</strong></span>, and it's a very
                  different set of circumstances, and I appreciate that, but the
                  diplomacy in Asia of a multilateral sort is still very shallow - and if
                  it's to be successful it has to have deeper roots," Dr Campbell said...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Some rivalry between USA and Australia here.</p>
              <p>Asia pacific union is a rubbish idea in my opinion, I hope Kevin Rudd can stop promoting this rubbish.</p>
              <p>Why asia suddenly go linked with pacific?</p>
              <p>EU itself is a flawed organisation;  want us to create this flawed organisation?</p>
              <p>Better go fuck off.</p>
              <p>You USA and Australia are both not part of asia, don't come and promote what EU style bullshit union here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You don't think I stupid or naive not to see through your fucking agenda.</p>

              <p><strong>Impetus given to concept of Asia-Pacific integration</strong></p>
              <p><span>"Asia-Pacific community" has once again
                  become a heated topic since the Eighth Annual Asian Security Summit was
                  held from May 29 to 31 in Singapore under the auspices of the
                  London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. The
                  Asia-Pacific community is depicted with an air of idealism, and members
                  on the Asia-Pacific rim are alive with a long-term desire to capture
                  large shares on global economy.<br><br>Australian Prime Minister Kevin
                  Rudd first proposed an Asia Pacific community concept in June 2008,
                  when he set forth a grand blueprint to foster a regional cooperation
                  body by 2020 at the Asia society's Sydney-based AustralAsia Center.<br><br>According
                  to his blueprint, the trans-Pacific body to be set up by 2020 will
                  include the United States, China, Japan and India. It will take the
                  Asia-Pacific Economic Organization (APEC), or a forum for 21 Pacific
                  Rim countries, the ASEAN Regional Forum, the ASEAN plus Three countries
                  (China, Japan and South Korea), the East Asia Summit and other existing
                  regional frameworks as the basis. And it will expand the capacity to
                  cope with transnational non-traditional security threats, open trade
                  mechanisms and provide long-term fuel energy resources and food
                  security guarantees.<br><br>The European Union (EU) is often viewed as
                  the epitome of regional integration in the political, economical,
                  social and other spheres, and it is considered as a model to be
                  followed by other regional groupings, Prime Minister Rudd said. But
                  skeptics were once suspicious of its viability and so "it was necessary
                  to take the first step," he acknowledged. <br><br>"Asia-Pacific
                  Community" initiative is based on the definition and recognition of
                  challenges facing the region. Against the backdrop of growing economic
                  globalization, the traditional and non-traditional security issues are
                  very complicated and mutually interwoven. Climate change, fuel energy
                  and food security have been turned into major topics in international
                  relations, and the spread of terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of
                  mass destruction and the rampant piracy also called for multi-faceted
                  coordinated responses.<br><br>Nevertheless, the U.S.'initiative has
                  been referred to as the key to the defense of security in the
                  Asia-Pacific region. It is precisely for this reason that Singapore,
                  Thailand and a few other Asian nations were not so enthusiastic with
                  the Asia-Pacific community concept when it was first announced as they
                  all had the fear of marginalization in their future regional framework.
                  Perhaps also against this background, Australian Prime Minister Kevin
                  Rudd tried purposely to dim the hues of big powers during his recent
                  trip to Singapore. In delineating an Asian regional community, Rudd
                  underscored the leading, facilitative role of the ASEAN and other
                  related coordinating mechanisms in the course of the community building.<br><br>In
                  view of an in-depth perspective, there is obviously a wide spread of
                  collisions between various concepts in international affairs. As a
                  matter of fact, East Asian nations are interdependent in the fields of
                  economy and trade, and they carry out practical cooperation in
                  non-traditional security spheres. Stern challenges, however, remain in
                  their traditional security realm.<br><br>Nevertheless, the Asia-Pacific
                  transformation process is bound to be very complex and difficult. And
                  what crucial at the moment is to seize the opportunity for regional
                  cooperation and integration and jointly eliminate real obstacles on the
                  way ahead.</span></p>
