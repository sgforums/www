              <p>I am not sure if it is an Asian mentality or just Chinese, house is not just a place to stay, but also an asset where you park your money or grow your investment. From a practical point of view, it is indeed stupid to move from a 5 room HDB to a tiny condo, but to many, the potential of increase in value of condo is much higher than for condo, and you have the total freedom to the use and sales of the condo, compared to HDB.</p>
              <p>In many cities in Asia, there is always the housing for the free market and that a cheaper alternative for the citizens. But in cities like HK, the whole market is in the hands of a few tycoons, the most well known is Li Ka Shing, and HK government's hands are often tied when it comes to developing more public housing which will inevitably impact the private housing. There is not much the people can do to make money. Singaporean are happy if the government, or anybody who can help them fulfill the housing dream and make money.</p>
              <p>People shows their status in different ways. To me, it is not so much what they have physically, but their values. Where they stay, what kind of house or apartment, got private swimming pool or garden, club membership....the 5 Cs, ....not many know how to express virtues or moral values, if they have any.</p>
              <p>Houses and cars money can buy, work hard and you can get it, virtues and the right values takes time to cultivate. Recently at a coffee shop this not so old uncle bought everybody coffee because he is now a GRAND FATHER, hahahaha....and that is a status not many of us can achieve, no matter how hard we try.</p>

              <p>there is no doubt that more retrenchments are on the horizon, but it is really sad that your only survival kit is to lick arse. The worse is the situation where the retrenchment is between you and your boss, then he gets the satisfaction of being licked and then to keep his job.</p>
              <p>If your job is becoming redundant, stay and get a good package if any, in the meantime look for a job. Never resign before you've found another job.</p>
