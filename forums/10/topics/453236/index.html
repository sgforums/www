              <p>Strangely, HK has never got to do much about its country for a century because of being the China gateway.  With China slow down, HK govt also begin to feel the heat to do something for its country.  Please see its approach to the problem is similar to our govt:</p>

              <p><a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/hong-kong/">Hong Kong</a> workers may need to retire
              later and universities should admit more overseas students as
              the city’s workforce contracts after 2020, the government said
              in a report.</p>
              <p>The government should review whether facilities for
              expatriate workers such as international school places are
              sufficient, <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.admwing.gov.hk/pdf/SCPP%20Progress%20Report%202012%20%28Eng%29.pdf">according to the report</a> released by the Steering
              Committee on Population Policy yesterday. Local women should be
              encouraged to give birth, the task force said.</p>
              <p>A failure to reverse the potential decline in the size of
              the workforce will limit future economic growth, according to
              the report. Hong Kong, a special administrative region of <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/china/">China</a> that runs its own domestic policy, faces competition from Asian
              cities including Tokyo and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/singapore/">Singapore</a> in attracting skilled
              workers and executives.</p>
              <p>The possible decline in the working population may “reduce
              the standard of living, weaken competitiveness and undermine the
              economic vitality of Hong Kong society,” the working group said
              in the report.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong’s workforce will shrink to 3.49 million in 2029
              from a projected 3.58 million in 2020, according to the report.
              The aging population will exert an increasing burden on workers,
              the committee said.</p>
              <p>In a survey of American Chamber of Commerce members in May
              2011, 63 percent said some executives are driven away by the
              lack of student places.</p>

              <p>No disagreement with you about the passport issue. However, while HK is part of China, the fact remains that mainland Chinese cannot suka suka go to HK, the beijing government controls the number of people going to china and the HK government controls the number of pragnant women who can come to HK. There is no free flow as in any country.</p>
              <p>While acknowledging that HK is part of China and Singapore is a sovereign country, HK and Singapore have similiar legal and civil service system (different from China), similar in size, both were the Asian Tigers, both are cities, with urban population. Both economies are heavily depended on service and financial industries, both depends heavily on cheap labour from around the region...... There are so much more that are common between Singapore and HK that there must be something we can learn from each other.</p>
              <p>To ignore HK's experience simply because they are part of China is just political.</p>
