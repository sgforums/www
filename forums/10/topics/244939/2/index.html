            <div class='col-md body'>Ok.... There's no Free Lunch in this world.... I suggest for free education only... Not subsidised petrol, not Free medical care, not Paying for those who dun work at all....<br><br>There are not enough in the workforce rite?? So the gov provide free education.... The singaporeans' National Service(including Girls) start at the age of 16-17 after O levels....<br><br>All must go though Poly... Take away A Levels... this way... every citizen starts learning a skill that the industries need at the age of 16-17(cheap Labour.. the gov provides ur education remember??).... During Holidays... All citizens are attached to GLCs... or some other companies that requires the student's skills set.... High Flyers may oso be sent to Overseas Attachments....<br><br>Minimum education a singaporean must possess is at least a Basic Degree.... Those who can't complete or dun wanna complete therefore is owing the Gov NS liabilities... They are not allowed to setup business in sg... they are not allowed to work for companies as they pleased.... So die die oso hv to study and do "NS"... Might as well choose a field that they hv passion abt....<br><br>In this way... we solve the problem of middle management workforce.... Top management and R&amp;D maybe still need foreign talents.... but sg does not requires as many as now....<br><br>On the same time... we still welcome pple to come sg to study wif us... still aim to be an world class education hub...<br><br>there are problems in this system... STILL needa import foreign talents ,... But mostly low end one... High end one got... but will get lesser as time goes by...<br><br>And since every citizen's a basic degree holder... we can produce more Doctors.... There might be a over-supply of doctors here.... as a result... these pple's skills will be a demand by other countries and head-hunted... It is another prob How our Gov wanna retain really... our own LOCAL talent~~</div>

The gov wants 6.5 million population... wat makes u tink there aren't enough jobs to go around?<br><br>Yes.. I agree the learning process is diff for everyone... those slower ones will hv to spend more years la... I already stated that there will be problem since everyone is a degree holder.... and I agree that I'm raising the bar.... not all countries hv the same standards.... as long as we produce graduates tat are world class... note tat.... after they graduate... they are free to work for whoever they like internationally.....<br><br>and Y i suggested start from poly is becoz it's progressive training... slowly more and more workload... an average guy would be able to complete basic degree course...<br><br>this is an advantage for the citizens as well... coz if they can't survive here... they can always shift to other countries where their skill sets are in demand...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes free Education for everyone is desirable.. Who can argue against that? But free education doesnt come from Nature in unlimited amounts, it is a man made value, hence WHO will be the ones providing this kind of service and for free? Surely a group of people's efforts and resources will have to be sacrificed.. In the end ultimately all that this free education thing will do is to violate more and more human rights.. Thats why i'm against this..<br><br>And maybe the government has the wisdom to see this and hence provide subsidies at best</div>
