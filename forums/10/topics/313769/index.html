              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Is this Singapore's Chief Justice Chan's confession?</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>If ever I have read a more cryptic, a
              more disguised, veiled, statement or threat of any person, this is it.
              I am referring to the article in Singapore’s state controlled newspaper
              the Straits Times of April 04, 2008 titled "<em>Let all have access to justice: CJ Chan</em>".<br><br>The entire report, no matter which way one wants to look at it, appears to be one thing, and one thing alone. A <em>mea culpa</em>.
              It appears the Chief Justice has finally had pangs of conscience
              hurting him, and now it is time for him to admit once and for all, that
              the Singapore legal system is not that free at all!<br><br>A careful reading of the state controlled newspaper report looks like this.<br><br>He says "<em>Singapore
              Lower Courts have been placed high in international rankings but what
              matters is the quality of justice people here receive</em>".<br><br>Just
              what is he saying here? Is he finally admitting that these
              international rankings that the government so proudly publishes are
              rankings not to judge whether the law is impartially applied; but
              instead, to judge how fast cases are dealt with and money recovered.<br><br>Is
              he admitting that all respected international organizations who truly
              judge whether rule of law and human rights exist; such as Amnesty
              International and Human Rights Watch have stated repeatedly that
              Singapore courts do not exercise the rule of law?<br><br>Is he
              therefore admitting finally that Singapore does not practice the rule
              of law, and that Singapore is nothing more than a dictatorship ruled by
              Lee's dictates? Is he now saying that the time has finally come for
              Singapore judges to actually behave as judges and not as PAP
              politicians?<br><br>Chief Justice Chan says "<em>While ranking matters, they should not detract from what matters</em>".<br><br>Again,
              we see what appears to be an admission that these rankings such as
              PERC, a Hong Kong based organization which caters to multi national
              businesses, gives high marks consistently to Singapore legal system;
              because it is more concerned about how much profit off shore
              businessmen can make in Singapore; not how much justice an ordinary
              Singaporean Dr. Chee Soon Juan can get in Singapore’s courts.<br><br>When he says "<em>they should not detract from what matters</em>"
              is he now admitting there is in fact a serious problem with the state
              of the law in Singapore, because of a lack of an independent judiciary,
              and that something should be finally done about it?<br><br>"<em>We should not allow them to dominate and overwhelm our own assessment of the quality of justice that we administer to our people</em>"
              Are we seeing an admission that he has neglected to examine the quality
              of justice in Singapore; that rule of law is indeed lacking and that
              something now has to be done about it?<br><br>He then goes on to
              directly and deliberately admit that these foreign rankings that Lee
              Kuan Yew has selectively relied upon were "<em>limited to certain
              aspects of justice such as how fast litigants can get a judgment from
              the courts and enforce them, as in cases in debt recovery and
              bankruptcy".<br></em><br>Is he therefore finally admitting that Lee
              Kuan Yew and his government have been downright untruthful and
              dishonest all these past 40 years when they routinely went around
              trumpeting the fact that Singapore follows the rule of law based on
              these one sided reports; but they knew all along that Singapore judges
              are not impartial, beholden to Lee Kuan Yew and the law is nothing more
              than decrees which he executes through his compliant judges.<br><br>Is he finally admitting that not only Lee Kuan Yew but he himself has been somewhat untruthful all these years!<br><br>And here he finally admits that “<em>these
              rankings surveys serve as a useful purpose in alerting foreign
              investors to the potential strengths and weaknesses of the judicial or
              legal systems of the countries".<br></em><br>Is this therefore an
              admission, belated, but still welcome that these business orientated
              rankings, do nothing for the average Fatima binte Kastari, in her claim
              that she did not violate the law, in the exercise of her constitutional
              right of freedom of assembly, when she protested at the Tak Boleh
              Tahan, in front of Parliament House?<br><br>I have no doubt in my mind
              that the Chief Justice of Singapore was trying to tell us something.
              Since if he was trying to say two and two are four, he could have done
              a much better job.<br><br>Let us hope that our expectation is indeed
              correct. That Mr. Chan Sek Keong, the Chief Justice of Singapore has
              finally seen the light, realized the folly of his ways and has finally
              picked up the courage as Thomas Beckett did in King Henry's court; and
              has finally declared that business cannot go on as usual. The time has
              finally come for the rule of law and democracy!<br><br>And let us hope that finally he has decided after all to become a judge, and not carry on in those robes as a PAP politician.<br><br>If
              that is in fact your intention, well done old man. But the question is,
              if you did what you threaten, will you end up as a bookseller just as
              JB Jeyaretnam and Dr. Chee Soon Juan have become, after inviting the
              wrath of the tiger, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>Please tell us more, Mr. Chief Justice.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>Perhaps C.J. Chan is attempting to make his own mark in the history books of the Singapore Judiciary - in a more dramatic human dimension compared to what the previous C.J Yong Pung How had left behind in terms of an improved infrastructure for a modern judicial legacy.</p>
