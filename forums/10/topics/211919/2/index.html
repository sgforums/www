            <div class='col-md body'>BANGKOK - AS A socialist and one who protested against the coup in Thailand with the slogan, 'No to Thaksin...No to the coup', I wish to explain the democratic alternatives to the coup.<br>The present coup leaders claim that 80 per cent of the Thai people supported it. If so, and the 16 million people who voted for deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra on April 2 have now really changed their minds, these military men should have taken an alternative road.<br><br>Months, if not years, ago, they should have set up a political party and taken part in the elections which were being called. With their 80 per cent backing, they would have beaten the Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party. It is no secret that the Democrat Party, which supports the coup, boycotted the April 2 polls because they knew they would lose. And they knew they would also lose the next scheduled polls.<br><br>Did Mr Thaksin and TRT win successive elections with convincing majorities because they cheated? There is no evidence that the 16 million people who voted for this party were forced to do so. There were no armed men forcing them to vote in any particular manner. I voted on April 2 against TRT and I did not feel that anyone was watching me. Did TRT give money to voters? Probably, but so too did the Democrats, Chart Thai and Mahachon parties. Did this affect the outcome of the vote? No. Why not?<br><br>In his book, Tale Of Two Democratic Cities, Anek Laothamatas argues that it is necessary to build political parties with real policies which can win votes in the countryside. This would end or reduce the system of patronage and money politics. The book was written before TRT was even established.<br><br>What TRT actually did was spend some time building up policies that would correspond with the needs and demands of various sectors of society. They won the elections on those policies, especially with the first-ever universal health-care scheme and provision for village funds. They won again last year and this year because they carried out those policies.<br><br>The Democrats lost because they spent all the time attacking the health-care scheme and other social benefits on the basis that these destroyed 'fiscal discipline'. While they were in power after the Asian economic crisis, the Democrats, like all neo-liberals, felt that it was not against 'fiscal discipline' to use Thai money to pay off the non-performing loans created by the rich. Some years ago, I shared platforms with spokesmen for TRT and the Democrats. I attacked TRT's abuses of power and criticised the Democrats for not having any policies. It did not take a genius to work these facts out.<br><br>Yes, the TRT government was one of big business and it also carried out neo-liberal policies for business interests such as privatisation and free trade agreements. There was no difference from the Democrats there. But worse still, TRT committed gross human rights abuses in the war on drugs and in the country's troubled south, and it is responsible for the abduction and presumed death of defence lawyer Somchai Nilapaichit. There was also corruption, but this is a common phenomenon in Thai politics.<br><br>There is an arrogant and anti-democratic camp that argues that the rural and urban poor do not understand democracy. Not only are the poor uneducated, but they also lack information, so we are told.<br><br>'Democracy,' say these undemocratic and elitist liberals, is where a government does not bow to the wishes and demands of the electorate. For them to give people what they want is like giving sweets to children - a bad thing because all their teeth will rot later.<br><br>So if the poor cannot come to their senses and vote for a nice party like the Democrats, which will cut their social benefits and village funds (in the national interest of course), then the poor do not deserve the vote. These people called for the use of Section 7, where His Majesty the King appoints an alternative government in a crisis. This did not happen, but a coup did take place later, which these so-called liberals now support.<br><br>Over a year ago, a number of us set up the Peoples Coalition Party in order to campaign against war, state violence and neo-liberalism. We called for the establishment of a social democratic welfare state, funded by progressive taxation of the rich. Not many people have joined us in building an alternative party which could offer real benefits to the poor majority.<br><br>So what now? The one thing I have learnt over the years, with encouragement from my parents, was never to trust a military dictatorship. A coup is not 'reform'. Dictatorship is not 'democracy'. The military cannot be trusted. Democracy has taken a serious step backwards.<br><br>But Thai democracy, like democracy anywhere, is and always will be built from below by social movements. That is why true supporters of democracy must stand together and demand that the military leave politics and that the 1997 Constitution be immediately restored, along with all democratic rights.<br><br>The military has no right to stage a coup or tear up the Constitution, just as Mr Thaksin had no right to commit gross human rights abuses or to avoid paying tax. The military also has no right to appoint a temporary government. Such a government, if necessary, should be elected under the supervision of the old Parliament, the new and old Senate and real representatives of the social movements. It should have only one important job: to organise political and social reform, involving representatives from all sectors of society, especially the majority who are farmers, blue-collar and white-collar workers.<br><br>The writer teaches in the Faculty of Political Science at Chulalongkorn University.<br><br>THE NATION/ASIA NEWS NETWORK<br>(Straits Times 27 Sep)</div>
