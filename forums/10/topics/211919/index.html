            <div class='col-md body'>[quote="szhcornan73"]<br><blockquote>Quote:from post of szhcornan73 at youngpap.org.sg<br>What is democracy? A tortoise, not a hare.<br>By Janadas Devas ST review<br>24 Sep 2006<br><br>WHAT is democracy?<br><br>The laymanÂ’s answer would be simple. Democracy, he would say, means citizen get to choose their rulers in fair and free elections held at periodic intervals. It also means citizens whose rights are constitutionally protected, and a government whose powers are circumscribed by law.<br><br>How would Britain, one of the worldÂ’s oldest democracies, fare by this definition?<br><br>Surprisingly, not well. For one thing, Britain does not have a written constitution. The Â“British ConstitutionÂ” Â– which inspired the Constitutions of many former British colonies, including SingaporeÂ’s Â– does not exist.<br><br>It is unwritten and uncodified, it provisions and intimations scattered across a variety of documents and resources, such as the Magna Carta of 1215, the Act of Settlement of 1701, statue law, the customs of Parliament, judicial rulings and case law.<br><br>For another, there is no ironclad provision for regular elections in Britain. Elections, of course, are held, and no British government today would stay in office for more than five years without calling for fresh ones.<br><br>But that does not mean it has never done so. The House of Commons that prosecuted World War II, for instance, was first elected in1935, four years before the war began in September 1939, and sat continuously until 1945 Â– a total of 10 years.<br><br>And yet, no Briton then had any doubts what he or she was fighting for: Britain stood for freedom, Nazi Germany for perversion. Winston Churchill, when he became prime minister in May 1940, may not have faced voters for more than five years Â– and would not do so for another five Â– but there was never a doubt about his legitimacy.</blockquote>Britain does not fare well in democracy ? Whose opinion is that? Any proof? How does one measure success ? Over what time frame ?<br><br>Has Singapore produced more notable and noble-class scientists and explorers than Britain. Has any of our ministers or doctors or engineers outperformed their counter-parts in advanced researches?<br><br>Under pseudo- or leadership democracy, our leaders have provided some forms of basic needs to the people. Wages have gone up and housing are provided to the people at an accelerated rate from 1965 to about 1970s.<br><br>After that, due to narrow policies aimed at enriching the government and public sector, people's sector has suffered and general wages of majority of citizens have been coming down. Property values have dropped. Majority of the citizens who have bought their HDB flats have been burdened with high mortgage debts.<br><br>It is questionable Singapore under guided democracy or pseudo-democracy has indeed succeed beyond 1970s.<br><br>Since 1970s, the private sector has been laboring under high costs of doing business.<br><br>Whereas democracy like Finland and western European countries have continued to make progress economically and socially and become technologically competitive, through broad-based education, Singapore's guided democracy could only claim success and has to resort to tweaking of election processes by GRC and electoral redrawing and suing of oppositions.<br><br>People's living standards are dropping to the third world as compared with their better days in the 1980s whereas their costs of living is rising to the first world.<br><br>So can we really claim to have been successful under whatever is our system. Can the newspapers tell or handle truths? Why can't our Straits Times write more objectively ? Is is not the result of guided democracy where newspapers are subject to government 's control in the way their journalists write about government policies and their actions which causes many problems as reported under the post "20 Major government policy errors".<br><br>...to continue..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Continued from previous post..<br><br><blockquote>Quote: Article by Janata Devan, Straits Times 24.9.2006<br><br>Now, consider Thailand. Surprisingly, it actually fairs better by our simple definition of democracy than Britain does.<br><br>After all, it has had no shortage of Constitutions Â– 16 in all since 1932, when it became a Â“constitutional monarchyÂ”, and it will soon get its 17th. And it has had no shortage of election either Â– two within 14 months, between last February and April this year, and it will probably hold another within a year.<br><br>With that much practice in constitution-making and election-holding, one would have thought the Thai commitment to democracy would be firm. But that is not the case.<br><br>Thailand has had slightly more military coups Â– 18 in all since 1932 Â– as it has had Constitutions. That is quite a record Â– one coup per Constitution, compared to BritainÂ’s no coup per zero written Constitution.<br><br>Democracy, obviously, is a good deal more complicated affair than provided for by Constitutions and elections.<br><br>One survey indicated that 80 percent of Thais approved of this weekÂ’s coup to unseat the thrice-elected government of Mr Thaksin Shinawatra. A bemused Western diplomat in Chiang Mai, A Thaksin stronghold, reported in an e-mail: Â“Right here in ThaksinÂ’s town enough people were happy about the coup to bring the soldiers snacks all day.Â”<br><br>The coup leaders presented their revolt as a democratic act, calling their regime the Â“Council for Democratic Reform under Constitution MonarchyÂ”. We had to use undemocratic means to save democracy, they in effect declared.<br><br>Usually intellectuals would regard such justifications a hogwash. Not so Thai intellectuals. Professor Thitinan Pongsudhirak of Chulalongkorn University, for instance, said: Â“The crisis in the immediate term has been resolved. Thaksin is out of the picture for now. We can move forward with political reforms.Â”<br><br>Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn of The Nation newspaper wrote that the coup Â“was a necessary evilÂ… There were no other options to end this political cul-de-sacÂ”.<br><br>Every Thai intellectual I spoke with on the phone took the same line. One Thammasat University professor said the political disputes would have led to bloodshed if the military had not intervened. Everyone agreed that Thailand need a deus ex machina in the form of tanks to set things straight.<br><br>What does all this tell us of the prospects of democracy in South-east Asia, including Singapore?<br><br>First, we should not confuse democracy with Constitutions and elections. The latter are the necessary conditions for democracy, but they are not sufficient in themselves. Democracies also need the rule of law, and they must have independent institutions to enforce that rule.<br><br>If ThailandÂ’s political reformers had expended as much energy creating those institutions Â– among them, an independent police and judiciary Â– as they did perfecting electoral systems, the country would not be in the fix it is today. But because it lacked such institutions, Mr Thaksin was able to commandeer the legal process, and his opponents, unable to seek redress through the courts, felt they had no alternative but to call in the army.<br><br>The single most democratic thing any democratically elected leader can do is ensure that the least democratic institutions in the state Â– the courts, the civil service, the police, the Attorney-GeneralÂ’s office, the central bank Â– are totally above board and accountable only to the law and the public interest.<br><br>Second, democracy is as much a frame of mind as it is a practice. It requires majority to respect minorities, and minorities to accept the rules of the game, to live and let live.<br><br>That spirit is best exemplified in Britain, where the ruling party is known as Her MajestyÂ’s Government, and the opposition, Her MajestyÂ’s Loyal Opposition. Tweedledum or Tweedledee Â– and no matter who is in power, Her Majesty (or the idea of sovereignty) stays put on the throne, the game goes on, everyone lives and let lives.<br><br>And finally, it is important to realise that democracy is not the work of one generation but of many.<br><br>Â“Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,Â” William Wordsworth wrote of the French Revolution, but unfortunately revolutions are often followed by guillotines. Democracy usually requires a painfully slow evolution.<br><br>Consider Britain: Up to 1832, only 1.8 percent of its adult population had the vote. The franchise was increased to 6.4 percent in1897 and 12.1 percent in 1884. It was not till 1930, when woman got the vote, the Britain finally enjoyed universal adult suffrage.<br><br>Of the 10 Asian states today, only four are democracies Â– Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. Of these, IndonesiaÂ’s democracy is new and fragile, and the PhilippinesÂ’ constantly on the verge of extinction. Only Malaysia and Singapore have held regular elections, without fail, since their independence.<br><br>And yet, as recently as last week, numerous human rights groups would have described both countries as less democratic than Thailand.<br><br>Revolution, bliss, chaos, coup, counter-coup, Constitutions galore, revolutionÂ… on and on, a dreary cycle. Perhaps the admittedly imperfect tortoises, Malaysia and Singapore, will get to the promised land sooner than the hares.<br><br>Janadas@sph.com.sg</blockquote>Thailand's ex-PM Thaksin could have done better if hehad tried harder to be democratic and more accountable to his peers in the running of his country.<br><br>Apparently Thaksin has somewhat tried to follow the Singapore's autocratic top-down leadership style instead which caused back lash and brought down his administration.<br><br>Thai people apparently are not so naive and have recognised his authoritarianism was not in the interest of their long-term good and so have taken to street protest against Thaksin at the slightest sign of his wrong doing in respect of disposal of his politically sensitive asset to Singapore companies.<br><br>To discuss the benefits of democracy, it simply could not be presented in the manner as given in the above-stated article. This sadly however has all along been the way Singapore press has been trying to protray about democracy by blaming democracy for chaos or troubles in worse-off democracy rather than successful stable and progressive ones in the Western Europe etc.<br><br>The fact is democracy has triumphed over other systems claimed to be better for centuries and advanced countries. Democracy has revolutionalised lives and brought about intellectual freedoms triggering off immense scientific and material and technological progress to mankind in the league of democratic countries.<br><br>Facts are facts. Even an anti-west politician like Mahathir has admitted that there is no system better than democracy much as he has lamented about certain shortcomings of democracy.<br><br>Democracy should be examined based on its history development and practices across the world over the past four centuries or so. Compare democracy with dictatorship and authoritarian systems over the same historical period and anyone could clearly see the results.<br><br>It is not an apple-to-apple comparison by comparing Thailand's experience with democracy with Singapore's own limited experiences. The comparison is flawed and subjective. Without democracy Britain could have become worse, Finland could have perished being so cut off from the major geographical and shipping networks.<br><br>It nay be more objectively asked: If Singapore has been run without an election system, what could have happened to Singapore.<br><br>Would there not have been a danger of the country's becoming maniacal with self-centredness and power-crazed people out to plunder and to commit wrong doings and injustices if the country was not run under Westminister-style albeit tweaked for PAP's own self-perpetuation.<br><br>But the way our leaders have been telling their people is that democracy may cause chaos. Why should it cause chaos if people at the helm are not that self-centred and are prepared to be accountable and do the right things in the greatest interest of the greatest number.<br><br>If all oppositions are allowed to survive and thrive as alternative without all the tweaking of the election process, or political defamation suits, will it have caused so many problems e.g. high costs of living and doing business and dropping wages and property values of the majority ?</div>

I do not believe that it is just because of the reasons listed by Atobe, sure they play a big part, but I would like to raise another factor raised by Rousseau, one of the difference between "collective individual will" and "general will"<br><br>Theoratically the purpose of the election in a democratic state is to elect the government that the people believe "to be the best for the state", but instead, most people vote on the party that they believe are "best to themselves". This is apparant in Singapore as people vote for the party that they think can give them as individuals or family, the most perks such as HDB upgrading or job stability.<br><br>Money politic can only exist in societies that are generally "selfish", note that it is different from individual selfishness. The culture of Singapore is such that you are encouraged to vote based on what you think is best for you or your family. If democracy is to work in Singapore, this has to change and everyone has to vote purely on the basis of who they think is best for the society.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you. Sometimes we vote based on which party is the best for us instead of best for the country. That's why the votes for the opposition increases for the last election.

            <div class='col-md body'>It is said that the GRC system <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_representation_constituency" rel="nofollow">hinders</a> the representation of women or minorities in Parliament. After all, JBJ won the Anson by-election even though this area was dominated by Chinks.</div>

A lot of things happened that damaged democratic principles.<br><br>Â“This coup is another step in the process of democratising Thailand. Without it, I think we will definitely go backwards,Â” she stressed.<br><br>But if the putsch was a step towards democratisation, why did the coup leaders move backwards by introducing draconian regulations such as the clampdown on the press and banning political parties and gatherings?<br><br>Dr Kobkua said this was to prevent a counter-coup from Thaksin loyalists.<br><br>Going by the past coups, she said, there was a Â“formatÂ” the coup leaders would adopt.<br><br>Firstly, they would take over all the strategic facilities such as communication, government offices, the military power base and the palace.<br><br>Secondly, they would announce that they had taken over power and thirdly they would get the blessings of the King and announce it.<br><br>Then, they would ban political parties, abolish the constitution and put freedom of the press under scrutiny.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s the format of the coup to make sure that control is complete. And whoever wants to do a counter-coup will not have the opportunity. DonÂ’t forget Thaksin also has supporters in the military,Â” she said.<br><br>Dr Kobkua is of the view that once an interim premier is put in place in about two weeks and an interim constitution drawn up, the controls would normally be lifted and the tight rein on the media and assembly would be relaxed again.<br><br>Stressing that she did not support coup dÂ’etats, Dr Kobkua however pointed out that this latest one was different.<br><br>The Suan Dusit poll done a day after the coup showed that 82% of the people in the city supported it and 86% of those in the countryside Â– normally a Thaksin power-base Â– backed it.<br><br><strong>Â“The surprising thing was to find rural people supporting it. It has never happened before that both city and countryside folks support a coup,Â” she added.</strong><br><br>Dr Kobkua does not think the growing violence in southern Thailand was the main reason that forced the military to stage this coup.<br><br>Â“If that is the main reason, it would have happened a long time ago Â– not now,Â” she said.<br><br>Rather, she sees it as a power struggle and a clash of personalities and policies of Thaksin and army commander-in-chief Gen Sonthi Boonyaratkalin.<br><br>Gen Sonthi, a Muslim and the first to rise to such a high post, got the job unexpectedly. A quiet and professional man, he was never close to Thaksin nor did he have the support of political personalities behind him.<br><br>It was former Prime Minister and chairman of the Privy Council Gen Prem Tinsulanonda, and former army commander-in-chief Gen Surayuth Chulanont, also a Privy councillor, who recommended Gen SonthiÂ’s name to the King.<br><br>But Thaksin and Gen Sonthi clashed from the start on the policy to be used in the restive south.<br><br>Â“The Prime Minister was always for using force to show the separatists that they cannot win. But Gen Sonthi said no we must talk to them and find out what the grudges are and do whatever we can to put it right,Â” said Dr Kobkua.<br><br>So Gen Sonthi did not get the confidence of the prime minister and was not given the authority to co-ordinate the solving of the problem in the south.<br><br>Dr Kobkua noted that if Gen Sonthi had been ThaksinÂ’s good friend, in all probability the coup would not have happened.<br><br>Word out was that Gen Sonthi was going to be moved to an inactive post in the annual military reshuffle that was coming up.<br><br>Dr Kobkua believed that another reason the coup leaders decided to go for it was because a democratic reform movement had planned to carry out protests in Bangkok on Wednesday.<br><br>The government's side had planned to counter this move by calling on their own supporters.<br><br>Â“There was bound to be trouble. I donÂ’t think Thailand could afford this so someone had to do something,Â” she said.<br><br>And now with the coup, the Thai historian thinks that this would be the best time to find an acceptable solution to the problem in the south.<br><br>She said that while Thailand would never allow the southern provinces to secede, there might be a middle ground where both sides could give and take.<br><br>The problems in the south have been there since 1902, she noted, adding that the majority in the Muslim south have come to accept the government in Bangkok.<br><br>Dr Kobkua noted that the situation only flared up from time to time when the south felt they had been unfairly treated.<br><br>In the 1980s and 1990s the situation was calm. It turned violent again two years ago.</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Dr Kobkua attributed this to the fact that Thaksin did very little for the south as he did not get 100% support in the elections. Hence he channelled aid and economic development elsewhere.</span></strong><br><br><span style="color: green;">Â“There must be something the central government can do now to make life better in the south. A majority do not support violence. They just want to be fairly treated and get a fair share of the countryÂ’s wealth,Â” she said.<br><br>She said the situation in Thailand would be normal as long as the coup leaders kept their word.<br><br>They need to set up an interim government in two weeks, hold elections within the next 12 months and bring in a stronger democratic government that would serve the interests of all.<br><br>But if doesnÂ’t Â– what then?<br><br>Â“That would be sad. It would mean that the military would carry on and that would be a step backward,Â” she said.  </span></blockquote></span><br></div>
