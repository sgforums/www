              <p>Singapore is good when compared to some of the neighbouring countries.</p>
              <p>But Singapore is considered as first-world. Then we say:</p>
              <p>First world country but not first world salary nor first world public transport system. And the minister pay is highest in the world (although the standard of living is not)</p>
              <p>Also, usable land size similar to Hong Kong, yet Hong Kong has (1) no GST, (2) higher salaries, till maids also want to move there, (3) lower overall tax.</p>
              <p><br>Then again, many people always complain about their own countries. As usual, the grass is always greener on the other side.</p>

              <p>As for Thaksin,  no thank you, Singaporeans are not stupid. We will tell Thaksin to go run Batam. We'd hire a foreign talent from a First World country to make Singapore TRULY first world, and we wouldn't mind paying him/her a first world salary.</p>

              <p>Err...he Lee family thing prob needs to end. But not now. I believe LKY is still calling the shots. He dies, Singapore dies. Unless we can get a good government going before he dies. Good government as in one that can be trusted to carry Singapore forward. Personally, I don't have that kind of confidence in our current government yet.</p>
              <p>And I'm sure all around, countries who wanna take a bite out of Singapore are also waiting for LKY to die so they can tear into us.</p>

              <p>I dun agreed with Durotar.</p>
              <p>Singapore was what it is in the past due to the people.</p>
              <p>The old man have done his part and it is time he move on.</p>
              <p>What is he is doing now is what the past emperor is doing, which is ensuring his family stayed in power.</p>
              <p>It is just pure greed for power.</p>
              <p>We are what we are today due to the stupid policy that his so-called incompetent kakis have caused.</p>
              <p>Just take a walk down to Geylang and you get what I mean.</p>
              <p>The place is messy and swarmed with china gal selling their bodies.</p>
              <p>Is this the singapore that we want ???</p>
              <p>Due to the selfishness of the old man, we have lots of uselss bunch of scholar poodles that sleep during work.</p>
              <p>They talk a lot of crap about bigger picture and not raising the people pay.</p>
              <p>So, what solution they can offer to the peasant that pay their million dollar salary except to blame the peasants when things goes wrong ???</p>
              <p>The biggest joke is one of the dog head is unable to take any responsibility when one of the most unwanted terrorist is on the loose.</p>
              <p>The peasants are given a bunch of crap for the escape.</p>
              <p>So, should we wait for this mas to commit a real terrorist act to wake up ???</p>
              <p>This is the so-called elite that the old man have enjoyed.</p>

              <p>More crime and vice as opposed to unlicensed casinos and brothels? The only problem I have with the casino is whether or not the casino operators they sign agreements with have a clause that states that they MUST employ Singaporeans ONLY.</p>

              <p>Yeah loh, invade Singapore for the 600sq km resourceless island. A better and easier way for above-mentioned governments to benefit is to kidnap the Finance Minister, LKY, LHL, Ho Ching etc and torture them to give up the bank accounts of Singapore Inc.</p>
