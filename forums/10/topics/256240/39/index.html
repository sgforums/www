              <p>You know why can't Singapore change now when I see people in Indonesia now who try to prosecute Soeharto corruption I pity them . Where were they when Soeharto still on power. Damn cowards just took an advantage out of situation.</p>
              <p>You expect things to change after LKY's death. How if it doesn't change at all. Then you would expect things to change after LHL's death and so on and so on.</p>
              <p>It's like wanting or hoping for something that you do not want to fight for. So you dream. Dream on then. Cross your fingers it would become reality if not you can always dream on.</p>
              <p>Pathetic I say. Sorry for the language. Perhaps your view is not that of majority. Perhpas the majority is content with the LKY family unchecked reign.</p>

              <p>Dont this Lee Kuan Yew knows that Westerners are also human?If they implement democracy,why cant we?Already,Lee Kuan Yew statement cant hold his ground,Philiphines,Indonesia,Taiwan all embrace to Western democracy already.Even Malaysia is becoming more n more democratic.</p>
              <p>I think old man are all the same,when live until Lee Kuan Yew age,they are all obstinate n unable to think properly.But lucky for most normal old man,when live up to Lee Kuan Yew age,they are all mostly retired.Even if they still working,they are under supervision of others.So they are not as arrogant n ignorant as Lee Kuan Yew,who block the way of other ppl n get cursed by them.</p>

              <p>I don't think there is such a thing as "asian democracy".</p>

              <p>I dont think there is such thing that Western democracy cant or unsuitable for Asians.Democracy is democracy,no diference there.</p>
              <p>And one thing about borrowing Western democracy is that there are also many options for us to choose,like U.S,2 parties competing for parliamentary seats,or some European nations who have 3 or 4 opposition parties.</p>
              <p>One good thing is those Westerners have already "tested" it out and we can borrown from them.Rather than we trying to find a "democracy of our own" n blindly beating around the bush n going nowhere.If we find that certain democracy system doesnt suit us,we can discard them easily,simple.</p>

              <p>That is simplistic.</p>
              <p>USA politics is actually dominated by financial and corporate interests.</p>
              <p>They are the first level of influence in choosing people to contest.</p>
              <p>The USA citizens are on the second level, that is how it developed there.</p>
              <p>Don't be fooled.</p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>...The fact that these forces of finance and business were themselves
              growing in wealth and power made them <strong>increasingly restive under the
              need to make constantly larger contributions to party political
              machines.</strong> Moreover, these economic tycoons increasingly felt it to be
              unseemly that they should be unable to issue orders but instead have to
              negotiate as equals in order to obtain services or favors from party
              bosses...</em></p>
              <p><em>...By the late 1870's <strong>business leaders determined to make an end to
              this situation by cutting with one blow the taproot of the system of
              party machines, namely, the patronage system...</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>...The structure of financial controls created by the tycoons of "Big
              Banking" and "Big Business" in the period 1880-1933 was of
              extraordinary complexity, one business fief being built on another,
              both being allied with semi-independent associates, the whole rearing
              upward into two pinnacles of economic and financial power, of which
              one, centered in New York, was headed by J. P. Morgan and Company, and
              the other, in Ohio, was headed by the Rockefeller family. </em></p>
              <p><em>When these
              two cooperated, as they generally did, they could influence the
              economic life of the country to a large degree <strong>and could almost control
              its political life, at least on the Federal level...</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>...In fact on two occasions, in 1904 and in 1924, <strong>J. P. Morgan was
              able to sit back with a feeling of satisfaction to watch a presidential
              election in which the candidates of both parties were in his sphere of
              influence.</strong> </em></p>
              <p><em>In 1924 the Democratic candidate was one of his chief
              lawyers, while the Republican candidate was the classmate and
              handpicked choice of his partner, Dwight Morrow. Usually, Morgan had to
              share this political influence with other sectors of the business
              oligarchy, especially with the Rockefeller interest (as was done, for
              example, by dividing the ticket between them in 1900 and in 1920)...</em></p>
