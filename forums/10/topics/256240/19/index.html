To me, think Seletar Reservoir is not likely.<br><br>Death is a natural thing especially for MM's age.  He himself said he never expect himself to live till now, everyday to him is a bonus.   Ha ha ha, very funny - as in Chinese saying "huang shang bu ji tai jian ji".   Thank goodness there are just very very very few tai jians here.   ha ha ha, hee hee heee!

Why People Use Names to...<br>By singportal.sg (10 posts) on Fri 23 Nov 2007, 04:09hrs to forum Community Forum<br><br>well i personally disagree for Poster to post any real name as a thread starter! This is some sort of personal attacks to the names, as from any angle of sight i think it could be trying to attract "someone" attention for FREE advertisements!? But, nevertheless there're 1001 ways to it...Why must the thread starter do that? Is it because of attraction? or is it because peoples are Stupid to judge at it? Or...?<br><br>Basically, to me a good forum is like Stomp.com.sg or Omy which I had been to and i found myself that each has its own way of bringing themselves expose to the Public and there have also their own ways to attract readers by different platforms and Interactives too. From what i know, these two big sites are from SPH and SPH is an established Newspapers media to Locally and Overseas and it's something that peoples cannot miss...just like one of our daily meals! The Newspaper for The Straits Times is a very good typical example by its own and even myself is readings and my childrens...This is a World's famous Newspapers and SPH do have also more to come...<br><br>However, some Poster has abused the System Online...Let me go back to my Tan Ah Kow Story...Mr Tan AK may be someone who is of any backgrounds or it could be liked U and I. Will U allows some days people posted your name and asked you:"when are you going to die?" It sound very rude and disrespectful to the person rite? To further elborate it, this Tan Ah Kow may also be your relatives, friends or your loved one and by seeing it, will U just sit back and do nothing? Ask yourself again, what happen if this Tan Ah Kow belong to a Country's of Great Contribution and by posting the name online which is not only in Singapore, but to all Over the Worlds so long peoples can access the Internet or now even most (all) handphones do supported the programming in it just like this myCommunity Forum! Do you still can say, well this Tan Ah Kow is not my friends, relatives or loved one AND if He is Our Country Leaders' then what have you still got to say...? Can U still sit and drink your coffee? Don't U and I belongs to the Country? And Is this a Proud to carry on Onlines? If your answer is still [Yes! Who bother it!], then i personally think (U or I)have mental problem or not fit to be here!!!This is something very inhuman and Why are (U and I) still here? Don't (U and I) feel ashame if your friends from Oversea called (U and I) and says...Tan Ah Kow, when are you going to die?<br><br>Most importantly, is that most forum Operator do not keep track of every User and "if" someone complain it and the Authority Concern had issued a note to the Forum Operator and fine or ban this forum from Lives! Do (U and I) still think, well it's not mine and whos care? Then will (U and I) have these forums anymore? So, whoever U are, please be more Considerate and Obeys the Community Guidelines as the Forum Operators also does to follow the MDA Authority in Singapore and also Internationally!!! Likewise versa, if (U and I) have abused it on the foreign Forum Operators and do (U and I) still think that the forum operator cannot traced it? Dun be so naive...when Posting of an Articles when logging to Your Handphones or PC, (U and I) have already discloses of ours identities, just like Calls-Tracing from a Tele-Communications Companies and even they can't traced it and What about the CID or FBA Peoples? Don't (U and I) think differently? If this is so, then either (U or I) is not belong to this human Worlds!!!<br><br></div>
