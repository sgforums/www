            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Smutocracy is a facade for democracy</strong><br>By Michael Backman<br><br>WHEN will Lee Kuan Yew die? Sadly, that is the question now on the minds of many Singaporeans. At 82, Lee retains a cabinet post, with the title Minister Mentor, continues to dominate the Government and shows no sign of quitting. But many believe that although he has done much for Singapore, he is now the greatest impediment to reform, and that little can change until after he is gone.<br><br>Last week, Lee admonished the younger generation for not fully supporting the People's Action Party at the elections the weekend before. It's a usual claim: young Singaporeans are insufficiently grateful for all that the older PAP leaders have done for them in developing the economy. It's as if a country's progress should be measured only by material comfort. The problem for Lee is that young people in other developed countries have money and freedom of expression. But in Singapore, all they have is money. Young Singaporeans are beginning to see that a gilded cage is a cage, nonetheless.<br><br>To combat this growing restiveness, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong Â— Lee's son Â— talks of political regeneration in his efforts to make the PAP appeal to younger people. But it's the same old tricks, if last week's elections are anything to go by. The ruling PAP won two-thirds of the votes. The real surprise is that it didn't win by more, given all the petty restrictions designed to head off opposition.<br><br>The PAP faced two main opposition parties: the Singapore Democratic Party and the Workers' Party. The SDP's leadership was hit with a series of defamation writs from the two Lees soon after the elections were called. It managed to win one of the two seats not won by the PAP.<br><br>The Workers' Party won the other seat. James Gomez, one of its leading candidates, blamed the elections department for losing one of his required polling forms at the start of the campaign. He moderately chastised a member of the department's staff for the apparent loss. But it turned out he had put the form in his brief case and had left the building without lodging it. He claimed this was an oversight Â— he was distracted Â— and he publicly apologised. But the PAP accused him of attempting to set up the elections commission.<br><br>The incident dominated the nine-day campaign. The Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, other ministers and the Government-controlled media raised it repeatedly. The highly litigious Lee Kuan Yew publicly labelled Gomez a liar.<br><br>The day after the election, Gomez was detained at Changi Airport. His boarding pass and passport were confiscated and police questioned him for eight hours. The next day he was questioned for five hours. A day later he was questioned for another three hours. That's 16 hours of police questioning over whether or not he intentionally put something in his brief case. The Public Prosecutor announced on Friday Gomez would not be charged but would be let off with a "stern warning".<br><br>Certainly, it's true that integrity is important in politics. That's why so many people were surprised back in 1996 when it was revealed that Lee Kuan Yew and many family members had accepted large discounts on a series of expensive apartments in Singapore from a local property developer, on whose board sat one of Lee's brothers. Lee and Lee Hsien Loong received more than $S1 million ($A829,000) in discounts, discounts that were in excess of the usual discounts offered in the market.<br><br>The company was later censured by the local stock exchange for not seeking shareholder approval for favourable transactions with related parties.<br><br>Lee has claimed that the election result demonstrates to foreign investors that Singapore is politically stable, which is good for business.<br><br>But his argument is simplistic. North Korea is politically stable but who wants to invest there? And Australia periodically changes government, has a free media and attracts plenty of investors, including many from Singapore.<br><br>But how good is Singapore, really? As every expatriate in Singapore knows, Singapore's media is appalling. Sex is covered endlessly. Rape and incest cases are described in unnecessary minutiae, as are instances of alleged sexual deviance ("Oh, isn't it dreadful?" is the line usually taken before the incident is recounted in slavish detail.) In essence, Singaporeans are fed a regular diet of soft porn, perhaps as compensation for precious little political debate. That's not democracy. It's smutocracy.<br><br>Academic freedom is also stunted. Daniel Bell, a prominent writer and academic who has taught at universities in Singapore and Beijing, writes in the latest issue of the respected intellectual journal Dissent that for him, "China is a paradise of academic freedom" after Singapore. The governments of both countries practise media censorship but after a newspaper in China ran some of his comments in an interview, but not others, the editor rang him to apologise. Not so in Singapore, where according to Bell, "public humiliation is a more common tactic for dealing with those who do not toe the party line". Singapore might be rich but it is out of step.<br><br>Meanwhile, Thailand faces fresh elections after the Thai courts declared invalid those that were held last month. Prime Minister Thaksin had called the elections due to huge public disapproval of the sale of his family's massive telecommunications assets to an arm of the Singapore Government. Tax changes meant that his family saved millions on the sale.<br><br>And this weekend there are elections in the wealthy Malaysian state of Sarawak. The family of Chief Minister Abu Taib Mahmud has accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars in timber concessions and public works contracts while he has been in office. No doubt he is heading for a landslide win. Stability is indeed good for business.<br><br>The day after the election, Gomez was detained at Changi Airport. His boarding pass and passport were confiscated and police questioned him for eight hours. The next day he was questioned for five hours. A day later he was questioned for another three hours. That's 16 hours of police questioning over whether or not he intentionally put something in his brief case. The Public Prosecutor announced on Friday Gomez would not be charged but would be let off with a "stern warning".<br><br>Certainly, it's true that integrity is important in politics. That's why so many people were surprised back in 1996 when it was revealed that Lee Kuan Yew and many family members had accepted large discounts on a series of expensive apartments in Singapore from a local property developer, on whose board sat one of Lee's brothers. Lee and Lee Hsien Loong received more than $S1 million ($A829,000) in discounts, discounts that were in excess of the usual discounts offered in the market.<br><br>The company was later censured by the local stock exchange for not seeking shareholder approval for favourable transactions with related parties.<br><br>Lee has claimed that the election result demonstrates to foreign investors that Singapore is politically stable, which is good for business.<br><br>But his argument is simplistic.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singapore libel case a test of Murdoch's bona fides</strong><br>Eric Ellis<br>The Sydney Morning Herald<br>07 Jan 08<br><br>Dow Jones brought some unwanted baggage with it.<br><br>THE TIMES asked readers recently "Is libel dead?" The number of defamation writs issued in British courts last year was about an eighth of the 457 writs 10 years earlier.<br><br>The downward trends are similar in other Western jurisdictions such as Australia and North America, suggesting those who willingly stand in the public eye are becoming thicker-skinned in withstanding the decade's avalanche of media forms.<br><br>Or perhaps the media are more careful about who they traduce, and how.<br><br>But one place where libel remains a legal growth industry is in a tiny country desperate to become part of the developed world: among the sensitive political and business petals of Singapore. As Rupert Murdoch is himself finding out.<br><br>That is because of a long-running case concerning Singapore's premier political family, the Lees; a case Murdoch's News Corporation inherited via its recently completed $US6 billion ($6.8 billion) purchase of Dow Jones.<br><br>Lee family members include, of course, Singapore's elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew and his son, the Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong.<br><br>The Lees have a long history of libel stoushes with foreign media, battles they have never lost when heard in Singapore's own courts, which grants them damages payouts that set world records. The (pre-Murdoch) Asian Wall Street Journal, Time, The International Herald Tribune, Businessweek, Bloomberg and the Financial Times are among other international names respected for their accuracy and authority that have been hit with the Lees' libel broadsides. And lost.<br><br>The Lees have used similar tactics in seeking to silence political opponents.<br><br>Remarks that might be regarded as just part of the rough-and-tumble of competitive political or business culture in Australia often head to the libel courts when aired in Singapore.<br><br>However, it is one-way traffic. Opponents have never won an action against the Lees. Singapore is in effect a one-party state, and that party is the Lee party.<br><br>Such is the presumption of a libel loss that most media companies now do not even take the fight to trial, instead promptly settling. They know that history says they will not win, and management usually decides that a quick settlement limits expensive legal bills - and possible even higher damages when Lee lawyers insist mid-trial that publicly heard evidence has further harmed sensitive reputations, which prevents airing of issues that may be germane to the case.<br><br>It is not just the media. In 2001 what seemed to many bankers to be a normal tactical paper was prepared by Goldman Sachs on behalf of its local client DBS Bank. Goldman-DBS criticised the merits of a rival bid for a bank DBS was seeking to take over.<br><br>Target and rival were miffed, complaining to the central bank, and each board soon pocketed $US1 million in damages from DBS, which did not get the deal.<br><br>But the case Murdoch has inherited is different. It stems from a profile of the Singapore opposition figure Chee Soon Juan published in the Dow Jones-owned monthly The Far Eastern Economic Review in July 2006.<br><br>In it Chee criticises the Government's handling of a local charity scandal.<br><br>But Lees's lawyers saw a reputational attack and sued the Review on behalf of Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong.<br><br>But on this occasion the magazine refused to roll over and settle. Much to Singaporean annoyance, the offending article remains posted on the Review website (alongside a link to human rights press awards). There are front-page pointers to all legal exchanges on the matter and an editor's letter explaining why the Review is taking the battle to the Lees.<br><br>The Review's arguments are mostly about transparency and the rule of law, the very principles on which Singapore prides itself but many say does not practise with quite the gusto it claims.<br><br>It is a case that poses particular issues for all protagonists.<br><br>It will be the first time News and the Lees have crossed swords in a libel matter, which has become a perverse kind of rite of passage for other international media proprietors.<br><br>The Lees have been the dominant political family in Singapore since the 1950s, about the same time Murdoch has been in charge of News Corp. Both have helped build institutions about the same size; News Corp's market worth approaches $US100 billion, Singapore's GDP a bit bigger. Both are expert at projecting power, and neither brook any challenge to their authority.<br><br>The Review had argued, pre-Murdoch, that since it did not have an office or staff in Singapore, it should not be subject to Singapore law.<br><br>It wanted the matter heard in Hong Kong, where it is based, and where it feels it would get a fairer hearing. The Lees have never won a case outside Singapore.<br><br>In a letter to Singapore's Information Ministry, which has sought a bond from the Review in lieu of presumed damages and Singaporean jurisdiction over the Review, Dow Jones's lawyers argue "its imposition on the Review, merely for the sake of making it easier for senior ministers of the Singapore Government to recover personal damages in a libel action, would be deeply regretted by all who care for the rule of law in your country.<br><br>"It is an exorbitant and unlawful demand that even totalitarian states have never sought to impose on media."<br><br>And that is the way the matter has largely stayed since mid-2006, largely an exchange of testy lawyers' letters as Singapore throws out the Review's effort to end the action in Singapore.<br><br>But then came Murdoch's successful bid for Dow Jones last year. The management that previously backed the Review's feistier approach to Singapore no longer runs the company, after Murdoch put in a new team.<br><br>The status of the case is unclear. Outwardly, it seems as if nothing has changed, and a Murdoch-owned the Review is still taking on the Singaporeans. The articles and letters remain posted at the Review.com and the Review editors say it is still live, referring the matter to Dow Jones lawyers, who do not respond.<br><br>The matter is pregnant with the notion of what constitutes credibility - Singapore's own sense of it and News's in the court of public opinion after the reputational shellacking it received en route to the Dow Jones win.<br><br>Singapore's legal system is also under scrutiny. The US embassy in Singapore has frequently expressed concern about "the ruling party's use of the court system to intimidate political opponents". The Australian lawyer Stuart Littlemore, who has observed Singapore libel cases for the International Commission of Jurists, says "the Singapore leadership has a long-standing record of using the High Court as a mechanism for silencing its opponents - by suing them for statements that, in any comparable jurisdiction, would be seen as part of a robust political debate inseparable from democratic freedoms, and by being awarded such unconscionably high damages and costs as to bankrupt the defendants, forcing them out of parliament".<br><br>Credibility was at the heart of the Murdoch bid for Dow Jones. There were numerous critics of his Dow Jones tilt - notably in its own newsrooms, and including some members of the publisher's controlling Bancroft family (which quickly put aside its gripes in accepting News's generous offer). The critics said Murdoch and News had insufficient credibility to be custodians of venerable media assets like The Wall Street Journal and The Far Eastern Economic Review.<br><br>News Corporation prevailed after a searing battle in which Murdoch's personal and corporate reputation was assailed, almost to the point of him pulling out. Murdoch himself said bitterly that he was treated like a "genocidal tyrant".<br><br>A significant aspect of the appeal of Dow Jones to Murdoch is its under-played assets in booming Asia, a region where Singapore interests are hugely influential, both politically and commercially, and where Murdoch thinks he can add much value absorbing Dow Jones into the rest of the News empire...<br><br><a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articlefeer29.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articlefeer29.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Singapore Administration cannot last. </strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Winston Churchill had said at the end of the Battle of Britain "This is not the end. This is not even the beginning of the end. But the end of the beginning". In the case of Singapore, with the demise of Lee Kuan Yew, it will be the unfortunately the definitive "final end". There is no foundation for this administration to go on.<br><br>Presently the people are dead set against the government. With record breaking ministerial salaries while at the same time, a drop in the average man's income; among other sufferings they endure, while this government takes no heed at all.<br><br>The people are aware that this government itself is illegal. The Ministers and MPs are there because the elections were unfair. Jeyaretnam, Dr. Chee and many others have been deliberately denied their places in Parliament though defamation actions and false criminal charges. This makes the present government illegitimate and without authority in law. It is therefore unrepresentative of the people. This government knows this. So do the people. They have no mandate to govern at all.<br><br>The PAP itself does not have any identifiable character or objectives. Today, the people do not know what the PAP actually stands for. Is based on socialist aims to further the lives, welfare and interests of the average man, or are it's motives purely capitalistic, caring only for the rich and wealthy.<br><br>Article 2(b) of the PAP constitution reads as follows "To safeguard the freedom and advance the well being of Singaporeans through representative and democratic government". But the present government is seen not representative at all. Lee Kuan Yew's son has been made the Prime Minister in circumstances where he assumed this position not because he represents anyone but simply because he is the Minister Mentor's son.<br><br>"Safeguard the freedom" it says. But Dr. Chee Soon Juan's freedom is taken away by the government imprisoning him for exercising his right to free speech. This government does not safeguard the people's freedom.<br><br>"Democratic government" it reads. Where is democracy when this government requires a citizen to obtain a police permit even before any public speech!<br><br>The reader is requested to read the PAP constitution. It will be quite clear to you that this government is not complying or even trying to act according to even one sentence in it! With the way this government is going, we have a government that is not representative of the people and with policies which no one can even guess as to what they may be; since the PAP constitution appears totally irrelevant.<br><br>In the present circumstances we know that Lee Kuan Yew is the boss to whom all Minsters, the Cabinet and MP kow tow and obey. The people just live day to day, wondering what will be in store for them tomorrow after Lee Kuan Yew had had his breakfast. The people do not like it, but they are afraid. So they take it in silence. They just obey whatever his edict after his breakfast, which message would be conveyed to the people through his ministers. And which thereafter will be promptly published in the state controlled newspaper, the Straits Times.<br><br>So we have a situation where firstly the government is not representative because the layman's views are irrelevant to Lee Kuan Yew. Second the people do not know the direction this government is going to take, since the PAP constitution itself is sidestepped. The Singapore constitution itself is totally ignored since even though it says so, there is no freedom of speech since a permit is required to do it. That is to speak! The opposition's applications for free speech and assembly permits will always be refused. And lastly, no one one knows if the people will be prepared to accept his son as the new dictator when his father dies. And no one knows if the people are blindly going to kow tow and obey his son in the absence of his father!<br><br>These problems make the future of this country, a small island which is 14 miles north to south and 26 miles east to west with 4 million people and no natural resources impossible.<br><br>I suggest you start doing something now before the final day is thrust upon you unprepared. When alas it will be too late.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/01/singapore-administration-cannot-last.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/01/singapore-administration-cannot-last.html</a></div>
