              <h1 id="story_title">Kuan Yew still a force to be reckoned with</h1>
              <p>UNLESS the unexpected happens, the Lee Kuan Yew era will reach it's half-century mark in Singapore next year.</p>
              <p>At
              84, Lee no longer resembles the pugnacious 35-year-old lawyer who
              became Singapore’s first prime minister in 1959 when it was a
              self-governing colony.</p>
              <p>But to the disappointment of those who
              want him to retire, he remains as active as many politicians half his
              age, embracing a high profile at home and abroad that far exceeds his
              advisory role as Minister Mentor.</p>
              <p>Recently, he appeared in
              Beijing for a day to attend the Olympics opening ceremony and then
              dashed home in time to celebrate Singapore’s National Day.</p>
              <p>Months earlier he was in Europe and spent several hectic weeks visiting the Middle East.</p>
              <p>“He’s
              here, he’s there, he’s everywhere,” exclaimed a Singaporean, who joked
              that it tires him out just reading about Lee’s activities. “He is so
              active that he overshadows the younger ministers.”</p>
              <p>With the
              retirement in February of Cuban President Fidel Castro, who also took
              office at the same time 50 years ago, Lee suddenly became the world’s
              longest surviving political leader.</p>
              <p>A handful of long-serving African leaders are years behind Lee in political longevity.</p>
              <p>There is a small difference, though, but hardly significant.</p>
              <p>Unlike
              Castro, Lee stepped down as Prime Minister in 1990 to take up advisory
              roles in the Cabinet – first as Senior Minister and then as Minister
              Mentor – titles that are unfamiliar in most developed nations.</p>
              <p>At
              that time, he said he would leave the daily running of the country to
              his successors and would play only “a goalkeeper role” in the event of
              a crisis.</p>
              <p>That hands-off attitude soon lay by the wayside and Lee began to take the front seat again.</p>
              <p>In
              recent years he has dramatically increased his public profile, making
              more and more pronouncements on major foreign and domestic matters
              crucial to Singapore.</p>
              <p>By comparison, his son, Prime Minister Lee
              Hsien Loong, a one-time cancer patient, has become much less active,
              which sometimes prompts Singaporeans to ask: “Who is the real Prime
              Minister?”</p>
              <p>At any rate, Lee’s forceful character and his
              historic role in Singapore has marked him as the real power, whatever
              the title he chooses to call himself.</p>
              <p>Lee’s hold on power –
              especially the nation’s finance, military and the mainstream media – is
              almost unbreakable and his authoritarian leadership, a little softened
              through the years, is still evident.</p>
              <p>For most observers it matters little who is prime minister, as to them the Lee Kuan Yew era has not been eclipsed.</p>
              <p>Will it continue – and for how much longer?</p>
              <p>Ask
              any Singaporean and he’ll swear it will be endless. Kuan Yew, however,
              has a different answer. He says he will carry on as long as his health
              permits, because he is still useful to the country.</p>
              <p>Kuan Yew
              believes that he has to remain active. “With nothing to do, no purpose
              in life, you’ll just degrade, go to seed,” he said during a public
              dialogue.</p>
              <p>“We've got to educate those about to retire: Don’t retire, work. Retirement means death.”</p>
              <p>Most
              believe that Kuan Yew is hanging on because of one or both these
              reasons: firstly, things will go wrong for Singapore when he goes, and
              secondly, the current crop of leaders don’t measure up to his
              expectations.</p>
              <p>The achievements of Kuan Yew and his team of unusually capable first generation leaders are indisputable.</p>
              <p>They
              transformed a poor, squatter colony into the world’s seventh richest
              country with per capita GDP rising from less than US$1,000 in 1959 to
              US$49,800 now.</p>
              <p>Thanks to the investment in education,
              Singapore's first prime minister has successfully raised a new
              generation of well-educated young Singaporeans who are able to build on
              the island’s prosperity.</p>
              <p>That, however, has its political downside for him and his authoritarian style of leadership.</p>
              <p>A
              gap has built up between these worldly-wise, Web-savvy youths, who feel
              little beholden to him and his old values, which had served him and
              Singapore well in the past.</p>
              <p>The Internet is full of their
              messages telling him that times have changed and he should change, too,
              and allow for more personal liberties.</p>
              <p>This is, of course, not the entire truth.</p>
              <p>The
              more elderly, conservative Singaporeans either support Kuan Yew or
              continue to vote for him out of fear that Singapore can get unhinged
              when he goes.</p>
              <p>Some observers, however, believe that in the past
              year or so, as Kuan Yew became more active and inflation worsened, some
              of this heartland support may have eroded.</p>
              <p>At the same time, the liberal-minded young people have become more vocal against Kuan Yew, many calling for him to step down.</p>
              <p>They
              say that although he had done much for the country in the first 25
              years, his remaining in office is stifling the emergence of new leaders
              within – and outside – the PAP.</p>
              <p>Kuan Yew’s complaint against the
              young generation is that they are ungrateful for what he has done. As
              one foreign observer said: “Young (affluent) Singaporeans are beginning
              to see that a gilded cage is a cage, nonetheless.”</p>
              <p>One letter
              writer said: “Lau (Old) Lee, I think you should take a rest from the
              vigour of politics. You have struggled since 1959 and have already
              passed on the torch to your son.</p>
              <p>“You have already achieved your aim and ambition. There is not much for you to do here.”</p>
              <p>Still, it's very unlikely that the Lee Kuan Yew era will end on its 50th year.</p>

              <h1>Kuan Yew still a force to be reckoned with</h1>
              <p>UNLESS the unexpected happens, the Lee Kuan Yew era will reach it's half-century mark in Singapore next year.</p>
              <p>At 84, Lee no longer resembles the pugnacious 35-year-old lawyer who became Singapore’s first prime minister in 1959 when it was a self-governing colony.</p>
              <p>But to the disappointment of those who want him to retire, he remains as active as many politicians half his age, embracing a high profile at home and abroad that far exceeds his advisory role as Minister Mentor.</p>
              <p>Recently, he appeared in Beijing for a day to attend the Olympics opening ceremony and then dashed home in time to celebrate Singapore’s National Day.</p>
              <p>Months earlier he was in Europe and spent several hectic weeks visiting the Middle East.</p>
              <p>“He’s here, he’s there, he’s everywhere,” exclaimed a Singaporean, who joked that it tires him out just reading about Lee’s activities. “He is so active that he overshadows the younger ministers.”</p>
              <p>With the retirement in February of Cuban President Fidel Castro, who also took office at the same time 50 years ago, Lee suddenly became the world’s longest surviving political leader.</p>
              <p>A handful of long-serving African leaders are years behind Lee in political longevity.</p>
              <p>There is a small difference, though, but hardly significant.</p>
              <p>Unlike Castro, Lee stepped down as Prime Minister in 1990 to take up advisory roles in the Cabinet – first as Senior Minister and then as Minister Mentor – titles that are unfamiliar in most developed nations.</p>
              <p>At that time, he said he would leave the daily running of the country to his successors and would play only “a goalkeeper role” in the event of a crisis.</p>
              <p>That hands-off attitude soon lay by the wayside and Lee began to take the front seat again.</p>
              <p>In recent years he has dramatically increased his public profile, making more and more pronouncements on major foreign and domestic matters crucial to Singapore.</p>
              <p>By comparison, his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, a one-time cancer patient, has become much less active, which sometimes prompts Singaporeans to ask: “Who is the real Prime Minister?”</p>
              <p>At any rate, Lee’s forceful character and his historic role in Singapore has marked him as the real power, whatever the title he chooses to call himself.</p>
              <p>Lee’s hold on power – especially the nation’s finance, military and the mainstream media – is almost unbreakable and his authoritarian leadership, a little softened through the years, is still evident.</p>
              <p>For most observers it matters little who is prime minister, as to them the Lee Kuan Yew era has not been eclipsed.</p>
              <p>Will it continue – and for how much longer?</p>
              <p>Ask any Singaporean and he’ll swear it will be endless. Kuan Yew, however, has a different answer. He says he will carry on as long as his health permits, because he is still useful to the country.</p>
              <p>Kuan Yew believes that he has to remain active. “With nothing to do, no purpose in life, you’ll just degrade, go to seed,” he said during a public dialogue.</p>
              <p>“We've got to educate those about to retire: Don’t retire, work. Retirement means death.”</p>
              <p>Most believe that Kuan Yew is hanging on because of one or both these reasons: firstly, things will go wrong for Singapore when he goes, and secondly, the current crop of leaders don’t measure up to his expectations.</p>
              <p>The achievements of Kuan Yew and his team of unusually capable first generation leaders are indisputable.</p>
              <p>They transformed a poor, squatter colony into the world’s seventh richest country with per capita GDP rising from less than US$1,000 in 1959 to US$49,800 now.</p>
              <p>Thanks to the investment in education, Singapore's first prime minister has successfully raised a new generation of well-educated young Singaporeans who are able to build on the island’s prosperity.</p>
              <p>That, however, has its political downside for him and his authoritarian style of leadership.</p>
              <p>A gap has built up between these worldly-wise, Web-savvy youths, who feel little beholden to him and his old values, which had served him and Singapore well in the past.</p>
              <p>The Internet is full of their messages telling him that times have changed and he should change, too, and allow for more personal liberties.</p>
              <p>This is, of course, not the entire truth.</p>
              <p>The more elderly, conservative Singaporeans either support Kuan Yew or continue to vote for him out of fear that Singapore can get unhinged when he goes.</p>
              <p>Some observers, however, believe that in the past year or so, as Kuan Yew became more active and inflation worsened, some of this heartland support may have eroded.</p>
              <p>At the same time, the liberal-minded young people have become more vocal against Kuan Yew, many calling for him to step down.</p>
