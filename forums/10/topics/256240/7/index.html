They have been fined, imprisoned and publicly disgraced for offences of which they are not guilty.</strong> The appellant, in addition, has been deprived of his seat in Parliament and disqualified for a year from practising his profession. Their Lordships order restores him to the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore, but, because of the course taken by the criminal proceedings, their Lordships have no power to right the other wrongs which the appellant and Wong have suffered. Their only prospect of redress, their Lordships understand, will be by way of petition for pardon to the President of the Republic of Singapore.Â” [5]<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Benjamin_Jeyaretnam" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Benjamin_Jeyaretnam</a></div>
