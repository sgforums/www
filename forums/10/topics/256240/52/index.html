              <p>It doesn't have to end like this.</p>
              <p>It doesn't have to be that Lee Kuan Yew will die and people despise him.</p>
              <p>It doesn't have to be that I want Lee Kuan Yew to die.</p>
              <p>I also want to have a political leader that I can respect.</p>
              <p>But did Lee Kuan Yew do it?</p>
              <p>Did he rule Singapore and lead Singapore so that people can say sincerely that I respect Lee Kuan Yew?</p>
              <p>No.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew failed in doing that.</p>
              <p>But he still wants to hold on to power.</p>
              <p>That is why I have no choice but to hope that Lee Kuan Yew dies soon.</p>
              <p>No one will miss you Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>No one will respect you also.</p>
              <p>You will die and you will be despised.</p>

              <p>poh, if I say if the wife passes on, he will not last

                  one after another within less than a year.   The wife may
                  bring him along when she leaves.   Or she leaves first to

              <p>the Leegime will not give much attention or attention at all to one who bothered to check on them.  Well, put it this way, if they are upright and do no wrong there is no fear, no anger they will have for Mr Ong to check on them.</p>

              <p>i am reading one of catherine lim's older books now, <strong><em>unhurried thoughts at my funeral</em></strong>. it's semi-autobio, quasi-fictional story where the subject is herself, dead and in the coffin, remarking the people who's come to pay their last respects.</p>
              <p>i was giggled by her tongue-in-cheek writing on page 3, where she wrote, <em>"the size of the deceased person's photograph on the obituary pages reflects his or her social status. the president, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">prime minister</span> or the wealthiest tycoon in singapore takes up the whole page, a member of parliament, half a page, doctor or lawyer a third or a quarter and somebody's old father in law who used to run a small groceries store in a housing estate, only a one-by-two inch rectangle."</em></p>
              <p>what's interesting if you read between the lines is, we have dead presidents, MPs but never a prime minister (yet). still, it didn't stop her from penning it as it is nonchalantly. i think she wrote this deliberately and on purpose.</p>
              <p>she's one heck of a writer!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>As chairman of the People's Action Party (PAP) and secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress, Ong was considered a firm Lee Kuan Yew loyalist. In January 1986, he sanctioned a strike in the <span class="mw-redirect">shipping industry</span>, the first for about a decade in Singapore,
              without telling the cabinet. He said that he did not inform the cabinet
              or the government because they would probably stop him from going ahead
              with the strike. There was a major corporate and Cabinet backlash
              against his decision; however, the strike lasted only two days, and a
              deal was struck.<sup id="cite_ref-asiaweek_0-0" class="reference">[1]</sup></p>

              <p>Ong ran for the presidency in 1993 under PAP's endorsement. He ran against a reluctant <span class="new">Chua Kim Yeoh</span>,
              a former accountant general, for the post. A total of 1,756,517 votes
              were polled. Ong received 952,513 votes while Chua had 670,358 votes,
              despite the former having a higher public exposure and a much more
              active campaign than Chua. There was a swing of support over to Chua's
              side, especially in the educated class. The reason was because of the
              issue of whether they wanted a PAP man as president to check on a PAP
              government or whether it would be better to have a neutral independent
              like Chua.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span style="white-space: nowrap;" title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007">[<em>citation needed</em>]</span></sup></p>
              <p>However, soon after his election to the presidency in 1993,
              he became embroiled in a dispute with the government over the access of
              information regarding Singapore's financial reserves. The government
              said it would take 56 man years to produce a dollar-and-cents value of
              the immovable assets. Ong discussed this with the accountant general
              and the auditor general and came to a compromise that the government
              needed to give him only a listing of all the properties that the
              government owns. It took the government a few months to produce the
              list. But even then the list was not complete. In all, it took the
              government three years to come up with the information about the
              reserves that Ong requested.<sup id="cite_ref-asiaweek_0-1" class="reference">[1]</sup> The government also tried to submit a bill to parliament for the sale of the Post Office Savings Bank (POSB), a statutory board whose reserves are to be protected by the president, to the <span class="mw-redirect">Development Bank of Singapore</span> (DBS), without first informing Ong during the last year of his
              presidency. Ong's office had to inform the government that the
              procedure was wrong.<sup id="cite_ref-asiaweek_0-2" class="reference">[1]</sup></p>
              <p>Due to health reasons, he decided not to run for a second term as president in 1999.</p>
