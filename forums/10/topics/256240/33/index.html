              <p>You better "Look right, look left, and then look right again, and cross the road." This is taught to all kindergarten toddlers. And it is a good lesson for life.</p>
              <p>Even on one way street. The courts have ruled that a vehicle reversing against the directional arrow, and knock down a pedestrian, the pedestrian is at fault for not applying the kindergarten lesson.</p>
              <p>Be aware when crossing roads. I am not the only one, MediaCorp artiste, lorry drivers, not to mention many car drivers, are also on the prowl.</p>

              <p>Precisely my point. But it got sidetracked.</p>
              <p>LKY has only two threats. 1. The Grim Reaper, 2. Terrorist</p>
              <p>Where else we have the possibility of being a road kill, a dengue statistics, killer litter victim, murdered by family, friends or criminals, or killed  by SARS, bird flu, toxic ingredients, teenage punks, hanged by the state, falling cranes, and even suddenly with no reason at all.</p>
              <p>And it is reported that the home is quite a dangerous place too. My water heater switch is faulty, and recently I jabbed the switch to get the connection and felt a buzz on my finger, I could have been killed.</p>
              <p>LKY slight pain in the chest, four senior doctors will rush to him, hospitalise him for full checkup. We got chest pain, GP will listen with his stethoscope, and say "Nothing leh! I'll give you some asprin, go home and rest." I know three cases where morning see doctor about chest pain, evening die of heart attack.</p>
              <p>It not a nice thing to know, but the possibility is there. Anyone of us may die before LKY.</p>
