              <p><br>hahaha...wanting to see Signapore going down will continue to be your wet dream, hoping to see some other Asia countries overtaking Singapore is a challenge to these countries. To say that "but most likely this will not happen" shows that you haven't lost your senses.</p>

              <p><strong>Lifelong income committee to release report on Tuesday<br>By S Ramesh, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 11</strong> <strong>February 2008 1449 hrs</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>SINGAPORE: Details of a national scheme to provide lifelong income to Singaporeans to see them through their old age will be released on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The committee, set up to study the National Longevity Insurance Scheme, is headed by Professor Lim Pin.</p>
              <p>Over the past two weeks, both Prof Lim and Manpower Minister Ng Eng Hen have given an insight into some of the committee's recommendations, among them is a new name for the concept – 'National Lifelong Income Scheme'.</p>
              <p>According to a UN study, Singaporeans have a life expectancy of 80 years while the global average is only 67 years.</p>
              <p>And it is estimated that by the year 2030, 900,000 Singaporeans will be above 65 years old.</p>
              <p>Zulkifli Baharudin, member of the National Longevity Insurance Committee, said: "Not many people have thought about it but when you sit down and really discuss in a detailed manner, most people do have their concerns. They want to make sure that they live a meaningful life.</p>
              <p>"People have concerns about their ability to live independent lives, the ability to continue to have whatever income they have for the rest of their lives, (along with the) understanding that some of the family support structures may not be as strong as what they were in the past."</p>
              <p>Hence, there is a need to ensure that Singaporeans have enough savings to see them through their lifetime.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced plans to help Singaporeans work longer and have more for their retirement in his National Day Rally Speech last year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>He also revealed that the government would make some form of annuity compulsory for CPF members.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A month later, the National Longevity Insurance Committee was set up. Its mandate is to design a national scheme that would be basic, affordable and fair to provide Singaporeans income for life from their CPF savings.</p>
              <p>The committee consulted nearly 600 Singaporeans from all walks of life for their views on how the scheme can help address the challenges of an ageing population.</p>
              <p>Denise Phua, MP and member, GPC for Manpower, said: "Most Singaporeans are very low in financial literacy. It is important for them to know – whether they are in the average income, high income or low income (groups) – how much they would need till the day they pass on. The Lifelong Income Scheme is a very good start-up for them."</p>
              <p>Observers said one of the challenges in operating the National Lifelong Income Scheme pertains to letting Singaporeans have the option of choosing the age at which they would want to start receiving the payouts.</p>
              <p>Among the recommendations that have come out so far is to start the payouts at the age of 80.</p>
              <p>Dr Ng announced earlier this month that the scheme would kick in by 2013 and he said about 60 percent of active CPF members will get at least S$600 per month for life under the scheme.</p>
              <p>"I hope the committee could give people a lot of hope for the future... (they could) predetermine what they want to have as a meaningful standard of living in the future," said Mr Zulkifli.</p>
              <p>There is, however, the concern that some Singaporeans still stand the risk of being excluded.</p>
              <p>Ms Phua said: "Some of them may not have the minimum sum in the CPF, and I truly hope that the government and other helping hands would be able to creatively stitch some solutions to help them to be included in the National Lifelong Income Scheme."</p>
              <p>The committee has also proposed that the CPF Board administers the scheme.</p>

              <p>Definitely true that some finding it hard to live a "good life".   A good example is a malay man depends on the CPF money to give the son a good uni education but he is shattered because the good and money minded gahmen PAP has extended the CPF withdrawal age.    </p>

              <p>Dear Sohyp1970,</p>
              <p>you have pointed out the greatest error made by LKY, downgraded and finally closed Chinese education, shut Nanyang Uni, resulting in a big group of Chinese educated being marginalized. This group of Chinese helicopters were the most discriminated minority in Singapore, much more than any race, or minorities of any religion.</p>
              <p>Who were his accomplish? the many english educated, including many who are against him, wishing for his dead.</p>
              <p>Don have to wish him dead, Sohyp1970, people like you are taller than that. </p>
              <p>Many Chinese ed now are perfectly bilingual. People like you can take on the PRC chinese even when they speak english, unlike many Singaporean who think they speak english but actually they only speak singlish and half past six mandarin.</p>
              <p>You are the people who can truely represent the Chinese Singaporean in a multiracial society, you don't have the stench of the former colonial ruler. You have the culture of the Chinese race holding citizenship of a young country, while many Singaporeans call themselves Chinese but have only the culture of the over 40 years of Singapore history which they cannot agree with.</p>
              <p>Stand tall, my friend. I know many many people like you, they are older than me, but I don't see them any less successful in life.</p>
              <p>Remember, it is the Chinese ed that make Singapore multi lingual. Make sure your children learn their chinese well. When LKY died, the only that will make him turn in his grave is when his grand children speak only english and migrate to america.</p>
