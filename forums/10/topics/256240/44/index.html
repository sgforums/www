              <p>When Lee Kuan Yew dies, I think we should lock up this thread and start a new one to reflect on his rule.</p>
              <p>See what he has given us, see what he has taken away from us.</p>
              <p>See what he has created, see what he has destroyed.</p>
              <p>See why people despised him so much.</p>
              <p>See how this man can stay in power for so long.</p>

              <p>The poorer Thais adore him because of Thaksin's populist handout of public money, which produced nothing in terms of economic value, productivity, income distribution ...... but indebted them. Meanwhile, Thaksin alone got richer by at least 100,000,000,000 Baht from his overwhelming power to pass the laws unashamed to favour his businesses. This has not included his cronies.

              <p>No countries are free from corruption. However, SG is perceived as the least corrupt in Asia and the world.</p>
              <p>In Thailand, traces of corruption can be seen everywhere from roads, walkways, airports, highways, poles, river banks, highrises, buses, railways, law enforcement, schools, street stalls, slums, education system ... so rampant that people take corruption for granted. It is a norm.</p>
              <p>SG is a resourceless island state while TH is rich in natural resources. TH was set to be far ahead of Singapore. What holds back Thailand? Not human right abuses. Not authoritarian regimes. Not democracy. Not freedom of speech. It's all about corruption.</p>
              <p>LKY has laid a good groundwork for SG.</p>

              <p>No countries are free from corruption. However, SG is perceived
              as the least corrupt in Asia and the world.</p>
              <p>In Thailand, traces of corruption can be seen everywhere from
              roads, walkways, airports, highways, poles, river banks, highrises,
              buses, railways, law enforcement, schools, street stalls, slums,
              education system ... so rampant that people take corruption for
              granted. It is a norm.</p>
              <p>SG is a resourceless island state while TH is rich in natural
              resources. TH was set to be far ahead of Singapore. What holds back
              Thailand? Not human right abuses. Not authoritarian regimes. Not
              democracy. Not freedom of speech. It's all about corruption.</p>
              <p>LKY has laid a good groundwork for SG.</p>

              <p>Well, everybody knows that. And you already call it 'obscene'?</p>
              <p>In Thailand, MPs and even graft probe commissions raised their salaries for themselves.  Worse, they wielded their powers in every area they could reach (stock markets, national budget, state-owned banks, pension funds, underground businesses, etc.) to funnel the money into their pockets lawfully! Many state-owned banks in Thailand (Krung Thai Bank, Thai Military Bank for example) have suffered a number of big losses due to frauds. Just for one of many examples, 4 years ago Thaksin pressured Export&amp;Import Bank to extend 4-billion baht loan to the Myanmese Government and Thailand's Finance Ministry acted as guarantor. The money would go back to a business arm of Shin Corp through a communication project in Myanmar. This is just the tip of the iceberg, you know. These hanky panky businesses always ended up with cash injection at the cost of taxpayers. Crooked politicians and officials in Thailand are still alive and wealthy. In Thailand, politicians, police, army, government employees, and tycoons are an inter-related web of crooks.</p>
              <p>Sadly, unlike Singaporeans, most Thai people (the majority poor) have largely been kept too uneducated and ignorant to understand what have happened to their countries with populist activities like gambling, handout, entertainment, easy consumer loan, consumerism, etc.</p>
              <p>Corruption-wise, Thailand should have received PhD while Singapore is still in their kindergarten.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, you remain one of the most competitive economies in the world. You are also one of the least corrupt countries in the world.</p>
