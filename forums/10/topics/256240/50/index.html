              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">A difficult time for Singapore ahead</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Channelnewsasia , the Singapore state controlled news media reports on May 15, 2008 "<em>Mrs Lee Kuan Yew in serious condition after brain damage".</em> She suffered a massive blot clot in her brain which resulted in a
              weakness of her side and inability to speak, and still remains in
              hospital in a critical condition. It is understood she has a history of
              suffering strokes, the last one being in 2003. Medical science tells us
              that people in such a condition are bound to suffer recurrence in
              strokes and keeping her age of 87 in mind, the prognosis is not good
              for a permanent recovery, and usually death is not too far away.
              However much we may want her to make a full recovery, and we all, I am
              sure wish her well, we cannot avoid the reality of the medical
              condition in such cases. It is dire.<br><br>These are worrying times
              for the country given it's unique circumstances. We have Lee Kuan Yew
              who practically runs the whole show, with everyone else doing nothing
              more than just taking his orders and dutifully carrying them out. They
              have lost their ability to think since the last 40 years of
              dictatorship with Lee alone doing all the thinking. As for his son whom
              he placed as Prime Minister, even among his own party members he does
              not appear to instill any confidence. He too as a dutiful boy has been
              obediently doing nothing more than just following his fathers orders.
              Most people would agree that if he is Prime Minister, it is in name
              only.<br><br>With the father strutting around the island shouting
              orders and jailing anyone who dared to say otherwise, the country has
              managed to acheive a certain amount of stability over the years, thus
              attracting foreign investment and became a fairly prosperous country.
              The question is whether the country can go on, with the demise first of
              Lee Kuan Yew's wife, 87, who has now suffered a massive brain
              hemorrhage, with Lee Kuan Yew himself already 84 and not too long to
              go; will business go on a usual?<br><br>If Singapore is to slip into a
              steady decline with the economy unravelling and disintegrating, the
              fault must lie with Lee Kuan Yew alone. He will be solely responsible
              for its demise.<br><br>Having been at the helm of Singapore for the
              last 40 years, he knew or must have known that for any country to
              continue advancing, you need an educated questioning people who are
              committed to the country, whose views are sought out and encouraged,
              where leaders are encouraged to develop and where at any one time,
              there are a great number of people who have managed to acquire the
              experience and understanding of government; where change of government
              can seamlessly occur; something which he has never allowed to happen.<br><br>In
              order to ensure that he and his family alone rule Singapore in
              perpetuity, he violently put down anyone who was not prepared to tow
              his line; regardless of how educated or how capable they were. This has
              caused disaffection and disinterest among the educated whose ideas and
              contributions did not conform to his; which meant that a great many
              capable people were lost as leaders to Singapore's nation building.
              They either went into obscurity or emigrated and left Singapore
              permanently.<br><br>And this meant, the talent pool in Singapore is
              small; limited only to those who were prepared to to submit to his
              authority and obey his commands. These people, the civil servants, the
              Ministers and high ranking government officers, no doubt are highly
              educated and talented people but unfortunately useless as leaders;
              since in Singapore Lee's set up, they are not required to think
              independently; since all they do is to carry out orders, I mean Lee's
              orders in an very efficient manner. But for any country to remain a
              real country, you need leaders who can think and act independently,
              with an understanding of politics and government and the necessary
              experience. Unfortunately no one in Singapore has been allowed to fit
              this description. And the lack of such people mean the end of a nation.
              Singapore, you must remember does not have any natural resources.<br><br>So
              is it possible that foreign companies are already making plans to
              repatriate their money and their personnel from the island? Has foreign
              investment already begun to transfer their funds to Bangkok, Kuala
              Lumpur or whichever country appears a more permanent and stable place?
              Are more Singaporean educated taking their sons and daughters and
              themselves to Australia? Is the stock market beginning to suffer losses
              at a steady rate?<br><br>I do not have any firm evidence of any of
              this, but if I am to guess, with the wife of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew in a
              critical condition in hospital, perhaps even dying, and with Lee Kuan
              Yew already 84 keeping in mind no one lives forever, and the son looked
              upon as a good schoolboy and nothing else, I must confess, I have to

              <p>People, read what did the son of Mrs Lee K Y said about prolonging life.  I have no issue whether guek choo the mrs lky is alive or dead, but just look at the "dear" lee hsien loong and read what he said about prolonging life makes me lose more respect for him.</p>

Alas, fixing it is politically difficult. We must not get into such a situation."<br>.<br>While different countries have taken different approaches to healthcare, "their experience shows that more resources do not necessarily improve healthcare outcomes", said Mr Lee, who received an honorary fellowship from the Academy of Medicine last night.<br>.<br>Hence, he said, in Singapore, "while we will invest more in healthcare, it is more important to get the economics of healthcare right". "The reality is that demand for healthcare is unlimited and has to be rationed," he said.<br>.<br><span style="color: #3366ff;">"Problems are compounded as populations age and vast amounts of high-tech resources are marshalled to manage the last few weeks of the terminally ill, delivering poor quality of life to the patients at very high cost to society," he added.<br></span>.<br>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan first talked about the need for a national conversation on the dying process last October.<br>.<br>Then, he said he would look into the legislation governing the Advance Medical Directive, which allows adults to refuse extraordinary life-sustaining treatment for a terminal illness, as part of his ministry's five-year plan.<br>.<br>Other healthcare priorities include the management of chronic diseases, which Mr Lee also mentioned last night as part of the "new and creative approa-ches" Singapore should explore to improve its market-based system of pricing and co-payment.<br>.<br>Maximising the benefits of IT is one such approach. For example, the National Healthcare Group has introduced tele- radiology at its polyclinics, where X-ray images are sent to Bangalore to be read.<br>.<br>This has reduced prices and cut turnaround times "dramatically from two to three days previously to an hour or less", said Mr Lee, who stressed: "We must press on with such initiatives."<br>.<br>He identified tele-pathology, which allows doctors who study disease processes and their causes to use telecommunications to transmit data and images, as one possibility.<br>.<br>The challenge is in training and recruiting people for the healthcare system. The Health Ministry projects that Singapore will need over 2,000 more doctors by 2015. Currently, Singapore produces about 230 doctors each year. In 2012, this number will be 300. But it will not be enough.<br>.<br>"Given our small local talent pool and competing needs from other sectors in the economy, there are limits to how far we can expand the local supply," said Mr Lee.<br>.<br>"Increasingly, we will have to recruit medical talent from abroad. We must be open minded in accepting such imported talent, while maintaining medical standards and helping foreign trained doctors to adapt to conditions in Singapore."<br><br>Blindly prolonging life is not the solution: PM<br><br>Derrick A Paulo<br>derrick@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>His health minister broke the silence last year, and now Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is taking the dialogue forward.<br>.<br>In a speech to medical professionals from Singapore and abroad, Mr Lee identified end-of-life care and how people are medically treated in their final stages as key factors in determining how well the health system works.<br>.<br>In this regard, Singapore will avoid taking the same route as some other countries, such as the United States, in the management of issues of death.<br>.<br>"The practice of medicine has its limits.
