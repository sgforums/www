              <h3 class="post-title entry-title"><strong>Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew: "If you don't fear me, I am nothing"</strong></h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Among the other out of this world, bizarre, mind boggling remarks that this man Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, has made, the one that beats them all is "<em>If you don't fear me, I am nothing</em>",
              which appears in his book Third World to First. I suppose it is a
              quotation from Machiavelli, a book that he appears to have read. One
              begins to wonder whether it is the only book that he is familiar with
              since he refers to none other.<br><br>Firstly he has got the definition
              wrong. Singapore, a country which hangs 20 year old petty drug mules,
              and whips criminals at their behind until it turns into a mesh of blood
              and flesh, a place which imprisons citizens for peaceful public
              assembly, while permitting the Burmese to assemble publicly in
              Singapore in any numbers and where kangaroo courts are used to abuse
              the law to stifle political dissent is not a first world country by any
              standards. If he has any doubt about what I said, he should consult the
              international human rights monitor Freedom House which places Singapore
              at the same ranking as Zimbabwe!<br><br>By now, if anyone has been
              following what nonsense this man has been saying for the past 2
              decades, including this nonsense about people having to fear him, which
              is only one of a series of silly remarks which he appears determined to
              utter; one thing must be quite clear. This man, with his son is ruining
              the country so fast that very soon, there will be no one left in
              Singapore except for Lee and his immediate family and uneducated office
              boys. Everyone with any ability to think, some pride and self respect,
              would have left the country to settle elsewhere for no other reason
              than their just refusing to take any more insults from him.<br><br>If
              Singapore is trying to become international, like London New York and
              San Francisco, then it needs people of the level of education and
              intelligence as expected in such great cities. In other words capable
              people who would be offended if told that they are required to fear Mr.
              Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, if they wish to live in Singapore.<br><br>Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, it appears, is still laboring under the impression that everyone
              in Singapore fears him. Unfortunately for him, this is not true. Many
              in Singapore may sympathise with him, as an old man suffering from
              dementia or some other incurable mental illness. Megalomania may be a
              correct <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">diagnosis</span>.
              True, there may be those at the lower rungs of society who may really
              fear him through ignorance, but the educated and discerning who still
              remain in Singapore, I doubt have any fear.<br><br>In any case, most of
              them have left the country by now and are living in countries such as
              Australia; from which vantage, I suppose they enjoy a good laugh once
              in a while, at this silly old man with his stupid remarks, and his
              country made up of its inhabitants which he calls "digits".<br><br>The
              state controlled media in Singapore reports almost daily that Singapore
              is trying to be an education hub, a bio tech hub, a transport hub, and
              not to mention various other hubs of excellence. Unfortunately to date
              none of these hubs have ever materialized.<br><br>The reason should be
              quite obvious. A banking hub requires highly educated people. And such
              people are not going to take it kindly if Lee insults their
              intelligence. Now if you order a highly skilled world traveled
              international banker to fear you, he is probably going to react in a
              way that you probably would not like. He may tell you to fly a kite,
              regardless of whether your name is Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew or Adolf Hitler. You see, this sort of arrogance is not going to go
              down well with educated people who do not see the need to prostrate at
              his feet.<br><br>What is even more annoying is this. Lee controls the
              press, turns the judiciary into a tool for destroying political
              dissent, imprisons its citizens when they exercise their rights under
              the constitution, appoints a Tamil boy as the Minister for Law just
              because he is a willing stooge; and yet after doing all this, he
              publicly claims that there is no corruption in Singapore and the
              Singapore legal system is the best in the world and so is the Singapore
              press even though it is ranked below North Korea!<br><br>When a man
              deliberately, brazenly and unashamedly tells blatant lies which is
              publicised through a state controlled newspaper, he loses all respect
              and his country loses it too.<br><br>Just as the Soviet newspapers
              which sang praises for the Communist government until its very last day
              before it finally fell, the Singapore government continues with these
              lies unashamedly.<br><br>Since Mr. Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew has completely lost sight of reality, I suppose there is no point
              in anyone telling him that he is ruining the country. As a result of
              this stupidity that goes on in that island, educated people who are
              needed to turn it into Lee's international city are naturally leaving
              the place. They don't see it becoming any sort of hub that Lee wants.
              Highly capable individuals would not be prepared to live and work in a
              dictatorship. The people who stay behind are the ones who are totally
              incapable of advancing the country. They can only take orders from
              above, the type which is not the building block of an international
              city.<br><br>Mr. Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew has to be told to shut up. He is making a fool of himself, let alone ruining the country.<br><br>Second,
              no one with any self respect will fear this man either within or
              without Singapore. Since this much has been established, someone should
              tell him that by his own definition, he is in fact, regrettably "<em>nothing</em>".<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>Much as we complain, the fact remains that LKY is still the person holding Singapore afloat. Given a choice, will u trust LKY or his son LHL to be in charge? Some of you may say it's the lesser of 2 evils...anyway I would still prefer LKY, I don't trust LHL as much. Of course, if there was someone better than the both of them, I'd choose that someone. But that isn't possible as yet. I'm NOT FOR LKY btw.</p>
              <p>True, LKY's achievements were mainly in the past, but it is still he who holds Singapore together. Just tells you how badly we need good leadership now.</p>
              <p>It's not just LKY that has to go; it's the entire system put in place. Even after LKY goes, I'm very sure not that much will change. We will have the same grievances, we will still see the same issues being brought up over and over again in this forum...</p>
