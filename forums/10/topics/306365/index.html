              <p>I don't care about them, that is their problem. Don't get me wrong, I'm a moral person but I do wish the death of some politicians in Singapore (Just check out my contribution to the LKY when are you gonna pass away thread). So what if they lose their jobs ? As long as they lose their jobs and I can prove that the government unemployment figures given are misleading, its ok. If they lose their jobs, the onus is on Govt to feed them. Or can increase tax to feed them also. Get rid of CPF, start the pension. CPF, I don't work, I don't have. Pension, I don't work but  I still have. What for work so hard when we can all slack ?</p>
