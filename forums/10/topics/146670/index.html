            <div class='col-md body'>Take away the MNCs, Banks, GLCs, and Government's part of GDP, the domestic or people sector of the economy is very very bearish right now.<br><br>Look at the neighbourhood shops, the JTC factories, the sliding COEs and the half-dead property market (dropped 35 % from previous peak) and you will know whether the economy is growing by 3-4.5% this year.<br><br>All the statistics and figures are connived to show good reports to justify continuing past policies which are essentially to keep our elites employed at highest pay, like the NKF case.</div>

Transparency is really lacking in this matter! Just imagine if the ministers were to initiate a pay cut like previously before... Many would have thought that they really got lower pay for themselves but they could be getting the same or more if they gave themselves more bonus right?<br><br>How do you think Durai got his 12-month bonus? He must have used some form of gauge to ask for something as insane as 12-months for his bonus!</span></div>
