Does that mean that for any offence where the maximum is, say, two years, an offender with a criminal record can be sent to jail for 10 years?'<br><br>However, Senior Counsel R. Palakrishnan said he had no doubt the Chief Justice has the power to apply the law. 'The Chief did this because it's an [color=red]<strong>exceptional case - an officer of the court was assaulted.</strong></span> He felt that the man deserved more than the maximum.'<br><br>But the broader reaction among lawyers was one of shock. Some did not know the provision existed. Others were confused because Louis did not have serious criminal convictions in the past, although he was fined $180 for providing public entertainment without a licence in 1986 and was jailed two weeks for driving under disqualification in 1999.<br>[/color]<br><br>I am not an officer of the court !<br><br>So anyone with a previous criminal record who attacks me will get <span class="large"><strong>7 instead of 10 years </strong></span>lah?!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The clause is antiquated and IMO pushing the boundaries of reason, although it is written in the Penal Code, nothing illegal about that....<br><br>Still, as usual, the official explanation had all the sensitivity of a piece of rotting wood. Although the one which our dear Health Minister all but put a dollar value on the life of a sick baby in Parliament ($330,000 was it, Mr Minister?)  still takes the cake.So I suppose this explanation by the Courts is not too surprsing, given the precedents.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Atobe,<br><br>depends on whether you want the official or unofficial reason.<br><br>The official one is that Singapore, as a sovereign nation with its own laws, a conservative Asian justice system based on Confucian values, must not submit to a kangaroo court set up by westerners with their own hidden agenda out to destroy Asian countries with their liberal Western values<br><br>Unofficial one? We don't want to come under the scrutiny for clauses like the one invoked in this case, where the sentence meted out can be 10 years even if the penal code says the max is 7...which kind of defeats the purpose of having the min/max sentence set up in the first place doesn't it?<br><br>That said, Western laws, by and large, suck to high heaven, if you thought the cases in Western courts you read about in ST are bizarre/ludicrous/stupid/hare-brained/a joke, you should really try spending time in a Western country(or at least Australia).<br><br>Makes that damn clause in our penal code seem almost acceptable.<br></div>
