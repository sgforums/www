              <p>2) Electricity increases (by then they will be using futures prices for 2050)</p>
              <p>3) Bus fares will increase another 20 cents</p>
              <p>4) Property tax will decrease, but they will increase the Net Annual Value of your property <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>5) Marlboros will cost $20 a pack</p>
              <p>6) Petrol tax will increase to help fight environmental pollution <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>7) CNG will be taxed because many converting from gasoline to CNG will reduce government taxes</p>
              <p>8) HDB 3-rooms (2 bedrooms) will start from $400,000</p>
              <p>9) ERPs will cost $5 per entry</p>
              <p>10) Singaporeans salary will remain the same (after taking effect the cost of inflation) due to the high influx of foreign talents to compete for wages, therefore depressing wages of citizens.</p>

              <p>Let me assure u that PAP will still hold 88 seats in parliament. Votes overall will drop but because of their majority in each GRC, this stranglehold will still persist. Perhaps this time it shall be 55.5%.....but they will still command 88 seats.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chiam will not lose his seat even though he appears senile. Residents will give his little known successor time to prove his worth as evident when Bukit Batok voted in "dun talk cock" Ling How Doong lol.</p>

              <p>WP's Low Thia Khiang will still retain Hougang but that's because this is all he is really good at: running a town council, not a govt. Sylvia will still continue her enthusiastic speeches but my guess is she may nick a constituency or if not, less likelier, a GRC.</p>

              <p>You know what when we in Indonesia were still under the
              Soeharto's new order regime the general elections had always
              brought overwhelming vitory to the Golkar party. Oppositions party
              such as PPP or PDI(Megawati's) were very impotent indeed.</p>
              <p>Now that we have <strong>REAL</strong> geeral elections
              <strong>the people need to be registered whereby</strong> such
              registration was never necessary in the new order regime.</p>
              <p><strong>Do you know why?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Because in real fair democratic general election, your
              votes count!</strong></p>

              <p>I'm a victim of grave abuses from psychotic people in power with
              access to telepathic person(s) in Singapore . All abuses are to
              convince people I'm mentally ill to cover their grave evil.
              Telepathy is not a far off fiction. It's a fact</p>

                              <p>Let me assure u that PAP will still hold 88 seats in parliament.
              Votes overall will drop but because of their majority in each
              GRC, this stranglehold will still persist. Perhaps this time it
              shall be 55.5%.....but they will still command 88 seats.</p>

              <p>Chiam will not lose his seat even though he appears senile.
              Residents will give his little known successor time to prove
              his worth as evident when Bukit Batok voted in "dun talk cock"
              Ling How Doong lol.</p>

              <p>WP's Low Thia Khiang will still retain Hougang but that's
              because this is all he is really good at: running a town council,
              not a govt. Sylvia will still continue her enthusiastic speeches

              <p><br>Really or not, last time i think you voted for them, this time around i think they give you $4000 progressive paid out a month before election, i think you still vote for them. Singaporeans, very easy to cheat on lah, either by money or fear, they all vote PAP liao. Outside talk big only.</p>
