            <div class='col-md body'><strong>No flat = No wedding<br>Newly-weds who find it hard to get a flat amid buoyant property market are putting off their weddings<br>Straits Times, The (Singapore)<br>Home<br>November 17, 2007<br>Author: Tan Hui Yee, Housing Correspondent<br><br>AS PROPERTY prices rise, some newly-wed couples are postponing their traditional ceremonies while they wait for a new Housing Board flat.<br><br>Many have been priced out of the resale market while others want to buy a new home, which means joining the hordes trying their luck at ballots in HDB sales exercises.<br><br>It is leaving couples in a dilemma. While they have registered their marriages officially, they are reluctant to hold the customary ceremony that legitimises the union in the eyes of the community, until they have a home to call their own.<br><br>Members of Parliament say they are getting more appeals from distressed couples.<br><br>Aljunied GRC MP Cynthia Phua, who raised a question on the availability of flats in Parliament this week, told The Straits Times that one or two such couples bring up the problem at her Meet-the-People session every week.<br><br>Although technically married, many of them live apart, in their family homes, while waiting to get a flat together.<br><br>Madam Phua said: 'For us Asians, once you hold back your customary wedding, you can't live together, and you can't even have babies.'<br><br>Deliveryman Ang Kah Liong, 34, has unsuccessfully applied for a new flat 10 times since he registered his marriage with his girlfriend three years ago. The couple - who earn $3,000 a month - live with Mr Ang's parents and three elder brothers in their family's two-bedroom flat.<br><br>They were determined to wait until they had a flat of their own before holding the customary ceremony but family pressure finally prompted them to hold it in September.<br><br>'I had no choice,' said Mr Ang. 'I could not wait anymore.'<br><br>People like Mr Ang are being caught in a supply-demand crunch.<br><br>The buoyant resale market, which has seen prices grow by 11 per cent in the first nine months of this year, is fuelling a demand for new HDB flats.<br><br>In the July to September quarter, five-room flats in Queenstown - a coveted district - sold for a median sum of $110,000 above their valuations. This means a buyer had to pay at least $110,000 in cash as that amount cannot be covered with a home loan.<br><br>So young couples who cannot afford such resale prices - even with government grants that can go up to $40,000 - are turning to new HDB flats.<br><br>MPs told The Straits Times that many seek help to get a new flat near their parents' homes but this can be difficult as these are usually in older estates where few new flats are being built.<br><br>Jalan Besar MP Lily Neo said: 'Many couples want to live near their parents in the Central Business District, but as you know, there aren't many flats there.'<br><br>They stand a better chance of getting a flat if they are willing to consider other locations, said Dr Neo.<br><br>Application figures for recent HDB sales exercises show how competitive the flat race can get.<br><br>The HDB received almost 8,000 applications for just 400 flats in Telok Blangah recently, and more than 1,600 applications for 516 homes in Punggol.<br><br>The HDB is pumping up the supply of new homes to meet demand. A further 3,600 flats are expected to be offered under the build-to-order system from now until March.<br><br>However, the Government has stated that it cannot meet all the demand for new HDB flats as that would risk creating an oversupply in the future.<br><br>Meanwhile 28-year-old secretary Koh Bee Leng and fiance Julius Lim, 30, who hope to marry next year, carry on with their house-hunting.<br><br>The couple have set their eyes on four-room flats in a mature estate such as Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh, but have had no luck in two sales exercises this year.<br><br>Ms Koh said: 'Everything is uncertain now, because of the issue of the availability of the flat. That's delaying our plan to get married.'<br><br>ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY HO AI LI </strong><br><br>i hate Marbok tan as much as many of you.(hatest of all PA* minister).<br>but the reality is there are heaps of houses in jurong west area that there arent much taker.<br><br>why complain when you cant get a houses of your favourite area like telok blangah, queenstown. these are establish estate and know for high prices. if cant afford it, look elsewhere such as jurong west.<br><br>the comon practices oversea when u r price out of a property is go rental. but it seem rental is for foreigners only here in singapore.<br>Why put a marriage on hold because of property?<br><br>How about ask HDB to build few blocks near IR to satisfy the lust of those high end HDB owners?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>marbok tan is indeed the worse, second worse is WKS.<br><br>my impression of Marbok tan:<br>1 the does not care about grassroot, he always want to look at the bigger picture, but often screw it.<br>2, when he screw up something, he always tried various means of presentation to cover it up and make them sound like success.<br>3. he bootlick the PA* to climb his way up the party ladder. The party need some diehard party members to carry out dirty jobs for them without himself knowing it. to me he sound like a Goring in the Nazi party.<br>4. he talk without thinking. he should keep quiet instead of making singapore a mockery of neighbouring country of 2010 world cup goals.<br><br>my impression of WKS.<br>1. he dont do much. that why we seldom find fault with him.<br>2. the police carry machine guns policing the roads in shenton way, orchard rds are a mockery of his so call brilliant idea.<br><br>the common of the 2 are they often make attacking comments on the opposition, but are often short of convincing. definitely not the class of SS fuhrer maybe adjutant like fegelein.<br></div>

The current sitation in BPJ is the work of SMRT buses, not directly because of the exchange. If you are talking about the exchange, then ceteris paribus (also assume that TIBS is still around), you would most probably see a better trnsport system in the NW. I aappreciate if you stop smoking around here by purposely mixing the two issues up so as to support your initial stand of "Mah Bow Tan wrong because he exchanged the two territories".</div>

They probably did read the proposals submitted by the contenders before choosing which company to operate NEL. Also, Delgro had already a plan to further diversify their business, so how can it be a wrong move if a company has a plan to diversify its business and eventually got awarded as the operator of NEL.<br><br>The way you post sound as if Singapore is controlled by a Singapore Sumpreme Soviet, probably you should read less of Harry Potter to stop fantasizing.</div>
