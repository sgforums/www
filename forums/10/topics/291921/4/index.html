The thing is that most of the world recongises the Chinese government which adminsters 90% of the total population and area of China. How can certain pro-independence Taiwanese not feel threatened and would not fight for their sovereignty.<br><br>Notice how we made a segue?<br><br>From Singapore, we talked all the way to Australia before coming to Taiwan. Point is, you should respect Singapore's sovereginty, instead of making remarks like chasing the current governemt out of parliement and merging with Australia.<br><br>Once again, if you are unhappy and cannot tahan the current situation of democracy here in Singapore, emigrate.
