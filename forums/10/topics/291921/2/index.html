            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by greyskymorning:</div><div class="quote_body">if ERP &amp; COE were not implemented during his time, wld ppl dislike him so much? u may b able to buy a hse if there is a huge plunge in property price now but many pple wld suffer huge losses as well as the economy</div></blockquote>Many people may be brainwashed into believing that collecting taxes after taxes and profiteering by HDB or LTA thereby creating more surpluses for our national coffer will help us to become rich and wealthy or do well to compete with our economies.<br><br>The reverse is true - surprised? Because the government essentially does not create jobs or generate wealth. It collects taxes and suck people's monies from the economy which slows down growth such monies from the people being immobilized into unproductive idle monies which may at best give us 2% returns from bonds but at worse be lost in some glorifying foreign investments which provide jobs and growths for foreigners and not us Singaporeans.<br><br>If taxes and profiteering are not so extreme as in our case where the government finds ways and means to suck more and more monies from the private sector such monies will be circulated within the private sector economy creating more investments and more jobs.<br><br>Just think about all the boasts of the government about their success in raising taxes and making profits by all the GLCs etc. Such a system is the reverse of creativity and competitiveness. It kills the goose (taxpayers) that lays the golden egg (investments and jobs).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ever heard of the story? Son of a poor washerwoman, worked hard and made good.<br><br>The funny thing about these scholars is that they went overseas, came back with caucasian or diff. racial wives and those change personalities. From MBT, TES, YI, JK to SD and many more.<br><br>Don't get me wrong.<br>1) If you are of mixed marriage, so be it. I am not referring to you.<br>2) Those who work hard to climb from poverty, I salute you.<br><br>What I don't like about these scholar-minister are:<br><br>1) They seem to think that Singaporean must be like them, mixed beyond recognition, to be of anything. Implementing policies to reflect their personal choices.<br><br>Deep and long talks with my many friends,  Malay, Chinese, Indian, tells of diff stories. Majority wants to preserve their heritages for the next generation.<br><br>2) They seem to have forgotten their struggles the moment they arrived or made good. Or worst still - forgotten their roots.<br><br>How many came out to share their stories to inspire others, unafraid that ppl will laugh at their past? How many went back to their communities, before they joined politic,  to help those in the same predicaments?<br><br>I think, it is something to do with this potent mix. Poor, inferior-complex asian man and the intoxication of up-class chick or white gal that make them behave so silly, so arrogantly.</div>
