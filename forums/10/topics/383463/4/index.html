              <p>vote opposition first if they suck on the job then can always recall back pap. Further more, after pap is down, and opposition is up there, I believe more options will be opened up gradually in the future as this shows that singaporeans are not pushovers, secondly if opposition really sucks on their role, there will be more parties will come to compete away the power. My point is pap regimes prevents and hinder political growth in singapore. So voting for opposition is not always a wrong move.</p>

              <p class="publishtext-post"> </p>
              <p><strong>SINGAPORE</strong> – PM Lee Hsien Loong announced a series of changes, which would have significant bearing on our political landscape. The first is a decrease in size of the Group Representation Constituencies (GRC) and an increase in the number of Single Member Constituencies (SMC) to at least 12. The second development is the amendment of the Parliamentary Elections Act, which will see 9 Non-constituency Member of Parliaments (NCMP) from the opposition taking up seats in the parliament.</p>
              <p>The changes in the electoral system in decreasing the sizes of GRCs and increasing the number of SMCs is a positive development. Miss Sylvia Lim from the Workers’ Party of Singapore criticized the GRC system and proposed a return to the SMC-style of electoral contest, which took place prior to 1988. However, it may not be entirely easy for the opposition in an electoral contest at an SMC. The PAP candidates that they will be up against typically have strong grassroots support and rapport with the residents. A last check of the electoral map at the <a href="http://www.elections.gov.sg/elections_map_electoral.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">elections website</span></span></a> has not shown which GRCs have been reduced and which SMCs have been created. The opposition has to start campaigning early in the targeted SMCs to stand a chance of winning over a substantial proportion of support. It will not do the opposition chances any good if the new SMC wards and their boundaries are released close to the elections. It means they have less time to campaign and win the residents’ support.</p>
              <p>The move to increase the number of NCMPs from the current 3 to 9 is an interesting one. Others have raised the by now familiar arguement that allowing the best losers to enter parliament is against democratic principles because they go against the voters’ wishes. Another familiar criticism is that such a change allows for token opposition presence at best, i.e. one that has no teeth to bite. NCMPs, like Nominated Member of Parliaments (NMP) cannot vote on the amendment of constitution, public funds, confidence in the government and removal of president from the office. It is not in the interest of this article to revisit these familiar arguements which have been brought up by countless others, but rather to address an insidious consequence of such a move – an increase in the number of votes for the PAP and a decrease in opposition votes.</p>
              <p>Readers may ask how can such a scenario happen? There exist a segment of voters who are not against the ruling PAP party, but they desire to see more opposition in parliament to facilitate political debates. With the changes which will see 9 NCMPs from the opposition in parliament, there is a chance that such voters may end up voting for the PAP because of the assurance that nearly one-fifth of the house according to Mr Lee will be made up of non-PAP members. These voters may take for granted that the consequence of having a “Devil’s Advocate” in parliament is already assured, and they will just vote for PAP. If the NMP and NCMP schemes were scrapped, such voters will have an incentive to vote for the opposition since this is in line with their wishes to have a opposition presence in parliament. Increasing the number of NCMPs in parliament may only decrease such an incentive. Such a scenario is at best speculatory but its possibility cannot be ruled out either.</p>
              <div id="quotes">“With the changes which will see 9 NCMPs from the opposition in parliament, there is a chance that such voters may end up voting for the PAP because of the assurance that nearly one-fifth of the house according to Mr Lee will be made up of non-PAP members.”</div>
              <p>However, is all completely lost for the opposition? Perhaps not. The opposition who entered parliament through the NCMP scheme will have an opportunity to further boost their track record. If they have performed well in addressing issues that concern the populace, this will only augur well for the latter’s chances during the next General Elections. Seen in another light, the NCMP scheme can be a stepping stone for upcoming opposition candidates to prove themselves.</p>
              <p>The decrease in GRC sizes and increase in number of SMCs can be seen as a positive change, but that should be accompanied by an early announcement on the details of these changes such as the newly created SMC wards and their boundaries so that the opposition can begin their campaign early for the next elections. The move to increase the number of NCMPs in parliament may possibly affect the opposition’s chances at the elections. But on the other hand, rising opposition candidates who enter parliament as NCMPs will have opportunities to improve their track record, and if they perform well, they would be able to win more voters.</p>

              <p>I believe everyone should be given the opportunity and freedom to decide the truth for themselves.</p>
              <p>And if you find that someone needed to launch a FEAR campaign in order to convince you or shut you up, then it's wiser for you to see the situation with your own eyes and find out if your world is really as bad as it was painted by these people.</p>
              <p>Heroes or not, it's true that Heroes usually take cares of other people's problem and rescue them from difficult scenarios. But one thing super true is, Heroes usually take cares of their own problem first before they realised they have the powers to help and benefits others.</p>
              <p>Unlike many self-acclaimed heroes who cannot even help themselves, people should learn how to identify the real heroes in their lives who can truly help them when they are in trouble, and not those fake ones who NEVER point a finger at themselves but always point their fingers at others.</p>
              <p>Easiest way to pick them out is to tell them they are WRONG and observe their reactions then determine their true intentions before you go and treat them like heroes. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Of course, they might say, no point choosing a candidate without any calibre or "experience". But I do not think the walkover new MPs have experience too. Most of them just shut up in the parliament till I don't even recognised their face.</p>
              <p>Even if the opposition candidate succeeded getting the seat, I'll just walk up him and say, "Congrats. If you work for the government, I'll make sure you go down the next election, but if you work for the people, I'll ask the people to work for you, but not the government."</p>

              <p>Leaders are also human and they are not perfect and they do fail. Even you all also fail right now.</p>
              <p>It's unbelievable how shallow-minded you are if you only want to focus on people's past failures when they are already historical in histories.</p>
              <p>How about admitting that you just want to focus on the failures of other because it will somehow make your own failures seems insignificant? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
