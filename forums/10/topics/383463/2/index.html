Further more, after pap is down, and opposition is up there, I believe more options will be opened up gradually in the future as this shows that singaporeans are not pushovers, secondly if opposition really sucks on their role, there will be more parties will come to compete away the power. My point is pap regimes prevents and hinder political growth in singapore. So voting for opposition is not always a wrong move.</p></div>

              <p>maybe you would like to enlighten the community by stating some of the examples what deed have they done in the past such that they have impacted you so much?  No they didnt do anything to me, I'm not hating them for anything in fact my family is wealthy and I live in a Terrace. I have $100K in savings at 26 (Am I considered an elite?) If I'm considered an elite, I should have supported the PAP to protect my self interests. But I just hope that Singaporeans would give them a reality check. If oppositions does not fare well in their jobs after they had emerged to the top, I believe singaporeans would recall back PAP. Btw, judging from your posts, I believe you work in the army? Are you a high ranking officer? </p>

              <p><br>Don't forget you were educated under the PAP education system.</p>
              <p>No matter how you tried to deny PAP your lies, in reality, you do hold some form of respect and gratitude towards PAP and their education system for educating you into who you are.</p>
              <p>And of course the same goes for your siblings, relatives and loved ones if they are Singaporeans and would most likely be educated in Singapore like every regular Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>You can say your heart and soul are denying PAP, but how about your mind and body? Taught and trained under PAP education system, how can that be wrong unless you can insist that your very existence is a mistake.</p>
              <p>Even if you could show everyone how ungrateful you care by lying and denying all your childhood memories, you are not capable of UNDOING all the PAP traces in you.</p>
              <p>Unless you are retarded enough to take a drill and punch a few holes into your skull, blending your brain cells into a thin shake, I don't think anyone can believe a Singaporean like yourself can truly achieve what he has claimed, that is to deny his loyalty towards the ruling party, PAP.</p>
              <p>If you are not even able to achieve such an easy thing, then how is it possible for anyone else to believe your conviction against PAP?</p>
              <p>Oh yes, tell me your children won't be educated under PAP education system, I believe I have heard it so many times from losers like yourself, until I have no choice but to be return you a smile and act "agreeable". <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Actually, whether they are angel or devil; or being the bettter devil of all devils, we, the ordinary people, don't really know. When I visit my MP during the meet-the-people session, mostly an assistant attends, hardly the MP.<br><br>When they want our vote, they appeal to higher orders such as rational thinking, social cohesion, welfare of everyone, leaving no one behind etc.<br><br>When the election is over, try writing a letter to a Minister and see if he replies you. I can say this because I wrote a letter on behalf of my illiterate parents, about certain unfair SER rules. My aged and retired parents paid and paid a bomb to the PAP govt due to no fault of them but sheer greediness of the PAP.<br><br>You tell me, having knowing this devil makes any difference? any thing better? which is the real devil here?</p>

              <p>Please kindly elaborate on the last statement you made "A citizen who does not hesitate to betray his own motherland". I would like to know why you bring up the word "betrayal"</p>
              <p>In addition, as I mentioned before, I give credit to the PAP for their past achievements, but I am concerned about the future. To date, no pro-PAP supporter has dared to reply back on my challenges below:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>What is the justification of paying our leaders 4-5x higher than the market rate, when the rest of the population in Singapore (1) must comply with market rates and (2) lives on deeply disproportionate salaries relative to our leaders?</li>
              <li>What is the justification of opening our doors so fully to foreign labour (I do not use the word foreign talent), so much so that jobs are being competed at ALL levels in the market?

              <p><br>yup true. Credit must be given to PAP for what they have done and built on the past years. But they have already reached the bottleneck whereby their policies are outdated and they didnt bother to revise them with the progression of the nation. Furthermore, they aren't proactive enough to be an efficient government. They immediately raised their pay and taxed the people more when singapore's economy is doing good. But, in dire times like these, they did not volunteer to take pay cuts. Where's the flexible wage system they are talking about? Singapore is not a country whereby it has raw materials like the middle east countries. Singapore is built together by us and our fore fathers.

              <p>I would like to add one more point to your good observations above, and I also wish to address this to Parn.</p>
              <p>In the corporate world, the company does not owe you anything the moment they compensate (ie salary) you for your work done. In short, when you sign a contract, you are in effect agreeing to all the conditions of employment, such that once they fulfill those conditions, you should not complain, nor continuously remind about how much work you have done in the past.</p>
              <p>It's the same for the PAP. They have rewarded themselves so much (over-excessive), that there is no longer any need to commend them on, or remember their achievements. They DID NOT sacrifice anything for the country. They rewarded themselves duly (or over-excessively).</p>
              <p>Therefore, there is no need to feel grateful or to appreciate their efforts, since they have gained immensely in the monetary sense anyway.</p>

              <p><br>Do you really not know the answer to your own question? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>With the rising of many so-called educated Singaporeans who felt that they have became wiser because of their education, but are somehow dissatisfied with Singapore in many ways, can you tell me how many Singaporeans that you know, are actually proud to be a Singaporean and love to be in Singapore?</p>
              <p>Do you not feel the anti-Singapore sentiments that has been floating around within the minds of many Singaporeans in here and in your real-life?</p>
              <p>Take a look at the support these people has for CSJ when he tried to seek help from a foreign President like Obama. How bad is the situation in Singapore right now until we need intervention from a foreign country? I would suggest CSJ to seek help from Malaysia instead and maybe that will truly give Malaysia an excuse to go to war with Singapore, to liberate us.</p>
              <p>I can ask you, would you seek the help of your neighbour or someone living far away from you if you have somehow suffered pain from members of your family? The answer is, you won't seek help from anyone to solve your own domestic problems because it is DISGRACEFUL towards your own family. Unless you are not a family-loving person, then there is no point explaining all these to you. In fact, maybe you cannot think very well for yourself and really needed my advice? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Regardless of the job title(politician or not) of the citizen of the country, any citizens who does not recognise the importance and the need of upholding and protection of the honor of their own country, certainly do not deserved to be protected and granted shelter in their own country. Such self-centred citizens are usually likely to betray their country for their own personal gain and benefits, and would not hestitate to behave drastically to throw their country into eternal turmoil without any deep consideration and regards for the consequences which their behaviour might brought upon the other fellow citizens.</p>
              <p>Betrayal is the word that I would use for those rebels who has anti-sentiments towards Singapore and I do not wish to see my country thrown into political uncertaincy with the change of government and I certainly DO NOT NEED to take a risk to believe and follow the retarded revolutionary ideals of many WRONG rebels who do not know how to truly appreciate, love, and contented with their own motherland when their own motherland offers them shelter, education, financial stability, so that they were able to grow up strong and fully.</p>
              <p>Maybe you have been asking questions to kindergarten children? People who are smart would choose to support the better side for the sake of their future and the future of their children. Only fools would risk their future and the future of their children for the sake of justice and righteousness.</p>
              <p>I can help you to answer your questions even though I'm no Pro-PAP cheerleader.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>What is the justification of paying our leaders 4-5x higher than the market rate, when the rest of the population in Singapore (1) must comply with market rates and (2) lives on deeply disproportionate salaries relative to our leaders?</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Shoudn't you be asking the person who decide to give our leaders such a huge payout? If you were in position to question all that, you would've done it so yourself. Since you understand that you were in no position to question them, why do you seek to demand an explaination? Do you imagined yourself higher than the person or the leaders? How would you feel if some act-smart kids come and confront your father and demanded him to explain why he is getting more money than their fathers? Did I managed to paint the scenario is a better for your understanding?</p>
              <p>If you do and truly desire to seek out the answer, then by all means PLEASE RISE UP AND BECOME SOMEONE BETTER THAN ALL OF THEM, then you can start asking all sort of questions you want. But tell me if UFO truly exists ok? Cos I want to know too. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>What is the justification of opening our doors so fully to foreign labour (I do not use the word foreign talent), so much so that jobs are being competed at ALL levels in the market? In other countries I have seen, jobs for foreigners are mostly either at the bottom (when no locals want to do it), or at the top (foreign talent). Middle level jobs are mostly left for the locals.</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>I do not speak on behalf of anyone, but this are my own opinions. As you are probably aware since you were young, Singapore do not have any natural resources and we are actually not self-substainable as a country of our own when compared with other countries around the world. Talent is one of the resources which the government has decided to work towards for the future of Singapore. Attracting investors has always been the driving force behind many government policies if you have not noticed.</p>
              <p>Maybe it is inapprioriate for the ruling party or government to tell you this, but I can tell you the truth. There isn't enough talents among Singaporeans in Singapore. And this following one is free of charge from my own opinion, there are too many insensible Singaporeans in Singapore. Educated yes, Knowledgable yes, Capable yes, Sensible NO, Mature NO, Worldly NO.</p>
              <p>Why do I say that? Because when you have problems in your own career, do you go and consult the PM or any politicians for help? How can you blame the country for not giving you a good career by making you the CEO of CEOs? How is the country responsible for fulfilling your ambitions for you?</p>
              <p>When the government has decided that attracting foreign investors to come and invest and help develop Singapore for us free-of-charge, it is inevitable that Singaporeans are born to compete with foreigners. I don't understand why Singaporeans are so afraid and threatened with competition from foreigners? Perhaps Singaporeans realised that they weren't really as good and capable enough as what they have perceived of themselves on the world market? The truth hurts but it doesn't means it will become a barrier that Singaporeans cannot overcome but have to crying to their PM and politicians for some comforting help.</p>
              <p>There are many Singaporeans at the top level of many companies, just because you are not one of them, doesn't makes it right for you to complain about your own inability and waste my time to answer questions which you already know the answers.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>What is the justification of continuous increase of cost of living? An example I always will remember, is when I question why an upgraded hawker centre must double its rental, the only justification for that is Market rate?</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>OMG, just because some retarded idiots doesn't want to tell you the truth and admit that they are greedy for your money, it becomes my problem to provide some form of justification to comfort you?</p>
              <p>I hope you have been living among Singaporeans long enough to know how many really good Singaporeans exists out there. It's like you can have many Singaporean friends, but how many of them actually make it to your best friend's list?</p>
              <p>Okie, it's not just Singaporeans who are greedy for your money. The entire world of human race are greedy for each other money, if not why we have reserve banks and where do you think these countries borrowed their money from? Please don't think they really borrowed from each other and GOD paid them interests in their saving accounts. How do you think banks generate their money from? It's from debts of course. But this is entirely another topic and you go and find it out for yourself, I'm lazy to explain everything to you just because you asked.</p>
              <p>When everyone in the world is greedy for more money and they comes up with some ploy at some point in their running their businesses and they know someone else in other countries are also doing the same trick to leech more money from the communities, it becomes a standard lie known as "Market Rate". So if Mr. Ah Kow knows that Mr. Ah Mao is overcharging his customers for his hawker service, Mr. Ah Kow assumed he can also safely overcharge his own customers at the comparable ratio rate of Mr. Ah Mao. When people like you ask Mr. Ah Kow, he will tell you "Oh, it's the Market Rate. Don't you know?". Then people like you will come and ask me questions like these and demanded that I provide some form of justification to comfort you like some China prostitutes.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>What is the justification of telling people age 40 and over that they are now more stupid, and hence must accept lower-level jobs, and lesser pay, when in effect, the govt is not able to attract jobs that are at a level these people with such immense experience can excel in?</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>It really depends on which 40 years old people you are talking about. If you go to your friendly 40 years old hawker uncle and tell him he's more stupid now and he must charge you lesser for his food, chances are he might splash your face with his pot of hot soup. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>If you go and tell your friendly 40 years old hairdresser that she's old and stupid and must therefore charge you lesser for her services, you might end up permanently bald and maybe can start training to walk on thin rope between buildings in the next NKF show. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>I have no idea which jobs in particular you are talking about the government not providing or attracting jobs for these people to excel in with their immense experience. Taxi-drivers, Hairdressers, Chefs, Hawkers, Teachers, Policemen, Singers, Dancers, President, PM, CEO of the CEOs, Photographers, Whores and Pimps, ..... not enough? Try not to take things overly subjectively ok?</p>
              <p><strong>"My concern is of the future, not the past. I am concerned with the sufferings of the local individual, where being a citizen in Singapore has not much benefits, and is of no difference to an alien in another country, and where we are in danger of losing our national identity due to the massive influx of foreigners."</strong></p>
              <p>As long as the current ruling party and government of Singapore is still made up of capable people and they are still doing their job for the benefit of the country, the people and their own money, I don't really mind if these people have the better future, cos I know that average Singaporeans won't be too far away from them because they still need Singaporeans to take over them when they retired.</p>
              <p>If Singaporeans really feel that they don't have a future in Singapore, do you think they will have the time and luxury to come to SgForums? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Are Singaporeans really so out of control, that we need to be ruled with an iron fist ?</p>
              <p>Why is there a need to disadvantage the opposition so much, if the current incumbent are so confident of their own doings ? What are they afraid of , really.</p>
              <p>Are the old, the young, the handicapped, the sick being well taken care of ? Do they feel like a prisoner in their own country/home ?</p>
              <p>While we are expected to put 100% trust in the ruling party.. are they trusting us 100% ?</p>
              <p>I wonder, and I ponder.</p>
