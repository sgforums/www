              <p>Obviously, it has to be the resident 'parn' who will pander to the PAP's pornographic ideas to send in the army to shoot the Citizens.</p>
              <p>Who else is more capable of peforming such an obscene act towards the citizens - other then the Stalinist-Autocrat that has its own private military kept and paid for by the tax collected from the Citizens ?</p>
              <p>For 52 years with the Stalinist-Autocrat that began its political life as a democrat and  as a pseudo-socialist - what has it achieved with its Third Generation of Leadership change, except for Singapore to slide into deeper economic and social quagmire ?</p>
              <p>Can it be possible to achieve - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">The ideal is to prosper Singapore into a country where it doesn't makes any difference who is the ruling party</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Of course it can - as had been happening in any Democratic Country - but not with the Stalinist-Autocrat that is determined to be <em>THE ONLY</em> Ruling Party that makes <em>THE ONLY</em> difference.</p>

              <p>Of course, they might say, no point choosing a candidate without any calibre or "experience". But I do not think the walkover new MPs have experience too. Most of them just shut up in the parliament till I don't even recognised their face.</p>
              <p>Even if the opposition candidate succeeded getting the seat, I'll just walk up him and say, "Congrats. If you work for the government, I'll make sure you go down the next election, but if you work for the people, I'll ask the people to work for you, but not the government."</p>

              <p><strong>Voting for status quo or ruling party?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>By </strong><a title="Posts by Kelvin Teo" href="http://kentridgecommon.com/?author=3"><span style="color: #004276;"><strong>Kelvin Teo</strong></span></a></p>
              <h5 class="publishtext-post">Published: June 22, 2009</h5>
              <h5 class="publishtext-post">SINGAPORE – The past general elections have seen huge turnouts for the opposition rallies. The ruling PAP party on the other hand had meagre turnouts. Some even went to the extent of saying that while people can be heard cheering during opposition rallies, most of the noises made during the PAP rallies are by the crickets chattering, other than the speakers of course.</h5>
              <p><img class="story" title="pap_rally" src="http://kentridgecommon.com/wp-content/themes/themasterplan_tma_v1.3.1%202%202/tma/images/latest//pap_rally1.jpg" alt="pap_rally" width="200" height="150"></p>
              <p>If turnout at rallies is used as a benchmark, the conclusion is that the support will be overwhelmingly in favor of the opposition. But it may not be that simple. The huge turnout at opposition rallies could be due to the presence of supporters from other wards. For instance, someone living in Joo Chiat Single Member Constituency (SMC) could attend an opposition rally at the Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency (GRC) in support for the opposition. Perhaps, objective polls would give a clear indication of support for the PAP. The Gallup poll has conclusively shown that the PAP was not popular and did not receive support from the respondents. Interestingly, the PAP government banned the publication of exit polls during elections for fear that the latter might influence voters’ mindset which will affect their ‘ability to vote objectively’. If polls are anything to go by, they indicated that the support is not in favor of the PAP. The question is why every year, an overwhelming majority ended up voting for the PAP?</p>
              <p><img class="story2" title="opposiition_rally" src="http://kentridgecommon.com/wp-content/themes/themasterplan_tma_v1.3.1%202%202/tma/images/latest//opposiition_rally-465x348.jpg" alt="opposiition_rally" width="232" height="174">One plausible reason is that the voters did not want the current status quo to change. Although they do not support the PAP, they also feel that a sudden change in status quo is far too uncertain for their future. Thus, the desire to stick to status quo outweighed their non-support for the PAP. This led to them to vote for the PAP. A prime example of this was apparent during the 2001 General Elections when the PAP garnered 75.3% of the popular vote. This came at the back of the Asian Financial Crisis and it was widely speculated that the people did not want any changes in political status quo amidst fears of its impact on the economy. This sentiment of a potential swing in votes for the PAP was echoed when developments at the Elections Department led many to speculate that the next elections will be held early at the back of the current global economic crisis. Thus, a repeat swing in support for PAP as that in 2001 due to unwillingness to tolerate a change in status quo is feared.</p>
              <p>Thus, for the opposition, an erosion of support for the PAP may not translate entirely into votes. The voters have to be induced into being less adverse to political changes and embrace them instead.</p>

              <p class="publishtext-post"> </p>
              <p><strong>SINGAPORE</strong> – A foreign counterpart of mine once asked me how our cabinet ministers performed during our 2006 General Elections. Admittedly, I did have great difficulties answering his question. My foreign friend hails from a western country, and the politics in his homeland is such that all the seats up for grabs during elections are contested by the incumbent candidate and opposition alike.</p>
              <p>Of course, I couldn’t give a straightforward reply. I could only recall that Mr K Shanmugam and Mr Khaw Boon Wan were among the best performing PAP candidates, garnering 77% of the votes at Sembawang GRC, and that our current Prime Minister Mr Lee Hsien Loong garnered 66% of the votes at Ang Mo Kio GRC. However, I promised my foreign friend that I would research on the current cabinet and get back to him later.</p>
              <p>When I finally got down to checking out the details of our current cabinet, what I found really surprised me. A little less than half (9 out of 20) of the cabinet ministers didn’t have to contest the most recent elections. They were given a shoo-in into parliament on the basis of a no contest in the GRCs which they stood in, winning on a walkover. Thus, technically speaking, I couldn’t tell my friend that Singaporeans voted for these ministers because the residents at their respective GRCs couldn’t vote in the first place. The 9 ministers are as follows:</p>
              <p>1)Mr Lee Kuan Yew(Tanjong Pagar GRC)<br>2)Mr Goh Chok Tong(Marine Parade GRC)<br>3)Mr Wong Kan Seng(Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC)<br>4)Mr Lim Boon Heng(Jurong GRC)<br>5)Mr Lim Hng Kiang (West Coast GRC)<br>6)Mr Lim Swee Say (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC)<br>7)Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam(Jurong GRC)<br>8)Dr Ng Eng Hen(Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC)<br>9)Dr Vivian Balakrishnan(Holland-Bukit Timah GRC)</p>
              <p>There wasn’t any other way for me to put it across to my friend. Singaporeans didn’t vote for a little less than half our cabinet due to the walkover rule. <a href="http://kentridgecommon.com/?p=1438"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">Some time back, I addressed the topic of the walkover rule which raises this question – can the walkover victory be justified if we do not know the preference of the voters in the ward? </span></span></a>And this is a very valid question. I did further research and compared the cabinet appointments of candidates in walkover constituencies during the 1988 General Elections and came up with the following list:</p>
              <p>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Health Minister)- Hong Kah GRC<br>Mr Wong Kan Seng(Minister for Community Development)-Toa Payoh GRC<br>Mr Lee Yock Suan (Labor Minister)-Cheng San GRC</p>
              <p>The 1988 General Election was the year when the GRC concept was first introduced. A GRC consists of multiple seats, and the requirement is that a candidate from a minority race (malay, indian or others) must be fielded. In 1988, the maximum size of a GRC is 3 seats, and has since increased to 6. Some GRCs are allocated 5 seats.</p>
              <p>Comparing the results of the 2006 General Elections to those of previous years yield interesting discoveries. The question that comes out of it is whether the introduction of the GRC correlates with an increasing trend of cabinet members entering office through a non-contest. It appears so as I also researched on candidates from walkover GRCs who were appointed to the cabinet during the 1991 General Elections.</p>
              <p>1)Mr George Yeo(Aljunied GRC)<br>2)Dr Ahmad Mattar (Brickworks GRC)<br>3)Mr Yeo Cheow Tong(Hong Kah GRC)<br>4)Dr Lee Boon Yang(Jalan Besar GRC)<br>5)Dr Yeo Ning Hong(Kampong Glam GRC)<br>6)Dr Tony Tan(Sembawang GRC)<br>7)Mr Lee Kuan Yew(Tanjong Pagar GRC)<br>8)Mr Wong Kan Seng(Thomson GRC)<br>9)Mr Ong Teng Cheong(Toa Payoh GRC)<br>10)Mr S Dhanabalan(Toa Payoh GRC)</p>
              <p>*Dr Richard Hu won by a walkover in Kreta Ayer, which is a Single Member Constituency.</p>
              <p>The introduction of GRC contest has various interesting impacts, many of which have been highlighted previously. And some of them have resulted in interesting trends, one of which has been discussed in this article. Thus, this give rise to pertinent questions regarding the nature of electoral contest within Singapore such as the implications of the walkover rule and whether the GRC concept has impacted competition dynamics.</p>
