              <p><br> I have already help you to answer your questions, even though
                          they may not be what you had expected or searching for. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>You must also understand and accept that your referred "study"
                          is done by subjective humans.</p>
              <p>I know what you are saying are all derived and adopted from the
                          PAP education system, and I don't blame you for that.</p>
              <p>But I would encourage you to use your own eyes to see the real
                          world please.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe when you can see the world with your own eyes and ignore
                          all the widely distributed propaganda studies/reports/references,
                          then and only then are you able to lead a discussion or even have
                          an exchange of true opinions.</p>
              <p>There is no point if you can only stand behind other people's
                          work, only to realised that you have wasted your lives defending
                          othet people's fabricated lies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not expecting you to completely agree with me, but please
                          don't allow gender to become a hindering factor. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I have to correct you. You <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRIED</span> to answer the questions, but most 'answers', you skirted the issue. When I asked about justification of the leaders' pay for instance, and it's not wrong since taxpayers fund the leaders' pay (just as shareholders fund the CEO's pay), you instead answer why do they need to justify to me. And when I explained to you why there is a need to justify, you start off on another topic (who serve leaders...)</p>
              <p>In essence, your answers are much like the PAP's, always skirting around issues and not answering them (Becoz they don't have the answer), and attempting to cause even more confusion. It's not what an honest Govt will do, throwing smoke grenades and changing topics such as what you do.</p>
              <p>2nd, I presume you are outside of Singapore, seeing the way you view with contempt Singapore males, and the way you seemed to think that Singapore males like myself have not seen the world. On the contrary, I am also outside of Singapore, and I have worked in many parts of the world, so probably I would have seen the world as much as you. That is the reason why I can ask penetrating questions, questions that pro-PAP supporters cannot answer (and skirt the issue like you did)</p>
              <p>3rd, Studies and statistics have certain amounts of truth in them (and I accept your point about studies being subjective). But to reject studies blatantly, is tentamount to you telling me you do not believe in Science (Since Science uses observations and experiments and statistics to come to conclusions). This is perhaps something you yourself need to reflect, instead of me.</p>
              <p>I do not doubt the efficiency and productivity of Singapore (as what the study said). I have been to parts of the world where it takes days or weeks or months for someone to come back when you have issues with a product or service. Singapore is one of the fastest and most efficient countries in the world. I dare say even more efficient than USA. And who is at the core of this reputation? Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Finally, it's in your own delusion that you think I ever bothered whether you are a female or male. To me, a female and male has equal rights to debate issues, and never once did I bring gender into the picture to shut you up (kindly acknowledge that). It was you that started making comments about gender, of what you think of Singapore males.</p>
              <p>In fact, I rarely ever bother to find out the gender of each forum member here, coz it's not important, and everyone has an equal right to express themselves.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, are you having anti-Singapore sentiments due to your contempt with males, that you reject the notion that Singapore has top workers in productivity? Then I wonder if you ever ask yourself, are you a rebel, and are you THE WRONG rebel that you have come to despise, to regard Singaporeans with so much contempt?</p>
              <p>I am PROUD to be a Singaporean, and I am proud to fly the Singapore flag in another country, to continue spreading the Singapore brand. How about you?</p>

              <p>You are actually one of the forumers I like, coz your postings are logical, observant, and with much reflection.</p>
              <p>On the above, I just would like to comment, that probably the only woman whom I will compromise to, is my wife. But at most times, I would also debate with my wife, and most times we debate based on logic. Only at times when she becomes emotional, will I compromise. But there are times I am emotional as well...</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter the gender of who I debate with, so long as he or she can look at things logically and have the capability of observation and reflection.</p>
              <p>You cannot deny that there are male posters here that do not have much logic as well, and just keep posting nonsense until you do not know what to reply, right? (read lionnoisy and xtreyier)</p>

              <p>I have to correct you. You <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRIED</span> to answer the questions, but most 'answers', you skirted the issue. When I asked about justification of the leaders' pay for instance, and it's not wrong since taxpayers fund the leaders' pay (just as shareholders fund the CEO's pay), you instead answer why do they need to justify to me. And when I explained to you why there is a need to justify, you start off on another topic (who serve leaders...)</p>
              <p>In essence, your answers are much like the PAP's, always skirting around issues and not answering them (Becoz they don't have the answer), and attempting to cause even more confusion. It's not what an honest Govt will do, throwing smoke grenades and changing topics such as what you do.</p>
              <p>2nd, I presume you are outside of Singapore, seeing the way you view with contempt Singapore males, and the way you seemed to think that Singapore males like myself have not seen the world. On the contrary, I am also outside of Singapore, and I have worked in many parts of the world, so probably I would have seen the world as much as you. That is the reason why I can ask penetrating questions, questions that pro-PAP supporters cannot answer (and skirt the issue like you did)</p>
              <p>3rd, Studies and statistics have certain amounts of truth in them (and I accept your point about studies being subjective). But to reject studies blatantly, is tentamount to you telling me you do not believe in Science (Since Science uses observations and experiments and statistics to come to conclusions). This is perhaps something you yourself need to reflect, instead of me.</p>
              <p>I do not doubt the efficiency and productivity of Singapore (as what the study said). I have been to parts of the world where it takes days or weeks or months for someone to come back when you have issues with a product or service. Singapore is one of the fastest and most efficient countries in the world. I dare say even more efficient than USA. And who is at the core of this reputation? Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Finally, it's in your own delusion that you think I ever bothered whether you are a female or male. To me, a female and male has equal rights to debate issues, and never once did I bring gender into the picture to shut you up (kindly acknowledge that). It was you that started making comments about gender, of what you think of Singapore males.</p>
              <p>In fact, I rarely ever bother to find out the gender of each forum member here, coz it's not important, and everyone has an equal right to express themselves.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, are you having anti-Singapore sentiments due to your contempt with males, that you reject the notion that Singapore has top workers in productivity? Then I wonder if you ever ask yourself, are you a rebel, and are you THE WRONG rebel that you have come to despise, to regard Singaporeans with so much contempt?</p>
              <p>I am PROUD to be a Singaporean, and I am proud to fly the Singapore flag in another country, to continue spreading the Singapore brand. How about you?</p>

              <p>Dear parn,</p>
              <p>I have acknowledged your response, and as I said previously, I do not appreciate your answers, because you skirt issues, very much like what our govt does.</p>
              <p>And I have also acknowledged your point on studies being subjective, I have yet to see you acknowledge that never once did I bring gender into the picture to shut you up just coz I disagree with you. Appreciation goes both ways, so far, you have demanded, but you have not done it on your end.</p>
              <p>Some things I wish to correct you:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Studies <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ARE</span> a part of Science. An example, have you heard "Institute of Health <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Studies</span></strong>"? http://www.iihs.ca/index.htm</li>
              <li>I spoke about a study that ranked Singapore workers tops in productivity. You were the one who made comments about Singaporeans being not able to compete with foreigners, and then start 'advising' me not to believe such studies.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>By the way, I don't need your attention. If you feel you don't wish to debate, then just make your point known. I am here to debate and discuss issues with people. Attention is not something I need, since I am more than confident in what I do in my life, neither do I need to seek your attention, since I am not interested in whether you are a female or not.</p>
              <p>Kindly not allow gender hinder discussions. You should really look at your own words carefully.</p>

              <p><br>I think the problem lies with you because you do not know how to interact with others politely.</p>
              <p>If you have asked someone to answer your questions, say it nicely and there's no need to say things like "so far, nobody has dared to reply my questions". It's not necessary and only ended up making you sound arrogant about it.</p>
              <p>I saw your simple questions and I thought this is really nothing much to be arrogant about and certainly your attitude in that post is unnecessary if you are truly confident with yourself.</p>
              <p>And if you has asked someone to answer your questions, do not assume or even imagine yourself as the interrogator or even the teacher because you are the one with all the questions marks (???).</p>
              <p>Show some appreciation when someone bothers to spend some time to reply to your questions and be gracious and prepared to accept their opinions no matter how harsh or hurtful they may be. If you're not prepared to do so, by all means please keep your questions to yourself and do not behave in an ungrateful and unreasonable manner and start finding faults in other people's opinions. Remember, it's their opinions and not yours and it doesn't belong to you and neither do they owe you anything by helping you with your questions.</p>
              <p>Bottomline, respect other people's opinions if you had asked for their opinions. Show gratitude if someone bothers to give you some of their attention.</p>
              <p>If you are unable to do all that, and continue to be pushy and unreasonable in your attitude, then soon you will find nobody would want to help you out with your questions and nobody would even bother to waste their time on your posts.</p>
              <p>And I can guarantee it's definitely not because nobody dared to reply to your questions, but because you are have very poor understanding about how to have an effective interaction with other people. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>To cut short Rage's long winded questions, these are the main points he raised and assumes to claim seeking for answers.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">1.What is the 'justification' of <strong>high pay</strong> (?) for ministers?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">2.What is the 'justification' of <strong>'opening our doors SO FULLY'</strong>(?) to foriegn labour</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">3.What is the 'justification' of <strong>continous</strong> (?) cost of living?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">4.What is the 'justification' of telling <strong>40YRS OLD they are 'MORE STUPID?"(?)</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">5.What is the 'justification' <strong>OF INCREASES IN RENTAL</strong> for upgraded hawker centre rental?</span></p>
              <p>6.Rage is concerned with the <span style="color: #993300;"><strong>'suffering' </strong>of locals against <strong>MASSIVE INFLUX</strong>(?) <strong>OF FOREIGNERS</strong>, and losing national identity. </span></p>
              <p>7. Rage still dares claim he is <span style="color: #993300;">PROUD to be a Singaporean, and am proud to fly the Singapore flag in another country, to continue spreading the Singapore brand. </span></p>
              <p><br>8. And after what he had written, he even dares cite <span style="color: #993300;">some male posters as not having logic?</span></p>
              <p>No, there is no sense in debating with an egoistical fool like him.</p>
              <p><strong>He seeks not answers to his queries</strong>. He has <strong>NO </strong>intention of listening to others opinions, answers which had <strong>LONG</strong> been given both officially and unofficaily through media channels and even blogs.</p>
              <p>Every answer given would be <strong>'nonsense'</strong> or <strong>'skirting'</strong> to his mind that is already cast in stone.</p>
              <p>He had <strong>not</strong> shown any openess to others view, except that he is right, rational, intelligent and etc, and <strong>everyone else is wrong</strong>, proven by his numerous subjective and egoistical posts in reply to others<strong> who disagrees with him, and </strong>would not hesitate to deride them senselessly.</p>

              <p><br> I think the problem lies with you because you do not know how to
                      interact with others politely.</p>
              <p>If you have asked someone to answer your questions, say it
                      nicely and there's no need to say things like "so far, nobody has
                      dared to reply my questions". It's not necessary and only ended up
                      making you sound arrogant about it.</p>
              <p>I saw your simple questions and I thought this is really nothing
                      much to be arrogant about and certainly your attitude in that
                      post is unnecessary if you are truly confident with
                      yourself.</p>
              <p>And if you has asked someone to answer your questions, do not
                      assume or even imagine yourself as the interrogator or even
                      the teacher because you are the one with all the questions marks
                      (???).</p>
              <p>Show some appreciation when someone bothers to spend some time
                      to reply to your questions and be gracious and prepared to accept
                      their opinions no matter how harsh or hurtful they may be. If
                      you're not prepared to do so, by all means please keep your
                      questions to yourself and do not behave in an ungrateful and
                      unreasonable manner and start finding faults in other people's
                      opinions. Remember, it's their opinions and not yours and it
                      doesn't belong to you and neither do they owe you anything by
                      helping you with your questions.</p>
              <p>Bottomline, respect other people's opinions if you had asked for
                      their opinions. Show gratitude if someone bothers to give you some
                      of their attention.</p>
              <p>If you are unable to do all that, and continue to be pushy and
                      unreasonable in your attitude, then soon you will find nobody would
                      want to help you out with your questions and nobody would even
                      bother to waste their time on your posts.</p>
              <p>And I can guarantee it's definitely not because nobody dared to
                      reply to your questions, but because you are have very poor
                      understanding about how to have an effective interaction with
                      other people. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>*shrugs*, when you point a finger at me, watch out for those pointing back at yourself. Kindly look at how your posts generalize singapore males. If I am rude, I wonder what you are</p>
              <p>It's quite sad.</p>
              <p>If you cannot respect that a Singaporean male can discuss issues with you, then just be gamely to admit it, and not go round circles to make unreasonable conclusions.</p>
              <p>So far, I have not seen an act of logic from you, such as acknowledging that studies are a part of Science.</p>
              <p>I view you hopefully as someone who is sensible, not someone else who says "Statistics is NOT Science", and to date, has not admitted it, and is going around like a raging maniac in this forums</p>

              <p>To cut short Rage's long winded questions, these are the main points he raised and assumes to claim seeking for answers.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">1.What is the 'justification' of <strong>high pay</strong> (?) for ministers?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">2.What is the 'justification' of <strong>'opening our doors SO FULLY'</strong>(?) to foriegn labour</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">3.What is the 'justification' of <strong>continous</strong> (?) cost of living?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">4.What is the 'justification' of telling <strong>40YRS OLD they are 'MORE STUPID?"(?)</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">5.What is the 'justification' <strong>OF INCREASES IN RENTAL</strong> for upgraded hawker centre rental?</span></p>
              <p>6.Rage is concerned with the <span style="color: #993300;"><strong>'suffering'</strong> of locals against <strong>MASSIVE INFLUX</strong>(?) <strong>OF FOREIGNERS</strong>, and losing national identity.</span></p>
              <p>7. Rage still dares claim he is <span style="color: #993300;">PROUD to be a Singaporean, and am proud to fly the Singapore flag in another country, to continue spreading the Singapore brand.</span></p>
              <p><br>8. And after what he had written, he even dares cite <span style="color: #993300;">some male posters as not having logic?</span></p>
              <p>No, there is no sense in debating with an egoistical fool like him.</p>
              <p><strong>He seeks not answers to his queries</strong>. He has <strong>NO</strong> intention of listening to others opinions, answers which had <strong>LONG</strong> been given both officially and unofficaily through media channels and even blogs.</p>
              <p>Every answer given would be <strong>'nonsense'</strong> or <strong>'skirting'</strong> to his mind that is already cast in stone.</p>
              <p>He had <strong>not</strong> shown any openess to others view, except that he is right, rational, intelligent and etc, and <strong>everyone else is wrong</strong>, proven by his numerous subjective and egoistical posts in reply to others <strong>who disagrees with him, and</strong> would not hesitate to deride them senselessly.</p>
              <p>Is there any further point to even discuss, let alone debate?</p>
              <p>Nope, better let him live with his delusions, his <strong>Mahattiar styled tongue twisting</strong> 'chest thumping of being proud to be singaporean yet incapable of accepting society's harmony and acceptance thru our free vote for our national administrative policies.</p>

You write good compos but they are mostly shallow which shows that u do not use ur brain when typing.  (Or u do not have one). I still remember one of your posts which starts with sentence like this "A singaporean starts work at age 21 monthly pay $2000" just shows how shallow you are. You probably haven't started work outside and havent gone out to the real world just yet. Stop your personal attacks.  </p>
