Internal security and policing are far ahead of neighbouring states, but the escape of al Qaeda-linked militant Mas Selamat Kastari from prison was a lapse that showed security is not infallible. The port remains a key potential target, and an attack on it could cause global disruption. There is also the risk</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">will see the emergence of more home-grown militants who would be better able to evade internal security.<br><br>Key issues to watch:<br><br>-- Assessments of strength and tactics of Jemaah Islamiyah and its offshoots. Most analysts believe the main JI movement has abandoned attacks on civilian targets, while the a violent splinter group was badly weakened after the death of its leader Noordin Mohammad Top. If this changes, the threat could rise.<br><br>* POLITICAL CHANGE<br><br>As Singapore evolves, calls for a more open political system with greater diversity of views are likely to intensify.</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">'s restrictions on opposition activity and freedom of speech will also come under increasing scrutiny. Markets will be watching whether the ruling People's Action Party can manage the transition to greater openness smoothly, and find the appropriate balance between greater openness and continued stability.<br><br>Key issues to watch:<br><br>-- Any sign of growing social pressure for political change.<br><br>-- Government response to pressure for change. The government says it will amend the constitution ahead of the next general elections in early 2010, to allow more opposition representation. But the change is not expected to have a significant impact.<br><br>* CORRUPTION AND LACK OF TRANSPARENCY<br><br>Preferential treatment shown to government-linked firms is a source of resentment and may deter some foreign investment. And while</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">is regularly rated as one of the least corrupt countries in the world, there are concerns over the stunted nature of political debate, and a lack of transparency in some areas -- including the collapse of the plan to install Chip Goodyear to run Temasek in place of the prime minister's wife.<br><br>Key issues to watch:<br><br>-- Corruption rankings. Any sign that</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">is slipping in global corruption rankings would dent the investment attractiveness of the city state.<br><br>-- Government policies.

The issue is complicated by demographic issues -- the majority Chinese population is growing at a lower rate than minority Malays and Indians due to different birth rates, and the government has made repeated efforts to encourage citizens to have more children. Labour shortages mean the country has to rely on immigrant workers for many jobs.<br><br>Key issues to watch:<br><br>-- Any sharp rise of racial tensions or unrest. This is considered extremely unlikely.</span></p>

              <p>maybe you would like to enlighten the community by stating some of the examples what deed have they done in the past such that they have impacted you so much?  No they didnt do anything to me, I'm not hating them for anything in fact my family is wealthy and I live in a Terrace. I have $100K in savings at 26 (Am I considered an elite?) If I'm considered an elite, I should have supported the PAP to protect my self interests. But I just hope that Singaporeans would give them a reality check. If oppositions does not fare well in their jobs after they had emerged to the top, I believe singaporeans would recall back PAP. Btw, judging from your posts, I believe you work in the army?

              <h2>Why Do We Need 6.5 Million People?</h2>
              <p><strong>The Over-Population Problem</strong></p>
              <p>On 21st February 2008, a friend sent me an ST online forum letter written by Mr. Yong Koi Kwong on why Singapore should not become a 6.5 million city state.</p>
              <p>The writer said: <em>“Singapore is situated in a hot humid equatorial region. The average relative humidity is 80 per cent with a daily average temperature of 24 to 32 degrees Celcius for virtually the whole year. The average number of hours of sunshine is 5.5 to 6 hours. It is very unpleasant to live in such an environment if there is no natural ventilation to take away one’s perspiration. </em></p>
              <p><em>Our country is unique in that we are a sovereign city state with no countryside. Only half the land could be built up (including about 12 per cent for roads). The rest of the country is occupied by military training grounds, central catchment area, 17 reservoirs and golf courses and five airports or airfields and two naval bases. </em></p>
              <p><em>In spite of our relentless land reclamation for the last 40-odd years which grew our country to the present area of about 700 sq km and a projected area of 780 sq km, Singapore would be the most densely populated country with 12,800 persons per sq km of habitable area if the population is projected to grow to 5 million. If the population is planned for 6.5 million, the average number of persons per sq km is 16,640.”</em></p>
              <p><em>He concluded, “We could live with the accolade such as the busiest port, best run airline and airport but the accolade that we are the densest populated sovereign state is one which we could live without.”</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The consequences of high density</strong></p>
              <p>Well said! I wonder why such a well-researched letter with good arguments should be consigned to the online forum. The printed version would have allowed all Singaporeans to ponder over the problem and debate on it. It would also show that good ideas for the country need not come from highly-paid officials, policy-makers or scholars.</p>
              <p>Any research scientist who has studied rats in an overpopulated situation will tell you that over-crowding is not a good thing for those rodents. They suffer from infectious diseases, become violent (they even form gangs), most become withdrawn, passive and some mount male and female rats indiscriminately.</p>
              <p>Of course rats are not human beings but the biological needs for space and resources is a common demoninator influencing both human and rat behaviour.</p>
              <p>William Cobett said, “Jails, barracks, factories in 1820s do not corrupt by their walls but by their condensed numbers. Populous cities corrupt for the same cause.”</p>
              <p>So what should citizens expect when Singapore becomes over-populated? We must expect noise levels to be increased, more traffic congestion and more pollution from smoke emission and waste. Singaporeans must put up with having to manoeuvre through crowds in public areas, long queues for a lot of services and the squeeze on public transport. There will be very little space for fun and recreation as all these places will be packed during the weekends. Trying to get across the Causeway during the weekends will take many more hours than now.</p>
              <p>On the health side, the control of an outbreak of infectious diseases in a dense population will spread easily and be harder to manage.</p>
              <p>Over-crowding also reduces fertility and causes stress-related diseases like ulcers, enlarged adrenals, chronic heart disease and mental illness.</p>
              <p>On the social side, there will be a higher rate of crimes, drug abuses, suicides, accidents and juvenile delinquency.</p>
              <p>In a situation where resources, including jobs and space become scarce, the weak and the minorities will suffer.</p>
              <p>Moreover, when the numbers to make up the population target is achieved through importing foreigners, then the friction will end up along ethnic lines. An intolerable living density will push those better qualified Singaporeans to emigrate and thus increase the ratio of foreigners to citizens.</p>
              <p>We have been trying very hard over the years to build social cohesion through many activities that promote racial harmony and through community activities like singing national day songs. All these will be undone when good Singaporeans leave and they are replaced by foreigners. It is not hard to imagine the day when the economic clout will fall into the hands of the foreigners and the key positions in the various corporations will be in the hands of non-Singaporeans because good Singaporeans become scarce. When such a time comes, the ordinary Singaporeans will be no better than a colonized people, with their lives dictated by some global nomads.</p>
              <p><strong>Why cities thrive</strong></p>
              <p>Cities grow and die. They die when they outgrow themselves. They die when they stagnate and lose their vitality. They die when their inhabitants no longer care.</p>
              <p>For Singapore, because the city is also the country, this means that, if the city dies, the country perishes as well. This was probably why the island of Temasek decayed and sunk into near-oblivion in the 14th Century until Stamford Raffles re-discovered it in 1819.</p>
              <p>So why do our planners want to turn our city-state into a population of 6.5 million? Are they just thinking of economic growth without considering the side-effects of an over-crowded city? Are our citizens just digits and robots?</p>
              <p>Major cities in the world have no problem because the sizes of their countries allow their people to commute 150km to 200km to and fro from work. They can live outside the city. In Singapore, if you drive more than 50km in a straight line, you’ll end up in the sea.</p>
              <p>The health and life of a city is not in its great number of people but on the quality of its people. When people become apprehensive, apathetic and live like over-crowded rats, the city loses its vibrancy and begins to stagnate.</p>
              <p>A city needs to rejuvenate, transform and re-create itself continually in order to stay healthy and alive. How can an over-crowded place with all the ills of high density be able to do that? What more if the population is already stifled by an overbearing political climate, which has caused apathy, to start with?</p>
              <p>At the moment, Singapore is a fairly clean and safe city. It is still physically a comfortable and convenient place to live in. However, once the population goes over an optimum level, it may not be that clean, safe or comfortable.</p>
              <p>It is a mistake to think that the higher the density, the better the economic growth and the more vibrant a city will become. It would be a mistake to think that by just focusing on the physical aspects, we will become a great global city.</p>
              <p>A great global city must not just be a comfortable and convenient place to live. It must also be a great place to live, a satisfying place to work and an interesting place to play in. There must be life, energy and a soul. And what gives a great global city this verve and vitality is the drive and enthusiasm of the people who reside in it -– the energy of its own people supplemented by the boost from good imports.</p>
              <p>What is the point of having a good physical environment, many great buildings with beautiful architecture and the most advanced technological infrastructures if our people do not have the drive and enthusiasm? If the people are apathetic and selfish, whether as a result of a stifling political climate or a extremely dense population, the city will be as listless as a sparkling shopping centre that has rude and disinterested staff.</p>
              <p><strong>The People Factor</strong></p>
              <p>The people factor is, therefore, the most important ingredient in the making of a great global city. A city that is a city-state can only be vibrant if there are enough citizens to lead changes, to create and to innovate.</p>
              <p>New York, London and Hong Kong are examples of such a city. In the January 28th 2008 issue of Time magazine, these three cities, collectively known as Ny.lon.kong, were given the credit of driving the global economy. They are places where new ideas and new concepts are always hatching. They are fast and lively because of the people and not the skyscrapers.</p>
              <p>Tricia Haynes, former inhabitant of New York wrote, “New Yorkers are the most vociferous people on earth. In New York everyone has a voice and everyone feels entitled to exercise it.” This is what makes New York throb and why it is able to attract “the ambitious, the flamboyant and those who want a slice of the action”.</p>
              <p>A city that reverberates with verve and energy rejuvenates itself and acts as a magnet for people and ideas.</p>
              <p>Singapore, therefore, needs to change if we are going to compete effectively against the likes of these three cities. As long as our people are tuned to act on cues from above and conditioned to move like a herd, then we can never hope to see Singaporeans experimenting and exploring new frontiers.</p>
              <p>When we were a third world country, the opposition PAP complained about a biased press. When we were in Malaysia, the opposition PAP complained about a controlled press. Now that we have become a 1st world country, the PAP no longer complains about the local press. In fact they now feel that a free press is not the answer to all of a country’s development problems.</p>
              <p>To bolster this argument, countries with rampant corruption and poverty are held up as examples of what we might become with a free press. Of course, the countries with growth and lesser corruption and a free press are not mentioned, for example, New York, London and Hong Kong — the cities held up for praise in the Time lead article.</p>
              <p>New York is full of critics and investigative reporters and people demonstrate in Central Park for all sorts of reason. It has a free press.</p>
              <p>Likewise for London. It has its full share of critical reporters. The press remains free.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong is very Asian and belongs to China but yet the people demonstrate at the slightest unhappiness. The boisterous media are very jealous in protecting their press freedom and yet this has not reduced Hong Kong to poverty.</p>
              <p>A free press and democracy have not reduced these places into penury. Why then are we so afraid of getting Singapore to join the Ny.lon.kong League? Why are we still reluctant to let our citizens have the space to create and work and nurture a conducive environment for them to have a voice and feel entitled to express it?</p>
              <p>The three model cities are ahead of us because they allow diversity in the physical environment, in economic activities, in the social settings and, more importantly, in the area of ideas and thoughts.</p>
              <p>Diversity is the engine of life and spontaneity in a city. According to Jane Jacobs, a writer, activist, and city aficionado, cities need “a most intricate and closed-grained diversity of uses that give each other constant mutual support, both economically and socially.”</p>
              <p>Furthermore, “cities are natural generators of diversity and prolific incubators of new enterprises and ideas of all kinds. They are the natural economic homes of immense numbers and ranges of small enterprises.”</p>
              <p>As a city-state, Singaporeans have no choice but to try and make Singapore a truly great global city if they want to survive. At the same time the government has a responsibility to provide our citizens the conducive environment and the right climate for physical, economic, social, cultural and political diversities to attain it.</p>
              <p>It is not just the numbers that count. It is the quality of the people. The people must feel free and motivated. They must feel, and be manifestly shown, that this country belongs to them.</p>

              <h2 class="post-title-single">How To Send In The Army In Case PAP Loses The Election</h2>
              <div class="post-entry">
              <p><a href="http://temasekreview.com/?p=12907"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #546188;">Apparently Catherine Lim asked Minister Mentor</span></span></a> whether the military would be sent in on the really slim chance that the PAP loses an election.</p>
              <p><a href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=4512"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #546188;">Minister Mentor’s answe</span></span></a>r makes sense. His answer is reproduced below.</p>
              <p>Some thoughts. If the government is really messed up and incompetent, I’m pretty sure the PAP would be able to come back into power lawfully after 1 cycle.</p>
              <p>However, even if the new opposition isn’t really messed up and incompetent, there are my ways the PAP can indirectly fuck up the new government to make them look like idiots.</p>
              <p>Let’s talk about the people in the civil service, the President and the people who work for him. To me, it is human nature to be loyal to the people who were in power when you gained power.</p>
              <p>The PAP has been in power for a long time. Let’s just say that the PAP can ask the funeral parlour owner for many many favors.</p>
              <p>Is this corruption? No. Don’t be silly. It is human.</p>
              <p>It is also human to mistrust new authorities. We had that problem when a new PC took over our platoon. Do I trust him? Do i follow the SOPs set by the old PC, SOPs that worked?</p>
              <p>It takes time to build the guanxi. 5 years might be too little time to get the mojo going. Not too hard for the old leader to tell the follower not to follow the new leader.</p>
              <p>For those with aspirations to be dictators in Singapore, the males have been so well-trained that Catherine Lim’s question is moot and that a coup can be done as easy as saying ABC.</p>
              <p>If the PAP really wanted to do something after a freak election, just get the military to do a SAF-wide activation. All the males have been well-trained in mobilization and will return to their camps to report. Just keep the males there. Confiscate mobile phones upon report. Tell the males to gather at the parade square and prepare store for moving out. Don’t actually need to move out.</p>
              <p>Trust me, most of the Singapore males will not miss a mobilization exercise. Maybe, they might get an inkling that it is a coup happening. But no one will not dare go back. Why? Cos the male will say this to himself, ‘if i don’t go back, and the new government topples, I will be charged for AWOL. Ok… better go back’.</p>
              <p>Now, before I end, I must say this. The ministers in our government do have connections with the military. Come on, look at some of their ranks. It would be naive to think that they cannot push the current officers in the SAF to do what they want them to do if they really wanted them to do something.</p>
              <p>And one final note, the only thing saving us from these sort of shenanigans is that we currently have decent men in our government. But they won’t be there forever, and we as a nation better do something to ensure that when wolves do get in, they can’t fuck us up.</p>
              <p>Which if you look at Minister Mentor’s answer, is something our current leaders have been trying to do. I pray they have done enough.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>You look at our record and the moves we’ve made. Let me put it simply like this. First, we maintain a system which gives any opposition the opportunity to displace us peacefully. We allow the system: we’ve not interfered with the civil service, the judiciary, parliamentary procedures, the police and so on.</p>
              <p><br>If you can win an election, so be it. If at some point we are not able to find a team which can equal an opposition team, on that day we deserve to be out. If we become corrupt, inefficient, can’t deliver, we’re out.</p>
              <p><br>What if we have a freak election, as we may well have? Many voters say openly: ‘In my family, three of us voted for you but two voted against, just to let you know that we want an opposition voice.’ In that situation, you may have a freak result. That worries me.</p>
              <p><br>So we’ve set in place a President with blocking powers. Any opposition that comes in will find that he cannot touch the reserves, otherwise you can promise the sky and spend the money. And all our hard-earned savings will go in five years.</p>
              <p><br>Second, you cannot change the top officials without the President’s consent. Any raiding of the funds must be approved by the President who has a council of presidential advisers to advise him yes or no.</p>
              <p><br>Now, why should we do all these if we expect to overturn an election?<br>We expect that if we are voted out, to stay out, and hope that within one term, that new government, incompetent and unable to deliver, will be out. And there’s enough core competencies and the funds to enable a fresh PAP government to revive the system.</p>
              <p><br>I spent 15 years thinking about these safeguards and finally persuaded my younger colleagues that we needed these because they can’t guarantee that each time they will produce a better team than the opposition just because you’ve done so in the past.</p>
              <p><br>I don’t see any problem in the next election, and probably the election after that. But if we don’t get a good team in the election after that and the opposition does get a good team together, we’re at risk.</p>
              <p><br>One of the first lessons I learnt in politics was from Harold Laski. He said if you don’t have a system that allows fundamental change by consent, you will have a revolution by violence. If we block all possibilities, we must expect violence. In that violence, eventually the army won’t shoot because you are in the wrong. That’s what happens in Africa, the army goes in and holds up the president and often shoots him.</p>
              <p><br>If we had not these thoughts at the back of our minds, why do we do these things? Just to bluff the people? Doesn’t make sense. An army commander, air force or police, has to be approved by a committee and the President must agree. Why? Because we will appoint the commanders? No, because a stupid government will do the wrong things and when we return, we may find the whole machinery has collapsed, as often is the case. Simple.</p>

              <h2>Why Do We Need 6.5 Million People?</h2>
              <p><strong>The Over-Population Problem</strong></p>
              <p>On 21st February 2008, a friend sent me an ST online forum letter written by Mr. Yong Koi Kwong on why Singapore should not become a 6.5 million city state.</p>
              <p>The writer said: <em>“Singapore is situated in a hot humid equatorial region. The average relative humidity is 80 per cent with a daily average temperature of 24 to 32 degrees Celcius for virtually the whole year. The average number of hours of sunshine is 5.5 to 6 hours. It is very unpleasant to live in such an environment if there is no natural ventilation to take away one’s perspiration.</em></p>
              <p><em>Our country is unique in that we are a sovereign city state with no countryside. Only half the land could be built up (including about 12 per cent for roads). The rest of the country is occupied by military training grounds, central catchment area, 17 reservoirs and golf courses and five airports or airfields and two naval bases.</em></p>
              <p><em>In spite of our relentless land reclamation for the last 40-odd years which grew our country to the present area of about 700 sq km and a projected area of 780 sq km, Singapore would be the most densely populated country with 12,800 persons per sq km of habitable area if the population is projected to grow to 5 million. If the population is planned for 6.5 million, the average number of persons per sq km is 16,640.”</em></p>
              <p><em>He concluded, “We could live with the accolade such as the busiest port, best run airline and airport but the accolade that we are the densest populated sovereign state is one which we could live without.”</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The consequences of high density</strong></p>
              <p>Well said! I wonder why such a well-researched letter with good arguments should be consigned to the online forum. The printed version would have allowed all Singaporeans to ponder over the problem and debate on it. It would also show that good ideas for the country need not come from highly-paid officials, policy-makers or scholars.</p>
              <p>Any research scientist who has studied rats in an overpopulated situation will tell you that over-crowding is not a good thing for those rodents. They suffer from infectious diseases, become violent (they even form gangs), most become withdrawn, passive and some mount male and female rats indiscriminately.</p>
              <p>Of course rats are not human beings but the biological needs for space and resources is a common demoninator influencing both human and rat behaviour.</p>
              <p>William Cobett said, “Jails, barracks, factories in 1820s do not corrupt by their walls but by their condensed numbers. Populous cities corrupt for the same cause.”</p>
              <p>So what should citizens expect when Singapore becomes over-populated? We must expect noise levels to be increased, more traffic congestion and more pollution from smoke emission and waste. Singaporeans must put up with having to manoeuvre through crowds in public areas, long queues for a lot of services and the squeeze on public transport. There will be very little space for fun and recreation as all these places will be packed during the weekends. Trying to get across the Causeway during the weekends will take many more hours than now.</p>
              <p>On the health side, the control of an outbreak of infectious diseases in a dense population will spread easily and be harder to manage.</p>
              <p>Over-crowding also reduces fertility and causes stress-related diseases like ulcers, enlarged adrenals, chronic heart disease and mental illness.</p>
              <p>On the social side, there will be a higher rate of crimes, drug abuses, suicides, accidents and juvenile delinquency.</p>
              <p>In a situation where resources, including jobs and space become scarce, the weak and the minorities will suffer.</p>
              <p>Moreover, when the numbers to make up the population target is achieved through importing foreigners, then the friction will end up along ethnic lines. An intolerable living density will push those better qualified Singaporeans to emigrate and thus increase the ratio of foreigners to citizens.</p>
              <p>We have been trying very hard over the years to build social cohesion through many activities that promote racial harmony and through community activities like singing national day songs. All these will be undone when good Singaporeans leave and they are replaced by foreigners. It is not hard to imagine the day when the economic clout will fall into the hands of the foreigners and the key positions in the various corporations will be in the hands of non-Singaporeans because good Singaporeans become scarce. When such a time comes, the ordinary Singaporeans will be no better than a colonized people, with their lives dictated by some global nomads.</p>
              <p><strong>Why cities thrive</strong></p>
              <p>Cities grow and die. They die when they outgrow themselves. They die when they stagnate and lose their vitality. They die when their inhabitants no longer care.</p>
              <p>For Singapore, because the city is also the country, this means that, if the city dies, the country perishes as well. This was probably why the island of Temasek decayed and sunk into near-oblivion in the 14th Century until Stamford Raffles re-discovered it in 1819.</p>
              <p>So why do our planners want to turn our city-state into a population of 6.5 million? Are they just thinking of economic growth without considering the side-effects of an over-crowded city? Are our citizens just digits and robots?</p>
              <p>Major cities in the world have no problem because the sizes of their countries allow their people to commute 150km to 200km to and fro from work. They can live outside the city. In Singapore, if you drive more than 50km in a straight line, you’ll end up in the sea.</p>
              <p>The health and life of a city is not in its great number of people but on the quality of its people. When people become apprehensive, apathetic and live like over-crowded rats, the city loses its vibrancy and begins to stagnate.</p>
              <p>A city needs to rejuvenate, transform and re-create itself continually in order to stay healthy and alive. How can an over-crowded place with all the ills of high density be able to do that? What more if the population is already stifled by an overbearing political climate, which has caused apathy, to start with?</p>
              <p>At the moment, Singapore is a fairly clean and safe city. It is still physically a comfortable and convenient place to live in. However, once the population goes over an optimum level, it may not be that clean, safe or comfortable.</p>
              <p>It is a mistake to think that the higher the density, the better the economic growth and the more vibrant a city will become. It would be a mistake to think that by just focusing on the physical aspects, we will become a great global city.</p>
              <p>A great global city must not just be a comfortable and convenient place to live. It must also be a great place to live, a satisfying place to work and an interesting place to play in. There must be life, energy and a soul. And what gives a great global city this verve and vitality is the drive and enthusiasm of the people who reside in it -– the energy of its own people supplemented by the boost from good imports.</p>
              <p>What is the point of having a good physical environment, many great buildings with beautiful architecture and the most advanced technological infrastructures if our people do not have the drive and enthusiasm? If the people are apathetic and selfish, whether as a result of a stifling political climate or a extremely dense population, the city will be as listless as a sparkling shopping centre that has rude and disinterested staff.</p>
              <p><strong>The People Factor</strong></p>
              <p>The people factor is, therefore, the most important ingredient in the making of a great global city. A city that is a city-state can only be vibrant if there are enough citizens to lead changes, to create and to innovate.</p>
              <p>New York, London and Hong Kong are examples of such a city. In the January 28th 2008 issue of Time magazine, these three cities, collectively known as Ny.lon.kong, were given the credit of driving the global economy. They are places where new ideas and new concepts are always hatching. They are fast and lively because of the people and not the skyscrapers.</p>
              <p>Tricia Haynes, former inhabitant of New York wrote, “New Yorkers are the most vociferous people on earth. In New York everyone has a voice and everyone feels entitled to exercise it.” This is what makes New York throb and why it is able to attract “the ambitious, the flamboyant and those who want a slice of the action”.</p>
              <p>A city that reverberates with verve and energy rejuvenates itself and acts as a magnet for people and ideas.</p>
              <p>Singapore, therefore, needs to change if we are going to compete effectively against the likes of these three cities. As long as our people are tuned to act on cues from above and conditioned to move like a herd, then we can never hope to see Singaporeans experimenting and exploring new frontiers.</p>
              <p>When we were a third world country, the opposition PAP complained about a biased press. When we were in Malaysia, the opposition PAP complained about a controlled press. Now that we have become a 1st world country, the PAP no longer complains about the local press. In fact they now feel that a free press is not the answer to all of a country’s development problems.</p>
              <p>To bolster this argument, countries with rampant corruption and poverty are held up as examples of what we might become with a free press. Of course, the countries with growth and lesser corruption and a free press are not mentioned, for example, New York, London and Hong Kong — the cities held up for praise in the Time lead article.</p>
              <p>New York is full of critics and investigative reporters and people demonstrate in Central Park for all sorts of reason. It has a free press.</p>
              <p>Likewise for London. It has its full share of critical reporters. The press remains free.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong is very Asian and belongs to China but yet the people demonstrate at the slightest unhappiness. The boisterous media are very jealous in protecting their press freedom and yet this has not reduced Hong Kong to poverty.</p>
              <p>A free press and democracy have not reduced these places into penury. Why then are we so afraid of getting Singapore to join the Ny.lon.kong League? Why are we still reluctant to let our citizens have the space to create and work and nurture a conducive environment for them to have a voice and feel entitled to express it?</p>
              <p>The three model cities are ahead of us because they allow diversity in the physical environment, in economic activities, in the social settings and, more importantly, in the area of ideas and thoughts.</p>
              <p>Diversity is the engine of life and spontaneity in a city. According to Jane Jacobs, a writer, activist, and city aficionado, cities need “a most intricate and closed-grained diversity of uses that give each other constant mutual support, both economically and socially.”</p>
              <p>Furthermore, “cities are natural generators of diversity and prolific incubators of new enterprises and ideas of all kinds. They are the natural economic homes of immense numbers and ranges of small enterprises.”</p>
              <p>As a city-state, Singaporeans have no choice but to try and make Singapore a truly great global city if they want to survive. At the same time the government has a responsibility to provide our citizens the conducive environment and the right climate for physical, economic, social, cultural and political diversities to attain it.</p>
              <p>It is not just the numbers that count. It is the quality of the people. The people must feel free and motivated. They must feel, and be manifestly shown, that this country belongs to them.</p>

              <div>
              <p>On 2 Sept 2009, I was one of the guests at a dinner to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. During the dialogue session, I asked Minister Mentor a question about a certain possible, though not probable, political scenario that had intrigued me for years. Suppose a freak election took place; what would the PAP do? Would MM send in the army? By way of softening the rather controversial nature of the question, I made sure there was a friendly, humorous preamble. So I addressed MM thus: ‘Some years ago I was giving a talk to some British businessmen, giving my usual spiel about Singapore politics, civic liberties,etc. During the question and answer session,one of the businessmen raised his hand and said, ‘ I’ve a question, or rather a suggestion. Why don’t you give us your Lee Kuan Yew, and we give you in exchange our Tony Blair, with Cherie Blair thrown in?’ I replied, ‘Mr Lee won’t like your noisy, messy, rambunctious democracy.’ He said, ‘No matter’, and went on to remark that if there were but five Lee Kuan Yews scattered throughout Africa, the continent wouldn’t be in such a direful state today. After this light-hearted sharing, I have a question: Sir, in the event of a serious threat of a freak election, would you do the unthinkable, that is, send in the army?’</p>
              <p>Reproduced below is the report in The Straits Times the following day on both my question (minus the preamble) and MM’s answer, exemplifying, once again, the hard-headed, no-nonsense PAP pragmatism, and the inimitable trenchancy of style that we have come to associate with Lee Kuan Yew:</p>
              <hr>
              <p>AT YESTERDAY’S dialogue, <strong>writer Catherine Lim</strong> posed MM Lee this question: ‘Sir, in the event of a serious threat of a freak election, would you do the unthinkable, that is, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">send in the army</span></strong>?’ This is an edited extract from Mr Lee’s reply:</p>
              <p>‘You look at our record and the moves we’ve made. Let me put it simply like this. First, we maintain a system which gives any opposition the opportunity to displace us peacefully. We allow the system: we’ve not interfered with the civil service, the judiciary, parliamentary procedures, the police and so on.</p>
              <p>If you can win an election, so be it. If at some point we are not able to find a team which can equal an opposition team, on that day we deserve to be out. If we become corrupt, inefficient, can’t deliver, we’re out.</p>
              <p>What if we have a freak election, as we may well have? Many voters say openly: ‘In my family, three of us voted for you but two voted against, just to let you know that we want an opposition voice.’ In that situation, you may have a freak result. That worries me.</p>
              <p>So we’ve set in place a President with blocking powers. Any opposition that comes in will find that he cannot touch the reserves, otherwise you can promise the sky and spend the money. And all our hard-earned savings will go in five years.</p>
              <p>Second, you cannot change the top officials without the President’s consent. Any raiding of the funds must be approved by the President who has a council of presidential advisers to advise him yes or no.</p>
              <p>Now, why should we do all these if we expect to overturn an election?</p>
              <p>We expect that if we are voted out, to stay out, and hope that within one term, that new government, incompetent and unable to deliver, will be out. And there’s enough core competencies and the funds to enable a fresh PAP government to revive the system.</p>
              <p>I spent 15 years thinking about these safeguards and finally persuaded my younger colleagues that we needed these because they can’t guarantee that each time they will produce a better team than the opposition just because you’ve done so in the past.</p>
              <p>I don’t see any problem in the next election, and probably the election after that. But if we don’t get a good team in the election after that and the opposition does get a good team together, we’re at risk.</p>
              <p>One of the first lessons I learnt in politicswas from Harold Laski. He said if you don’t have a system that allows fundamental change by consent, you will have a revolution by violence. If we block all possibilities, we must expect violence. In that violence, eventually the army won’t shoot because you are in the wrong. That’s what happens in Africa, the army goes in and holds up the president and often shoots him.</p>
              <p>If we had not these thoughts at the back of our minds, why do we do these things? Just to bluff the people? Doesn’t make sense. An army commander, air force or police, has to be approved by a committee and the President must agree. Why? Because we will appoint the commanders? No, because a stupid government will do the wrong things and when we return, we may find the whole machinery has collapsed, as often is the case. Simple.</p>

              <p>Why Singapore needs to have elected opposition MPs in parliament and not token representation</p>
              <p><span class="time">December 14, 2009</span></p>
              <p>The “reforms” introduced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to allow up to 18 non-PAP MPs in parliament as NMPs and NCMPs in the next general election is nothing more than a gimmick to satisfy rising demands from Singaporeans to have more alternative voices in the august chamber. It is akin to giving a child throwing tantrums a candy to shut him up.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should not be deceived again by such juvenile antics from the ruling party to entrench itself in power for token opposition without a grassroots base in parliament is no threat at all to its political hegemony.</p>
              <p>In the first place, the PAP still retains its traditional two-thirds majority in parliament which enables it to ram down unpopular policies down our throats without consulting the people. (remember GST hike, salary hike for ministers, casinos and the large number of foreigers flooding our shores?)</p>
              <p>In other words, while the non-PAP MPs are allowed to voice “alternative” views to the establishment in parliament, they are hugely ineffectual and will have minimal impact on the policy-making process.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, it may hamper the opposition’s chances in the next election as it gives Singaporeans less incentives to vote for the opposition now that they are able to enter parliament as a “best loser” NCMP even if they lose the election.</p>
              <p>What Singapore really need is genuine political competition on a level playing field which enables its citizens to toss out non-performing and unpopular ministers from office.</p>
              <p>Though the PAP has done much good for Singapore, it is not entitled to govern forever. Under a democratic system, all political parties should have equal chances of winning power so long they have the support of the people.</p>
              <p>The PAP will not feel threaten by having more non-PAP MPs in parliament since they still call the shots. The status quo will remain and nothing will ever change.</p>
              <p>Some PAP apologists have been going around applauding Prime Minister Lee’s move to “open” the political space for debate by allowing more non-PAP MPs in parliament via the NMP and NCMP routes.</p>
              <p>One YPAP member and new citizen from India Mr Fredric Fanthome claimed that this was “unheard of” anywhere in the world.</p>
              <p>Yes, nowhere in the world do we have a country which is synonymous with the party which manipulates the system to suit its own partisan interests in flagrant disregard for the Constitution, a sham democracy when the opposition is so weak and divided that the ruling party has to “appoint” them into parliament because they are unable to win a seat on their own.</p>
              <p>Without a constituency of their own, opposition MPs are deprived of a grassroots base to build up their party as well as to better understand the concerns of Singaporeans on the ground.</p>
              <p>Unlike the PAP losing candidate for Potong Pasir Sitoh Yi Pin who is still able to conduct his own “Meet-the-People” sessions in the constituency, NCMPs are unable to do so.</p>
              <p>During the dinner bash held last Saturday at Potong Pasir to commemorate Mr Chiam See Tong’s 25 MPs as a MP, he was swarmed by residents the moment he appeared with many clamoring to shake his hands.</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam’s popularity and rapport with his residents is built up slowly over time. It would not be possible if he did not win his first five-year term as a MP. There are currently no other avenues for NCMPs and NMPs to reach out to the people.</p>
              <p>Political parties in Singapore have to depend heavily on grassroots support for funds, manpower and other resources especially during election time.</p>
              <p>Without first securing a base to begin with, it will be difficult if not impossible for the opposition to build up its strength and support thereby putting themselves forever at a disadvantage as compared to the ruling party which is able to mobilize the grassroots organizations to serve its interests.</p>
              <p>The opposition will also be unable to prove their worth and capabilities which will further perpetuate the erroneous public impression that only the ruling party has the means and experience to run a Town Council well.</p>
              <p>Only when there is a real threat of a government losing power will it be bothered to sit up and listen attentively to the concerns of the people and implement pro-citizen policies instead of unpopular ones.</p>
              <p>Eighteen non-PAP MPs in parliament will never be able to exert the same amount of political pressure as half the number of opposition MPs.</p>
              <p>Why is this so?</p>
              <p>Because the NMPs are appointed on a two-yearly basis and the NCMPs do not have a base of their own to increase their ground support and national profile.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, voting in nine opposition MPs will change the political landscape radically. They will be able to show the people both inside and outside the parliament what they are capable of and provide a alternative to the ruling party.</p>
              <p>The government will have to think twice before talking down to Singaporeans or taking them for granted again because the nine opposition MPs can hold them accountable in parliament and if it is not careful, the number may increase in the next election which can even threaten their positions.</p>
              <p>For example, the Malaysian government has become more attuned to the needs of the ethnic minorities only after losing its two-third majority during the 2008 elections.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak said in his inauguration speech that the era of ”government knows best” is gone and he would listen more to the people. </p>
              <p>Recently, a minister called ex-premier Dr Mahathir the ”father of racism” for continuing to defend the controversial BTN course which many had decried as being racist.</p>
              <p>These developments would be unimaginable before the 2008 political tsunami which changed the face of Malaysia politics forever. The ruling Barisan Nasional coalition is aware that if it is not careful enough, it will be booted out of office by the opposition in the next election.</p>
              <p>In many first-world democracies, the opposition is merely a “government-in-waiting” and it provides the people a real choice as to whom they want to lead them.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans need to lend more support to the opposition so that talented people will step forward to join them. With a credible opposition in place, we will not need laughable rules to “guarantee” 18 non-PAP MPs in parliament.</p>
