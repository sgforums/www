              <p>Having observed and analysed the many political or pore people-related issues and the outcomes, I have learnt what the pore is. The core of the system.</p>
              <p>Is it not clear?</p>
              <p>Tell me a person still cannot see this aspect?</p>

              <p>Total transparency is what i call it - I can see it clearly now the rain is gone.</p>
              <p>I can see the pore totally as clearly as a piece of transparency.</p>

              <p><br>Like what Francis Seow said "that's sad for Singapore", that we have to have an authoritarian like him to dictate everything, even all the Ministers being paid millions are not worth anything. All lack brains and testicular function. Does the intelligence of one surpass the intelligence of many? <strong>ä¸‰ä¸ªè‡­çš®åŒ èƒœè¿‡ä¸€ä¸ªè¯¸è‘›äº®</strong></p>
              <p>When I was young I read about he Marxist plot, but it seems like there is more than meets the eye; because we are so often affected by what we read in the newspapers, we often succumb to it's propaganda perpetuated by the ruling regime.</p>
              <p>A person with lose morals with integrity lacking will often relent to the vagaries of power once acquired.</p>

              <p>In fact, most countries in the first world don't. I don't think there's any leader in the first world countries going round suing anyone opposing them to bandruptcy or keep changing the law to suppress the opposition.</p>
              <p>So you mean as a leader of PAP, it is best to shut out the opposition voice? Then why bother to have GE? And what the parliment for? For wayang?  The PAP can just decide everything and then announce to public. No need MP, no need GE, just need MIW. Will be saving money also.</p>

              <p><br> Should we or should we not wait for a time when singapore can
              produce an opposition party capable of out-manauvering the PAP by
              their sheer ability and talent to do so, or should we throw the
              opposition into power without thinking if they can run the country
              better than the PAP?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After all, throwing in a party that may not run the country well
              may ensure that any future hope for a opposition will be
              extinguished. It could be possible for the people to be so pissed
              with a new party terrible running of the country, that it destroy
              any trust the people have in the opposition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should we think in the long term, or the short term?</p>

              <p>I never said that the opposition should take over but there should be more opposition MPs to represent us instead (pls scroll up and read my post again).</p>
              <p>The current situation is where the PAP MPs are putting up a big wayang show during every parliamental debate.</p>

              <p><br>You tell me, which government in the world don't suppress their oppositions??? And if that govern dun do it, i think most probably they will be gone in no time.</p>

              <p>Put yourself in the position as leader of PAP, are you going to tell the opposition to join in debate, share idealogies, free to speak your mind seminars and allow them to speak to public bad about you????...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not saying that PAP is good or the best, but they are good in stopping opposition, and that is what politics is all about, you cannot blame them. If let say worker party wins and govern singapore, do you think they are going to allow PAP (became opposition) freedom of speech on bad stuff about them??</p>
