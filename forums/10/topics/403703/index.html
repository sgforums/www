              <p>Since
               her marriage to the 59-year-old Singaporean tobacco tycoon in 1996, 
              talks of Gong Li's marriage being on the rocks have been rife.</p>
              <p>The
               couple is rarely seen together in public and rumors of her hooking up 
              co-star John Cusack while filming on the set of <em>Shanghai</em> added 
              fuel to the fire.</p>
              <p>In Singapore recently to promote her movie, <em>Shanghai</em>,
               the actress confessed that although her in-laws have a place in 
              Singapore, she usually stays in hotels when she visits the country. The 
              star declined to offer a reason for that.</p>
              <p>In 2008, Gong Li 
              obtained Singapore citizenship; the move caused uproar among Chinese 
              netizens, with some even branding her a 'traitor'. During the interview,
               the actress explained the reason for her naturalization.</p>
              <p>"I took 
              up citizenship simply because of my family. I think this is something 
              very natural and since we're all Chinese, I don't see a problem with 
              that."</p>
              <p>When asked if the term 'family' referred to her husband and
               in-laws, Gong Li nodded in reply.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong reporters recently 
              checked Singapore's Registry of Marriage records and confirmed that Gong
               Li and Ooi are still married. However, speculations that the couple are
               in the midst of divorce proceedings remain.</p>
              <p>Taiwanese tabloids 
              alleged that close associates of the couple revealed their decision to 
              split more than a year ago as the lovebirds felt that they have drifted 
              apart.</p>
              <p>"The both of them spend more time apart than together; now 
              they're more friends than lovers. The agreement to split was an amicable
               decision and the two of them still remain friends."</p>
              <p>When quizzed 
              on the status of the couple's relationship, Gong Li's manager 
              Christopher Tseng avoided the question.</p>
              <p>"I am not familiar with 
              their private matters. I don't know how her marriage is doing."<br><br>Source: <a title="http://entertainment.xin.msn.com/en/celebrity/buzz/asia/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4175253" href="http://entertainment.xin.msn.com/en/celebrity/buzz/asia/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4175253">http://entertainment.xin.msn.com/en/celebrity/buzz/asia/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4175253</a></p>
