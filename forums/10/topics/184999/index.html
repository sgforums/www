            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>do most patients who are ignorant of pharmacological and medicinal developments - make any demands on the Doctors attending to them ?</blockquote>Singaporeans are more educated than you think and it is becoming common to have patients coming with an armful of data downloaded from the internet when it affects their health. Are you suggesting that doctors should not tell less IT-savy patients about more effective but expensive treatments? In fact, that was perhaps what the Minister of Health meant when he said doctors should not raise patient expectations too much.<br><br>But do you think it is right to offer one level of treatment to private patients and foreigners who can afford it, and another for locals?<br><br><blockquote>Is it not a fact that new technologies are introduced by the Medical Community to raise efficiency and supposedly to help in reducing costs ?</blockquote>That's a major misconception here. Doctoring is not the same as manufacturing die casts. IT and automation of some lab processes can raise efficiency but that constitutes a small part of healthcare costs. You cannot automate surgery or looking down a microscope. The new technologies that have transformed medicine are mainly in newer surgical techniques/treatment regimes and more accurate diagnostics. All of these are more expensive as there are few skilled professionals who have the skill and the techniques are covered by expensive patents.<br><br>Most new technologies are introduced to improve diagnosis and treatment, not to reduce costs.<br><br><blockquote> With Economy of Scale from a World Wide demand of a proven medicine or material or medical technique - one would expect costs to be made lower, except for the greed of the Medical Community to take advantage of a niche specialty and to accelerate the time duration to recover the cost of Research and Development.<br></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Economy of scale? Can you perform surgery on a conveyor belt as if every appendicetomy is the same? If you do, yes, you get economy of scale. Are you suggesting that instead of performing a rarely ordered lab test, we wait for a month to batch enough requests before running it? That will give us economy of scale but WHAT ABOUT THE PATIENT??<br><br>As for pharmaceuticals, surgical equipment and diagnostic reagents/kits, yes, it is the partly the greed of the pharmaceutical industry that has kept the prices so high. But that is not the fault of the government. These are private companies, not charities...and the business does carry high risks. Merck has been sued millions of dollars in a single court case over Viox, with thousands of cases pending. One drug failure can mean billions of dollars lost.<br><br>Perhaps you are suggesting that the government should ignore patents and copyright?<br><br></div>
