But i think all humans are rational. They will always go for the better choice, due to self interests. I think there is nothing like "Pa si buay chao" theory in this world now. If Singapore can still be a nice and comfortable place to stay, who will want to leave? Only those idiots will want to leave.<br><br>If Singapore is really losing their competitive edge, being a small country, vulnerable to all the external threats, it will be very hard for Singapore to be a nice place to stay. So if the wise guys knows whats the best for them, they will make the best move. Which move they will make really depends on your own view.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
