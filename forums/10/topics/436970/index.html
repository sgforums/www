              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">The United Nations (UN) has released its report in the recently concluded Universal Periodic Review of Singapore that was held in May 2011. The exercise is part of the UN’s on-going review of the state of politics among its member states.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">Among some of the calls made to the PAP Government included the lifting on the ban of peaceful public assemblies, the cessation of the use of defamation laws to stifle free speech, and the abolition of laws that curtail freedom of association. Several countries including Canada, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom made the proposals.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">Calls were also made for the Singapore Government to review its laws on mandatory death penalty.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">Below are excerpts of the report making recommendations for civil liberties to be respected in Singapore:</p>
              <blockquote style="color: #151009; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; background-color: #fce0b1; background-image: url(http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/WP_010/images/PostQuote.png); border-right-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 50px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 37px; background-position: 0% 0%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; border-color: #f9c367; border-style: solid;">
              <p style="color: #151009; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">99. The following recommendations did not enjoy the support of Singapore as Singapore considers that they are based on incorrect assumptions or premises:</p>
              <p style="color: #151009; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">99.1. Review the de facto ban on peaceful public demonstrations, the use of anti-defamation laws; and the registration process for civil society and associations, to ensure that such laws, as adopted and enforced, are consistent with international human rights guarantees of the rights to freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of association (Canada);</p>
              <p style="color: #151009; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">99.2. Abolish the defamation law and ensure protection and promotion of the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and association through legislative reform and policy changes (Czech Republic);</p>
              <p style="color: #151009; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">99.3. Abolish the penal law on defamation and ensure, through legislative reform and political change, that freedom of expression, as well as freedom of association and peaceful assembly are guaranteed to all inhabitants, citizens or not, of the country (Switzerland);</p>
              <p style="color: #151009; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">99.4. Implement the 18 recommendations made by the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute in its 2008 report “Prosperity Versus Individual Rights” (United Kingdom);</p>
              <p style="color: #151009; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">99.5. Prohibit corporal punishment and put in place an educational system respectful of the physical and psychological integrity of minors (Switzerland);</p>
              <p style="color: #151009; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">99.6. Fully incorporate the principles and provisions of CRC into the domestic legal system, especially those regarding corporal punishment (Poland);</p>

              <p>The PE in itself was "democratic" with no election boundaries being drawn. If Tan Jee Say had not contested, I would dare say that Tan Cheng Bock would have trounced Tony Tan. I guess the results of both elections showed clearly what the majority of Singaporeans want and thinks i.e they are sick of certain PAP policies and at the same time do not subscribe to the politics the likes of SDP stand for.</p>
              <p>That aside, I would think Tan Jee Say is probably not the best orator around and I would be embarassed if he spoke for Singaporeans on the world stage. That probably caused him some votes as well.</p>

              <p>You are right.  Few weeks ago, the LKY expressed clearly that as long as he is around he will not allowed democracy, western democracy.    Democracy is democracy, there is no such thing as western democracy.      He called it western democracy to please the PRC.</p>

              <p>At least LKY learned mandarin cause he wanted to communicate with the mandarin speaking. TT, though he was Minister for Education, never learned, never thought he needed to communicate with the Chinese.</p>
              <p>there are 4 official languages in Singapore, some chinese talk to malay in malay, not english, there are malay who can speak hokkien, but no english. our national language is Malay. not sure what it means to be neutral. To be practical is to use 4 languages.</p>
