            <div class='col-md body'>frankly, i feel that if one is very interested in a uni education in a local uni, DON'T GO POLY...<br><br>its no secret that the 2 local unis take in mostly 'a' level students... why should it come as a surprise to poly people only AFTER they enter poly?<br><br>i mean no offence to the rest of you... but i've heard a lot of nonsense from some so-called educated people recently...<br><br>basically, they complain that they can't get into the local uni with their diploma and complain that the gov't is stone-walling them and the system is not giving them a chance...<br><br>so i asked them why did they choose poly when 'a' levels was a more direct way and guess what they said... i quote: <strong>"aiya 'a' level very cheem ah... must study gee pee, must study chinese... i'll rather learn something useful..." </strong><br><br>they knew from the start that they won't stand a chance unless they aced everything for 6 sems, but that only bothered them AFTER they got their diploma...<br><br>bear in mind that a poly grad will command a much higher starting salary than an a-level holder cos the poly grad is seen to have finished his education while the 'a' level is seen to have stopped halfway.<br><br>what happens to 'a' level students who didn't make it to uni then? they also jia lat what.<br><br>poly grads are not the only ones disadvantaged by the system. if a uni degree adds value to a worker, then i think the gov't should consider liberalising entry requirements across the board for ALL singaporeans: 'a' level holders, private certificate holders, mature students AND poly diploma holders. not just ONE of the groups.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there's always a percentage of students capacity opened for poly grads. The only thing is the number is small.<br><br>However, comments made on the lack of theoretical knowledge of poly grads seems to be a bit off. In the working world, you cannot depend on just theoretical knowledge, how much theoretical stuff can u squeeze in your under-utilised brain and remember them for life. How much of this knowledge can you efffectively apply on practical situations? Well, i am not saying theories are 'nothing', but i am trying to emphasize that sometimes, you need a good mix to get things moving in the right direction.</div>

I say ok.<br><br>So i waited, after ORD came the package. I happy fill in the forms, then suddenly realised that there  are no ARTS options on the form!

Bulls to them.  So i said ok, is there  anyway I can apply for ARTS.  The lady say Yes, that i need to come down to NUS to get  a special form. But then what she said next got me angry, she said" but i advise  you not to bother because there will be more than enough JC students to take up all the places."<br><br>I was like shit, its as  though we are not better than JC students, 2nd CLASS citizens ah we all poly cannot go NUS ah, stopid sia, so now i study in MIS do Curtin Uni Business, happier can dfinish in 1.5 yrs. better still, who cares for a NUS cert.</div></blockquote>Actually this is standard practice what.</div>

No wonder the newspaper are claiming that poly grad have a better chances of finding a job during this economy crisis compared to a local uni grad!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
