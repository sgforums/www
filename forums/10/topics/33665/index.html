            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.<br>i was just doing a project regarding the issue whether there are sufficient opportunities given to poly grads to enter a local university and whether if rejected by a local uni and accepted by foreign uni, will they be less inclined to return to singapore? i would like as much comments to be given by all. thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i personally feels that more poly student can be accepted into the local uni... provided that their results in poly as well as in their O levels are good lah...<br><br>But then the problem lies in the absence of a standardized entrance examinations....<br><br>its is difficult if not unjust to set a percentage for poly student that will be permitted to join local U... each individuals should be given an opportunity to go to the local U on their own merits against others.... under a meritocracy system...<br><br>BUT therein lies a problem... the courses taken by A level student is different from poly student... and because of this bi-track system... its difficult to set a generally acceptable standdardized entrance examinations... that would satisfy both groups...<br><br>My suggestion is that... ALL poly student should be given an opportunity to take an entrance examination at the local U, in their respective faculty of studies of choice......<br><br>if they make the grade.. they should be permitted to enter local U...and the local U should expand a particular faculty if need to meet the demand...<br><br>this way... there is no complaint on the existance of preferences for A level student or poly student.. each entered university on their own merit... they pass.. they enter.. they dont pass... dont bother blaming others...<br><br>alternatively... we can remove the bi-track system and go for a mono track version...<br><br>all O-level student can only proceed to A level... no more poly...<br><br>all poly campus are combined and reformed to become singapore's number 4 technology univerisity handing out degrees and doctorates.... instead of diploma.... all current diploma holders can convert the diploma to degree after passing a A level equivalent examination...<br><br>Foreign uni... some good ... some bad.. some okay okay... but the problem is worst... how to measure their credibility??<br><br>BUT i personally feels that... as long as you went oversea and study full time in a respectable university of global standing.. your degree should be just as acceptable to a local Uni degree....<br><br>BUT if you take those correspondence, part time, fast track, buy over the counter degree.... i think... no need for me to say... you also paiseh to call yourself a degree holder....<br></div>

Re-enrolled for A-diploma and graduate. By now, I'm in working class. I tried to enrolled into NUS for part-time degree, it was tough when I saw their schedule.<br><br>I subsequently enrolled in SIM and had graduated only last year after 2.5 year slogging. But it was better as you have networked with many people of same calible or higher.<br><br>While working earlier, I have save enough to pay for two sets of course fee, my wife and I study part-time together. No need to get loans from whoever.<br><br>It will be a credible suggestion. Please make sure that your uni to be enrolled is accedited to some professional institution and recognised by the govt.

Weeks before I ORD, i called NUS and asked, i want to apply for NUS  Arts to specialise in Psychology... they ask me many questions, then say ok will send me a  package because Poly Grad  diff from JC.

Bulls to them.  So i said ok, is there  anyway I can apply for ARTS.  The lady say Yes, that i need to come down to NUS to get  a special form. But then what she said next got me angry, she said" but i advise  you not to bother because there will be more than enough JC students to take up all the places."<br><br>I was like shit, its as  though we are not better than JC students, 2nd CLASS citizens ah we all poly cannot go NUS ah, stopid sia, so now i study in MIS do Curtin Uni Business, happier can dfinish in 1.5 yrs. better still, who cares for a NUS cert.</div>
