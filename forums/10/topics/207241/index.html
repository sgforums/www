It suggests that a majority believe tax cuts would be affordable if public services were genuinely reformed, but they have little faith that any party could achieve this.<br><br>The results suggest that Cameron could be missing an Â“open goalÂ” by failing to capitalise on the desire for tax cuts.<br><br>The poll found that a large majority of people Â— 81% against 9% Â— supported a Â“significantÂ” increase in the Â£32,000 threshold for the 40% tax band, which would take more people on middling incomes out of that bracket.<br><br>The detailed market research, carried out by ICM on behalf of the TaxpayersÂ’ Alliance (TPA), an independent political lobbying group, comes as some modernising MPs are beginning to argue for a break with the current taboo over tax.<br><br>Labour, under Tony Blair and the chancellor Gordon Brown, has shied away from income tax rises, fearing they would frighten middle-class voters. Cameron, whose party has traditionally supported lower taxes, has sought to change that perception amid Labour accusations that the Tories will cut spending on vital public services.<br><br>Last week Stephen Byers, the former Labour minister, argued for the abolition of inheritance tax. He said that the levy of 40% on estates worth more than Â£285,000 was a Â“penalty for hard work, thrift and enterpriseÂ”. This weekend George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, responded by advocating the abolition of stamp duty on shares to Â“repair the damageÂ” done by LabourÂ’s raid on pension funds. The Tories say the move would increase the average pension fund by Â£8,000.<br><br>CameronÂ’s Tories have sided with Labour policy on economic stability and investment in public services before tax cuts, but the poll shows that a majority of the public still want governments to take less out of their wage packets.<br>The key finding of the study, in which 1,000 people were interviewed, is that people hold the political parties and the system in contempt and are strongly attracted to the prospect of real change.<br><br>It found that emigration is a possibility for more than one in five people. Asked if they had thought about moving abroad, 16% said they had given it<br>Â“serious thoughtÂ” and a further 6% said they planned to do so.<br><br>The poll will be a further blow to Blair, who returned from his three-week Caribbean holiday this weekend to more speculation about his future.<br>Tessa Jowell, one of his most loyal cabinet ministers, admitted yesterday that his plans to step down as leader were creating Â“a sense of uncertaintyÂ” within the Labour party. Geoff Hoon, the Europe minister, acknowledged that the government had been going through Â“problemsÂ” and people were beginning to see Cameron as a serious alternative.<br><br>Downing Street sought to shore up BlairÂ’s position after the defection of 37 Labour members from the Derby constituency of Margaret Beckett, the foreign secretary, to the Liberal Democrats in protest at his failure to condemn Israeli military action in Lebanon. An unusual statement from No 10 insisted the prime minister was Â“convinced that his government has the experience and authority to meet these challengesÂ”.<br><br>TodayÂ’s poll results suggest there is little belief that the current political system can fix peopleÂ’s problems and show strong support for tax cuts. It shows 76% of people favour lowering the basic rate of income tax. People also agreed by about three to one Â— 56% to 17% Â— that reforming public services would allow tax cuts without reducing spending on vital services, although many doubted this would happen.<br><br>The ToriesÂ’ unwillingness to argue for lower taxes has, according to the TPA, Â“left an open goalÂ” for other parties.<br><br>There were majorities in favour of Â“significantÂ” increases of personal allowances and for raising the threshold for inheritance tax or abolishing it.<br><br>Worryingly for Cameron, 36% of people did not back his stance that cutting taxes could threaten economic stability.<br><br>The TPA, which has 15,000 members, believes politicians are failing to recognise a genuine desire for tax cuts among the public. Matthew Elliott, its chief executive, said: Â“The partiesÂ’ conventional wisdom about public opinion is wrong. The parties are all wrongly committed to the status quo of high taxes and massive power for MPs. The public rightly donÂ’t believe them and want change.<br><br>Â“They want large tax cuts and serious reform to get MPs out of managing services and to get non-MPs, who know what theyÂ’re doing, into government.Â”<br><br>The poll shows strong disillusionment with the main political parties. Only 24% of people identify with the Labour party, 17% with the Tories and 9% with the Liberal Democrats. Four out of 10 people do not identify with any party.<br><br>When asked to choose between Brown, BlairÂ’s likely successor, and Cameron, the public is divided with 38% favouring each man.<br><br>ICM interviewed 1,000 people between July 31 and August 2.
