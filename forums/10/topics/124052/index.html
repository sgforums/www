Many years of self-praises and self-accolates as talents.<br><br>They seem to have ways of muscling in ordinary citizens to get what they want.  Laws and enforcements are meant to catch criminals by piling on pressures and increasing penalties. This sort of tactics is apparently copied over to be applied on ordinary citizens on minor parking issues without discrimination.<br><br>It may not be surprising that such officers are earning good internal reports by their superiors even and getting more in bonuses. Ministers will get double quick promotions and three - six months' bonus based on inflated pays with all such things going on ?

I am willing to pay the fine..  If URA replied and say appeal is not accepted and I have to pay the $20.00.  I will pay it ! No big deal. Full stop.  However, there was no reply and when reply was received, nothing is said about pay what fine.  They merely asked for proof.  In the mean while the time is expiring.  FOr your information the last letter that came to me, I had to collect it personally at URA Centre and the date was already after the Court date.  And this is only done after I called URA so many times.    You tell me now, where do we stand in a system like this.   In that last letter, they say they had considered all the factors surrounding this case and decided to revert the charges bact to $106.00.  If they had a case, the fine would have been $306 instead...  I hope I have paint a clearer picture now ....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From another viewpoint, it appears there is nothing tat can prove u really attempted to pay the fines. A person who heck care and do not want to pay the fines will have as much evidences as u have now. The best course of actions, as some person suggested, is for u is to find your MP. Frankly they work wonders on such gov issues and hope tat u only need to pay $6 and get a warning. Next time ask someone who knows how to use the SAM machine to guide u</div>
