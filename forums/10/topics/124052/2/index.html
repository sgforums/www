The point is, I made a mistake in payment.  My second biggest mistake is to appeal.  In the past, during the appeal, the extend the payment period.  This time round something is wrong..  I was successful last time and they actually waive based on merit.  I am not hoping for full wavier but to pay original sum..  I was wrong then..  Had I not called them, the police will be on my door now...  I don't want that and I cannot afford it too..  So I told them forget the whole incident, just tell me how much to pay..  They say got reply for my last letter and is waiting for me to attend court, then give to me... This is ridiculous.  They took like two weeks to reply and they cannot trust the Singpost to deliver.  Wait for me in person to give..  I thought it was stupid but I didn't want to create any scene...  just go down, collect letter and pay at the same time.  The main issue here is how the Government react to the case...  They don't reply but keep increasing the price.  You are right, come to think of it, they are Ah Long ( legal one too )..</div>

I admitted I make mistake, all I say now is the Government should also be responsible enough to reply even if waiver is not given..  Is this too much to ask.  If you agree to their attitude, it is tentamount to say that, all civil servants can just ignore all appeal letters since there is a law in place to punish people who don't pay.  You write they don't reply or answer to your queries, you just pay up... no question ask and no appeal allow.  That being the case, the people of Singapore must be make known than there won't be anyone saying the civil service is f@## up ....   On the other hand, it will be known as an efficient agency that up-hold the law ....</div>
