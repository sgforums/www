            <div class='col-md body'>I've read all sorts of crap about there are ALOT of jobs available in singapore and that there's no reason to be jobless.<br><br>I've graduated since 6 months ago and still jobless.I went for career fairs....submitted countless resumes to companies who abide by this mantra "We regret that those not shortlisted will not be notified" .<br><br>Where's the basic courtesy??<br>In Japan even if you're rejected you receive a rejection letter and will not be left wondering if your resume has been received or not.If Japan can do it why not singpaore???<br><br>For those companies/banks which asked me to go for interviews often ask mme such stupid crap like "So what have you been doing since you graduated in September 2004"<br><br>WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING??<br>THE GALL TO ASK ME SUCH A QN!!!<br><br>I've been sending resumes and going for interviews and attending courses. That's what I've been doing!!! And whenever i reply them they continue asking crap like<br>"So since september you have been living off yr parents?? How do u support yrself?"<br><br>KNNBCCB Where got pple ask such crap one???<br><br>And are companies all sexist nowadays?? Prefering to employ women over men??<br><br>Before i go for interviews I speak to my fellow interview candidates and keep in touch with them. The men don't get hired and the girls get hired!! Not just in one instance but a few already!!<br><br>SIM (Singapore institute of Mgmt) just recently held its Convocation for their graduates 2 weeks ago. After 7 months, their emmployment rate is only at 53% )<br><br>And with the upcoming fresh batch of graduates from SMU,NUS and NTU coming up...do all grads who haven't find a job yet have to sell backside to find a job??<br><br>I'm a part time model but part time male models don't earn as much as females. (Another example of singapore being a sexist country)...so far i'm earning enough to eat (eat only, i rush back to drink water).<br><br>WIll the govt do something abt giving INTERVIEWERS PROPER TRAINING ON HOW TO CONDUCT AN INTERVIEW IN A PROFESSIONAL WAY RATHER THAN ASK SILLY QNS!!!<br><br>And those who study HRM will know that Interviews(Structured n unstructured) are the most inaccurate ways to judge whether sommeone is worth hiring or not.<br><br>Also will the govt stop thinking of attracting foreign talents cuz YOUR LOCAL TALENTS ARE BEING NEGLECTED!!<br>I'm so angry argh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I need someone to advise mme on what i can do....i'm really exasperated.</div>

However, for the fresh grad, there are upshots about the current system too. How many singaporeans have had to attend a selection day, take part in group discussions, do a presentation on an issue and go through a panel interview? How many Singaporean fresh grads would do well in these exercises?</div>

That's what I've been doing!!! And whenever i reply them they continue asking crap like<br>"So since september you have been living off yr parents?? How do u support yrself?"<br><br>KNNBCCB Where got pple ask such crap one???<br><br>And are companies all sexist nowadays?? Prefering to employ women over men??<br><br>Before i go for interviews I speak to my fellow interview candidates and keep in touch with them. The men don't get hired and the girls get hired!! Not just in one instance but a few already!!<br><br>SIM (Singapore institute of Mgmt) just recently held its Convocation for their graduates 2 weeks ago. After 7 months, their emmployment rate is only at 53% )<br><br>And with the upcoming fresh batch of graduates from SMU,NUS and NTU coming up...do all grads who haven't find a job yet have to sell backside to find a job??<br><br>I'm a part time model but part time male models don't earn as much as females. (Another example of singapore being a sexist country)...so far i'm earning enough to eat (eat only, i rush back to drink water).<br><br>WIll the govt do something abt giving INTERVIEWERS PROPER TRAINING ON HOW TO CONDUCT AN INTERVIEW IN A PROFESSIONAL WAY RATHER THAN ASK SILLY QNS!!!<br><br>And those who study HRM will know that Interviews(Structured n unstructured) are the most inaccurate ways to judge whether sommeone is worth hiring or not.<br><br>Also will the govt stop thinking of attracting foreign talents cuz YOUR LOCAL TALENTS ARE BEING NEGLECTED!!<br>I'm so angry argh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I need someone to advise mme on what i can do....i'm really exasperated.</div></blockquote>how about your university friends?  are they without jobs too?</div>
