            <div class='col-md body'>How much you pay the degree holder for the starting salary ? The important question of all. $1800 dollars ? After cut CPF. Take home $1500 dollars ? Every year increment 4% ? Then by 10 years sure can get over $2500 dollars right ? For a degree holdering grad from NTU or NUS Right ?<br><br>I believe that is what most company of Singapore is giving out to the students. in 2005. That is good salary. Of course lah !<br><br>Fare price hike getting higher !<br><br>$1800 starting salary a bit low for a degree holder leh. How come huh ?<br><br>Maybe nowdays HDB 5-room cost $200,000 above for first hand ?<br><br>Maybe a Car cost $80,000 or more. Petrol goes up to $1.60 per lites.<br><br>Maybe give birth to child at KK hospital cost $5000 dollars.<br><br>Maybe medical check-up costing more and more. $1000, $2000, $3000, etc.<br><br>Maybe CPF interest drop a lot like 2.5% and special account 4% ?<br><br>Maybe Bus fare just travel to work. From Yishun to Cityhall cost $2.40 per trip.<br><br>Maybe a bowl of mee is $2.50 to $3 dollars nowdays.<br><br>Maybe electricity bills keep on going up. Water bills also going up when Newater is coming soon. Paying desert water price in rainforest area.<br><br>Too many Maybe. And $1800 dollars salary is a very little to a degree holder ?<br><br>How about ITE students ? Poly ? Isn't it going to be worst ?<br><br></div>

Unfortunately this is all so true, although there is a minority of us overseas that try to move away from the SG crowd and mingle with people from other ethnic backgrounds. Most SG overseas students tend to congregate together, and hence, there is a lack of exposure to the culture of the host country that they are in. So you end up seeing alot of "little Singapores" everywhere you go, especially in areas where SG students tend to study...I dunno...I feel that its as if they've never really left the sheltered waters of home and still seek a sense of security in numbers...I ended avoiding them in the end (even if I had to put up with snide remarks from time to time) and made new friends instead...its the best time to make contacts with your peers..networking internationally is invaluable... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Deportivo,<br><br>I guess you are right in that some foreign grads are really impressive, and some just dun cut it. Also, I'm sure that local grads are not all inferior, i'm sure I can find some who are better than foreign grads.<br><br>What really frustrates me is the common perception by SOME employers that all foreign grads are better, therefore they automatically get hired over local grads and they get promotions and higher pay due to their foreign degrees rather than their performance.<br><br>I guess there are very few employers like Deportivo who doesn't care much about all the pretty packaging and rather cuts straight to the chase and look for substance.<br><br>I do noticed in my search for jobs that govt bodies and GLCs like to look wholly at results. Nothing else matters. Perhaps when big brother stops basing all their recruitment wholly on results, we will see less threads in Politics forum. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
