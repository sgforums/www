I read it during the cabinet meeting this morning and I found that he (Dr Rohan Gunaratna) linked BN with MILF. Even PAS was linked with the MILF".<br><br>After his initial reading, Dr Mahathir had accused Dr Rohan Gunaratna of committing slander by associating BN with MILF, and indirectly linked BN with al-Qaeda.<br><br>In the ChanelNewAsia interview, Dr Rohan Gunaratna claimed that Dr Mahathir had misread his book, and indicated that he had spoken to the Malaysian Government, even offering to pay US$1million to anyone who can find such a statement that directly or indirectly suggested that BN is linked to al-Qaeda.<br><br>A day of two later, Dr Mahathir was reported in the New Straits Times to have cleared Dr Rohan Gunaratna of making such a statement accusing BN of links to the MILF, and to al-Qaeda.<br><br>If your posting is correct, then Dr Rohan Gunaratna must have lied in his clarification over ChanelNewsAsia.<br><br>If your "statement of fact" is correct, then it is amazing how anyone in Dr Mahathir's position can read an entire book during an even more important event such as a Cabinet Meeting.<br><br>Now we know what goes on at a Malaysian Cabinet Meeting, where "Papa" reads a book, with all the other obedient Ministers listening attentively - mindlessly slurping up every interpretation from "Papa's" readings.<br><br></div>
