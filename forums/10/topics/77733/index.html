            <div class='col-md body'>i am sure the topic is one of a staurated nature..delinquency in teenagers is a common as puberty to our young adults,<br><br>in fact quelling this very nature of delinquency would in fact retard the youth's emotional and character growth..<br>it might sound absurd but all of us have been thru a certain amounrt of angst when we were younger..irregardless of whch gen we came from we did partake in  certain amount of non-conformity.<br><br>i believe the isuue of delinquency in singapore isin't as drastic as it is in other nations..<br>yes our students are often rude at some have no respect for their elders..but let's macromanage this situation and we see that it is but a small group even thus this small group would out grow this age.<br><br>about coporal punishments in the classroom. i think it defeats the purose of new age learning or the application of education now in the 21st cventury..<br>in an era wherby radical methods of learning are introduced even at pre-kindergarten levels..where the students are enriched with various modes of thought even at  a very young age. thus imposing punishments like caning and such are a contrary to the aims of modern day education<br><br>yes the students and youths need a mode of redress but let it come from another way.<br>in an age wherby money and freeadom are made accesible; physical punishment might oftentimes be ineffective..<br><br>cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

May I add that it is probably in teenagers' nature to retaliate against a higher authority until they've sorted out their own priorities in life and become more mature</div>
