There is no sign that the numerous past economic restructuring plans to value-adding model are being implemented to catch up with the world's technology-driven countries like Korea or Finland.<br><br>The Swiss standard of living which was promised was not realised. Instead the ordinary people's wages have dropped to the third world and costs of essential public services have risen to the first world from medicare to transportation and utilities have risen forming 40-60% of family income among the lower income groups.<br><br>The continued increases of fees and taxes are therefore wrong policies from the past which have hampered the growth of the economy from the 1970s.<br><br>There is no broad-based growth now except those MNCs or GLCs which are making monies out of people's CPF cuts and not from any particular success in innovation or practical knowledge application by the masses.<br><br>There is no sign the economy will grow on its own through self-reliant innovations or knowledge application by the people except for occasional world-connected freak growths.<br><br>So to the ministers, please think harder - do you take it for granted that the current growth has been created by the government.<br><br>True talents are those who could grow the economy from innovation and practical knowledge application involving the masses. But since ministers have only been promoting foreign companies and foreigh talents how could they ever achieve such upgrading.<br><br>In defeat of applying true talent ministers are seen only as continuing to tax people heavily and recover all costs through creative accounting.<br><br>Is this kind of tax-and-recover system called talented government?</div>
