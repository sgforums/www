              <p><em>Political filmmaker <strong><a href="http://singaporerebel.blogspot.com/">Martyn See</a></strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em>reviews that historical 2006 televised debate between MM</em><em> </em><em>Lee Kuan Yew</em><em> </em><em>and the post 65′ers.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <div style="text-align: center;">
              
              
              
              
              </div>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p>During the run-up to the 2006 General Elections, Mediacorp’s
              Channel News Asia aired a 50 minute-long programme entitled “Why My
              Vote Matters.” It featured a dialogue session between Minister Mentor
              Lee Kuan Yew and a selected panel of post 65-ers.</p>
              <p>Televised debates with PAP leaders are extremely rare.
              Older Singaporeans would have to cast their minds back to the mid-1980s
              when Select Commitee hearings such as the amendments to the Legal
              Professions Act were beamed into their living rooms. It had reportedly
              featured the then Law Society President Francis Seow jousting with
              then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, with cameo appearances by young
              lawyers Teo Soh Sung and Tang Fong Har. Two years after the programme
              was aired, Teo and Tang were detained under the ISA for an alleged
              “Marxist conspiracy” to subvert the Government. Seow was also arrested
              a year later.</p>
              <p>Throughout the latter half of the 1980s to the mid 1990s, televised
              political debates did make recurring appearances, most notably with the
              live Parliamentary proceedings and other Select Commitee enquiries,
              including a rare face-off on the cost of living, which featured
              SDP’s Chee Soon Juan versus PAP’s George Yeo. And there was a
              particular memorable hearing on the Elected Presidency Bill, when a law
              lecturer named Walter Woon held his own against a panel of ministerial
              heavyweights including the then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. By the
              mid-1990s, ‘Live in Parliament’ and other Select Commitee hearings were
              eased off the air, sporadically appearing only as heavily-edited spots
              during the nightly news broadcasts.</p>
              <p>It is in this context that the airing of this 2006 debate makes for
              such a rare milestone event in Singapore’s television history.</p>
              <p>On hindsight, there are questions one would ask of the station’s
              executive producers and the Prime Minister’s Office. Why did they see
              the need to conduct such a televised dialogue? Were they hoping to win
              the young voters over by allowing the octogenarian to remind them of
              PAP’s accomplishments? Were they hoping that the young 65ers’ would be
              so in awe of the MM that they would capitulate? And why entitle the
              show “Why My Vote Matters” when half the population of this country
              have not and will probably not be able to vote, given the number of
              uncontested seats since the 1980s? Add to that, it was Lee Hsien
              Loong’s first General Elections as the Prime Minister, so why didn’t he
              take the hot seat instead of his father?</p>
              <p>Presumptions and motives aside, this televised debate makes for
              compelling viewing, and some startling revelations, chief of which was
              how the post 65-ers went straight for the jugular and tabled questions
              on the uneven playing field, particularly of the GRC system, and on
              occasions even interrupted the MM. Older Singaporeans conditioned to
              deference towards Lee would have been appalled at such disrespect shown
              to the ‘founding father’.</p>
              <p>One young 65er who stood out was journalist Ken Kwek of the Straits
              Times’ political desk. Kwek had pinned Lee to the ropes on a survey he
              had done about political fear. But in a reversal of role, Lee shot
              back, probing Kwek to disclose the names of his sources.</p>
              <p>Having watched this again on Google video, I found several
              illuminating moments. I leave marked timecodes of them but I’ll leave
              it to you to make your own conclusions.</p>
              <p><em>(Ken Kwek has since left the Straits Times. He is currently a
              playwright and had written the screeplay to the local film The Blue
              Mansion.)</em></p>
              <p><em>————-</em></p>
              <p>1:47 : On why there are many PAP MP’s who have never contested.</p>
              <p>2:06 : On why “there isn’t much of a fight.”</p>
              <p>3:55 : On why the need for GRCs. It’s for racial minority representation.</p>
              <p>4:33 : When pointed out by Ken Kwek that PAP’s minority candidates
              had indeed won in single seats prior to implementation of GRC system,
              Lee replied , “That was with the PAP in complete control. That
              generation voted for the PAP.” There was a pause. Lee seemed unsure of
              how to continue. But was interrupted by another question. This is
              probably the biggest Freudian slip by Lee that the GRC system was
              implemented for a different reason other than for minority
              represenatation.</p>
              <p>4.55 : Voting are “basic, visceral, emotional biases.”</p>
              <p>8:47 : Potong Pasir and Hougang “have to wait at the end of the queue.”</p>
              <p>8:57 : Lee asks, “Does any government help the opposition to displace itself?”</p>
              <p>10:05 : On eliminating the opposition.</p>
              <p>11.10 : On fear of voting against the PAP.</p>
              <p>12:04 : No level playing field anywhere.</p>
              <p>12:42 : We can “guess” but we don’t know who voted against us.</p>
              <p>13:07 : The grilling of Ken Kwek begins here. You name the voters who are afraid.</p>
              <p>13:26 :  I started as a cross-examiner. You name them.</p>
              <p>13:45 : Kwek : Why should I name them?</p>
              <p>13:55 : More cross-examination by Lee on Kwek.</p>
              <p>15:10 : We have said categorically, “The vote is secret.”</p>
              <p>16:11 : “I allowed my grandchildren to speak back to me but from time to time..I put them down.”</p>
              <p>17:45 : I built up my base from one single seat in 1959.</p>
              <p>18:56 : We want a fair media.</p>
              <p>19:10 : Where is the opposition’s “substance?”</p>
              <p>22:14: GRCs does the opposition good.</p>
              <p>23:22 : I’ve never said that the opposition is unnecessary.</p>
              <p>24:52 : Is the PAP insecure about losing?</p>
              <p>25:22 : On why the government disallows political podcasts and blogging.</p>
              <p>27:18 : Emotional attachment to nation via right to vote is an “unfounded thesis.”</p>
              <p>27:15 : “The fact that we are not challenged is a strong mandate.”</p>
              <p>32:44 : There is no political apathy.</p>
              <p>33:35 : The definition of politics equals jobs, home, medicine, education, future.</p>
              <p>34:40 : In the 50s and 60s, Singapore was “in a state of agitation everyday.”</p>
              <p>36:50 : Once the PAP goes soft, it will be displaced.</p>
              <p>36:39 : Our candidates have competence, integrity.</p>
              <p>38:10 : There is a databank here (points to his head).</p>
              <p>38:40 : Would you like me to retire from politics?</p>
              <p>39:56 : Do you not think my son has a mind of his own?</p>
              <p>41:00 : I’ll be sad if your generation wants me to retire.</p>
              <p>44:04 : “If I’m arrogant, would I be talking to you?”</p>
