Each time they increase Electric bills, they come out with these rebates to look good. What good does it do, if I take $1 from you and treat you to a 0.50 cents packet of sweets??? Or is it like give you $500 take back $1500 later through all sorts of increases?<br>So typical! So predictable!<br><br>And for some unknown reasons, all my friends including myself, are receiving unusually high electric bills as of last month!!!
