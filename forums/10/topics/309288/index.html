              <p>From: Singapore Inc,<br>      Department of Minister Acquisition,<br>      Istana, Orchard Rd, Singapore 238823</p>
              <p>To: Leaders of the Free World</p>
              <p>RE: Singapore seeks new Prime Minister</p>
              <p>Dear Sir,</p>
              <p>Singapore Inc. was formed in the aftermath of the latest spate of ministerial salary increment. Disgruntled Singaporeans, tired of being powerless, got together and the first Annual General Meeting of Singapore Inc. was convened to discuss the various problems plaguing our nation.</p>
              <p>Faced with a soaring CPI, our elite team of ministers, who are incidentally the highest paid group of politicians in the world, offered this advice to citizens affected by the slew of price hikes: switch to cheaper products.</p>
              <p>We at Singapore Inc., were so impressed with their creativity that we took the advice to heart. Not only that, as responsible citizens, we have voted to carry this advice further and to its logical conclusion: switch to cheaper politicians.</p>
              <p>We did our sums and arrived at the conclusion that if we were to replace the current Prime Minister and his cabinet with cheaper but more talented foreign imports, we would save millions for the Treasury in the short term and billions in the long run. Therefore, we at Singapore Inc. appeal to world leaders in both the political and commercial arenas to apply for the post of Prime Minister of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Ideally, the incoming Prime Minister should be willing to work long hours for very little money. </p>
              <p>Should you accept the post of Prime Minister, we are pleased to offer you the following terms:</p>
              <p>- An annual salary of US$800,000 dollars. It may be much lesser than the US$2.05 million paid to our current Prime Minister, but why do you think we are seeking a replacement in the first place? US$800,000 dollars is twice the amount the American president is earning, and not to be sneezed at.</p>
              <p>-The position of Prime Minister of Singapore is hereditary, and you can even exercise the option of choosing your successor from either your own family members or close associates.</p>
              <p>-Guaranteed return to power at every 'General Election' for the Prime Minister and his party.</p>
              <p>-Stock options and a seat on the board of directors in the GIC. The GIC is a Sovereign Wealth Fund established to manage Singapore's foreign reserves which amounts to more than US$100 billion. Unfortunately, we are unable to give you an exact figure at the moment. Please have fun finding out when you become Prime Minister.</p>
              <p>-The spouse of the Prime Minister will be offered the post of CEO of Temasek Holdings, the executive arm of the GIC. It currently manages a portfolio of more than *US$100 billion. (*Exact figure unknown)</p>
              <p>-A compliant judiciary to offer flexible interpretations of the Constitution and Legislations to suit your every need, such as when you need to sue pesky opposition politicians for defamation.</p>
              <p>-Health, dental, life and disability insurance.</p>
              <p>Duties and Responsibilities:</p>
              <p>-Upon assuming office, the Prime Minister will form the new government. We at Singapore Inc. advise a complete overhaul of the Cabinet. Currently, a Singapore minister earn an annual salary of US$1.32 million. We advise appointing ministers who will be happy with US$360,200. That is much lower than the current pay scale for a Singapore minister but twice the amount a US Cabinet Secretary is earning. With 15 Cabinet ministers (excluding the Senior Minister and Minister Mentor), this exercise to curb the excesses of the cabinet will save the Treasury US$14.4 million a year.</p>
              <p>-We at Singapore Inc. advise that the posts of Senior Minister and Minister Mentor are redundant and a waste of taxpayers' money. No other Prime Minister in the world needs to be advised by a Senior Minister and mentored by a Minister Mentor at the same time. Doing away with these redundancies will save the Treasury another US$4 million a year.</p>
              <p>-Traditionally, Singapore has a President who is the ceremonial head of State. However, after Ong Teng Cheong's term of office, what little executive power the post of President conferred has been further curtailed. We at Singapore Inc. therefore consider the current salary for the President at US$2.6 million to be an excess and an unnecessary burden on taxpayers. We advise keeping the ceremonial post of President but reducing his salary to US$315,000 which is on par with what the President of Germany is getting.</p>
              <p>-If our advice is taken and implemented, that will save the Treasury approximately US$22 million a year. And you will be popular with the people.</p>
              <p>We look forward to you joining us.</p>
              <p>Singapore Inc.<br>(For the people. By the people)</p>
              <p>*Amendments made to letter:</p>
              <p>-Annual salary for US President should be US$400,000. Twice that amount should be US$800,000.</p>
              <p>-A Cabinet Secretary is earning US$180,100 per annum at the moment. Twice that amount should be US$360,200.</p>
              <p>-Therefore, if our advice is taken and implemented, that will save the Treasury approximately US$22 million a year.</p>
              <p>PS: Don't think we are not kicking ourselves over the mistakes, but as that gives us a good excuse to send out the appeal one more time, we are not kicking ourselves too hard.</p>

              <p>A list of world leaders and newspapers you can send this appeal to. And in case anyone doesn't get it, it is a fucking satire. Do not expect any replies from the politicians. Do not expect any world leader with an ounce of common sense to actually apply to be Singapore's PM. But this is a damn good way to get their attention, in my opinion.</p>
              <p>Obviously, there isn't a Department of Minister Acquisition at the Istana. This is just my way of protesting against the obscene ministerial salaries and the lack of People Power in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Singa Crew,</p>
              <p>In the same way as government is opening the door to foreign talents for workers, like cleaners, masseurs and others, there is no reason why foreign political talents like Howard, Tony Blair, Rudd, Clinton who have greater talents than our ministers cannot do a better job in governing our country in the next lap.</p>
              <p>After all our MOM, MOT, MTI, and MHA have failed to solve our long-standing economic restructuring, manpower and transport problems.</p>
              <p>To ensure their loyalty, we could introduce certain residential or other conditions. They should be offered about US$400,000.00 pa (without life pension or bonus so as not to spoil the market) and I am sure they will not compare with other CEOs' salaries because they have the higher intelligence to realise that each vocation is different and there should be no such comparison in the first place.</p>
              <p>With such foreign talents becoming our ministers we could save a lot of tax monies for citizens who then could begin to work harder and save from lowering costs of living to prepare a better life and enjoy better retirement at the same time.</p>
              <p>We can be sure that they are more mature too and more open to criticisms and are more  accountable, so our people will integrate better with them because of such leadership quality and greatly support and unite behind them and not be color conscious.</p>
              <p>Without such foreign talents to lead us we will continue to go downward in our economy as seen in deep recessions every few years due to lack of substance and fundamentals or motivations of the people.</p>
              <p>Will you please forward a copy of this welcome letter to the press overseas as you have my support to invite these foreign talents to be our leaders.</p>

              <p>Heya Robert Teh,</p>
              <p>I have already finished mailing everyone - the politicians and foreign press. That went well despite the amount of emails I have to send out. Thanks to cut 'n' paste technology. :)</p>
              <p>By the way, good letter you wrote there. Perhaps you would like to email the foreign media yourself? Because it would look better if more than one Singaporean send out the appeal.</p>
              <p>The millions saved every year could go toward helping the poorest in our society. And there are just so many uses I could think of! For example, the public libraries in Singapore require users to pay to use their computers. Public libraries in other countries, also funded by taxpayers, provide such services for free. Maybe the libraries here are not getting enough funding? Well, they can apply for more funding if we can save the US$21 million a year! :)</p>

              <p>Heya Robert!</p>
              <p>Just made amendments to my original post. Check it out again.</p>
              <p>A helpful poster in another forum informed me the figures for the presidential salary and cabinet secretary salary are not up to date.</p>
              <p>So the 'offer' for a new PM is now at US$800,000.</p>
              <p>Still much lower than what our Dragon Prince is earning, so the impression I was trying to make with my letter has not changed in any way.</p>
              <p>I don't know if you have posted this elsewhere or sent it to anyone, but if you did, maybe you would like to make the corrections?</p>

              <p>Through such
              free and unbridled participations by fellow citizens in expressing
              their views and opinions of government actions and policies, your
              leadership is another milestone in the progress of mankind.</p>
              <p>Even
              though in a mature democracy you have to handle many responsibilities
              like making collective decision conducting governance with
              accountability and transparency to the parliament and MPs and citizens,
              you have never backed down from such duties and rsponsibilities.</p>
              <p>At
              the end you have succeeded in establishing a government which is
              elected by democratic process capable of bringing about the greatest
              good of the greatest number. This is democracy which is admired by
              countries all over the world.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a young democracy set
              up somewhat along the line of the Westminster style of parliamentary
              democracy. However owing to selfishness and self-centredness of our
              politicians the Westminster democracy was not being followed strictly.
              It is merely being used to give a certain legitimacy for elected
              leaders to govern with ceaseless and unbridled power with election
              merely used as facade to give our politicians power without
              correspondence check and balances played by other equally important
              branches of governing the country the refereeing by judiciary and
              independent legislature of MPs elected to serve the people and question
              the doings of the executive in charge of administration of government.</p>
              <p>The
              main reason why we feel we should publicly and openly invite foreign
              talents like yourself is firstly our current crop of political leaders
              simply do not have the qualities or prerequisites to govern the country
              with freedoms of expressions and other rights of participations in
              checking on wrongfulness by the governing elites.</p>
              <p>Our leaders
              have largely through years of tweaking the democracy machinery usurped
              the total power of other equally important institutions of democracy
              with the judiciary and legislature totally taken over by the executive.</p>
              <p>With
              the tweaking of the democratic institutions going on for years today we
              are only a democracy in name and citizens have lost their right of free
              election due to changing of the one-man-one-vote election process by
              requiring candidates standing for election as MPs using some excuse
              like racial harmony to find other candidates in threes or fours, fives
              or sixes depending on configuration of election boundaries to stand in
              blocks called GRC (Greater Representation Constituency) thereby
              depriving citizens of their rights to vote or stand for election in
              single wards allowing free and unimpeded choice based on good quality
              of the best individuals available to the population.</p>
              <p>As a result
              today as you might have heard often in the news today many people are
              unable to stand for election and people are no longer free to vote for
              their own best candidates of MPs to be their leaders.</p>
              <p>In every
              election, most of the wards became uncontested and politicians from the
              oppositions are facing law suits for speaking frank opinions or
              criticising the government in the course of election.</p>
              <p>The
              problems caused is such that economy is being run down with little or
              no prospect of growth except by sheer autocratic rule disregarding
              problems faced by the people.</p>
              <p>Lately for the past few years the
              government has even gone to the extent of importing citizens because
              many of our true talents have been forced to migrate to other countries
              due to oppressive policies at home as mentioned in the foregoing. Most
              jobs are now open to foreigners without any check of qualifications or
              availability of labor among the citizens. Jobs including cleaners,
              masseurs, clerks, engineers, lawyers, doctors, professionals and
              others,are open to applications without restraints by foreigners who
              often are not even qualified.</p>
              <p>Therefore we the citizens found
              that this kind of government is becoming more and more selfish and only
              protecting their own self-interests.</p>
              <p>We are of the opinion that
              if that is the case we might jolly well invites foreign talents as well
              to take over our government jobs. We feel that people like Howard, Tony
              Blair, Rudd, Clinton and many more have greater talents to do a better
              job in governing our country in the next lap.</p>
              <p>After
              all our MOM, MOT, MTI, and MHA could not even solve simple problems
              from the long-awaited economic restructuring, to creating jobs for
              local citizens and proper use of citizens' surpluses to benefit their
              job creations and lowering of the perpetual rising costs of living.</p>
              <p>To
              ensure their loyalty, we could introduce certain simple conditions. The
              job of PM is available to talents like yourself at between 
              US$400,000.00 pa and US$800,000.00 pa and we are sure you will not
              compare such salaries with other CEOs' salaries because they are of
              different vocation and there should be no such comparison in the first
              place unlike our own political leaders who use such ploy in order to
              take higher salaries by the millions by sheer legalistic use of their
              political power.</p>
              <p>With
              such foreign talents joining us of your calibre we are sure we the
              citizens not only will have greater talents to govern us we could save
              a lot of tax monies for citizens who then could begin to work harder
              and save from lowering costs of living to prepare a better life and
              enjoy better retirement at the same time.</p>
              <p>We can be sure that they are more mature too and more open to
                                      criticisms and are more  accountable, so our people will
                                      integrate better with them because of such leadership quality and
                                      greatly support and unite behind them and not be color
                                      conscious.</p>
              <p>We
              hope you could reply to this invitation by sending your application or
              expression of interest to our President for such ministerial jobs
              before 2010 the next election which no doubt will have the full
              understanding of the citizens (we the forumers will no doubt ask for
              appropriate motion to be put through parliament in the next sitting to
              approve such appointment)</p>
              <p>For the same
              reason as the government is opening its door to foreign engineers and
              professionals to join us, we feel it is perfectly legitimate and lawful
              too to invite foreign talents to be our leaders subject to appropriate
              safeguards as mentioned.</p>
              <p>Yours faithfully</p>

              And i dont think that our PM post has to work long hours.Due to the fact that Singapore is so small,the things that a PM has to deal daily are only minor.
              
              And i believe our silver-spooned kid Lee Hsien Loong,boot-licker Goh Chok Tong,and senile old man Lee Kuan Yew are spending most of their time sleeping in the office.And throw most of their jobs to their subordinates to do.

              <p>Hello there Mr Robert Teh,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I posted my spoof article to various forums based around the world and have generated some interest. On a British politics forum, someone wish to know more about our electoral system, so I will post that Tony Blair letter of yours there. You explain it better than I do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, since it is mainly a British politics forum, it will generate some interest I think.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Check it out here: <a href="http://www.politicsforum.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=552109#552109">http://www.politicsforum.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=552109#552109</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh if you do not wish it to be there, let me know. I assume you wouldn't mind because you did ask me to send out your welcome letter on your behalf.</p>

              <p>Crew,</p>
              <p>Thanks for posting my invitation letters to world leaders like Tony Blairs and Clinton at various forums.</p>
              <p>As stated in my post, we are a young democracy which has not yet matured and experienced the substantive goodness of true democracy. For over 40 years our democracy is merely a facade to legitimise the self-centred agendas of the power that be that happened to take control of the machinery of democracy to serve their own purposes.</p>
              <p>Our democratic institutions the judiciary and legislative are no longer functional and are being compromised being usurped totally by the self-serving power that be. MPs and judiciary alike are merely playing second fiddles to the executive and over time with the accumulation of power come self-interests and abuses of power as seen in NKF, Shin Corp and persecutions of citizens with defamation suits for participating in the political process.</p>
              <p>It is so ridiculous that Westminster democracy is used as a facade to allow power that be to use it to serve their own private gains. Even the one-man-one-vote election process has been tampered to become a block representation with candidates being prevented to stand for election unless he is able to find similarly minded candidates to join in the group representation constituencies.</p>
              <p>Citizens however are growing restless and listless with such hypocrisy as days go by. Every slightest mistakes made by our so-called world's best ministers paid millions become targets of mass unhappiness. No one can blame the citizens for being uncooperative and critical of the government especially over the non-stop taxing and holding back spending of taxing with all kinds of schemes to hoard monies for government's own surpluses which at the end at lost in billions all over the world on dubious projects for their own glory and self-praise.</p>
              <p>However the citizens are getting more educated and many are working in various parts of the world due to sluggist domestic sector of the economy. The citizens with greater education, travels and overseas exposures and living experiences can now see all the flaws of our present political system and it is a matter of time they will rise up en mass to demand change.</p>
              <p>Although our leaders now claim success for economic rebound the current rosy GDP and property market recovery is merely a blip due to world recovery while the basic problems remain. The economy is hollow without remaking or restructuring of the desired value-adding upgrading and technology driven start-ups needed to catch up with rising China, India and Korea etc.</p>
              <p>Because of failures in economic restructuring talked about for years government has basically been unable to turn around its own domestic sector. The blunt of such failure fall heavily on the new graduates with those reaching 40s unable to find jobs. Many are resorting to migration because of our own sluggist domestic economy.</p>
              <p>Such failure has forced the government to open the employment doors to all kinds of foreigners to come in to take citizens' jobs in order to rescue the falling economy.</p>
              <p>Under such circumstance, citizens will have to think for themselves and safeguard their own future. There is no reason why they cannot also invite capable foreigners like the Rudd, Howard, Clinton, Blair to come in to take over our leaders' jobs which in any case are over-paid and badly performed.</p>
              <p>Everything is so fake. For real progress of our little red dot citizens now have to bear the responsibilities to look after their own interest to prevent any more such hypocrisy seen in the daily press and media. Everything being put up in parliament is only for show to cover up real problems. It is appeasement exercise now because of too many unhappiness with rising costs due to fundamental flaws in policies etc.</p>
              <p>Just look at the way Minister Ng Eng Hen is still despite all the unhappiness of the citizens trying again and again to justify his open-door employment policies without consideration for the citizens' interests and needs. There will be no change and everything being done will be for show and appeasement with no real change.</p>
              <p>Citizens will have to work very hard to get together through forums and discussions to cause change by staying cohesive and united. Only then will the government be willing to make amends and change. </p>
              <p>You have my consent to post this at our forums where it matters.</p>
