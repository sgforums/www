The Shan/Wa.. The Junta is only controls the communication between the different factions.. all hates each other. If civil war breaks up.. it will be worst than Iraq present situation... with three faction.. and it's a desert.<br><br>I finds it funny, when any country govt faces major protest for it's calling for it's down fall... what would any other country react ? In south Korea and european countries they are allowed to use tear gas, batons and rubber bullets.. and even automatic pistol to shot at vocal unarmed protestors (I saw one video last year form live-leak - sweden I think). But Myanmar was frowned upon... even if they are initially using tear gas ? Look at french, Italy and south korea... the police are bashing the protestors like no tomorrow.. but it's ok. USA even arrest granny's just for reading their constitution.<br><br>Even in Singapore... force charge with batons and tear gas are approved way of dispersing crowds violent or not... as long as they deemed to be of illegal gathering.</div></blockquote>Burmese soldiers are not highly educated n they just obey order given y their commanders IF they are highy educated like Spore with mostly ITE, A level or poly diploma graduates, do u think they will obey orders blindly to suppress the rioters as what this the present situation is.</div>

Their families eat army food ration while the generals's families eat good food, able to travel to other part of the countries<br><br>to have medical checkup done by good doctors in Spore n their families buying branded goods. I read somewhere many years back, some of the generals holding ministerial portfolio less formally educated unlike our SAFOS general trained in ivy league universities. No wonder the Burmese general never think so much about shooting their own citizen.</div>

No point lah, anything just blame the government.</div></blockquote>Government accountability (at least to 666 percent of the electorate who voted)<br><br>Public officials have an obligation to explain their decisions and actions to the citizens. Government accountability is achieved through the use of a variety of mechanisms -- political, legal, and administrative -- designed to prevent corruption and ensure that public officials remain answerable and accessible to the people they serve. In the absence of such mechanisms, corruption may thrive.<br><br>A free society depends upon a high degree of mutual trust. The public will not give that trust to officials who are not seen to be impartially dedicated to the general public interest, nor will they give trust to those high in government who violate the rule of law they ask citizens to obey at the expense of self-interest, or to those who present government as the place where one feathers his own nest, [or] exchanges favors with friends and former associates.<br><br></div>

Even a PHD will take orders to shoot when he wears the uniform.  Ultimately, whether one obeys or not depends on whether he is under threat, and whther he is courageous enough to make a stand or be a hero. Given that SGreans are kiasu plus kiasi, it is very unlikely that an order will be subordinated unless someone is a hero to take the lead, then the typical SGrean will follow. In this forum, it is easy to make a comment but when you are like the soldiers in Myanmar, I wonder what you would do?</div>
