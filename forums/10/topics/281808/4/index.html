They are waiting for chaos and riots. Who kicked and shot the protesters in Myanmar? Could be one of those who were squeezed by the Juntas. He cannot kick the Juntas so he can only kick a big fuss and probably kick the poor chap next to him.  It is only human, or is it ?<br><br>Call me Ah Lao</div>

The wanton shooting and killing of peaceful demonstrators by the military junta has brought new meaning to the word depravity.<br><br>Instead of entering into a dialogue with the citizens to resolve the crisis in Burma through peaceful means, the military junta is unleashing violence to quell the People Power that has taken firm root in the country.<br><br>We, the undersigned, therefore and hereby call upon the SPDC to immediately<br><br>- cease all brutal acts against unarmed, peaceful protesters, including Buddhist monks who are at the forefront of the present largest democracy uprising in 20 years,<br><br>- release from detention the National League for Democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners and monks who have been detained,<br><br>- enter into a dialogue with NLD and other ethnic minority groups to diffuse the explosive situation in order to restore democracy,<br><br>- convene parliament and hand over power to the elected representatives in the 1990 elections.<br><br>We believe that a just and lasting solution to turmoil presently enveloping Burma can only be found by implementing the above demands.

We will only raid the home of those who are trying to cause instability and insecurity to the majority of peace-loving people. And don't harp on age old story. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Are you telling us no first world democratic country resort to "torment" to get the information they want. Ask Iraq</span>.

If we nurture that ONE to be powerful and mighty who in turn gives us and our children a good life, why not? There are always people who are unhappy with the system, any system. They are waiting for chaos and riots. Who kicked and shot the protesters in Myanmar? Could be one of those who were squeezed by the Juntas. He cannot kick the Juntas so he can only kick a big fuss and probably kick the poor chap next to him.  It is only human, or is it ?<br><br>Call me Ah Lao</strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">From the shallowness of your reply, you hope to be called <span style="font-style: italic;">'Ah Lao'</span> ?<br><br>Not by a long shot, as you have a lot more to learn before you can even hope to be recognised with this status. Even if you were to push your age by a few more years with growing a long goatee, it is best that you keep the thoughts to yourself so as not to embarass yourself.<br><br>Chaos and instability will surely befall on any country when there are no clear and transparent political process or stable political institutions that will <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> be dependent</strong> on any one political party.<br><br>Can the success of Singapore be continuously assured in the hands of a selected few ?<br><br>The Communist Party of Soviet Russia believe themselves to be infallible for the better part of over 60 years of its history, and brought Soviet Russia to a crashing halt, but was able to recover itself only through political openess.<br><br>Communist China is also taking a new route of political openess, as much as it is slower than Russia in doing so - yet its own form of political openess has provided its Citizens with progressive avenues of political and cultural expressions that will assure a vibrant future for China.<br><br>Communist Vietnam continued closed political mentality has resulted in the country being mired in corruption in its political and economic process even as the country provides material progress for its people. This environment will not last for long as its people become open to the global environment.<br><br>Singapore system - in the monopolistic grip of a single political party that create political institutions that depends entirely on the singular non-transparent guidance and input - will surely result in the corrupting of the political process as had happened in all One Party dominated countries.<br><br>History has never shown any country that is subjected to ONE Party dominance to last for too long, and Singapore is no different when LKY time on earth expire.<br><br>As long as LKY do not leave behind a political system and political institutions that are not dependent on the monopolistic grip of any one political party, or one group of politicians, or one strong political personality - can Singapore continue with its present level of stable progress ?<br><br>As matters stand, the rot is beginning to set in with the incessant greed for financial gains resulting in more money driven policies being created that continue to squeeze Singaporean pockets - {not their testes.... yet}.<br><br>Singaporeans may reach the same psychological breaking point as the Myanmese has reached in their set of circumstances.<br><br>Then again, how much does an immature and self-indulgent educated 'goondu' know about the real world affairs when cloistered in the safe environment created by grand-parents and parents ?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'lao gen'</span> ????<br><br>Not by a long shot.<br></span><br></div>
