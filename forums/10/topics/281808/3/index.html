I know you wanted to say that Singapore is a country that citizen cannot walk out in the street to demostrate.<br>But do you really want to see such thing happening in our own country.To see our fellow countrymen killing one another...i simply cannot imagine it.<br><br>I just wish the situation in Maynmar can improve and hope the goverment can stop using violence on its own citizens.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am told that most of the Myanmar's soldiers are not paid.. only provided with food and lodging... thus loyalty is in minus parameter.<br><br>The Junta's only control the southern part of Myanmar.. the rest are controlled by different ethnics groups - 8 majority ethnic groups...example.. The Shan/Wa.. The Junta is only controls the communication between the different factions.. all hates each other. If civil war breaks up.. it will be worst than Iraq present situation... with three faction.. and it's a desert.<br><br>I finds it funny, when any country govt faces major protest for it's calling for it's down fall... what would any other country react ? In south Korea and european countries they are allowed to use tear gas, batons and rubber bullets.. and even automatic pistol to shot at vocal unarmed protestors (I saw one video last year form live-leak - sweden I think). But Myanmar was frowned upon... even if they are initially using tear gas ? Look at french, Italy and south korea... the police are bashing the protestors like no tomorrow.. but it's ok. USA even arrest granny's just for reading their constitution.<br><br>Even in Singapore... force charge with batons and tear gas are approved way of dispersing crowds violent or not... as long as they deemed to be of illegal gathering.</div>
