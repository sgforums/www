            <div class='col-md body'><strong>WP 50th Anniversary Dinner Speech</strong><br>By Mr Low Thia Khiang, Secretary General and MP for Hougang<br><br>Leaders of Political Parties, Members and Supporters, Distinguished Guests:<br>Good Evening.<br><br>Thank you for your presence here tonight. Special thanks to those who have contributed to the successful publication of the PartyÂ’s 50th year anniversary commemorative book. The presence here this evening of the family of our party founder - Mrs David Marshall and their son - has added much meaning to the dinner to mark the 50th year milestone of the WorkersÂ’ Party.<br><br>The WorkersÂ’ Party has been a constant feature of SingaporeÂ’s political scene for half a century, witnessing the different stages of political development in Singapore and at each stage, played its role as an opposition party. The outcome has been mixed and the effect has been limited. However, despite the difficult political climate, WP has remained resilient, challenging the ruling party during each general election to provide a choice to Singaporeans. This is our contribution to the political process of our system of Parliamentary Democracy.<br><br>Since 1959 when the PAP became the only dominant party, the mass media has often portrayed opposition to be against the national interest and a source of instability to the nation. Opposition parties were labeled as irrational, opposing for the sake of opposition. The WorkersÂ’ Party has had to battle such propaganda to change this negative image.<br><br>In my view, the party has made good progress in this aspect after years of painstaking effort, through public policy discourse and ground work. We have to continue in this direction in a sustainable and consistent manner, so as to build public confidence in WP.<br><br>The WP leadership is committed to this direction and has executed strategies in the confidence-building process. However, the ultimate key lies in the people. Whether Singaporeans are prepared to do their part by joining WP and remaining actively involved in WP to build up the party is a decisive factor to determine whether the Workers� Party will be able to mark another milestone 50 years down the road.<br><br>The quality of members is a very important factor in a political party. Cadre members elect the core leadership and decide the direction and manner of political engagement of the party. To give every member a sense of ownership, we must encourage internal debate, discussion, and those with potential to assume leadership roles. But an individual leader, however capable, has a limited capacity. Without teamwork from trustworthy and responsible members, the party will not go far. And worse, if members leverage on the party for the pursuit of personal ambitions or self-interest, at the expense of the party interest, a party split is inevitable.<br><br>Members of the WorkersÂ’ Party have come from all walks of life; they have played different roles in the party. Without them, we wouldnÂ’t be here this evening to celebrate 50th anniversary. Just as WP has had a 50 year journey, many members are now in their 60s and older.<br><br>In GE 2006, WP was fortunate to have a group of younger Singaporeans born after independence who responded to the call to come forward to serve. But the numbers are still insufficient to make WP as effective as we would like it to be, i.e. to be able to provide an effective alternative choice to the people, to protect the political rights of the people and to contribute towards the move to make Singapore a First World Democracy.<br><br>Recently, during the sale of our Hammer newspaper, someone remarked to me that he would not want to buy the Hammer because WP is useless. I respect his view, but the reality is that WP would not be able to meet the expectations of everyone. The fact is that members of WP are like other ordinary Singaporeans facing time constraints and the need to balance work, career and family. We also face limitations in political space and the shortage of resources. We are not a profit making corporation, and our members and office bearers are all volunteers.<br><br>For those who feel that WP is not up to the mark, how about coming forward to do some public service? I challenge the critics of WP to join the Workers� Party to make it better! Only when there is a pool of credible human resources, can WP perform better. Only when there is new blood, can WP continue its renewal to meet societyÂ’s expectations.<br><br>On a broader level, when one talks about success at elections, the single most important factor is the will of the general public. I am of the view that there is a general aspiration in Singaporeans wanting opposition party to thrive, to articulate the peopleÂ’s sentiments in Parliament, and to certain extent, to balance the power of the govt.<br><br>But a general will for opposition has not been able to materialize for two reasons. First, the ruling party has used its incumbent�s advantage to amend legislation to limit political space, to change election ground rules, redraw electoral boundaries; it has also used stick &amp; carrot strategies during GE to block the wishes of the people. Secondly, voters do not have enough confidence in opposition parties for one reason or another.<br><br>The changes made by the ruling party via the GRC system has effectively divided contest at General Elections into two leagues. The first league is the GRC, the second league is Single Member Constituency or SMC. No opposition party has been able to win a GRC so far. Even in SMCs, no opposition candidate has unseated an incumbent MP for 15 years. If the situation continues, the opposition will be significantly weakened and its ability to contest elections to allow Singaporeans to exercise their political rights will be affected.<br><br>On the other hand, for the PAP, new candidates are sent to GRCs to contest and easily elected into Parliament. So the PAP achieves its objective of renewal easily. Even in the second league of SMCs, the PAP can redraw electoral boundaries to dissolve SMCs and create new ones depending on their assessment of ground support. SMCs are now contested by PAP candidates who are either office holders like Ministers of State, or incumbent MPs with strong grassroots support. Hence, to win in SMC now is also not an easy feat for opposition either.<br><br>In my view, as long as opposition is unable to secure a breakthrough in a GRC, the opposition remains a marginal player and at risk of extinction one day. Any talk of checks and balances and alternative government would be just talk, let alone the dream of seeing an opposition party winning an election and taking over the government like in mature western democracies.<br><br>In the history of the WorkersÂ’ Party, the watershed moment had been the 1981 by-election victory of the first opposition member of Parliament in Singapore since independence, Mr JB Jeyaretnam.<br><br>If we want our system of Parliamentary Democracy to be able to function properly, to allow Singaporeans real choices, and to promote good government for the next generation, seeking an opposition breakthrough in a GRC is a must.<br><br>The WorkersÂ’ Party had targeted winning GRCs since their inception in 1988, but without success. Let me assure you that we shall work toward another watershed at the next election to breakthrough a GRC!<br><br>To achieve this breakthrough, teamwork, party discipline and unity are vital.<br><br>The WorkersÂ’ Party will continue to strive hard without any let up. We believe that, notwithstanding any political arm-twisting tactic the PAP may deploy, voters are the backbone of WP. As long as the Â“one man, one voteÂ” system remains in operation, the right to decide is still in the hands of the voters.<br><br>It has certainly been no mean feat to survive this journey of ups and downs in opposition politics throughout the past 5 decades. While there have been breakthroughs and milestones, WP still needs your continuing support to ensure good governance and develop a First World Democracy where the People are empowered to determine the direction of the Nation.<br><br>The power to decide the future of our nation lies in your hands.<br><br>You have a Choice - Exercise this power or relinquish it.<br><br>Ultimately, this is your legacy!<br><br>Thank You.<br><br><a href="http://www.wp.sg/wordpress/?p=49#more-49" rel="nofollow">http://www.wp.sg/wordpress/?p=49#more-49</a></div>
