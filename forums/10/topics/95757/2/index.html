People will jump at all opportunities to criticise you because they dare not do so against the ruling party and they want to justify the sorry state of affairs in Singapore.<br><br>People must understand that the PAP is like this today simply because the Singapore People allowed them to do so.

If a check is required, the people can only do so hand in hand with the opposition and also the other way round.<br><br>But now the misconception of the duty of the opposition and the impression has been spoiled by the PAP and ingrained in an entire generation of Singaporeans.

            <div class='col-md body'>Juz my 2 cents...<br><br>in my research for my graduate degree i had to read parliamentary debates of countries like Australia and NZ where opposition members debated with the government. though the opposition( and equally many times the government were wrong) may not be always right but the fact that they were given the right to debate without fear of legal recriminations based on real or alluded offences had a healthy effect on the country. these are<br><br>1. there is no given assumption that whoever is in power is always right. so everyone has the right to contribute to the country without being made to feel stupid or worst, fearful. In the debate series, the debaters assume that what the other party says is open to criticism, hence they are prepared to defend with gusto and logic. overall effect, it sharpens the thinking of the country and the open debates, like between latham and howard allowed people to see and hear from themselves who represents them more. Like what roberteh said, the opposition is neutered even b4 they begin. no way u can see credible opposition, because even if they are credible, they won't get much airtime from our media about how good they are. unlike, democratic medias, where the entire government debate are held open for all to see. here, you usually see only the good about PAP rallies and snippets of the opposition doing stupid things. case in point, i remeber the tang liang hong case and the media coverage of the whole issue. can't help but think the whole thing was misrepresented to the public by the media for certain political achievements.<br><br>2. it is not true that the statement "we know what is good for you holds true for all governments." thousands of years of recorded human history teaches us that power unchecked corrupts. i was very perturbed when then PM Goh said something to the effect that the PAP proved that the adage "absolute power corrupts absoultely" has been debunked by the PAP because in the 30+ years it held power, it had not been corrupted. think again! the thin line of being corrupted can be crossed by those who define the line, and if history is of any use, it showed us it happened over and over again. the extremely short history of singapore is too short to prove anything. Does the PAP want to bet against thousands of years of recorded history? remeber, they bet, we lose.<br><br>That's why mature countries evolved into democracies only after much blood have been shed. because those who hold power would never tolerate opposiition in any form. it is human nature. that is also why an opposition is so important to the continuation of a country's future.  what we have here is a form of paying lip service to the form of having an opposition in the political system but much has been done to neuter it. i believe the opposition is not made up of fools but they have certainly been portrayed as such.<br><br>so far we have a decent government but again history proved that no dynasty lasted more than 3 good emperors usually. We are into our 3rd PM...do you think the 10th PM of Singapore would be as good as the first? perhaps.<br><br>if we test our candidate's either through trials (like Lee Kuan Yew) or through a tough selection/election process against a tough opponent who has nothing to fear speaking up against the imcumbent. i respect LKY because no one can doubt the odds he overcame but our leaders now are groomed, practically from birth, being told that they are somebody, without the test of hardship or elections. perhaps thats y they think they are really somebody and could even imagine that they can even go get themselves in between china and taiwan and think that the people there are gonna be awe-struck by their views. perhaps back here in s'pore they are already too used to having the media agreeing with them and praising them for the 'wisdom' they display in every silly little thing they say.<br><br>i fear we are politically inbreeding already. never spelt well for governments in history, would we be different?<br><br>sheesh..i am rambling and it is so late...am i making sense?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The answer is yes.<br><br>If countries all over the world could do it, why do you think it is impossible to do it here in Singapore? Asian countries did it too; so the "Asian Values" doesn't work here.<br><br>People are very "pragmatic", especially in Singapore. PAP thought they have "all the support" from people, but this is superficial. Most of those so call "supporters" only support it when it got the power. They have vested interests. Thus, if it loses power, these supporters will disappear. This happens to Suharto also, who has built up a whole network of "support" but eventually fell through it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>That is what happen to KMT in Taiwan too. However, KMT is slightly better as it could manage to keep its support base, though smaller in size.<br><br>Again, such "worry" theory is meaningless. The decay of PAP has begun more than 10 years ago. It is just a matter of time before it totally crumbles. Believe it or not, GRC is really a double edged sword. It is the source of weakness for PAP to evolve into doom. IF PAP doesn't reintroduce political competition via political reforms, it is just a matter of time that PAP would be split and become history in the end.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by arburthen?:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes everything may be intact, but don't forget none of the opposition has ever come to power and none of them knows how to run a government except maybe a ward or two.<br><br>Only PAP has been the ruling party for last 30 odd years thats means the 84 PAP MPs which you are hoping to boot has the membership support from LTA, MRT, SAF, NEL, SCDF, Police and what not.<br><br>If I was the ruling party and I just lost majority power to a political newbie opposition before I leave office I will turn everything upside down.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear fymk,<br><br>Our latest manifesto is at its finalization stage. Hopefully it could be out by year end. I will keep you posted on it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>You have raised very valid and important question; how to finance some of the things mentioned in our manifesto?<br><br>I will touch on this one in my "Vision" piece, of the role of government and public Finance.<br><br>For the meantime, I am having a little discussion in YPAP forum about this "overall vision", Democratic Socialism. PAP used to subscribed to Democratic Socialism but I think they have abandoned it totally. I will post part of my reply to this vision here.... please bear with me, this is not a complete opinion:<br><br>But I think socialism is inevitable. It is a matter of what form of socialism we want. There is a "new form" of socialism evolving in the world.<br><br>I believe in Democratic Socialism, just as PAP had believed in it in its foundation years. And it is true, PAP is neither democratic nor socialist after 39 years of evolution.<br><br>The ills of capitalism don't lie on the meritocracy it suppose to embrace. It lies on the miscontrued belief of elitism, cronyism as "meritocracy". Thus, in the end, we are walking towards to the similar ends of feudalism, which has proven that it could not work at all. The predicted "uprising" has the root cause of cronyism and elitism, not "meritocracy". In fact, if capitalism could stick closely to the foundation of meritocracy, it could have lasted forever, theoretically.<br><br>I do not see socialism as a full control of factors of production. If it is such, then it cannot work as it is against human nature. Ironically, it is a matter of relativity that defines socialism, against the evolving ills of capitalism. Socialism, to a new age definition, is to uphold social justice and equality, in terms of Equal opportunity which is in fact, an extension of meritocracy! Yes, upholding the very foundation of capitalism, meritocracy. Socialism is to preven the evolution of the social ills of elitism and cronyism which would most probably bring us back to feudalism.<br><br>It is inevitable that we should have socialism as when capitalism evolves, it will naturally ended up with inequality in income distribution. The only way to prevent "uprising" due to extreme difference in social distribution of wealth, is to have socialism as a mechanism of redistribution of income and resources by means of govt intervention. If not, allowing capitalism to carry on developing without any controls, it will result in what we have now, structural unemployment which will eventually result in extreme poverty within the capitalist system. When resources and job opportunities lessen, cronyism and elitism will take its bite further. It will become a vicious cycle.<br><br>Thus, in my view, we will still need a form of democratic socialism to fill up the gaps left by capitalism. PAP seems to have forgotten all its past. They should seriously relook into their idealism again.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fymk:</div><div class="quote_body">The way I see it .
