Its that we cannot please everyone. As it can be shown by the exchange. It is beyond our abilities and that of the PAP too!<br><br>Rest assured. i can see you. you are important.<br><br>It is hilarious but also saddening in a way. Even our opponents the PAP in our exchanges treat us with more respect than some of the forumites here.<br><br>Sigh! what to do, when we first stood out we were told that it will never be easy. People will jump at all opportunities to criticise you because they dare not do so against the ruling party and they want to justify the sorry state of affairs in Singapore.<br><br>People must understand that the PAP is like this today simply because the Singapore People allowed them to do so. And for so long. The opposition too did not get its act together. If a check is required, the people can only do so hand in hand with the opposition and also the other way round.<br><br>But now the misconception of the duty of the opposition and the impression has been spoiled by the PAP and ingrained in an entire generation of Singaporeans. It will take time to change.<br><br>Engaging in a firefight is not Meng Seng and i wanted but we had to engage in order to show the prejudice and stupidity that runs through some of the opposition haters.<br><br>These people claim that they want an opposition but if they are so demanding of the opposition, the opposition will never be good enough for them.<br><br>Sigh! We have taken the step and we shall run the gauntlet with no regrets.<br>this is our path. it cannot be avoided.<br><br>We only wish that more Singaporeans will be awakened.<br><br>Warmest Regards.<br></div>
