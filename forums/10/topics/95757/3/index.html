And inform all my supporters to not cooperate and drag their feet on general population issues.<br><br></div></blockquote>Yes that true but the law requires them to listen to the Legislature appointed Executive. When they have been booted out, who will listen to them? Maybe some stalwarts but not the Civil Service, they have the backing of the Law when it comes to this.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">By the time the opposition figures out how to run a government the term is up and the people by then has had enough of all the blunders and experimentation c ockups from the new government will be begging for my party's return to power. </div></blockquote>That is your hypothesis but it seems that you have forgotten that when the new incumbent is in power the entire ministries and stat boards report to their new bosses. They need not do everything themselves. Just set out policy directions. The new bosses do not have to re-invent the wheel just make improvements where needed.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">Classical case look at indonesia, they didn't want surharto so they brought on in a so call democratic government hoping things would be better, apparently not. In almost 10years they have had 4 governments change hands, civil unrest, another civil war in Acheh, endless riots, ethnic clensing violence and these terroists who were hiding in the shadows now brazenly walk in daylight, need I say more?<br><br>The people of indonesia has had enough. And now the they are begging for a military figurehead to return to power as seen in their most recent election.<br></div></blockquote>Are you saying that Singapore is the same as indonesia?<br>What basis for comparison do you have?<br>Do you know how big is Singapore ang how big is Indonesia?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I don't agree with you.<br></strong></blockquote>That's OK. you have the right to. i wont hate you for that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>And frankly I don't think you know what the hell you talking about. </strong></blockquote>Oh my! that's serious perhaps you should go find out more first.<br>Try to understand how the political system works then continue your posts.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Thats why I say if opposition want to come to power can they take over seamlessly? </strong></blockquote>Anyway, the original question is if the opposition come to power can they take over seamlessly. Now it has mutated. My my these days many things mutate not just viruses. and at an alarming rate too! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>If all the pap ministers just drop everything and walk out tomorrow to go holiday for a year </strong></blockquote>Ask yourself frankly, will they do it? They will not even fight an election on a level playing field. Will they ever do that? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>can the current opposition able to come in and 'catch it' and continue to run things as though nothing has happened?</strong></blockquote>The finale of your reply shows the unfairness of your reasoning.<br>"can the current opposition" is what you say now.<br>The current opposition cannot kcik the PAP out and it cnnot even contest all 84 seats.<br><br>The original question was "if the opposition comes into power" this means more than 42 seats must be won.<br><br>At the last GE less than 42 seats were contested.<br><br>The answer to your final question is of course a "No." <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

The Civil Service is duty bound to obey the new government in accordance with the law if that materialises.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>But know one thing none of the foreign investors will wait that long, the minute they smell trouble or unrest, they will pack up and go. </strong></blockquote>Thats what the PAP wants you to believe - trouble and unrest<br>Foreign investors come from countries and in most countries there has been change of governments and also more level political playing field, elections are nothing scary to them<br><br>On the other hand, no need to wait that long given the current economic policies of the present government, some investors have already packed up and left.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I on the other hand will be more willing to wait for PAP to split up at least that way the group that splits away still retains semblence of support from various government agencies.

The hypothetical scenario of PAP split was first brought out by PM Lee (Senior) then as he was as his view as to when there would be two party Parliament in Singapore.<br><br>You can wait. thats your prerogative. however you will be waiting for a long time because this so called split will never happen because the PAP people will not want to rock their own boat in an attempt to introduce reform. And reform is something which they are very much unwilling to undertake in substance.<br></div>

And all we do is close the door and play S-League and think Tampines Rovers are the best. In time, our leaders cannot take on other countries. If PAP wants that, we give it to them.

Why can't I just be an obedient citizen because all I want is to make money. If I were to be seen as a trouble-maker, the ISD can come after me. Sound like the Waffen-SS during WWII eh?<br><br>I have the following to say to the 2 extreme types of people:<br><br>Businessmen who just wanna make money:<br>Just be pro-govt, whoever may be the govt. Coz some things there were once illegal can be made legal again as long as there is benefits for the govt. Eg. lifting the ban of sale of certain chewing gums in exchange for FTA. As long as we share our profits with the govt, we will live happily ever after.<br><br>People who live their dreams and principles:<br>Pursue your dreams. If you want to govern the country, inherit this population that blames you for everything that don't go their way, by all means. You may be able to change them and make Singapore a better place to live in.<br><br>To each his own. There is no right or wrong.
