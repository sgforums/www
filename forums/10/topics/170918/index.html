And he employed "the simple tricks of advocacy -- contradictions between one witness and another, contradiction between a witness and his previous statement to the police and the preliminary enquiry."</blockquote><blockquote>Pointing out that the French and other Latin nations do not use trial by jury, Lee Kuan Kew argues that it is too "alien" to the basic social attitudes of many other cultures, including those of Asia.</blockquote>2.<br><br><strong><a href="http://www.abanet.org/media/faqjury.html" rel="nofollow">Frequently Asked Questions About the Grand Jury System</a></strong><br><br>3.<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial#See_also" rel="nofollow">PROs and CONs of jury system.</a></strong><br><br>4.Some local and most of foreigners critize PAP abolished jury system<br>in order to control the jurisdiction.Buy how can a layman to know<br>the true or false of another profession,or to find the truths of a case?<br>Even the jury is a professional.say  a lawyer,can he determine<br>the accounts of a complicated commercial case?<br>So shall we Sporean just follow blindly what the US,UK did for many<br>years in jury system?Find out what are the pros and cons.<br><br>5.After u do your home works,voice your own opions on jury system,<br>no matter u for or against it.<br>It is a shame that we Sporean just follw the old practises of<br>other countries without examining the system.<br>But i am not saying we do just to make a difference.<br>The ultimate question is if the new method or system will<br>make Sg a better place to stay.<br><br>6.Anyway,<a href="http://www.edb.gov.sg/edb/sg/en_uk/index/why_singapore/singapore_rankings.html" rel="nofollow">Sg is the top 11th country in the world in WORLDWIDE QUALITY<strong><br>OF LIFE INDEX by EIU 2005.</strong></a><br><br>7.In economy,<strong><a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/countries.cfm" rel="nofollow">Sg is the second freest </a></strong><br><br>8<a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/country.cfm?id=Singapore" rel="nofollow"><blockquote> and that the judiciary has a notable record of siding with prominent politicians against political opposition.</blockquote></a><br><br>9.Any ratings in jurisdiction system?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lionnoisy,<br><br>pre) how come u r not examining the pros and cons of a one-judge system either?<br><br>1) That's LKY's own opinion; we don't need to keep listening to him.<br><br>2) ???<br><br>3) hmmm...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>4) Did you read Denyse Tessenhohn's commentary in TODAY? She sharply criticized the ignorance of many academically-trained experts and asked everyone why should we rely on experts so much. So one of the cons of the jury system is that jurors might be too emotional; And supposedly a judge can't? Unless you can prove that a single judge can fully restrain his emotions while judging a case, the argument doesn't hold.<br><br>Anyway, would you be pacified if we had a jury consisting entirely of professional lawyers?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>5) Have you read up on the other side yet??<br><br>6) Just what is used to measure quality of life? I suspect that the EIU survey measured quality of life in terms of average income, which is of course inaccurate since some people earn much more than others. If they measured it in terms of housing, then tey probably didn't take into consideration the quality of housing and housing expenditure out of gross income should be taken into consideration too.<br><br>7) Economic freedom has nothing to do with whether there is a jury or not. So this point doesn't strengthen your argument.<br><br>8 ) And it appears that our CJ has a notable record of siding with govenrment politicians in cases against opposition politicians.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>9) shall look for it.<br><br>the (unconvinced) pikamaster</div>
