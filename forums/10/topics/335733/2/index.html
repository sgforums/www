              <p>its unlikely for him to be paying any fees he owns the state, and he's definately chalked up a lot of those plus his usual habit seems to be "come lah 7 more days i scared you ah?!"</p>
              <p>and this amount of money spent no matter how big or small is unnecessary, comparing it to a bigger amount doesn't make it better. its just the kettle calling the pot black.</p>

              <p>Recently I heard a comment from a relative of mine takes pride
              in the mentality that the only the fittest survive in
              Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I certainly do not agree with the statment that she made. Simply
              because it would imply that Singaporeans who have felt no love for
              the country left and took up Citizenship with another country are
              all weak? And for those who stayed on in Singapore and not doing
              very well are weak too!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I have said before, Singaporeans are treated worse off than
              an animal, "Eat less than a pig, work more than a bull/cow". "You
              can be dead but no sick in Singapore".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why should anyone who is able to escape this kind of treatment
              stay on? I do not belive that there is any value of any kind in
              holding a Singaporean Citizenship other than convience of the
              passport.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the recent movie by Jack Neo "Money No Enough 2" it clearly
              demostrates how sad it is for the children to be wishing that their
              mum leaves the world sooner as she is a fianancial burden on
              them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is simply not good enough that the Government says that we
              cannot afford a decent health care system. What are they there for?
              With all their brilliant minds and talents? To suck more money out
              of us???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most Singaporeans couples work two to three jobs between them
              and as such the children gets less attention, there is less family
              time. Whose fault is it when the children gets into trouble with
              the law? We were told about family values by our "Singapore
              God" and we are different to the Western society, are we?? We
              are conservative etc, this implied that Western society are
              not???This is ignorance on the part of the ruling party.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unable to insult public servant?Why not?? I mean we pay them
              right? If I keep a dog, I could at least call it a fucking bitch
              right? Get this straight, why can't I call any of our so called
              talented leaders a fuck wit? Is it because of our so called
              oriental background about emperors and kings and subjects?</p>

              <p>I don't think that people who left Singapore to work/stay in overseas would have meant that they are weak. Every society has a certain theme and trend which may not be necessary suitable for each and everyone of us.</p>
              <p>I don't know how did your relative come up with that idea. But just ignore her lah. I believe many of us would have met a handful of irritating people in our lives too.</p>

              democracy.</p>
              <p>The bad point is that we heavily depend on our government. If it
              falls, we falls. That is the only pillar we have. Hence, based on
              this structure, it is important to have strong, decent and able
              government.</p>
