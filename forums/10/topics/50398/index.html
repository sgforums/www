Yes, there are some very good people here and I have some great Singaporean friends and colleagues but, as a populace, general civility is sadly lacking.<br><br>So why am I still here? Sure, Singapore has a lot to offer and is a challenging city in which to work. Yes, it's clean, safe, the income tax is low and so on, but what really makes a country is its people, and Singaporeans need to wake up to the fact that basic courtesy is easy to practise and makes for a far happier society.<br><br>What frustrates and saddens me on a daily basis is that when I take an escalator, nine times out of 10, Singaporeans will stand side by side, denying me of my option to walk rather than stand.<br><br>When shopping or dining out, I can expect poor service as the norm; when alighting from a train, Singaporeans will try to push their way in before I can get out; when I hold a door open, a Singaporean will walk through but will rarely say thank you and will leave the door to slam in the face of the next person.<br><br>At a taxi stand, when I am about to get into a cab, the alighting passenger will slam the door for me to reopen.<br><br>I have had to call the police to settle a dispute with a neighbour who continued to create noise disturbance every night despite my polite pleas for his consideration of others' need for sleep.<br><br>When driving and I indicate my desire to change lanes, a Singaporean driver will speed up to ensure I don't get in front of him.<br><br>When I withdraw money at an ATM, a Singaporean behind me will peer over my shoulder.<br><br>When selecting my lunch at the local hawker centre, a Singaporean will start to bark his order to the vendor.<br><br>Many foreigners I know have cut short their contracts and returned home because they can no longer stomach the ungracious Singaporean.<br><br>Come on, Singapore, it isn't so difficult to be courteous. The world will thank and respect you for it.<br><br>ERNIE BENSON<br><br>---------------------------------------------------<br><br>HAVING lived in Singapore for 1 1/2 years now, I was surprised to learn the Lion City ranks third among the world's least friendly cities. It should have ranked No. 1. When it comes to common courtesy, manners and graciousness, Singapore takes home the booby prize.<br><br>Take my ride on the MRT from Buona Vista to Tanjong Pagar on Tuesday morning. My pregnant state, coupled with the lurches of the train, threw me off balance not once but twice.<br><br>Four weeks from delivering a baby and nobody offered me his seat - not the teenager who pretended to be engrossed in an SMS session, nor the businessman who quickly looked away from my imploring eyes.<br><br>It was not an isolated incident. I ride the MRTto and from work every day and am constantlyamazed at Singaporeans' lack of compassion towards pregnant women, women carrying children or the elderly.<br><br>GENEVIEVE PRIEST (MRS)<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>NO<br><br>AT ABOUT 10.30 last Friday morning, I took a taxi from my condominium on Upper Thomson Road to Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre, and inadvertently left a briefcase in it. I had a medical appointment and was able to report the loss only after returning home at about 12.30.<br><br>When I telephoned the Lakeview Radio Taxi Service, the despatcher knew immediately what I was talking about. She told me the driver had already turned in the brief case, which contained a book I had on loan - the loss of which would have been most embarrassing - as well as several important medical prescriptions.<br><br>We arranged that the driver would take the case to my home, and he arrived within half an hour. He had come some distance, but refused to be paid for the trip, saying he had not put down his meter (I had to insist on showing my appreciation).<br><br>I would like to thank the Lakeview Radio Taxi Service and the driver of cab SHB 1410 M for their very friendly, helpful and efficient cooperation. I shan't forget it in a hurry.<br><br>It was typical of the best side of Singaporeans, and explains why it is a pleasure for a foreigner to live here. The survey published recently in The Straits Times that put Singapore almost bottom of the list of countries ranked according to the friendliness of their citizens was, of course, so much bunkum.<br><br>DENNIS BLOODWORTH<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I ARRIVED in Singapore eight years ago with a dream, a borrowed laptop and two suitcases.<br><br>I survived a currency crisis, Sept 11, the Internet bubble and the severe acute respiratory syndrome. The business conditions and living environment here have enabled me to concentrate on building my public relations consultancy, which now serves clients like Datacraft Asia, Philips and NortelNetworks. I don't know if I could have done this anywhere else in Asia.<br><br>Over eight long and sometimes-lucky years, Singapore has been a safe harbour from which to build a business and a wonderful social life. I want to say 'Xie Xie' to all the friends, staff, suppliers and clients who have made Singapore my home.<br><br>JIM JAMES<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In case anyones wondering, the above letters are in reponse to a survey done internationally which ranked Singaporeans 3rd from bottom in terms of courtesy and friendliness. The surveyors used 2 tests to determine a country's friendliness, the percentage of people who<br><br>- returned a deliberately dropped pen<br>- help an injured person (a surveyor who was acting injured)<br><br>ST published an article not long after, refuting the claims of Singaporeans being an unfriendly lot and citing interviews it conducted with a few tourists and expats here and from the quotes from about 3-4 people, concluding the survey was off. No prizes for guessing that the tourists who ST quoted in their article wer fulsome in their praise for Singaporean's courtesy.<br><br>Heres my view, Singaporeans are not a friendly people by nature. Of course, there are shining lights, but I'm ashamed to say these people are rare and don't come across them that often. We have a long way to go in this department and unfortunately I think things will get worse. Parents and schools seem to ignore teaching kids proper manners (apparently grades are the only yardstick to measure success of a person by in Singapore) and what I've seen are lots ill-mannered people on the streets who<br><br>- think they're the only person who exist in this world<br>- seem think saying thank you, sorry or excuse me is a big humiliation for themselves and  their families<br><br>Any thoughts?</div>

Sometime feels ashamed to be a singaporean. Wonder if the sch. are still teaching social studies??<br><br>Our ppl have become to be arrogant, selfish, and extReme Kiasu! If any of u out there dun agree, take a short trip like 3 mths out of S'pore, u will definitly notice the ugly side of our ppl. Having living in US for a while, i truely had a great cultural shock when i came bk home. example, when in a lift, u greet a person good morning, he would look at u as if u are siao. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   In MRT, u have problem getting down b'cos ppl are rushing in b4 u get off.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

A lot of people tried to offer help to those who were injured. I was at the scene myself, and though it's cruel it was hilarious to see so many people tumble down  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote>well.. maybe it's just cultural matter. i mean.. it's not only happen in singapore. say.. in my country, jakarta where i live now.. the same thing happen here. what make it worst is.. the facilities we got here is extremely lousy that even make people don't bother abt others. and in hong kong.. they walk very fast, they tend don't see others.. worst than singapore i think.<br><br>i have quite a nice experience when i was visiting yr country. i was kinda lost when i try to find keppel road and extremly blur which transportations i should take. then an old man (he was very nice and have a very fluent english) asked me if i got lost or what and he directed me which bus i should take.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>see.. not all singaporeans are ignorant. some are nice. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
