They are not committing any mischief. WP is an organization about the People afterall. Obviously for it to operate, it must be allowed to interact and reach out to help the community bond and build  better synergy.  This kind of people bonding can only be good for society.<br><br>Thus, it should be encouraged. Singapore belongs to all citizens. Not 1 party. correct or not?<br><br>All of us pay tax. correct or not?<br><br>So, I hope to join WP in their up coming mass activity. Whatever it may be. Indoor or Outdoor. The most important thing is to achieve an approval in any activity. Else, there is not future for WP since they cannot get approval to organise anything.  I am confident WP has the gift of the gap to convince the authorities to approve at least 1 event. Keep on trying! Rome was not built in 1 day!
