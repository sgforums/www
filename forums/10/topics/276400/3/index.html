And this is also why only the People's support can help ensure a balance of situations. We must understand what is the actual situation.  Reading the news and listening to the radio will not be sufficient info to understand the current situation. We need to hear more views to understand more.  We need to listen to both sides of the parties.<br><br>Can I suggest, as I suggested before in another thread, to have a cycling organiser organise the event and WP apply as public member to join in the cycling. I am sure this is possible. Many cycling events get approved many times before. What WP need to refrain from doing is making speech, for now.<br>I hope WP be persistent in attempt to reach out much more than ever before. No matter how tough it is to get approval to cycle, you must try to cycle. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   If that cannot be done, how about apply for chess playing competition? Or fishing tournament? Or helping the less fortunate by going from blocks to blocks and help the residents?  Nothing can be approved? It would be a very sad thing if so.  What would other 1st world democracies think!?<br><br>Singapore must be capable of showing that she means it when she says she want to be a more inclusive society.  She must show she has what it takes to claim as 1st world standard.<br></div>

The gahmen treasure them as workers in Singapore to the extent that they have placed a statue of an indian worker in the open field opposite Mustafa.  This is how far the PAP shows their appreciation to the foreigners, I don't see them doing anything to show their appreciation to our contribution to the country.  Double standard.</div>
