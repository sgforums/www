            <div class='col-md body'>Melvin your (WP excomrade?) said WP cycling event is open to public. True or not??<br><br>From sammyboy:<br>From:  F-4E Phantom II - Lord (TiLik)   14:10<br>To:  KwonZ unread  123 of 123<br><br>150808.123 in reply to 150808.120<br><br>From:  KwonZ   12:59<br>To:  F-4E Phantom II - Lord (TiLik)<br><br>What you and your crony have done is to strip away the basis for the questions to support your stand.<br><br>The fact of the matter is that hopengkee was being less than truthful. The fact that pappies have done similar cycling get-togethers is a clear sign that he was less than truthful in his initial response to LTK.<br><br>KwonZ<br><br>Sigh. I don't think you understand LaMei's statements enough to even know what she was asking. Let us have it all in context:<br><br>1. WP MPs question Ho Peng Kee on refusal of permit for cycling event.<br><br>2. LTK exchange with HPK does not go well, Ho Peng Kee makes an unpleasantremark.<br><br>3. Internet activists like you speak up against HPK, YoungPAP cycling event brought out to show unfair discrimination against WP.<br><br>4. LaMei questions nautre of WP cycling event - open to public or not? which may be the reason why YoungPAP's event allowed and WP's event is not. It seems that Young PAP's event was just for its members.<br><br>5. WP representatives have not replied on LaMei's queries.<br><br>6. Discussion goes on on why remark is avoidable or not and whether or not remark is unacceptable or is acceptable robust parliamentary engagement?<br><br>7. You make the statement that my and my crony strip away the basis for the questions to support my stand.<br><br>Do you see it clearly now?<br><br></div>

Not difficult to attract talents at all.   Comparatively, WP does not have the money and yet manage to find a few good men and women.

            <div class='col-md body'>What has the cycling being opened to the public got to do with the licensing issue? East Coast is a public place, if the WP members gather there to celebrate their 50th anniversary, there will be bound to have people who recognize them and join.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is quite strange that the application was denied given that other parties could get the permit before.<br><br>We should ask ourselves what is the implication if WP accept the decision without appeal.<br><br>Its not just the cycling thing the way I see it. It implies many more things.<br>In future, what if someone apply for other activities and also get the same reason for denial of permit? And everyone also accept without appeal?<br><br>How 1st world is singapore?<br><br>Cycling is not illegal. Why cannot approve? Many Singaporeans support the WP , not just the PAP. Why WP cannot organise for its supporters a casual cycling event? If something is done wrong, they can charge WP. But nothing has happened!   Singapore is made up of singaporeans. Singaporeans also support WP.  Lets not ignore this fact. We should respect this fact.<br><br>As suggested in the forum, WP should apply many other activities and see if all are denied. Try 101 activites and see if they can give the same excuse for 101 activities and let the public judge our leaders.<br><br>Having legal assistance could do no bad also , I think.  Doesn't WP have such talents?<br><br>I hope the HPK can give a more convincing reason for disapproval.<br><br></div>

Last time he ask pple who don't agree with him to join politics...... sound like Wooden Goh ask Catherine Lim to join opposition..... ????<br></div></blockquote>Hi,<br><br>I can't speak for others. Personally, I have previously suggested to some netizens that one can make a bigger difference contributing to any opposition political party than internet debate or blogging, not that the latter cannot make a difference but it would be a smaller one "per capita" individual.<br><br>I meant it as an invitation, not a challenge <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> and am open to disagreements.<br><br>In my opinion, the PAP will feel more pressure with 84 opposition candidates than 84 serious bloggers. The same level of pressure can be applied only if there are, say, 8,400 serious bloggers.<br><br>I beg to differ with SM Goh's message to Ms Catherine Lim, which I deem as a challenge. Furthermore, the SM told Ms Lim to join his opponents, whereas I am inviting others to replace people without talents in opposition parties like myself <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>In other words, SM was showing Ms Lim the entrance of a dungeon; I am laying out a red carpet <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As to your other post, the following are all that I wish to comment from my understanding:<br><br>1) WP's cycling event was only for WP members and their family members whom the Party will register beforehand.<br><br>2) As far as I know, Mr Low isn't offended by AP Ho's remarks. The former happened to have removed his ear piece for a few seconds due to an itch, which caught the eye of the latter and led him to make the impromptu response in jest. Hence, I feel Mr Low can't be said to be unable to acceptable robust parliamentary engagement.<br><br>Regards</div>
