            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Lazerlordz<br><br>I am not surprised about PAP practising double standard.   They are practising double standard all these years.<br><br>Just look at the issue on salary.   MIWs who are over 60 are still getting fat salary, no salary reduction.  For the ordinary folks, PAP said for those who are 60 and above who are working are to receive salary cut/reduction.   Widening of income gap -  they are the ones who raised their salary so high (highest paid gahmen in the world) which widens the income gap, ironically now they are talking about doing something to it.<br><br>Thus, this ruling party has no credibility.   They are making it more and more difficult for the people to trust them.</div>
