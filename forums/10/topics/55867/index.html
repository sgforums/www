Goh's People's Action Party (PAP) has been in power since 1959.<br><br>In an earlier poll, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew -- the father of deputy prime minister Lee -- was chosen by Yahoo users as Singaporean of the Year in the run-up to city-state's independence day celebrations on August 9.<br><br>The senior Lee, who turns 80 next month, stepped down as prime minister in 1990 in favor of Goh, who has suggested publicly that the junior Lee, a former brigadier general in the Singapore armed forces, should soften his tough public image.<br><br>According to a spokesman, Yahoo reaches about 500,000 Singaporeans and receives 22,000 opinions daily on community message boards.<br><br>About 80 percent of Yahoo's users are between 18 and 54 years of age, with an almost even gender split.<br><br></div>

Every rumour has its beginnings from some grain of truth. The way he handled his first marriage was a fiasco. The story abt him slapping S. Dana? Somehow i dun think it's entirely false.<br><br>Fact is, an internet poll can be rigged. Opinions can be influenced.<br><br>I have no doubt LHL was already the next PM. </div></blockquote>At the same time that the rumor of the slapping incident occurred, it was surprising that Tony Tan and Danabalan both quit the cabinet at the same time.<br><br>At that time, Tony Tan was only a Defense Minister, and Danabalan was Foreign Minister (?) or was he then Finance Minister (?) - while the brilliant LHL was the DPM, Second Defense Minister and Minister Trade and Industries.<br><br>Yet when Tony Tan returned to the Cabinet, he was made <strong>DPM</strong> and Defense Minister - equal in Cabinet Position as LHL, who was also DPM and Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore - (giving up his portfolio of Trade &amp; Industries Minister to George Yeo) .<br><br>So no more overbearing behavior from LHL on the Defense Minister ?<br><br>Dana remained out of the cabinet - (the slap must have stung ? ) .<br><br>That LHL will be the next DPM was left in little doubt, but another surprise came about three years ago, when GCT was in the front page of the Straits Times saying:<br><br>"Don't push me, or I will dig my heels deeper. I will go when I am ready to go"<br><br>Now what prompted him to say that ?<br><br>Wonder who is pushing him to quit ?<br><br>Are we reading too much into movements in the sand ?<br><br></div>

Sand dunes shift overnight. Given the fact that this recession is not abt to disappear in a few years, we might get more of these emotional outbursts soon....</div>
