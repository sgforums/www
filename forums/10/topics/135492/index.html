            <div class='col-md body'>I read the following article in the Electronic New Paper, and I wonder what the f-u-c-k, is wrong with people in Singapore???<br><br>I suggest the authorities take strong and stringent views/actions towards the issue of Maid Abuse in Singapore, as it is giving us all, a VERY bad reputation. Especially when we are considering ourselves as a "developed" country.<br><br>I feel SHAMEFUL! These sort of maid agencies should be shut down, and employers who abuse their maids physically, should be made liable to be given 6 strokes of the cane along with a 2 years prison term!!!<br><br>I am strongly, against inhumane acts!!!!<br><br>====================================================<br><br>THE woman refused to let go of Madam Barbara Peters' hands.<br><br>--Pics/KUA CHEE SIONG and DOMINIC YING<br>Miss Wilma, 23, a Filipina, told her that she had been abused by her maid agent.<br><br>They had just alighted from a bus which Miss Wilma had jumped into to ask for help.<br><br>Madam Peters (below), 53, said: 'She kept holding on to my hand. I asked her to sit down at the bus stop but she didn't want to.<br><br>'She said she was afraid the agency people would see her... We went to some place behind the building where I called the police.'<br><br>Miss Wilma had dashed barefoot onto the bus at a bus stop in the East Coast on Tuesday.<br><br>She started asking the passengers to help her.<br><br>Then as the bus passed a maid agency, she ducked.<br><br>Said Madam Peters, a childcare teacher: 'She was barefoot, her T-shirt was torn and she looked liked a lost child.'<br><br>The bus driver told Madam Peters that the woman wanted to go to the police station.<br><br>Then she begged Madam Peters: 'Ma'am, can you please help me? Can you take me to the police station?'<br><br>That's when Madam Peters agreed and asked Miss Wilma to get off the bus with her.<br><br>Miss Wilma claimed that just one day after she arrived in Singapore to work as a domestic maid, she was slapped across her face - twice.<br><br>She alleged that her abuser was one of the bosses from the maid agency which had brought her to Singapore.<br><br>Speaking to The New Paper from Changi General Hospital, Miss Wilma said that she arrived in Singapore less than two weeks ago, on 24 May, from her hometown, Roxas City, in the Philippines.<br><br>Soon after, Miss Wilma claimed, her recruiter in the Philippines had called the agency and asked to speak to her.<br><br>SCOLDED<br><br>With shoulders hunched, the small-framed, soft-spoken maid said: '(The recruiter) just wanted to ask me if I was all right. The (agency's woman boss) took the phone and threw it at me. It hit me on my forehead.<br><br>'She scolded me and said the phone was for business only, nobody can use the phone.'<br><br>The next day, Miss Wilma claimed, she was slapped across the face, once on each cheek.<br><br>'I don't know why she slapped me, I don't know what I did... She was very angry, she's always angry.'<br><br>Taken by surprise, Miss Wilma said she just sat quietly in a corner.<br><br>She claimed that one night she had gone to the boss' house for training but had menstrual cramps.<br><br>When she informed the woman, she alleged she was verbally abused and threatened.<br><br>She alleged that she was later told to sleep on the floor next to the washing machine, with only a pillow and blanket.<br><br>Several days later, Miss Wilma was placed with a family. She said her employers were 'very nice'.<br><br>However, after two days, they sent her back to the agency for more training.<br><br>She claimed she was sent back because she could not cook.<br><br>Back at the agency, the verbal abuse and threats continued.<br><br>She said: '(The woman boss) pulled my T-shirt and dragged me into the storeroom and then she pushed me against the wall.<br><br>'She pulled me outside again (by the collar) and told me to sit down, cannot move.'<br><br>Miss Wilma showed us a few scratches on her chest, which she said was a result of this incident.<br><br>She said she was not given any dinner that night, nor was she given breakfast or lunch the following day.<br><br>What she was given, however, was a brown drink and four painkillers for her stomach cramps and backache.<br><br>She also claimed she was told to drink the same brown concoction and take six painkillers the next morning.<br><br>Miss Wilma said that after being threatened with harm, she was so fearful she just did as she was told.<br><br>WANTS TO GO HOME<br><br>That same morning, when she saw the two bosses leave the agency, she said she decided to run away.<br><br>She said: 'I want to go home. I'm very scared, I want to go back.'<br><br>Throughout most of our conversation, she sought comfort from her aunt who visited her in the hospital. Her aunt works here.<br><br>She had her arm on her aunt's lap, often looking at her for assurance.<br><br>Before coming to Singapore, Miss Wilma used to work as a salesgirl in her hometown and in Manila.<br><br>Like many other domestic workers here, she had come to Singapore so that she could support her two younger sisters who are in college in the Philippines, and her mother, a farmer.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Police confirm maid taken to hospital<br><br>THE police confirmed they received a phone call from a member of the public who said a maid needed help.<br><br>Police spokesman ASP Victor Keong said the maid was taken to a hospital for medical examination, and they are investigating her allegations.<br><br>When The New Paper called the agency on Wednesday and asked if a maid had run away, the director of the company said 'there was nothing of that sort' and hung up.<br><br>We called again about half an hour later and got a woman, who put us through to her 'boss'.<br><br>This time, asked about the runaway maid, he claimed 'we already brought her back'.<br><br>HUNG UP AGAIN<br><br>The New Paper had visited Miss Wilma just hours earlier, and she had said the agency did not know where she was nor had they tried to contact her.<br><br>So, we asked where he had brought her back from. He refused to say, and hung up - again. A third try yesterday received the same response from the director.<br><br>A check showed the agency started operations about two years ago and is accredited by the Association of Employment Agencies Singapore (Aeas).<br><br>When contacted, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said the agency has not lodged any report with the ministry about a runaway foreign domestic worker.<br><br>A spokesman said: 'MOM takes a serious view of any offence against foreign domestic workers.<br><br>'Once reported, the police and MOM will conduct thorough investigations into all complaints of abuse.'<br><br>Under the Employment Agencies' Act, the Commissioner for Labour can revoke the licence of an employment agency if the agency is found to have acted in a manner likely to be detrimental to the interest of the agency's clients or maids.<br><br>Maids who are abused can contact MOM at 6339-5505.<br></div>

The govt, specifically MOM, should really do something to correct the situation.<br><br>For eg, the govt could introduce minimum wage for maids and compulsory day off per week. In addition, the employer should be required to send the maid for regular medical checkup with a local doctor who will issue a certificate to be copied to MOM.<br><br>We need appropriate measures to prevent more tragic cases from happening.<br><br></div>

Also, sometimes the employer does not abuse the maid, but due to the vast difference in environment, lonliness  and desperation, can cause a person to do drastic things without abuse. It really depend on how the individual copes with stress so I wouldn't say it is the employers mistake all the time.<br><br>Just the flip side of the coin.</div></blockquote>Yes, there are many employers in Singapore who treat their maids like family members and their maids 'own' the kitchen. The maids in these families get birthday gifts, angpows during CNY, gifts for Christmas, much like everyone else in the homes they work for.<br><br>I understand, too, that it is not uncommon or difficult for maids from Indonesia to acquire documentation falsifying their age. A family I know of once found themselves with a maid who was actually a mere 15 although her  identification papers showed she was in her early twenties. They sent her back to the agency because the girl exhibited behaviour that indicated she was not mature enough to handle her duties, even for a small family without young children.</div>

In every society, there'll be the black sheep, both among employers as well as maids. Dun see how minimum wage will improve problem.

Hong Kong has a minimum wage of HK 3670 which is roughly about S$700.<br><br>However, Hong Kong plans to cut the minimum salary of foreign domestic helpers by 400 HK dollars and impose a levy of the same amount, ie 400 HK dollars for vocational training.<br><br>Training for domestic maids in Spore is minimal and is left to the maid agencies. More often than not, so-called maid training is just another form of abuse.<br><br>Imo, part of the levy should go towards supporting a level of minimum wage and part of it should go towards proper maid training. A minimum wage policy will help to correct the impression that Sporeans (in fact it's the Spore govt) are exploiting maids coming from poor neighbouring countries. Employers in Spore are paying good money but they could be getting better value.<br><br>As far as punishment is concerned, I believe there is sufficient deterrent measures. What is missing is appropriate preventive measures. It's better to prevent abuse from occurring in the first place than to punish after the criminal acts have been committed. There'd be less tears all 'round at the end of the day.</div>
