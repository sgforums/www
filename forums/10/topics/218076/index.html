We have too many vague issues in Singapore and not enough answers. Deviant groups are appearing and disappearing like fog, so it's hard to deal with them directly.<br><br>Religion is thus righteous to the self-righteous. Unless we ban all religions altogether, there is no long term solution. As long as one religion appears to malign and present false information about another, there will still be a justification for terrorists to kill and murder.</div>
