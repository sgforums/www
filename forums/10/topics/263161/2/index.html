            <div class='col-md body'>So what on earth is Gazelle trying to argue here? That we might as well give up on our local status and become an expat ourselves? Indeed, what thing can he hope to achieve by highlighting the better deal you can get as a mistress instead of a wife and end up making more people want to play the role of the wife less? If this way of myopic thinking is not one of the reasons why we are losing our people, IÂ’m not sure what else is.<br><br>LOL, itÂ’s like pointing out how efficient the fire department is without doing anything to prevent or put out the fire in your own home.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to those talking about employment on local terms. By the definition of expats, they are generally more wellpaid than the normal workign hacks around anyway. is it any surprise they can enjoy the quality of life here more?<br><br>and i think it the cultural differences too if you are talking about europeans. From my experience they are really much more willing to spend to the extend of little or negligible savings and such; so its not surprised they are not that put off by higher prices too since even at same salaries they are willing to spend more of the income on the now.</div>
