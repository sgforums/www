He is presently a PhD candidate at Monash University, Australia.<br><br>Upon his return, he released his book Self-Censorship: SingaporeÂ’s Shame (1999), which examines why people are afraid to speak up. The book reached the number one spot on the best-sellers list at MPH, the local bookstore chain. Events around the book and his use of the Internet led to the founding of Think Centre, a multi-partisan organisation. He also organised the Â‘Save JBJ RallyÂ’ and in 2001 published his second book on Singapore entitled Internet Politics.<br><br>In recognition of his ability to mobilise people for political action through the Internet, Asiaweek voted him as one of AsiaÂ’s Most Powerful Communicators in 2001.

I never understood that argument about having a lawyer draft that statement. Gomez is a PHD candidate for god sake. if Gomez cant draft a simple apology in simple english dont understand what PHD he is doing then. Its clear from the PAP they are just attempting character assasination here. I hope people do not fall for this whole Gomez saga with the PAP. Georgie boy has got to come up with a better argument.</div>
