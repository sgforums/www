            <div class='col-md body'>The sale of the giant Thai Telecoms operator - Shin Corp - to Temasek is creating a Political Uproar in Thailand due to shady deals that are now surfacing - as reported in the <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Bangkok Post</span></strong>. <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.net/News/01Feb2006_news01.php" rel="nofollow"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Click here</span></span></strong></a> for full article.<br><br>The Thai Prime Minister - Mr Thaksin Shinawatra has denied his direct involvement and ownership of Shin Corp since he became the Prime Minister of Thailand; and had stated that his son - Mr Panthongthae - is the owner of the Holding Company - named "Ample Rich" - since December 2000 and that even the Stock Exchange of Thailand is "aware" of this status.<br><br>According to the Bangkok Post, the Thai Prime Minister told cabinet ministers that he had set up Ample Rich in the British Virgin Islands only because he wanted to invest in the US stock market and that the subsequent transfer of Ample Rich to his son did not violate any law.<br><br>As matters now appear, it seems that the company had reportedly sold 392 million shares of Shin Corp to a Mr Panthongthae and his sister Pinthongta at <strong><span style="color: red;">one baht a share on Jan 20</span></strong>.<br><br>The two then sold all their holdings in the telecom giant to Singapore's Temasek Holdings on <strong><span style="color: red;">Jan 23at 49.25 baht a share</span></strong>.<br><br>This transaction had created an uproar amongst the Thai Citizens, should we be concerned that our own Temasek may have been taken for a ride in this 'get rich' scheme ?<br><br>Did we "scratch" their back, and got our's in return ?<br><br>Will Singaporeans make any call for an enquiry to the dealings that Temasek had made in paying such a huge sum of our National Surplus to gain control of another Country's "national asset" ?<br><br>Thailand is supposed to be a "Third World" country, and yet they enjoy the Press Freedom of the "First World"; while our Singaporean "First World" Newspapers only make "Third World"news on Singaporeans flashing within their own homes.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>salman as usual is talking rubbish!!! there is a thing called 'Due Dillegence' which sounds like Temasek rushed through once again....if i was the royal highness Ho Ching I would have sat up and taken note at how fast the Thai prime minsiter raised the percentage of foreign ownership on Thai telecommunication companies. It was raised to 49% in a single day. The Thai PM was in a rush to get the cash from Temasek. Now even my grandmother will tell you that raising stakes in a single afternoon is a receipe for political disaster.  The backlash from the politicians and the Thai people will eventually fall on the new owners of Shin corporation being Temasek! Ho Ching is on a shopping spree with Singaporeans cash. Hope she buys some nice shoes and not just JUNK!</div>

The thing is no matter what business as long as it a local big organisation that is bought over by a foreign organisation, there will always be a uproar. if it a small business, you see if they even bother to complain abt it.<br><br>The important thing is it must be able to make money from it as that what business is all about. Business and emotion can't always go hand in hand. Business is about making money and not making love. At the end of the day, who will benefit? Both of them cause it create jobs for the Thai while it generate profit for Temasek which is what it should be realising in the long run.<br><br>Anyway if they intent to sell and Temasek don't buy, someone else will so why not let Temasek be the one that buy it over as it a big and well establish company with a pretty big market share in Thailand. Nothing to lose unless they crap it up and causes it to lose money instead of gaining.</div>
