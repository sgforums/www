            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">With passing of each day, the storm gets stronger, clearing the air for the main issues are beginning to crystallize : </span><br><br><blockquote><br><a href="http://www.asiaone.com/st/st_20060207_369634.html" rel="nofollow"><strong><span class="large">Public 'may turn against S'pore'</span> </strong></a><br><span class="small">Feb 7, 2006<br>The Straits Times </span><br><br>BANGKOK - A GROUP of academics yesterday warned that there was a risk of public opinion in Thailand turning against Singapore regarding the Shin Corp-Temasek Holdings deal.<br><br>In a discussion at Chulalongkorn University, Professor Thitinan Pongsudhirak said: <strong>'Temasek is not an ordinary company</strong>, it is owned by a foreign government. This has implications for the Singapore government...Shin Corp is seen here as tainted assets;<strong> <span style="color: red;">in due diligence it is surprising that Temasek did not consider the fallout</span>.'</strong><br><br>He said Temasek and the Singapore government had become unintended players in Thai politics.<br><br>'Temasek needs to clarify its plans and intentions, especially regarding Shin Sat and its applications, and iTV's editorial stance and management' he said.<br><br>Shin Sat and iTV are part of Shin Corp's non-core assets. Temasek has declined to say whether it will divest stakes in these businesses.<br><br><strong>Shin Sat operates satellite frequencies given to Thailand by the International Telecommunications Union, <span style="color: red;">making it a Thai asset</span> that is <span style="color: red;">now owned by the Singapore government</span>,</strong> Prof Thitinan said.<br><br>Broadcaster iTV has a long history in Thailand and there are now concerns about foreign interference in local broadcasts.<br><br>Senior law professor Suchit Bunbongkarn said: <strong>'The public is convinced that Singapore thinks only of its own interests.'</strong><br><br>He added, however, that <strong>it is difficult to say whether this negative attitude towards Singapore will be short-lived or will continue</strong>.<br><br>Professor Suchit was among seven Constitutional Court judges who in 2001 voted against Mr Thaksin in a case in which the premier was accused of misdeclaring his assets. Mr Thaksin won by one vote.<br><br>Singapore's embassy on Sathon Road in Bangkok's business district was the target of a small demonstration last week.<br><br>And some xenophobic commentaries against Singapore have begun appearing in the Thai media and on radio shows. A column in the Thai-language Kom Chad Luek paper this week accused Mr Thaksin of behaving like a representative of the Singapore government. </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">From an alternative report - <a href="http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Focus/GA27Dh02.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>Temasek takes on a 'let go, let grow' business approach</strong></a> dated January 27, 2005 - it seems that lack of due diligence seems to be a hallmark in the transactions of multi-million dolllar transactions of Temasek:</span><br><br><blockquote>One recent investment that soured: China Aviation Oil, which in November reported US$550 million of losses from trading oil derivatives. The company, a unit of Beijing-based China Aviation Oil Holding, which supplies jet fuel to airlines flying through China's airports, was first listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore in 2001. Temasek was among the investors who bought a total of 25 percent of the company, says Temasek spokeswoman Eva Ho.<br><br>In 2004, the Singapore unit bet that oil prices would fall. As its trading losses mounted and oil prices reached record highs, the Beijing parent brought forward the sale of another 15 percent stake to European and Asian investors in October, raising US$108 million to cover margin calls, according to chief executive Chen Jiulin.<br><br>Again, Temasek bought some of the stock, ending up with a total of less than 2 percent, according to spokeswoman Ho. On November 29, China Aviation Oil filed for bankruptcy protection. On January 24, it asked creditors to write off 59 percent of the US$530 million they are owed.<br><br>``<strong>The general lesson is that when investing in China, the focus on quality and <span style="color: red;">due diligence has to be paramount</span></strong>,'' Dohadwala says. ``China Aviation is listed in Singapore, but it's still a Chinese company.'' </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">It will seem that the sheer size of Singapore's Reserve has caused the Elite to be callous in the manner that Singapore's hard earned reserves is spent.<br><br>Paying 16x the estimated Shin Corp prospective earnings for 2006.<br><br>Paying 3.3x the book value in the take over of <a href="http://www.cfoasia.com/archives/200112-03.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong>Dao Heng Bank</strong></a> in 2002.<br><br>Temasek owned Companies have also paid <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/FF25Ae04.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>MILLIONS to hold a small stakes</strong></a> in Indonesia companies at some questionable valuations:<br><br>Singapore Telecom paid US$1.1 BILLION for a 36% stake in Telkomsei - Indonesia's largest cellular operator;<br><br>Singapore Technologies Telemedia paid US$594 MILLION for a 42% stake in Indonesian telecoms operator - PT Indosat.<br><br>Singaporeans have not had any opportunity to voice our concerns in this matters, as all issues are classified as State Secrets.<br><br>In a country, where even the Elected President has no authority to even ask for the accounting of the Country's Reserves, is there any hope for the accounting of the National Reserves ?<br></span><br><br></div>
