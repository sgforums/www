Okay the first question, "Recently, what journals or books did you read?" Second question "For the last few months, do u come into contact with any political influence peoples, if yes, can we hve the names" Third question, "Do u think of migrating out of Singapore after you graduated" Fourth question " You mix with what type of friends in your free time" Fifth question "Are u on medication, if yes, what type of illness or sickness are u suffering from"</p>

              <p></p>
              <p><br>SINGAPORE: Countries which welcome foreign manpower should try to manage this issue with policies that favour their own citizens. That is because the influx of foreign workers could cause unhappiness among citizens. <br><br>Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong said this at the inaugural Singapore Human Capital Summit on Wednesday. <br><br>Some 700 international delegates will discuss the latest workforce challenges at the three-day event. <br><br>In Singapore, foreign employees will grow as the country continues to stay open to them. And Singapore is faced with the dilemma of either going for maximum growth or accepting slower growth by reducing the number of foreign workers. <br><br>Senior Minister Goh said: "For when growth slows down, so do the incomes of Singaporeans, while the costs of living may rise. But if the government goes for growth, Singaporeans have to accept the increasing social costs of a growing foreign population in their midst. <br><br>"Regardless of how this dilemma is resolved, our public policies must continue to make Singaporeans feel that it is worthwhile to be Singaporeans." Examples of these policies include how only Singaporeans get significant subsidies for healthcare and public housing. <br><br>On retaining and developing talent, Mr Goh said Singapore has several strategies. <br><br>These include investing heavily in educating the population; making Singapore an attractive global city to live and work in; and building the country to be a leader in manpower practices and capabilities. <br><br>Mr Goh said: "The real test of our manpower strategy is whether our young people are able to succeed in the global workplace, not just in Singapore. <br><br>"Beyond technical skills, language skills and a global mindset are critical. Equally important is the ability to work well with others and across different cultures." <br><br>Mr Goh said today's financial turmoil makes it even more critical to reflect on the importance of manpower and talent to help boost economic growth. It also highlights the urgency on how to attract good talents into government and the public service. <br><br>- CNA/ir <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SM Goh confident that governments are managing financial turmoil<br></span></strong><span class="update"><em>By Imelda Saad, Channel NewsAsia | </em></span><span class="update"><em>Posted: 23 October 2008 0045 hrs</em> </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong said the way forward in the current market turmoil is for governments to decide on the new global financial set-up. <br><br>In an interview with China Central Television (CCTV), ahead of the Asia-Europe Meeting in Beijing, Mr Goh noted that over-regulation may stifle the growth of the financial industry. <br><br>However, without due regulation, countries may face the same problems on an even larger scale in future. <br><br>While Mr Goh is confident that the problem is now being managed, he added that it is the real economy that he is worried about as the financial industry is merely the intermediary for the real economy. <br><br>"To be very frank, nobody knows whether there will be more problems coming up. But the point is, governments are now pouring all the resources they can to tackle the problem," said Mr Goh. <br><br>Touching on Asia-Europe ties, the senior minister said more can be done to enhance economic cooperation and to tackle multilateral issues such as climate change and terrorism. <br><br>He added that inter-faith dialogue can also be conducted to foster better understanding between people of different cultures. <br><br>"In Asia, our religions are quite different – Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Hinduism, which are not very familiar to people in Europe. And in Asia, neither are we too familiar with all kinds of aspects of Christianity," Mr Goh said. <br><br><br>- CNA/so </span></p>

              <p><br>Can govt said that those earning below $1500 per month dun hv to pay GST for power supply bills, conservative fees, singtel bills etc etc, and lower the transport fees, children school fees and all essential goods like rice, oil, sugar, milo etc etc  especially for this group. If govt can do that, i will hug them forever for being a good govt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The ironic is that if govt really want to help the poor and tax the rich, why tax both in the first place?? A good govt should hv the ability to plough from the rich who had enjoyed good life due to the peaceful and harmonious society whereby the poor are being obedient and do not riot or commit crimes against the rich. Such environment allow the rich to flourish, but the rich must learn to plough some back for the poor, for they must understand that without the peaceful and the poor, they cannot get rich as it is today. And the govt shall be the aribitrator to take from the rich and help the poor. But sad to say that the poor are also taxed heavily here.</p>

              <p>i agree with your reasoning. the pt is govt dont see the need of it. because, the policy irregardless whether it displease the singaporeans doesnt matter to them. they have in place a set of laws , procedure that will deter the growth of opposition, opposition views in singapore. Such as ISA, GRC, defermenation law suits, members of PAP being implant into various non govt organisation such as CASE, NTUC, SPH.</p>
              <p>with that in place, they will remain in power.</p>
