Our S'pore ministers tell us that some countries with poorly paid ministers/civil-servants are prone to corruption, implying that they need to pay themselves more so that they will not be tempted by graft.<br><br>But as the NZ example clearly shows, it is possible to have a clean govt and pay them way under a million a minister.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NZ ministers will most likely serve with greater passion and zest because they will most likely be able to question and provide alternative views and solutions unlike our ministers who simply accept everything said by their supremo and unable to stand up to check on excesses of unproven concepts and assumption.<br><br>It is time to bring in a few foreign ministers to check on all the hype about leadership of the last 40 years which is full of bull and assumption where intuitive leaders simply expect everything they say to be obeyed without questions.</div>

Here we are talking about one particular issue - ability of NZ ministers to speak up their mind candidly and not be cowered by authoritarianism or fear of loss of their own million-dollar positions.<br><br>If only we could emulate the good point of other people or other system we could go further than we have over the last 20 years where we have stagnated due lack of alternative views and solutions.<br><br>It is this ability and courage in speaking their mind without fear or favour, that we need to learn from the NZ ministers and some others.<br><br>If we do not then we would have to continue to put up with all the holier than thou arrogance and suffer higher taxes and rising cots caused by narrow track-minded authoritarianism which except for temporary world recovery is not likely to solve many problems.</div>
