You mean if we dont increase the pay from 1.2 million to 2.2 million, these ministars would turn corrupt?</div></blockquote>I totally agree with this. Corruption isnt measured by salaries. Maybe in certain countries where the ministers are really <strong>UNDER</strong> paid will they tend to succumb to corruption. However, i am damn sure that our ministars are well paid as seen from the figures TS has provided us.<br><br>Thus, corruption is really measured by the individual's integrity and if he posesess any greed in him. What makes you think that if increasing the salaries of the ministars to 2.2mil will ensure them to be free from corruption? Wont there come a time when they feel that 2.2mil might not be enough?<br><br>My 2cents worth...</div>

In fact, they have been very successful in attracting Chinese nationals to their country for education and movie making has been taking off - witness the Lord of the Ring phenomenon. We can't actually say much for our digital movie animation blah blah efforts. I know cos I was working in that industry for five years.
