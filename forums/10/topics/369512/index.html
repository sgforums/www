              <p>Friday July 24 2009</p>
              <h3 class="r"><a class="l" href="http://www2.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/world/33005-underground-science-city-to-take-shape-in-singapore"><em>Underground Science</em> City to take shape in Singapore</a></h3>
              <p>SINGAPORE, July 22 — The term “underground economy” has taken on a
                                  whole new meaning as Singapore pushes beneath the land surface to house
                                  R&amp;D laboratories and data centres: it proposes to set up an
                                  Underground Science City (USC) at Kent Ridge.</p>
              <p>There are moves afoot to get detailed designs and cost estimates for
                                  the project, which spans a 20-hectare geological formation below
                                  Science Parks 1, 2 and 3 as well as Kent Ridge Park.</p>
              <p>The USC project is also in the vicinity of One-North, National
                                  University of Singapore and National University Hospital, where
                                  research and development activities are actively pursued.</p>
              <p>The push for the USC follows the government's recent green light to
                                  start building the billion-dollar Jurong Rock Cavern (JRC) on Jurong
                                  Island to store oil and petrochemicals.</p>
              <p>JTC Corporation — which called a tender yesterday for a consultant
                                  to carry out feasibility studies on the USC — said that the project was
                                  needed given the limited land available for new investments at Kent
                                  Ridge, following the earlier substantial developments at the three
                                  Science Parks.</p>
              <p>The USC is part of a wide-ranging, 10-usage underground rock cavern
                                  feasibility study called by the government in May last year. Other
                                  possible underground uses being looked at by that study include power
                                  stations, incineration plants, water reclamation plants, warehouses,
                                  wafer fab plants and an airport logistics facility.</p>
              <p>This islandwide study — being carried out by the
                                  Sintef-Tritech-Multiconsult consortium — is, however, not site or
                                  location-specific. It is nearly completed and interim reports from this
                                  will be made available to the consultant appointed for the latest USC
                                  feasibility study, JTC said.</p>
              <p>JTC added that the first studies on the proposed USC project by
                                  various bodies and corporations had concluded by 2001 that it was
                                  technically feasible to develop an underground cavern at Kent Ridge for
                                  R&amp;D facilities.</p>
              <p>But with advancements in technologies for cavern construction, JTC said that it was necessary to review the previous findings.</p>
              <p>Hence the USC consultant — working within a 14-month timeline — will
                                  now reassess the maximum-size cavern complex that can be built, as well
                                  as other factors like its impact on the environment and working
                                  population at Kent Ridge. It will also have to provide ballpark
                                  construction estimates for the USC's three preliminary designs.</p>
              <p>Under a second stage of the project, JTC said that it is also
                                  preparing to call a tender for soil and rock investigation works at
                                  Kent Ridge to prepare for the USC's cavern design. The USC consultant
                                  will help provide inputs for this.</p>
              <p>When that is completed, the USC project will then proceed to its
                                  third phase of detailed concept design, which will include the cavern's
                                  layout and design, space distribution for the specified usages, surface
                                  and subsurface facilities, and cavern access and circulation.</p>
              <p>Here, the consultant will need to provide data like projected user
                                  demand, method of excavation and the impact of the cavern construction
                                  on existing surface developments. It will also have to consider issues
                                  like tremors from earthquakes, and address the psychological effect of
                                  working in caverns.</p>
              <p>The latest USC study follows JTC's award in April of the main S$890
                                  million (RM2.1 billion) construction contract for Phase One of the JRC
                                  on Jurong Island to Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction.</p>
              <p>Actual building of the underground facility will begin this
                                  year-end, with the first two caverns providing 480,000 cubic metres of
                                  oil storage when ready in the first half of 2013. The entire Phase One,
                                  comprising five caverns, will provide a total 1.47 million cu m of
                                  storage when completed by 2014. — Singapore BT</p>

              <p>If only the pussy learn to be more modest and less noisy about everything Singapore has done, can be done, will be doing - life will go on in a more modest fashion.</p>
              <p>It was said that the late Budhist Monk <a rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/forums/1169/topics/76704">Hong Chuan Fa Shi </a>- from Bright Hill Temple - had advised that there are 9 dragons residing under Singapore and had supported the prosperity of Singapore since the 1819 founding.</p>
              <p>Not many countries have such a fortuitous occurence of 9 dragons converging and to co-exist together at one location - and had provided good 'Feng Shui'.</p>
              <p>When the MRT system was first mooted in the late 1970s and work begun in the early 1980s, the venerable monk had also advised against an underground MRT system that would disrupt the happy slumber of the 9 dragons, and Singapore's prosperity and fortune will be severely disrupted for good.</p>
              <p>The good advise went unheeded.</p>
              <p>Whether it was by fate or by events forewarned, the first economic downturn to hit Singapore - since 1939 Global Recession - had occurred in 1987, and again in 1997, and 2001, 2002 through to 2005, and before we got through the aftershocks of 2005, we were hit again in 2008.</p>
              <p>The short interval between shocks that occurred from 2002 through 2008 seems to co-incide with the deep tunnel system for the sewage lines that cut across north-south and east-west directions and went deeper then the MRT system, as well as the under ground ammo site that was completed about 2 years ago.</p>
              <p>Singapore will have to prepare for worst to come, when more tunnels and caverns are dug deeper under Singapore.</p>
              <p>The Feng Shui has been broken, the slumber of the 9 dragons have been disrupted and the fury has been revealed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Obviously the noisy pussy will not appreciate the sound advise of a monk, nor even respect the dragons, as the pussy is only interested in his fantasy to be a noisy lion.</p>

              <p>If only the pussy learn to be more modest and less noisy about
              everything Singapore has done, can be done, will be doing - life
              will go on in a more modest fashion.</p>
              <p>It was said that the late Budhist Monk <a rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/forums/1169/topics/76704">Hong Chuan Fa Shi </a>- from Bright Hill Temple -
              had advised that there are 9 dragons residing under Singapore and
              had supported the prosperity of Singapore since the
              1819 founding.</p>
              <p>Not many countries have such a fortuitous occurence of 9 dragons
              converging and to co-exist together at one location - and had
              provided good 'Feng Shui'.</p>
