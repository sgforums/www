            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The vice consulate</strong><br>Cops raid gambling den in Senegal Consulate<br><img src="http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20061104/ST_IMAGES_CASINO05-69Ht.jpg"><br><br>Â• 8 S'poreans among 31 nabbed<br>Â• 23 charged with operating illegal gambling den<br>Â• About $80,000 in cash seized<br><br>FINGER on the buzzer, the plainclothes policeman ignored calls from the other side of the door to identify himself.<br><br>He and his fellow officer were not about to blow their cover, not when they were about to do something unprecedented: bust the premises of a foreign mission.<br><br>Nearby, in a lift on the top floor of Lau's Arcadia building, a group of policemen stood by, out of sight of a closed-circuit television camera.<br><br>The metal gate had been left open, leaving only the wooden door barring entry. All it took was a good shove to break into the Senegal Consulate.<br><br>Business conducted inside on Friday evening was hardly diplomatic. A mixed bag of men and women were thwarted mid-game, playing cards in hand and chips on the baccarat table.<br><br>They did not resist, sitting or squatting pliantly as police searched the air-conditioned premises.<br><br>Thirty-one people were rounded up, including 23 who are suspected to be part of the den's operations. The 23, a mix of Indonesians and Malaysians, were charged in court yesterday with operating an illegal gambling den, an offence for which they can be fined up to $50,000, jailed up to three years, or both.<br><br>The other eight are Singaporeans believed to be gamblers. They are out on bail.<br><br>Among those nabbed was a man with a full head of grey hair, believed to be the den's chief.<br><br>He appeared to be someone of consequence; a framed photograph of him sitting next to a man of African origin hung on a wall near the well-furnished consulate reception area.<br><br>But the facade of a consulate with its dark sofas, plasma television set and even a golfing putting mat laid out for visitors, disintegrates quickly.<br><br>Venture further in and there are three meeting rooms with semi-circular baccarat tables, swivel chairs and ashtrays. A noxious combination of cigarette smoke and powerful air freshener pervades the air.<br><br>A fourth room looked to be living quarters, with mattresses and pillows on the floor and a rack of men's clothes.<br><br>An attached bathroom was stocked with toiletries. Further evidence of a well-run den: a well-stocked pantry with cartons of Coke, jasmine green tea and mineral water. Fruits were found too, which are served only to high-rollers.<br><br>Police discovered two metal safes filled with $2, $10 and $50 bills. In all, they recovered about $80,000. There was the usual gambling paraphernalia - chips of different colours and cartons of playing cards.<br><br>Investigations by The Straits Times earlier last week found that a minimum bet was $100 and the maximum $30,000. The den also extended credit of up to $50,000 to high rollers.<br><br>While some of those arrested were shocked to tears, others cursed their bad luck.<br><br>After they were escorted out of the five-storey building in East Coast Road, one man, who looked to be in his early 30s, told another that this was the first time he had been caught in an underground gambling den.<br><br>'I usually gamble when I go on cruises with friends. Illegal dens are not worth the risk,' he said in Hokkien.<br><br>He jokingly asked if the bust meant he still needed to repay the money he owed the operators.<br><br>'Still must return,' the other man replied. Clearly, given the den's claim of having 300 or so regulars, there were many who got away.<br><br>Investigations earlier last week showed that as many as 100 punters could pack the premises late at night.<br><br>News of the raid spread quickly among the network of gamblers and operators.<br><br>A regular punter told The Straits Times he had received a call from a den operator the same night, advising him to stay away.<br><br>While the police were gathering evidence from within the consulate, men and women in expensive cars were seen in the side road, Chapel Close, which leads to the building.<br><br>They quickly did a U-turn and left, peering anxiously out of their cars, when they noticed a lot of people standing around.<br><br>It seemed that the syndicate had been aggressively recruiting new clients in the area since the consulate office moved from a shophouse unit in East Coast Road to Lau's Arcadia last month.<br><br>Regular diners at a nearby coffeeshop told The Straits Times that they had been approached by young men and women to gamble at the den, although they did not know it was a consulate office.<br><br>Often too, men would come to order bottles of beer to take back up the building.<br><br>When told about the raid, an employee at a lighting shop at Lau's Arcadia said: 'There's been some unfamiliar people going up the building in the past few weeks.<br><br>'Many of them look fierce. But there were also some young and pretty ladies.'<br><br>Mr Lionel De Souza, a retired police detective with more than 25 years of experience, has come across gambling set-ups in remote pig farms, cemeteries and Chinese funeral wakes, but never one in a diplomat's office.<br><br>'They must have been very sure they had immunity from arrest,' he said.<br><br>Those arrested were later led to a waiting police bus, shielding their faces from passers-by who had stopped to gawk.<br><br>But not all of them were mere onlookers - some were spotted exchanging waves with those arrested. They walked away briskly when The Straits Times approached them, and were seen making calls on their mobile phones.<br><br>As police were carting off evidence, a few yellow amulets were found pasted on the underside of the baccarrat table from the 'VIP' gaming room.<br><br>For the den operators, it was clear the paper charms did not bring any luck at all.<br><br>Copyright Â© 2006 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Where is Senegal's Honorary Consul?</strong><br><br>THE police are looking for Senegal's Honorary Consul to Singapore, Mr Benny Kusni, after the consulate was raided on Friday night.<br><br>But the Indonesian businessman is nowhere to be found. He has apparently not returned home since the raid and it is not clear if he is even in Singapore.<br><br>The African nation's consulate office, located on the fifth floor of Lau's Arcadia building in East Coast Road, was doubling up as an illegal casino which operated three baccarat tables.<br><br>The police nabbed 31 people, among them Singaporeans, Malaysians and Indonesians.<br><br>Foreign Minister George Yeo told reporters yesterday that the incident should not affect ties between the two countries.<br><br>Singapore and Senegal established diplomatic ties in September 1999.<br><br>Mr Kusni, who is believed to be in his 30s, came with his family to study in Singapore as a child. He is married to a Singaporean. They have two young sons.<br><br>He owns a company in Jakarta called Triskel, which exports timber products like flooring and furniture to Asian countries such as Singapore and China.<br><br>He was appointed Senegal's Honorary Consul to Singapore last December.<br><br>Honorary consuls are not paid for their diplomatic duties, which largely involve handling applications for visas.<br><br>When The Sunday Times tried to contact Mr Kusni on his Singapore mobile phone yesterday afternoon, it was picked up by a man who identified himself as Mr Kusni.<br><br>The man said he was busy and to call him later. Subsequent calls to his phone went unanswered.<br><br>Calls later in the day were diverted to the voice mail of Distinct Holdings, but there is no record of such a company in the Registry of Companies and Businesses.<br><br>A police spokesman said they are looking for Mr Kusni to assist in their investigations into the gambling den they had busted.<br><br>A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman yesterday confirmed that honorary consuls do not enjoy diplomatic immunity and privileges under the Vienna Convention of Consular Relations, which Singapore signed in April last year.<br><br>'It is therefore up to the police to determine what action, if any, should be taken against the Honorary Consul of Senegal,' the spokesman added.<br><br>Copyright Â© 2006 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.</div>
