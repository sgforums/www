"This is where a cooperative relationship with the United States can address their policy agenda."<br><br>ECONOMIC ISSUES<br><br>Briefing on a meeting with China's Minister of Commerce Bo Xilai, Larsen said "Minister Bo pledged to send an intellectual property rights ombudsman to the Chinese Embassy in Washington and commit significant amounts of money to purchase licensed software for the Chinese government."  (See Protecting Intellectual Property Rights.)<br><br>The congressmen also met with Chinese business leaders and connected them with other U.S. legislators to provide Congress with a Chinese business perspective of U.S.-China trade relations.<br><br>In addition to meeting with Chinese leaders in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, the congressmen traveled to cities located in China's interior, such as Lanzhou and Xining.<br><br>HEALTH AND SCIENCE<br><br>During their January visit, the congressmen received the first-ever briefing from Chinese Ministry of Health officials for members of the U.S. Congress on China's response to avian influenza, or bird flu. (See Bird Flu (Avian Influenza).)<br><br>Additionally, the congressmen were the first foreign delegation allowed to visit the Jiu Quan Space Center in Inner Mongolia, the principal launching site for China's space rockets and satellites.<br><br>"The space center is a visible demonstration of China's commitment to manned space missions for the long-haul, and is another opportunity for dialogue and cooperation between the United States and China," Larsen said.<br><br>China completed its first manned space flight, Shenzhou V, in October 2003 followed by a successful second flight in October 2005. One of China's long-term goals in space is to build and deploy a large-scale space station.<br><br>"We could do some prior planning to stage rescue missions for downed astronauts," Larsen said.<br><br>CULTURAL CONNECTIONS<br><br>Both congressmen cited the need for other members of Congress to visit China.<br><br>"Our best interest is in engagement with China, where we can work toward common goals and solve shared problems, " Larsen said.<br><br>Kirk also announced he is working with local officials to name 2009 the "Year of China" for the city of Chicago, complete with a series of cultural festivals. In this way, he said, Chicago residents will become much more aware of China and its relations with the United States.<br><br>"The 21st century will not be a happy one if China and the United States are against each other," Kirk said. "There is a significant opportunity for both countries to enjoy unparalleled prosperity if we cooperate."</div>
