But political issues are sensitive, so aso cannot blame those pple. Like u are actually a calm and cool person, but i attack ur weakness which u r sensitive with. You sure to pissed off rite?? Once pissed off, u will not have a clear mind to think.<br><br>Just ignore those political threads if u are not comfortable with it and enjoy ur stay here partcipating other threads. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Some people really need to get real and read more. But if you look at it from another point of view, you can see how much people here yearns for more available land.
