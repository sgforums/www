            <div class='col-md body'>The above incident as reported finally confirms a total lack of talent of the present elected leadership and its ability to govern the country with reason, objectivity, fairness, justice or equity.<br><br>It demonstrates its total failure to understand the larger perspectives of running of a country - needs to grow the intellectual and political maturity of the people in order to bring about greater diversity of views and solutions and greater vibrancy of social and cultural sphere to promote such growth to take the country higher on the road of progress to bring about the greatest benefit of the greatest number.<br><br>It is a confirmation that the leadership of the country has no more higher ideals or qualities to govern the country for if it has it could easily have come up with a better than Â“in open public view so there is a danger to incite disobedience to law and orderÂ” garbage in denying police permit to allow political party to celebrate their anniversaries or some special ceremonial occasions of which the ruling party itself has been given plenty of occasion to do so by the same Home Affair police authority.<br><br>All citizens should be able now to see the bankruptcy of mental capacity to deal with political process or accommodation of alternative views and solutions to problems resulting in a situation where the police could only talk garbage in not granting any permit as long as there is a fear of civil dissent of their state of high-handed governance in its many latest policies like denying CPF withdrawal at 55 or self-rewarding of ministers by writing their own pay cheques.<br><br>It has become a government which after failing to meet the needs of the people like accountability for its policies and actions it has resorted to unreason and acting beyond reason and beyond the pale systematically suppressing through political and police power peopleÂ’s views and solutions to better evolve the people as a nation.<br><br>It is confirmed that there is no more a government by truth, reason or common sense of decency.<br><br>There is no comprehension or regard for truths, arguments and rationalizing of governing decisions and policies.<br><br>Dr. Catherine Lim was right in pointing out the increasing divide between the government and the governed in her comment on state of governance.<br><br>Like the Myanmar government it could only govern with sheer political power of its police by suppressing all basic civil freedom to any form of political participation.<br><br>It is a government by legalistic lawlessness by legalistic terrorism.</div>
