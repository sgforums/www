              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore. Even further resignations from the ever dwindling Singapore legal profession.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>I have known Venogopal Ragavan, a
              Singapore lawyer who is now in his 60s, while I was practicing law in
              Singapore. What he told me a few days ago on the phone did not come as
              a surprise; it was another of this government's series of stupid
              policies that inconvenience Singapore lawyers unnecessarily.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Now, it
              appears every lawyer has to deposit with the Government Medisave
              Program 7% to 8% of their annual income as security for their medical
              expenses! And listen to this; if they did not, they cannot practice law
              in Singapore! </strong></span><br><br>This requirement is not only stupid, it is
              completely unwarranted. What, may I ask, has contributing to medisave
              got anything to do with practicing law! And if Singapore requires
              lawyers, as well as cooks, hairdressers and lion tamers to contribute
              to Medisave, then they should have rules to require this.</p>
              <p>But
              prohibiting a lawyer from practicing his profession is a punishment
              totally unrelated to medisave. Does it also mean, an air-conditioning
              technician or a Cantonese noodle cook should also stop work if there is
              no money in medisave? And does it not occur to these million dollar
              ministers that if they do not work, you would be in fact be making sure
              they don't have any money to eat, let alone depositing money in this
              government account.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>According to Mr. V Ragavan this sum to be
              deposited can amount to as much as $30,000 to $40,000 and for some even
              more. And together with the already existing money they have to pay to
              get their yearly law practicing certificates which amount to $6,000 a
              year, the total amount is simply beyond the means of many lawyers,
              especially those who do not have the Lee Kuan Yew/ PAP connections like
              Mr. V Ragavan.</strong></span><br><br>I tell you, I do not know anywhere else in the
              world where it costs so much to practice law, when the legal work
              available is almost non existent for the ordinary lawyer. As you know,
              with the bulk of the legal work being Lee Kuan Yew's government
              contracts, it all goes to people who are sycophants like Davinder Singh
              and Hri Kumar of Drew and Napier. Essentially bootlickers who make a
              living that way. <br><br>And if you are foolish enough, or brave
              enough, depending on which way you look at life, you have nothing to
              look for in Singapore's legal market. As it is, the courts charge an
              arm and a leg merely to file a law suit in the courts, thousands in the
              High Court and hundreds of dollars in the Subordinate Court. And if you
              were an ordinary regular bloke with no connections, you are probably
              going to lose your case anyway, so why bother. As for criminal cases,
              no need to hire a lawyer since whatever the prosecutor says goes unless
              you are the newspaper editor of a Singapore Chinese daily who got away
              after killing a pillion motorcycle rider, while on a cell phone! You
              can read about this abuse of the law in my blog about this woman
              Chinese editor who got away.<br><br>All in all, Singaporeans have come
              to know there is no need to squander hard earned money in law cases in
              Singapore, because you simply cannot win in Lee's courts. Best to
              simply eat humble pie and take what comes. <br><br>According to Mr.
              Ragavan, many lawyers especially senior ones who are not making any
              money, when they should be, except for Lee Kuan Yew's selected few, are
              simply calling it a day. As many as 300 to a 1,000 lawyers have left or
              will leave by the end of this year when the payment has to be made.
              Tell me, with an already world record for insufficient lawyers, 3,000
              in a country of 5 million, with the drain of this impending number, how
              many lawyers will actually be left in that island? An island which
              according to the recently appointed Lee Kuan Yew's Minister for Law Mr.
              K Shanmugam, is a London of the East!<br><br>Mr. Ragavan is Venogopal
              Ragavan of the firm RS Balan in Chin Swee Road, a cheap office premises
              next to Lee Kuan Yew's Subordinate Courts. His phone number is
              67344207. I have not got his permission to mention him, but being a
              lawyer, I expect him to stand up against any reprisals from Lee Kuan
              Yew. He tells me that he too is contemplating giving it up. And looking
              at the bleak situation as it is, I tend to agree.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>He says, if
              you were a bachelor like him, and you don't use up the money and die,
              it will revert to Lee Kuan Yew and his government. Surely that alone
              should be a reason to refuse to pay and give up practice altogether. </strong></span><br><br>After
              my writing this, I don't expect my old friend to speak to me anymore.
              This can be expected after all, in Lee Kuan Yew's fear ridden
              Singapore. <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>And by the way, I guess you noted the absence of
              any report of this in the state controlled newspapers. After all it is
              not very good news, is it? </strong></span><br><br>Gopalan Nair<br>39737 Paseo Padre Parkway, Suite A1<br>Fremont, CA 94538, USA<br>Tel: 510 657 6107<br>Fax: 510 657 6914<br>Email: <a href="mailto:nair.gopalan@yahoo.com">nair.gopalan@yahoo.com</a><br>Blog: <a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/</a><br><br><em><em><em>Your letters are welcome.
