              <h1>Debunking the “constructive” illusion</h1>
              <p><strong>By Eugene Yeo</strong></p>
              <p>A reader posted a comment on our site lately castigating us for only
              knowing how to criticize without coming up with any “better solutions”.
              Another emailed us imploring us to offer “constructive
              criticisms” instead of ranting relentlessly at the government.</p>
              <p>What exactly is “constructive criticism” ? I have searched through
              all major dictionaries and can’t seem to find a definition for it. The
              term itself is an illusion concocted by the PAP to limit the boundaries
              in which they can be criticized and to preserve and perpetuate the myth
              about their “capabilities”.</p>
              <p>In the PAP/SPH, jargon, “constructive criticism” must fulfil the following criteria:</p>
              <p><strong>1. The identity of the critic must be known so that: </strong>he
              or she can be easily threatened, sued, bankrupted or fixed into
              submission which will take the sting out of the rest to exercise
              ’self-censorship’ when criticizing the establishment.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Criticize them in subtle / diplomatic / friendly manner in order not to make them look bad </strong>so
              that they can continue to justify their exorbitant high salaries simply
              by proclaiming themselves as the best talents that Singapore will ever
              produce. Have a live debate in public between PM Lee and Dr Chee and
              the fake aura of invincibility which the PAP has so cleverly enshrouded
              itself will vanish into thin air instantaneously.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Offer better alternatives and solutions </strong>so that
              they are able to demolish you if your proposals are unsound or steal
              your idea to become theirs in the future without giving due
              acknowledgement or recognition.</p>
              <p>An old dog is incapable of new tricks. It is the same old “divide
              and conquer” strategem employed over the years to split and weaken the
              opposition camp.</p>
              <p>Opposition politicians who give the PAP a “passing grade”, defend
              its laws as “fair and just” and express their pride in voting for them
              in previous elections are “constructive opposition” to be given a
              positive spin by the state media to increase support for them amongst
              unsuspecting opposition supporters.</p>
              <p>Those who dare to “call a spade a spade” and criticize them are
              hauled up in courts, sued for defamation, bankrupted and demonized by
              the state media as “destructive opposition” bent on destroying the
              nation.</p>
              <p>How can an opposition politician destroy the nation by shouting
              ‘where is the money’ in public ? Or does one do so by really losing
              tonnes of money overseas and still dare not account to the public ?</p>
              <p><strong>The primary purpose of an opposition is to check on the ruling party</strong>,
              not to make life easy, nice and cozy for them to run the show with
              impunity. In fact, they are supposed to make life difficult for them to
              ensure that they are accountable to the people.</p>
              <p><strong>The opposition exists for the sake of opposing</strong>.
              This is the eternal truth everywhere else in the world, but under the
              distorted “spectacles” of the PAP and the state media, it is wrong to
              “oppose” for the sake of “opposing”. Then what is the role of the
              “opposition” ? To be a flower vase to wayang in Parliament so that the
              PAP can continue to masquerade Singapore as a democracy to the world ?</p>
              <p>Under the PAP dictionary, the word “opposition” has become a dirty
              word because they do not like to be opposed. The Longman dictionary
              defines the word “oppose” as “<strong>to regard a suggestion or planned course of action with strong disapproval</strong>.”
              Is there anything wrong in disagreeing with the PAP ? Must we always
              see eye to eye with its actions all the time ? If what they have been
              doing are perfectly free from blame, will there be any grounds for us
              to oppose them ? Is the opposition opposing them because of their
              party’s name or logo ?</p>
              <p>It is not the duty of the opposition to come up with alternative
              policies to challenge the government for it does not have the manpower,
              finance and most importantly, the necessary information made available
              to them in order to do so.</p>
              <p>Can anybody tell me there is any opposition in the world, be it the
              Conservatives in the United Kingdom, the Republicans in the United
              States, the BJP in India or the Pakatan Rakyat in Malaysia which exists
              to not to oppose the ruling party, but to be a “constructive
              opposition” offering alternative policies without embarrassing the
              government?</p>
              <p>If the PAP government, with the entire civil service at its disposal
              still needs a “constructive opposition” to help them in policy-making
              and formulation, then perhaps they are redundant after all and
              undeserving of their high salaries.</p>
              <p>An opposition leader who dare not confront or challenge the ruling
              party out of fear of offending them and yet call on Singaporeans to
              vote him into Parliament to be a “watchdog” of the PAP is in fact a
              “running dog” which has betrayed the trust of the people !</p>
              <p>Over here, we do not mince our words when we criticize the
              establishment and it is for our readers to judge for themselves the
              merits of our critiques, not the PAP, the media or its proxy blog TOC
              to pass summary judgements and teach netizens a lesson in “credibility”.</p>
              <p>If what we post here is complete hogwash without any meaning, you
              can be sure that our faithful and astute readers will cruxify us
              immediately on the spot without mercy.</p>
              <p>A real tested political leader will be able to pass through the
              baptism of fire and withstand any bullets shot at him by his
              detractors. If you cannot take the heat, for goodness sake, just leave
              the kitchen !</p>
              <p>Nobody force you to be in politics. You are in the game because you
              claim you want to serve your family…oops, I mean the people and so stop
              whining like a faggot and threaten to fix your opponents when they
              expose your inadequacies because they are just doing their job.</p>
              <p>A “constructive critic” if there is such a term, is one who points
              out the follies, mistakes and oversights of the government directly and
              fearlessly so that it is held accountable for them.</p>
              <p>Very soon, the state media will come up with a new definition for
              “credible bloggers”, those who are known in real life, plays around
              with semantics to attract official attention and prostitute themselves
              for cheap media publicity. You bet that these shenanigans will be
              constantly promoted, appraised and adulated to dilute the influence of
              vocal blogs which dare to criticize the establishment.</p>
              <p>In my humble opinion, a “constructive” opposition / critic / blogger should posses the following attributes:</p>
              <p>1. Courage to criticize, challenge and confront the
              establishment based to the best of one’s knowledge reasonably and
              truthfully as far as possible.</p>
              <p>2. Magnanimity to concede and admit one’s mistakes if proven wrong.</p>
              <p>3. Fortitude to withstand barrage of counter-attacks and to inspire others to join in the fray.</p>
              <p><strong>Critics exist to criticize the government, just like the opposition exists to oppose the government.</strong> If the government wants us to based our criticism on substantial
              evidence, then it must be forthcoming with the information in the first
              place. It is ludicrous to expect ordinary citizens to spend time doing
              “proper research” before they are allowed to criticize. Maybe MICA
              should consider muzzling every citizen with a dog mask and only allow
              those with a “permit” to open their mouths.</p>
              <p><strong>This “constructive” opposition / criticism is an illusion which only exists in the dreams of the PAP.</strong> They can only play such tricks on the minds of the electorate in
              Singapore where a majority of the populace has been brainwashed after
              40 years of “national education”. If they try to repeat the same
              bullshit in other modern democracies, they will be jeered, ridiculed
              and lampooned till they climb of out of their toilet windows and
              disappear without a trace like Mas Selamat.</p>
