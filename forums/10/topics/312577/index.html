              <p>XX Jelly,</p>
              <p>I will come to the crux of my case against you straight away. What is it that you are afraid of, and that impelled you to such a massive public</p>
              <p>exercise in the total denigration of a comrade of nearly thirty years? What prompted you to stoop so low to an utterly shameless demolition</p>
              <p>effort, by way of the incredibly sordid wxxxx pxxxx  tabled before pxxxxxxxxx on 29 June?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your statement in xxxxxxxxxx the same day gave you away. It made it abundantly clear that you were motivated by political revenge. For you</p>
              <p>referred to my recent public statements on political developments in Sxxxxxxxx as having made necessary what you did. But legitimate</p>
              <p>political comment calls for a rational political response, not for political revenge by way of a revolting descent into the gutter. The entire</p>
              <p>exercise reeks of revenge, a motive which enabled you to throw overboard all ethical considerations, medical ethics, Confucianist, Christian,</p>
              <p>Hindu ethics, the whole lot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to your own panel of doctors, I suffered from a medical condition, not a moral or political one. Clinical tests clearly indicated a</p>
              <p>much enlarged liver, resulting in a state of acute confusion, bouts of giddiness, exhaustion and fainting spells, admittedly erratic conduct,</p>
              <p>and amnesia. We may differ about the diagnosis. Several doctor friends of mine in Sxxxxxxxx, let alone in the United States, have quite</p>
              <p>other notions about the diagnosis. For now, we will let that be.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But where in the civilized world is sordid political capital so shamelessly squeezed out of a medical condition? Where else would self-respecting</p>
              <p>politicians count obviously transient behaviour, proceeding from a critical medical condition, as a fundamental moral or political lapse?</p>
              <p>And where else is the sacrosanct confidentiality of medical reports, and of doctor-patient relations, so outrageously violated for a purely political</p>
              <p>purpose? You know the answers. Only in a society governed by a man like you.</p>

              <p>All my conrades in party, trade unions and gxxxxxxxxx, including you, have always known me (you often extolled me), as a highly moral man over nearly</p>
              <p>three decades of intimate comradeship in a common struggle for a common cause -- the building of a nation. How does a clearly transient condition</p>
              <p>transform me overnight into a hopeless alcoholic, womaniser, wife-beater, among other lurid depictions of depravity?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The data presented in the wxxxx pxxxx, in the form of my letters to you just before and after my resignation, and of Dr. N's psychiatric report to you</p>
              <p>(the use of which constitutes the most disgusting outrage on medical ethics imaginable), can only be seen in undistorted perspective, in the light of</p>
              <p>the most crucial data of all which, of course, has been carefully omitted. You know very well that all this was done or took place when I was under</p>
              <p>extraordinarily heavy sedation, 125mgs (yes, one hundred and twenty-five mgs) of valium daily, to be precise, for some ten days. My son Janadas</p>
              <p>knew of this, but he was persuaded that this was normal for cases like mine. But doctors in the United States were astounded when I told them of this.</p>
              <p>Even Dr. G who looked after me in New York, was not told of the kind of sedation I was under, although he had asked for the information.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Such excessive sedation, enough to dope an elephant, makes not for clarity, but for hallucination and disorientation, and you had successfully pontificated</p>
              <p>to a man rendered highly suggestible by a psychotropic (mood-altering and mind-changing) drug. Further, psychiatric examination and assessment by</p>
              <p>Dr. N was conducted when I was in a highly sedated state. In other modern societies it would have been an impartial medical inquiry that would have</p>
              <p>been called for, rather than a political wxxxx pxxxx , and the gxxxxxxxxx, not the patient, would have been in the dock for the scandalous appropriation</p>
              <p>of medical reports on a patient as state documents for shameless political use. In addition, I believe that I would have been able to sue my Sxxxxxxxx doctors,</p>
              <p>in particular Dr. N and Dr. T, alleging gross violation of medical ethics.</p>
