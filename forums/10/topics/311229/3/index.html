              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Hey, the Brits colonies never belong to the brits. America never belong to the brits, it belongs to the native American. Read my post carefully. Tibet is part of China even before 1751, way before the Europeans, including the British, ended the massacre of the native American to take the land for their own. The kindergarten argument is for kids, what I am saying is that if you have nothing to say about the Europeans who invaded the American by force, and massacred the people to claim their land because it happened in 1800, why should you cry foul over the annexation of Tibet as part of China in 1750? If you do then why never ask the whites to leave America? In fact, there was no record of war, nor blood shed during the annexation of Tibet as part of China. What logic have you for screaming and name calling? Isn’t it the alienable right of the native American to be free and independent? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What happen if the ROC in Taiwan started instigating the people in Fujian province and the HK people began supporting the people in the Guangdong province to become independent, do you think the people in Fujian and Guangdong then have the alienable rights to be free? Sure wish if the politicians are as simple as you are, but even the simple Chinese in any small village knows their history and they will not want any intention to break the country apart. What cultural chauvinist? Have the Tibetan culture been diluted by starbuck, coffee bean or the Chinese culture?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Hehehe, only simple minded people like would worry about the Malaysian who wanted to take over Singapore. Well, they are trying with Petra Blanca, lets wait for the result. I will be happy if Malaysia really want to take back Singapore, then we don’t need to fight we will have a united Singapore with Malaysia as part of our territory. If I were you I would be afraid that China would want to claim that Singapore belongs to them because of the majority Chinese population. Hehehe…. </span></p>

              <p>The above links were written by a former Aussie diplomat,

              <p>Nowadays I don't read New York Times anymore because it is
                          helping the US government cover up on actual death figures in Iraq.

              <p>Most of American media have labelled the killings in Darfur as
                          genocide. The Iraq war has already taken 3 times as many lives
                          as the Darfur crisis but yet NY times is silent on the issue.</p>
              <p>IMO, one of the reasons why American/western media is so keen on
                          the Darfur issue is that they want to distract the world's
                          attention away from Iraq.</p>
              <p>How credible is NY Times anyway?</p>

              <p>practically all media are forms of propaganda. When you pick a few to read from, all you're picking is which form of bias you agree with more.</p>

              belong to the brits. America never belong to the brits, it belongs
              to the native American. Read my post carefully. Tibet is part of
              China even before 1751, way before the Europeans, including the
              British, ended the massacre of the native American to take the land
              for their own. The kindergarten argument is for kids, what I am
              saying is that if you have nothing to say about the Europeans who
              invaded the American by force, and massacred the people to claim
              their land because it happened in 1800, why should you cry foul
              over the annexation of Tibet as part of China in 1750? If you do
              then why never ask the whites to leave America? In fact, there was
              no record of war, nor blood shed during the annexation of Tibet as
              part of China. What logic have you for screaming and name calling?
              Isn’t it the alienable right of the native American to be free and
              independent?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What happen if the ROC in Taiwan
              started instigating the people in Fujian province and the HK people
              began supporting the people in the Guangdong province to become
              independent, do you think the people in Fujian and Guangdong then
              have the alienable rights to be free? Sure wish if the politicians
              are as simple as you are, but even the simple Chinese in any small
              village knows their history and they will not want any intention to
              break the country apart. What cultural chauvinist? Have the Tibetan
              culture been diluted by starbuck, coffee bean or the Chinese
              culture?</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Hehehe, only simple minded people
              like would worry about the Malaysian who wanted to take over
              Singapore. Well, they are trying with Petra Blanca, lets wait for
              the result. I will be happy if Malaysia really want to take back
              Singapore, then we don’t need to fight we will have a united
              Singapore with Malaysia as part of our territory. If I were you I
              would be afraid that China would want to claim that Singapore
              belongs to them because of the majority Chinese population.
              Hehehe….</span></p>

              <p>you still don't get it do you ..... okie, since you don't like being compared to a kindergarden school kid, let's try you for a politician who got caught farking with another woman on camera, like that so many chaps up north ... you'll blame others for plots and biased reporting, or should you instead be blaming yourself for flashing your pecker everywhere ? ...</p>
              <p>what i'm saying is that just because someone did it in the past, it doesn't and shouldn't mean it's right to do it now ... and scream "hey, they did it before, so why should i ? ".... when you get caught for murder, do you say, hey ! ... why catch only me ? ... others have killed before before and got away with it ? ... " </p>
              <p>instead of learning from the mistakes and atrocities of others .... you're trying to justify atrocities being committed TODAY, right now  ... from the atrocities others in the past ? .... I think you failed your morals and ethics in primary school .... "hao de bu xue xue huai de".....</p>

              <p>practically all media are forms of propaganda. When you pick a
              few to read from, all you're picking is which form of bias you
              agree with more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's important to read the local paper alongside with
              international ones, or you fall into the same trap of reading from
              a biased viewpoint.</p>

              <p>Fact remains that Tibet has been part of China for a long time. The time to act righteous and stage rebellions is long past.</p>
              <p>Trust me, if people in Yishun started behaving like that all the time and lashed out at authority, I would be the first to also recommend stricter measures on them.</p>

              <p>As I have said, there's no right or wrong here. For the invading country, it's always right. For the invaded, it's always wrong. Countries have been absorbed through the ages. It's even happening now. It will happen again in future. What are countries anyway, but lines drawn in the sand?</p>

              <p>that's not what you've been saying, or why we've been having this argument ... you're been trying to justify the killings of recent weeks by saying that tibet is legally part of china because china is now the occupying force, and has been for the last 6 decade .....</p>
              <p>don't you see this whole point is all about the morals and ethics of the subjugation of one country by another by force ? .... don't try to fob it off by simply saying that it has always happened in history, or that it has already happened  .... i'm still interested in your moral pronouncement ..... so Singapore is but a line drawn in the sand for you ? ... that you'll happily suck it up and bend over for whoever takes over Singapore, if it comes to that ? .... shall I say that's actually very practical and chinese of you ? ... but nevermind about singapore ... I don't suppose that's where you're from ? ...</p>
