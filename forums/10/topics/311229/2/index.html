              <p>so military force is, in your books, .... right ? .... </p>
              <p>so "the chinese decided many MANY years ago that tibet was part
              of it by invading. There are NO "tibetans" anymore.".... woah
              ....</p>
              <p>so according to your logic, when Iraq invaded kuwait in the
              first gulf war, no one should give a flying fark, cos there are
              only two parties involved, Iraq, and Kuwait, right ? ..... funny,
              you know saddam hussein called all kuwaitis new Iraqis after he
              invaded ? .... again, I fail to see your curious logic ....</p>
              <p>so if Singapore gets swallowed up by our neighbours to our north
              or south, we become "local rebels" in your books ? ... and we
              should all suck it up and kowtow to our new masters, accept a new
              identity ? .....</p>
              <p>I do notice many chinese cultural chauvinists, not neccessarily
              chinese nationals,  proclaiming tibet to be part of china ...

              <p>1) the invasion happened a long time ago. Tibet is part of china now. It's not a debate. It's a fact. You don't have to be a chinese cultural chauvinist, whatever THAT is, to claim tibet is part of china. You just have to be someone who owns a map.</p>
              <p>2) But let's say we should save the culture of tibet from the Chinese rule. Here's a list of Tibet's long history. Which culture do you think we should make them adapt to?</p>
              <p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Tibet</p>
              <p>Should we perhaps reinstate the emperors?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) But hey, let's take this further. Modern china is made up of many ancient Kingdoms that were invaded at some point in time. Let's break all the states up and let them reignite their culture! Would that make you happy?</p>
              <p>4) Why stop at China? Save all cultures! Liberate the Americas from the british colonists! Drive the Australians out of australia so the native culture may flourish! In fact, go back to where your ancestors came from so OUR native malays can revert!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, slow down and take a moment to think about it. Cultures get merged or destroyed through time/wars. It's been happening all through history. The Tibetian/Chinese merger is not the first, and probably won't be the last. Just look at how Iraq is faring under the Americans. Some things you just have to learn to let go.</p>
              <p>You want to start your self-righteous crusade to save the Tibetian culture, you better be prepared to save every culture. Start with saving every single different culture that has been destroyed in Tibet alone by the current Tibetians. Frankly, this is only an issue not because of "chinese cultural chauvinists"(WTF IS THAT ANYWAY), but because of people so blindly anti-chinese such as yourself that nothing they do is right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So to recap, let's just get one point straight. Tibet IS part of China. That is a fact. You want to claim otherwise, you'll need a time machine.</p>

              <p>Hi, I am from China. Many good points you have raised, deathbait! Thank you for representing a sane voice amongst some less enlightened opinions in this forum.  It never is a coincidence that the trouble in Tibet is climbing up at this point, just a few months away from the Olympics. It is part of the scheme on the part of Western politicians to further smear the image of China and trying everything they can do wreak havoc in China,  for the sake of their own political objective. Tibetans are unfortunately a gullible lot, allowing themselves to be used by anti-Chinese Westerners for the political agenda of the latter. </p>
              <p>It amazes me that some people are so quick at pointing fingers at our government for the alleged "cultural assimilation", without understanding that the "Tibetan culture", as you rightly put it, is one characterized by slavery. If it is another country that liberated the Tibetan people from the imprisonment of slavery, they would probably credited with helping the advancement of a people/civilization. But not if it is China. Because it is China, because we represent a different ideology, the West would consistently and persistently find fault with us even when there is none. Their objective is clear: to demonize China and continually pressurize China so that it eventually comes to collapse. But you know what? All this unjustified and abrasive China-bashing just hardens our (the common Chinese nationals) resolve that Communism does need to stay, for lack of a better countering ideology to the hypocritical West. I am not even a fan of communism. But the West is helping make it popular amongst us, ironically. </p>
              <p>So it is never about Tibet. It never has been. I doubt the red-haired barbarians truly cared about the well-being of another people. It is their political objective,  their perennial desire to conquer the world with their own ideology and their way of doing things that compelled them to indulge in this never-ending  China-bashing orgy. Sadly some less informed Singaporeans / red-hair wannabes are too eager to join them... </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Tibet was part of China since 1700, previously known as Tu Fan, in 1751, the Manchurian government not only recognized Tibet Dalai Lama as spiritual leader, but also as political leader, similar to the Fan Wang (</span><span style="font-family: å®‹ä½“;  " lang="ZH-CN">è•ƒçŽ‹ï¼Œè¯¸ä¾¯</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">), but Tibet remains part of China.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There was no problem until the end days of Qing Dynasty. <span lang="EN">In the battle for supremacy in central Asia, the Britist invaded Tibet, and occupied Lhasa in 1904. Qing government was outraged but what could they do, they already lost HK to the Brits, and Macau to the Portugese, the western armies had burnt down the Summer Palace, and occupied much of the Chinese coastal territories. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">When the Brits empire came to its end, it left Asia as a whole and gave independence to countries like India and Pakistan, which fought again each other even until today. May be some western political historians believe that the Brits have given “independence” to Tibet as well. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Of course, when China government became stronger, they claimed what was theirs, Tibet was part of China, without any question. Unfortunately, the new government was communists which was against religion, of any kinds, surely this didn’t go down well in tibet. Since the end days of Qing dynasty, China went through the rapes of the western imperial powers, WW2, the unification of China was not without difficulties and certainly struggles, even civil war. But no politicians should try to rewrite history to their benefits.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Looking back at what the western powers were doing in the continent of America, in the same period when the Qing Dynasty was consolidating its territories. That was the period when the heaven cried. The Qing government occupied the land, but respected the local cultures including religion, the whites not only took what was others for their own, they massacred the indigenous people in their reform movement “killing the Indian to save the man”.<span>  </span><span lang="EN">The Holocaust expert David Cesarani have argued that the government and policies of the USA against certain indigenous peoples constituted <span> </span>genocide. and "in terms of the sheer numbers killed, the native american genocide exceeds that of the Holocaust". He quotes David Stannard, author of American Holocaust.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span lang="EN">In 1751 Chinese had already officially recognised Dalai Lama in Tibet, the whites had not stopped killing the Indians until 1800 (did they stopped there?) and the Blacks continued to be their slaves till 1860. There is no western moral high ground for judging Asia.</span> </span></p>

              <p>Tibet is not the only place where many people think they should be separated from China, besides Taiwan, there are many minorities in China and where they lived now were not part of China 5000 years ago.</p>
              <p>For how long did the people of quebec wanted to be an independent country from Canada, but they were voted out. May be we should ask the Chinese government to vote if they would allow tibet to be an independent country.</p>
              <p>Or should the world stand up and fight for the great american to be given back to the native americans, and the whites american should go back to europe?</p>
              <p>Spratleys? go to court and fight it out, after all there are more than just China claiming the territory. Tibet, it is part of china 100 years ago. Try to take it away and the boy will not call the mother. The boy has grown up, you can't bully him anymore. That is the new order in the world.</p>
              <p>BTW, a grown up boy sure got to have some confidence in himself mah, call it pride if you like...already kena bullied for so many years cannot kaotow anymore.</p>
              <p>Whether he will end up being a bully is yet to be seen, but I will still watch out for those who are used to bully other people.</p>

              <p><strong>Russia links Tibet violence to Kosovo 'precedent'</strong></p>
              <p>MOSCOW, March 18 (RIA Novosti) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
                  Lavrov has said that the recent violence in Tibet is inextricably
                  linked to the recognition of Kosovo's independence.</p>
              <p>Speaking in an interview published on Tuesday in the Rossiiskaya Gazeta
                  government daily, he said that the recognition of Kosovo's unilateral
                  declaration of independence by many countries, including the U.S. and
                  the majority of EU states, had "already reverberated in many regions."</p>
              <p>He added that the Kosovo issue was linked to recent riots in Tibet and
                  demands for greater autonomy by ethnic Albanians in Macedonia.</p>
              <p>"There are ground to presume that this is not occurring by chance," he said.</p>
              <p>"You can see what is happening in China's autonomous region of Tibet,
                  how the separatists there are acting. The Albanians in Macedonia are
                  already demanding a level of autonomy that is a clear step toward
                  independence. Furthermore, events in other areas of the world give us
                  grounds to assume that we are only at the beginning of a very
                  precarious process," the minister went on to say.</p>
              <p>Violence erupted in the Tibetan capital on March 10 as locals gathered
                  to mark the anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising. There are
                  conflicting reports behind the number of deaths, with China saying 13
                  civilians and 13 members of the security forces died, while exiled
                  Tibetan leaders put the number of civilian deaths at around 80. China
                  has blamed the violence on the Dalai Lama.</p>
              <p>Lavrov also said that attempts were continuing in Kosovo "to force people to live in a state that has been illegally formed."</p>
              <p>Russia's top diplomat reiterated Moscow and Belgrade's view that
                  Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence was a blatant breach of
                  international law. He also called the encouragement of separatist
                  tendencies "immoral."</p>
              <p>The worst violence to hit Kosovo since the "world's newest state"
                  announced its independence a little over a month ago broke out on
                  Monday after United Nations police and NATO-led KFOR troops launched an
                  operation to regain control of a UN court building that had been seized
                  by ethnic Serb protestors.</p>
              <p>Over 100 people were injured in subsequent clashes between Serbs and police.</p>
              <p>Serbia said on Monday it had "begun consultations with Russia on joint
                  action to put an end to any violence against Serbs as soon as
                  possible."</p>
              <p>Lavrov, who is due to begin a three-day tour of the Middle East on
                  March 19, also called on all Islamic countries to defy calls to
                  recognize Kosovo's sovereignty. This would, he said, act as a sign of
                  Muslim solidarity.</p>
              <p>During his visit to Syria, Israel and the territory controlled by the
                  Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Lavrov is due to discuss the
                  Israeli-Palestinian peace process and bilateral relations.</p>

              <p>And as usual,China is blocking off all foriegn news report abt the Tibet riots.</p>
              <p><strong>China Tries to Thwart News Reports From Tibet</strong><br><br>By THE NEW YORK TIMES  MAR. 18, 2008<br><br>BEIJING  — The Chinese government is restricting foreign journalists from entering Tibet and neighboring areas, and blocking some news, video and Internet reports about the protests there from appearing inside China, according to journalists working here.<br> For the past few days, CNN, the BBC, Google News, Yahoo and YouTube have been blocked or have faced temporary blackouts or service disruptions in some parts of China. Some foreign journalists also say their e-mail service has been disrupted.<br> Such measures are not unusual here. China strictly censors news that appears in the Chinese media and occasionally disrupts the activities of international news organizations and foreign Web sites operating in China, particularly if the content they are distributing is deemed politically offensive to the government.<br> The Foreign Correspondents Club of China issued a statement on Monday calling for China to immediately allow foreign journalists access to Tibet, which is in far western China. The organization, made up of foreign journalists based here, said Beijing had failed to honor its promise that before and during the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, it would allow foreign reporters greater freedoms to report in China.</p>

              <p>Sad....really sad about this.....I think what saddens me more is probably reading these kind of posts at online forums.....</p>
              <p>I think some people are not on their objective minds anymore, and they dont even realize it....just receive whatever advertisement shown at them.....</p>
              <p><br>'Advertisement' ...are things  made  and packaged and shown, and then u will form an impression and buy the product or the concept...</p>
              <p><br>Please at least think abit before you easily fall into the tricks in the ads....</p>
              <p>Some posters here resemble the posters in other Western websites. These people have completely bought the (false) product.</p>
              <p>One look at Western media and many people can see what is going on. What surprised me is that <br>there are people who still miss the obvious.</p>
              <p>Maybe I give an example.</p>
              <p>I think most people here are familiar with the so-called Straits Times..? Do you all objectively believe that Straits Times is neutral? especially during election period..? Hmm? It is filled with advertisements nobody can miss. Everybody familiar with this?</p>
              <p>And now open your eyes, wide.</p>
              <p>Watch how certain Western media are concocting an advertisement campaign to demonize China.</p>
              <p>First is Sudan, Darfur. I was a little puzzled at first. How can China and the Olympics be linked to some happenings in a country in Africa..?</p>
              <p>And now, look again, almost all Western media will make a reference to Olympics, again. Tibet and Olympics. These 2 words go together.</p>
              <p><br>Only a fool will miss the obvious.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Tibet was part of China since 1700,
              previously known as Tu Fan, in 1751, the Manchurian government not
              only recognized Tibet Dalai Lama as spiritual leader, but also as
              political leader, similar to the Fan Wang (</span><span>è•ƒçŽ‹ï¼Œè¯¸ä¾¯</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">), but
              Tibet remains part of China.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There was no problem until the end
              days of Qing Dynasty. <span>In the battle for supremacy in
              central Asia, the Britist invaded Tibet, and occupied Lhasa in
              1904. Qing government was outraged but what could they do, they
              already lost HK to the Brits, and Macau to the Portugese, the
              western armies had burnt down the Summer Palace, and occupied much
              of the Chinese coastal territories.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">When the Brits
              empire came to its end, it left Asia as a whole and gave
              independence to countries like India and Pakistan, which fought
              again each other even until today. May be some western political
              historians believe that the Brits have given “independence” to
              Tibet as well.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Of course, when
              China government became stronger, they claimed what was theirs,
              Tibet was part of China, without any question. Unfortunately, the
              new government was communists which was against religion, of any
              kinds, surely this didn’t go down well in tibet. Since the end days
              of Qing dynasty, China went through the rapes of the western
              imperial powers, WW2, the unification of China was not without
              difficulties and certainly struggles, even civil war. But no
              politicians should try to rewrite history to their
              benefits.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Looking back at what the western
              powers were doing in the continent of America, in the same period
              when the Qing Dynasty was consolidating its territories. That was
              the period when the heaven cried. The Qing government occupied the
              land, but respected the local cultures including religion, the
              whites not only took what was others for their own, they massacred
              the indigenous people in their reform movement “killing the Indian
              to save the man”.<span> </span> <span>The
              Holocaust expert David Cesarani have argued that the government and
              policies of the USA against certain indigenous peoples constituted
              <span> </span>genocide. and "in terms of the sheer
              numbers killed, the native american genocide exceeds that of the
              Holocaust". He quotes David Stannard, author of American
              Holocaust.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>In 1751 Chinese had
              already officially recognised Dalai Lama in Tibet, the whites had
              not stopped killing the Indians until 1800 (did they stopped
              there?) and the Blacks continued to be their slaves till 1860.
              There is no western moral high ground for judging
              Asia.</span></span></p>

              <p>once upon a time, the US belonged to the british ... so by your reasoning ... it's alright for the brits to claim back what "belonged" to another  ?. .... it is the alienable right of people every where to be free and independant ... though it has been 60 years, I think it's abundantly clear, that the tibetans are unhappy and unsatisfied with chinese rule ...</p>

              <p>I find it comical and stupid when people come and say double standards are being applied when certain issues come up, be it fake and dodgy goods or tibet .... it reminds me of those politicians being caught farking another woman on tape ... screaming conspiracy theories ... they completely miss the point ... shouldn't they be blaming themselves for being peckerheads in the first place ? ... instead of blaming others for being exposed ? .... don't point fingers and say that everyone else is farking around when you get caught ... just don't give other people any excuses ! .. don't keep skeletons in your closets ! ....</p>

              <p>Most of American media have labelled the killings in Darfur as genocide. The Iraq war has already taken 3 times as many lives as the Darfur crisis but yet NY times is silent on the issue.</p>
              <p>IMO, one of the reasons why American/western media is so keen on the Darfur issue is that they want to distract the world's attention away from Iraq.</p>

              <p><strong>Buddhism with a clenched fist</strong></p>
              <p>MOSCOW. (RIA Novosti political commentator Dmitry Kosyrev) -
              Discussion of the recent unrest in Tibet has for the most part focused
              on the number of dead and wounded, and on whether the actions of the
              Chinese security services were right or wrong.</p>
              <p>But there are two far more important, if perhaps less evident, truths
              to emerge from the events in Lhasa. First is the emergence of
              politicized Buddhism. The second is just how little we know about it.</p>
              <p>The debate about the rights and wrongs of the Chinese actions is
              something of a red-herring. As long as you accept that the Chinese
              authorities did not stage arson in Lhasa's marketplace, it is
              unreasonable to criticize the actions of the police.</p>
              <p>Law enforcement agencies in any country must act quickly and decisively
              to remove any threat to life and property. Whether the Chinese should
              be in Tibet in the first place is another question.</p>
              <p>The bigger issue behind the Tibetan drama, though so far overlooked, is
              the role of politically active - and occasionally aggressive -
              Buddhism.</p>
              <p>The phrase "aggressive Buddhism" initially sounds absurd. Non-violence,
              after all, is the essence of Buddhism. A Buddhist monk would never till
              the land lest his spade hurt a worm. For many, Buddhism represents an
              "ideal" religion, which, unlike Christianity and Islam, has avoided the
              atrocities of the Inquisition, makes no justification for war and
              conquest, and has never stooped to terrorism. It is for these reasons
              that so many seek inspiration in Chinese, Japanese, Thai and other
              Buddhist cultures.</p>
              <p>"Virtue should sometimes clench its fists," went a 1960s slogan of
              Soviet liberal intellectuals. That would sound preposterous if it
              referred to Buddhism. Or would it?</p>
              <p>Buddhist monks were active in last year's protests in Myanmar, and are
              now at the centre of the Lhasa drama. Even if Buddhist extremism is a
              sheer theoretical assumption, its thunderbolt appearance is among the
              most alarming developments in the world today.</p>
              <p>This statement demands clarification. The Lamaism of Tibet is only one
              branch of Buddhism, and Buddhism does not know a global hierarchy
              outside Tibet.</p>
              <p>Importantly, there is no proof that monks were behind either the
              Burmese or Tibetan unrest, and there is certainly no evidence of
              organizational links between them. Really, rioters are people of quite
              a different sort, while monks and harmless laymen tend to be picked as
              scapegoats. And this leads us to the second lesson of Lhasa - just how
              little we know.</p>
              <p>The violence leading to deaths and injuries in Lhasa started with
              arson. The number of casualties on both sides is approximately equal,
              and the Chinese authorities, we think, have a vague idea of who started
              what and who is to blame.</p>
              <p>That is about all we know - and probably all we will know for the
              foreseeable future. Yet the events unfolding are dramatic enough to
              base a thriller on, and it is all tempting - and extremely easy - to
              impose such a fantastical plot on events.</p>
              <p>Setting the stage is China's, and indeed Asia's, breakneck drive for
              global influence, a trend that many in the world are uncomfortable
              with. China has two tender points - Muslim-populated Xinjiang and
              Buddhist-populated Tibet. Xinjiang at one point appeared the best place
              for subversion, but the NATO operation in nearby Afghanistan has
              deprived Islamic militants of a bridgehead.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, with its strong
              antiterrorist agenda, has brought together countries bordering on
              Xinjiang to protect this vulnerable and remote part of China.</p>
              <p>Hence our anti-Chinese conspirators turn to Tibet as the theater for
              their dastardly plans. Ample food for the imagination is provided by
              Tibet's links with Buddhists all over China. Now, add the Dalai Lama,
              an exile since 1959, Buddhist organizations scattered all about the
              world - some with an obscure background - and conspiracies against the
              junta in Myanmar as a way to deter China.</p>
              <p>The book might finish with the emergence of a Buddhist version of
              al-Qaida getting out of its founders' control, just as the real
              al-Qaida was established and nurtured to fight the Soviet regime, and
              then went astray. Wouldn't that make a bestseller?</p>

              <p>Nowadays I don't read New York Times anymore because it is
              helping the US government cover up on actual death figures in Iraq.

              <p>Most of American media have labelled the killings in Darfur as
              genocide. The Iraq war has already taken 3 times as many lives
              as the Darfur crisis but yet NY times is silent on the issue.</p>
              <p>IMO, one of the reasons why American/western media is so keen on
              the Darfur issue is that they want to distract the world's
              attention away from Iraq.</p>
              <p>How credible is NY Times anyway?</p>

              <p>Those articles I shown were written by an Aussie diplomat who specialises in china affairs. He has been dealing with China for decades. Those articles were published by Japan Times. Give me reasons why I cannot trust him or Japan Times?</p>
              <p>If u look at my first post I have already proven that there are worse atrocites taking place elsewhere( Indian genocide in Kashmir) but yet the amount of western media coverage on Kashmir is so pathetic. Why? Because western media is delibrately focusing on China. Very obvious.</p>
              <p>Western countries like Uncle Sam are indeed biased of china. Anyone who follows world affairs can see that. On one hand the western world(especially Uncle Sam) never stops talking about human rights abuses in China. (I have already proven that quite a lot of western accusations against china's human rights abuses are nothing but lies) but yet on the other the same western countries are ignoring the real massive human rights abuses happening in other countries.<br>Let me give an example: Saudi Arabia<br><br>Here are some links about saudi arabia's human rights abuses:<br><br>http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/apr2000/saud-a26.shtml<br>http://www.hrw.org/wr2k1/mideast/saudi.html<br><a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGMDE230572000">http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGMDE230572000</a></p>
              <p><br>By Uncle Sam's standards, Saudi is definitely considered an evil state. <br> But yet Uncle Sam is ignoring what is going on there and is even supporting the Saudi despots. Read here:<br><br>http://www.commondreams.org/headlines/032800-01.htm<br><br>Why? Bcos Saudi Arabia serves US oil interests well and the USA is more than willing to turn a blind eye to the massive humans rights abuses over there. Hell... the US is even supplying weapons and arms to Saudi Arabia. Read here:<br><br><a href="http://tinyurl.com/jttko">http://tinyurl.com/jttko</a><br><br>Not long ago EU nations were debating whether or not to lift the arms embargo imposed on China. Uncle Sam once again intervened saying that China should not be allowed to import weapons from Europe. Reason given by Uncle Sam is that China's human rights record is poor.<br>Here comes the question:<br><br>If Uncle Sam feels that countries with poor human rights record should not be allowed to buy weapons, then why is Uncle Sam itself more than willing to sell weapons to countries like Saudi Arabia? Can anyone pls answer my question?<br><br>One does not need to be a genius to tell that the US is indeed biased against China. So harsh with China and yet so lenient with Saudi Arabia.</p>

              <p><strong>10 arrested for protesting against rising
              prices</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE police on Saturday arrested 10 people for holding a
              rally without a permit to protest against rising living costs,
              witnesses said.</p>
              <p>Leading pro-democracy activist Chee Soon Juan was among the
              group who were bundled into police vans after plainclothes officers
              stopped them in front of a shopping mall in the business district,
              an AFP reporter and photographer said.</p>
              <p>Chee is the leader of the Singapore Democratic Party, one of a
              handful of opposition parties in the city-state, which has been
              ruled by the People's Action Party since 1959.</p>
              <p>About 18 protesters, including children, had earlier gathered
              outside parliament where they symbolically laid groceries on a
              sidewalk.</p>
              <p>The police then stopped them just minutes after setting off for
              the Orchard Road shopping area, where they had planned another
              protest.</p>
              <p>They wore red t-shirts with the words 'we cannot take it
              anymore' while others carried placards denouncing rising
              prices.</p>
              <p>The 10 were arrested after ignoring police calls to disperse and
              lay down their placards, the witnesses said. Chee's activist sister
              was also apprehended.</p>
              <p>Singapore, scarred by racial riots in the 1960s, has strict laws
              against public assembly, which require a police permit for a
              gathering of five or more people. -- AFP</p>

              <p>Another example: Olympic games</p>
              <p>U.S. lawmakers and several entertainers using the Beijing olympics to pressure China to help bring an end to the Darfur crisis is proof of America's bias and unreasonable attitude against China.</p>
              <p>Saudi Arabia is a country guilty of widespread human rights abuse. However, this massive human rights violator allows privileged U.S. access to its oil and serves U.S. (oil company) interests well. The United States therefore not only remains silent on Saudi human rights violations, it maintains thousands of military personnel in Saudi Arabia and actively supports and protects the regime.</p>
              <p>If USA the most richest and powerful country in the world refuses to use its influence to do anything about the massive human rights violations happening in its Arab ally, Saudi Arabia, then why should these people expect China to do the same for Darfur?</p>
              <p>After all China is nowhere as powerful as USA and is in a lesser position to influence globlal affairs aboard. They expect so much from China but yet can't be bothered to do anything about Saudi Arabia!!!</p>
              <p>While the media and politicians of America are so critical of china for turning a blind eye to Darfur crisis, they themselves are silent on Saudi human rights crisis. Is this not hypocrisy?</p>
