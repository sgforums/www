            <div class='col-md body'>When i first read about Goh Keng Swee, i thought he was quite an extraordinary person. Some blog paid tribute to him by calling him "true architect of Singapore"<br><br>Correct me if i am wrong<br><br>He<br><br>1. Built SAF from scratch<br>2. Created DSO, Singapore's military research arm<br>3. Created EDB which was too successful and big that some part had to break off as<br><br>4. DBS<br>5. and JTC<br><br>6. Created MAS and Singapore's stock exchange<br>7. His deputy Joe Pillay under him in MAS went on to create SIA.<br>8. He had played a huge role in revising the education system in the 70s and 80s<br><br>I dont think its unreasonable to say that his thinking shaped many aspects of  modern singapore.<br><br>It would really be interesting to read his memoirs.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, he is not only the true architect of economic and finance, technology and sciene, security and defence in modern singapore, but was also the chief engineer in development of housing, education, arts, culture and nature as well.<br><br>u may also include HDB, PSA, CPF, MOE.<br><br>without his amazing and diverse contributions, Singapore might not be what it is today. Foresight or vision is nothing without the right person to implement. To me, the contributions of a great man will only be further glorified for generations if one knows when to step down or when to let go of the power, yet humble enough not to go around explicity or implicitly reminding ppl the existence of his/her seemingly infinite databank of knowledge or experiences, or his contributions.</div>

The Peoples' Defense Force was also established by him, to allow volunteers interested in the Military Defense of Singapore.<br><br>After retiring from Singapore Politics - for personal reasons - he was engaged to be a Consultant to help China open up, and merge into the Economy of the World.<br><br>His contribution to China's progress will not be known, but looking at the phenomenal growth of China in just a short span of twenty years, and comparing to what Singapore has similarly achieved in the same time frame, one can guess that his contribution has not been insignificant.<br><br><a href="http://www.dso.org.sg/home/publications/comm/2-Tribute.pdf" rel="nofollow"><strong>Tribute to Dr Goh Keng Swee</strong></a><br><br><a href="http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographyGohKengSwe.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong>Biography of Dr Goh Keng Swee</strong></a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The above post has re-confirmed what forumers have said here in this forum on many occasions.<br><br>We need true action talent and leadership to upgrade Singapore economy to the next level i.e. Value-added technology-driven hub. Dr. Goh Keng Swee is the type of action leader who could go about executing an overall macro-economic plan consistently with a focused mind that sustained the whole endeavours.<br><br>I noticed that as compared with him, the rest are mostly thinkers, coming out with a lot of concepts and assumptions and not action type. Despite all the rhetoric of economic restructuring over many years, we are still not making major headways as GKS has done since 1970s. As posted in the "20 major policy errors of government" many problems remain unsolved over many years. That is why since the 1970s, the economy has been moving sideways and nothing in terms of major upgrading has been accomplished.<br><br>To save the Singapore economy from being held hostage by all the pro-foreign conceptualisations, it is about time the party upgrade its own calibre of economic planning and execution. Go for actions and not all the talks. They should put in really more quiet but purposely and resourceful people who has the implementation capabilities to lead the country from behind.<br><br>Right now there is still a hodge podge of economic incentives to draw foreigners to invest here but there is still a lack of overall economic strategic master planning and implementation capabilities in our economy. Now because the world economy finally recovers so there is all the talks and concepts about leadership and talents rounding the economy just to catch a tide or wave to their favour. Intrinsically and in terms of creativity and strategic execution, we don't see much in whatever plans being launched.<br><br>New MPs and new ministers come and go and some only came up with business hubs and IT hubs but we do not see a coherent holistic plan being pushed by someone capable to reach goals and results.</div>

In the first part, I hope to bring some history that is outside of our textbooks (or propaganda, depends on how you see it), and shed light on why PAP is the PAP we know today.<br><br>Younger Singaporeans, like me, may not know of the insights on the founding of PAP and the true leaders (aside from the much-publicized Lee Kuan Yew) that made us from a British outpost to a country. But hopefully, in understand our past; we can derive thoughts to prepare us for the future. This first part will provide some interesting look (hopefully) into the history of PAP from 1955 to 1965.<br><br><strong>This will also serve as a starter to 6 leaders of Singapore, Dr Toh Chin Chye, Dr Goh Keng Swee, Lim Chin Siong, Devan Nair, S Rajaratnam and Lim Kim San.</strong></div></blockquote><strong>Further reading can be seen in the thread <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=183403" rel="nofollow"><strong>Comet in Our Sky ?</strong></a>.<br><br></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ministers nowadays only wear a certain label that says "I am the talent and our solutions are basically correct and not questionable". They keep denying problems caused by high cost and pro-foreign policies or ignore them and don't talk about them. That is why it takes so long and we still have not solved the "20 major government policy errors as posted here in this forum.<br><br>A new perspective should be adopted to view the people and all their needs and aspirations as its internal resources which can be put to good use.<br><br>This is a more dynamic way of running the country based on diversity and cultural passions.<br><br>If one has a narrow control mind, this cannot be done. If we as people want more action-men like Goh Keng Swees, we must create Good corporate governance that will support and nurture action-type management like that done by Goh Keng Swees.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>QN: How would you characterize Lee Kuan Yew?<br><br><strong>RAJA: Kuan Yew was really the leader. HeÂ’s the number one. So he was leading the group as a whole. Keng Swee was more of the civil servant, and I, the ideas man. And thatÂ’s how we all got started.</strong><br><br>I suppose you mean this part. This phrase is very vague. It may only imply hes not a leader like Lee Kuan Yew, but he was definitely a visionary in terms of building key instititutions in Singapore<br><br>I dont think we should read too much into that phrase. There are two other articles in atobe postings, one by DSO, the other by the philippines press. They help to give a more accurate picture of what Raja meant.<br><br></div>
