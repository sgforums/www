            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote> - posted in CNA by [quote="otter"]<br>This is a very general statement. There are still murders and bodies get 'chopped', which are far from civilization. No matter how civilised the people of a country are, there will still be some black sheep.</blockquote><blockquote>:Reply by NinJaka<br><br>Agreed, there are some black sheeps in a civilized society and should be punished. Some of the writers already mentioned that harsh laws should be imposed for the severity of the crimes and not across the board. They are using the "fear factor" to get the message across which is uncivilized and that kind of system should apply to third world countries and not for developed countries like us.<br><br>What I suggest are they are many other harsh laws ought to be reviewed. One good example is the chewing gum regulation which was already being reviewed.</blockquote><blockquote>Reply by Robertteh<br><br>In a more developed or educated society like ours, the norms of human conduct and behaviour should be skewed more to the educated citizens so that laws and punishments of citizens will not have to be that harsh based on worse of conduct of a few to be heavily deterred.<br><br>The fact that there are some robbers or murderers in a society does not make all citizens liable to become criminals to be heavily deterred in the same way.<br><br>The judges should be more balanced in trying criminals in a more civilized society. Yes there may be exception always e.g. an educated person may turn out to be a robber or a murder but they should not jump to the conclusion that education does not make a difference just becauee of some exception among the educated. So judges should not let the occurrence of a few crimes to pre-judge or preempt the likely behaviour of the rest as this might only lead to greater oppressions or over-punishment which might lead to bigger problems.<br><br>The laws should not assume people to be guilty or liable of certain crimes  if such crimes are not seriously dealt with by way of deterrence. However we often hear of judges or politicians speaking in such tones which can be rather presumptuous.<br><br>The general rule should be set so that the worse assumptions in laws should not be made because of occurrence of some crimes or even increased crimes. Harsh laws should not be presumptuous and should be reserved as a last resort against the wilful and incorrigible criminals.<br><br>It will be quite wrong or over-bearing to make an lady landlords as an example by jailing her for renting unwittingly flats to illegal workers who in the first place should be left to the police to deter and prevent and detect under the normal immigration and other laws. Otherwise our policemen may even become lazy and want to ask for more harsh laws to control crimes and not do their duties.<br><br>It is to be noticed that in recent years more and more laws are passed to make citizens answerable by way of deterrence to take over the duties of enforcements even though civil servants are paid higher and higher salaries. Government has also passed many duties to MCST and TC and members of the professions nowadays to wash off their hands. It is time for them to realize the they should be more proactive in solving certain problems associated with government and not keep pushing them away and do less and get paid more.</blockquote></div>
