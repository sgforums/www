            <div class='col-md body'>Business Times - 11 Oct 2005<br>S'poreans invest total of $359b in HDB flats<br>Some 93% of HDB dwellers own or about to own their flats: research<br><br>By ALEXANDRA HO<br>AND ARTHUR SIM<br><br>THIS nation of property owners has $359 billion invested in their HDB flats, according to the latest figures from a research paper released by the Singapore Department of Statistics (SDS).<br><br>And 93 per cent of HDB dwellers own - or are buying - their own flats, the figures show.<br><br>The research paper reveals that the average home equity of households residing in their own HDB flats was $154,000 in 2003. This is 3.3 times the average annual household income of $46,800.<br><br>Home equity, as defined by the Department of Statistics, is the estimated value of the flat after deducting the outstanding loans from the HDB.<br><br>The SDS also found that the equity-to-income ratio was highest for those in the lowest 20 per cent of households, at 9.8.<br><br>Of the homeowners in the least well-off 20 per cent, 71 per cent had equity of at least $100,000 in their flats, which compares with the 72 per cent for other income groups.<br><br>In fact 7.8 per cent in the least well-off 20 per cent had equity exceeding $250,000 in their flats.<br><br>In the middle income group, which makes up 60 per cent of HDB households, 15 per cent had equity exceeding $250,000. In the top 20 per cent income group, the figure is 22 per cent.<br><br>On average, home equity for HDB flat owners in the lowest 20 per cent households was estimated to be $138,000.<br><br>For those who owned three- and four-bedroom flats, the average equity was about $110,000 to $150,000. The national average is $154,000.<br><br>These figures compare favourably to the HDB household survey results released in June which showed that the average household income of those living in one- and two-room flats had dropped. This is despite the fact that HDB dwellers were, in general, better off.<br><br>According to the SDS, around 11 per cent of those in the lower household income group live in one- and two-bedroom flats.<br><br>The home ownership rate was high for households with younger heads. Even among the lowest 20 per cent, more than 90 per cent of those aged under 55 years owned their flats.<br><br>In comparison, households headed by those over 55 had slightly lower home home ownership rates (88 per cent).<br><br>The statistics show that 47 per cent (or $359 billion) of total assets in the household sector was invested in residential property.<br><br></div>
