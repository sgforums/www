              <div class="story_text" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 120%;">THE TRIAL of three men taken to court for wearing T-shirts with a kangaroo dressed in a judge's robes has been postponed for three weeks to give them more time to prepare for the case.
              <p>The defendants - Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) assistant secretary-general John Tan Liang Joo, 47; full-time national serviceman Muhammad Shafi'ie Syahmi Sariman, 20; and activist Isrizal Mohamed Isa, 33 - wore the T-shirts between May 26 and May 28 in the Supreme Court building when hearings before Justice Belinda Ang were being held in Court 4B.</p>
              <p>Those hearings were to assess defamation damages that the SDP, its leader Chee Soon Juan and his sister Chee Siok Chin had to pay Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>At the start of court proceedings in the case against them on Tuesday morning, the trio stood up to ask the judge for an adjournment.</p>
              <p>Tan and Muhammad Shafi'ie both told Justice Judith Prakash that they did not have time to prepare for the case as they were involved in a separate trial in the Subordinate Courts for participating in an illegal assembly.</p>
              <p>Isrizal, in turn, said he needed more time to prepare, and to also look for a lawyers to represent him in the case.</p>
              <p>Tan and Isrizal did not have lawyers present at the hearing, while Muhammad Shafi'ie was represented by lawyer Chia Ti Lik.</p>
              <p>After a brief recess, Justice Prakash granted them an adjournment. The case will resume on Nov 24.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Justice Judith Prakash adjourned the hearing, which began in the
              morning, to give time to the trio to decide if they want <span style="color: #ff0000;">to tender an
              apology or withdraw their insinuation about the Singapore courts. </span></p>
              All three refused to do so</blockquote>

              <div id="articleBody" class="artText"><span> <span style="color: #666666;"><strong> Trio found guilty of offending court, refuse to budge </strong></span>

              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              FOR 15 minutes, they huddled to discuss their options.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The trio had just been found guilty of contempt of court, and faced the possibility of jail.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              But offered a possible
              reprieve, Mr John Tan Liang Joo, 47, Mr Isrizal Mohamed Isa, 33, and Mr
              Muhammad Shafi’ie Syahmi Sariman, 19, opted not to take it.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">“It was not too late” for them
              to apologise for their actions, the Deputy Solicitor-General told them.
              It was just two weeks ago that blogger Gopalan Nair escaped a jail
              sentence after he offered an unreserved apology for his most recent
              contempt of court offences. </span>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              But after the 15-minute adjournment, the trio declined to apologise.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              They denied any intention of
              holding a court in contempt by wearing T-shirts depicting a kangaroo
              dressed in a judge’s robes, and cited various personal beliefs, such as
              the right to freedom of expression.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              They will now be sentenced on Thursday.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              In May, they had turned up at
              the Supreme Court each wearing the T-shirts to show their support for
              Dr Chee Soon Juan, the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP)
              secretary-general, who was at a hearing for a defamation lawsuit filed
              against him by the Prime Minister and Minister Mentor.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The Attorney-General then
              started contempt of court proceedings against the three as their
              actions were meant to imply that the Court was a “kangaroo court”,
              which is “generally understood as being a court characterised by
              unauthorised or irregular procedures, or sham and unfair legal
              proceedings”.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Yesterday, Deputy
              Solicitor-General Jeffrey Chan Wah Teck argued that the trio’s
              allegations were the “worst insult anyone can give” to a judiciary and
              pressed for jail sentences.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              He argued that Mr Tan was more culpable than the other two as he was “obviously a leadingplayer” in this initiative.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">Closed-circuit television
              footage played yesterday showed that Mr Tan, whois also the SDP
              assistantsecretary-general, had distributed the T-shirts inside the
              courthouse. </span>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span></div>
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">Another clip showed the trio
              wearing the T-shirts and posing for photographs outside the Supreme
              Court. Media photographers gathered outside snapped pictures of the
              trio. </span>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span></div>
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr Shafi’ie claimed that they
              were taking photos for “private remembrance”, while Mr Tan said that he
              tried to wave the media away. </span>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span></div>
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">But Mr Chan argued that the
              trio stood there for 26 seconds. If they did not want the media to snap
              their pictures, <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">they could have walked away. </span></em></strong></span>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span></div>
              One photo of the three eventually appeared on the SDP website.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Despite being found guilty of
              holding the court in contempt, full-time national serviceman Shafi’ie
              did not want to apologise “due to his personal convictions”, said his
              lawyer Chia Ti Lik.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Justice Judith Prakash, who was presiding, asked <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr Chia# if his client knew of the adverse consequences. </span>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “I have submitted as per instructions,” replied the lawyer. “It is his personal belief.” </span></div>

              <p>If all 3 of them are wearing the same T-shirts, they are fully aware of the significance of it. It is also a political charged case, you have to be pretty slow as a Justice to not catch what they're trying to say.</p>
