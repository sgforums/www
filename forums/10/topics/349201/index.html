              <p>state own business had show a stagnant and lack of the niche in an open market, that is why most of the Chinese stateowned companies are now privatised, under private managements, organisation restructured itself to suit the environment better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nationalisation is a return to stateowned business, that is because private managements are liable to greed and individualism, leading to organisations poor performances,  perhaps we can see a shift in the pardigm back to stateown culture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Same goes to Singapore, singtel, capitaland, etc etc, were each privatised to stay relevant and competitive but still Link to govt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What USA is having now is the same as singapore, get a hold on the share, made them a GLC, and when time are good, sell back to whoever wants to buy. In actual fact, the USA govt are buying at a good price now, and hopefully when the economy pick up, they will be rich.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nationlisation or Stateowned organisation lack to urge to compete, cos the peoples there alway think that govt will alway pay them, that was where the phrase "iron rice bowl" came from, it only encourge laziness and stagnatisation</p>

              <p>There could be quite a difference depending on how the clause behind the contracts and how the nationlization is done ....</p>
              <p>I cant be 100% sure but taking similar situation to consideration. If a company is declared bankrupted (depending on under which chapter ) , they do not have pay outstanding debts , so the other party can only write off those debts.</p>
              <p>Likewise for credit default swaps whereby people (usually investment cooperations) could go into to hedge risk for defaulting. But if like AIG ( the issuer of such a instruments ) are to be declare bankrupt, the amount of write down will be tremendous too .</p>
              <p>I wonder if nationalising of banks is such a case too whereby the resulting effects in a mid or short term position will affect lots of other entities involved.</p>

              <p>Senile Uncle, please lah, i hv never cut and paste, i dun post like my uncles do, or lionoisy does. Stateown organisation is the same as GLC, just that now it is run by professional wage earners management rather than ministers or high rank govt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During the revolution of Communist industrial in the late 80s and 90s, so much ministers and govt management gone out of jobs, so much trimming was done to make the organisation lean and mean, that a steel industry of 40 thousand workers find themselves workable with only 10 thousand workers. The revolution to cut down nationlisation of industries had proven a great success in china economy. However, there were 10 of millions who lost their jobs, and who dun believe they will lost their jobs. But because of the industries changing to support Privatisation, more FDI pour in with western management concepts and personnel, they will re employed back into the market and enjoyed better incomes and living standard</p>

              <p>They used these investment to earn their income. If government is taking over, then these investor would be forced to sell their stocks at a lower price than they would possibility get or even possiblity suffering a loss. The investors,we talking about here can be anyone on the street.</p>
              <p>They had been damaged by the management and now they to face another wave of damage. If i'm them, i guess i would be piss off too. Nationalisation would jar their trust and make people loathe to invest in banks even when the financial crisis is over.</p>
              <p>Though i think people would probably forget about it and move onto another economy opportunities But then.. this is the psychology of some of the people.</p>

              <p>Citi could only pay 1 cent dividend for the next 3 years.  in current bear market, valuation of citi shares should be less than 50 cents per share.</p>
              <p>a big draw back of public bail out money is that the government, being accountable to the tax payers, would demand as early pay back as possible and that includes selling the shares at a profit.  both of which are negative for shareholders.</p>
              <p>If Citi is nationalised, the first thing to happen would be to stop/sell all its international banking businesses (for example, does it make sense for Singaporeans to borrow from US government-owned Citi to buy a private apartment in Singapore?) and keep the bank 100% onshore.</p>

              <p>it does not make sense for US govt to lend to Singaporeans.  for instance, if a Singaporean defaults on his mortgage, then the US owned citi bank will have to foreclose and auction it off to other investors.  kinda inappropriate.  if a Singaporean defaults on his US govt owned citibank credit card, then the us state bank will have to hire hit men on the streets to chase the money.  kinda inappropriate.  </p>
              <p>kinda inappropriate for US state bank to chase profits in Singapore and in other countries.</p>

              <p>Repayment of debts may not be from P/L totally. Sales of assets or business units  which look more likely now then ever.</p>
              <p>Raising of money from preferrential offers , stock split etc are also common methods. In the worst case , they will just operate with net debt then. I do see quite a number of companies operating with net debts (even though they are profitable for the particular financial year ). </p>
              <p>I guess when the economy is getting better , citigroup could become profitable but still carrying these outstanding debts. In the nutshell , people may not see the debts to be as big as a matter as it use to be and the share price will once more follow the speculative sense of a bull economy. Afterall United states itself has been in debts for a long time too .</p>
