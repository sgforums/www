            <div class='col-md body'>The root of problems faced by the citizens is self-centredness.<br><br>Because of self-centredness, the whole country has been governed based on the ideas and assumptions of one man. It could only use leadership, talent, globalization and colourful expressions and concept to make it look like success.<br><br>Success came initially. It was the results people's own sacrifices in forgoing their incomes and earning to pay direct and indirect taxes and allowing government to recover all possible costs and making hidden profits on lands and assets through its GLCs.<br><br>Since 1970s, the initial success brought about by people's own sacrifices was taken for granted as leaders' or government's own success or talents.<br><br>As events have proven, such self-centred system of running the country is no longer sustainable resulting in deep periodic recessions, unemployments and dropping wages of ordinary citizens from which the people have yet to recover.<br><br>Now leaders are using external economic recovery as a hype with the help of their controlled media to make workers' sacrifices on cpf cuts and double-taxation on essential services, lands and assets look like their success.<br><br>Once it is proven that self-centredness especially in the aftermath of ministers' wrongful benchmarking of their own salaries to lucky private sector CEOs, has ceased to work and will no longer work for the future sustainability of growths, it is then possible for newspapers to free themselves from the current yoke of obsessive controls by the autocrats.</div>

The majoity of people of Singapore are so easily manipulated, timid, docile, fearful and so on.  Their mentality is better don't this and that if not the govt will put you in jail!   It takes two to clap!!</div>

Reasons being majority of singaproeans are timid, docile, fearful, easily manipulated and thus prefers autocracy.  so to those who don't mind the ruling party who complain about the way the ruling party is running the country, you all are slapping yourselves on your faces, what a great joke!!  If you people support pay and pay, support them all the way through even when they give themselves super high pay, continue to raise the cost of living in a short time.  So don't complain, supporters of pay and pay!!!  You are just reaping what you sow!  ha ha ha!</div>
