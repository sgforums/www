              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>The PAP has launched the Singapore Citizenship Journey portal using taxpayers’ monies this month as a pilot project in three GRCs – Tanjong Pagar, West Coast and Sembawang.</p>
              <p>Prospective new citizens will now have to register on the Singapore Citizenship Journey before they can become Singapore citizens as well as to attend compulsory “sharing sessions” with PAP-affiliated grassroots leaders.</p>
              <p>The portal will also have an e-learning module to help new citizens learn more about Singapore and an online module in English for them to complete.</p>
              <p>Minister of Community Development, Youth and Sports Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said in Parliament on Wednesday that “having a more structured naturalisation process will ensure that they understand and appreciate the pillars of national identity and values.”</p>
              <p>It is unsure how prospective new citizens who cannot even speak a single word of English will be able to complete the online module.</p>
              <p>In a desperate attempt to reversing the damaging effect of the “Stop at Two” policy in the 1970s and to boost Singapore’s declining birth rates, the PAP has opened the floodgates to foreigners in the last few years.</p>
              <p>Due to the PAP’s liberal immigration and pro-foreigner policies, foreigners now make up 36 percent of Singapore’s population, up from 14 percent in 1990. Of the remaining 64 percent, an increasing number are born overseas.</p>
              <p>A significant proportion of the newcomers hail from the inland provinces of mainland China, many of whom are unable to speak or comprehend English. The mainstream media carried reports of Chinese construction workers, cleaners, masseurs and even prostitutes being granted Singapore PRs and citizenships.</p>
              <p>PAP’s octogenarian leader Lee Kuan Yew said in a recent interview with the National Geographic magazine that it is a “good idea” that Singapore welcomes so many Chinese immigrants as they are more “hard-driving” and “hard-striving” than locals.</p>
              <p>Though the fundamental reason behind Singapore’s immigration policy is sound, it is implemented too hastily with little prior planning or foresight to anticipate problems arising in the future.</p>
              <p>Too many foreigners were allowed into Singapore within too short a period of time such that it is near impossible to integrate all of them and the fault lies solely with the PAP.</p>
              <p>For example, plans to integrate them should have been drawn up as early as 2003 and not only now when Dr Vivian unveiled a megal $10 million dollar Community Integration Fund to serve the purpose which is too little, too late.</p>
              <p>With ethnic enclaves already emerging in the HDB heartlands, it is very unlikely that the new immigrants, consisting of a motley crowd of mainland Chinese, Indians, Filipinos, Malaysians etc. will be able to mix around with one another, let alone integrate into the larger Singapore society.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, it is ordinary Singaporeans who are paying the price of the PAP’s policy mistakes and not the millionaire PAP ministers whose positions remain as secure as ever.</p>
              <p>According to a recent Wall Street Journal editorial, the relentless influx of foreigners has depressed the wages of ordinary Singapore workers, increased the cost of living, especially that of public housing, decreased labor productivity and led to an overall decline in the standards of living.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the PAP continues to live high up in their own ivory towers and remain oblivious to the problems currently besieging the nation.</p>
              <p>Unless Singaporeans vote out the PAP in the next general election to reclaim the ownership of their nation, they will soon be relegated to second class minorities within their country of birth with the males having to serve two years of National Service to protect the foreigners, PRs and new citizens.</p>

              <p>they need foreigners to become singapore citizenship in order to have full control of them.right now gov is unable to take full control of their children of these permanent residents.it is expected that the intelligent permanent residents would immigrate to USA ,europe or australia when there is chance!</p>
              <p>so it will be the spore gov next move to have them anchor their children when they have any as these permanent residence from overseas would return to malaysia or india once they have sufficient funds to buy property from their own original country.these pr. would have children as they intend to return to their own country.....the singaporeans cant even afford to have much children or none even after getting married for a decade or so due to high cost in living and the low salary which was exacerbated with the onslaught of the seeemingly unlimited amount of permanent residences by spore gov policy.</p>
              <p>from the gov perspective ,it might be prudent that collateral damages brought about by large amount of foreigners by the millions into a small island be considered as acceptable. collateral damage in the form of lower salary on singaporeans,high housing prices,high food cost,higher transportation,lesser decent job opportunities,lowest bank fixed deposit interest rates are just a few thats being faced by all in singapore.</p>
              <p>so its still the sporeans both young and old that finally pays the ultimate price for it.By that time  it may already be too late as a withered old  person will not have much savings,resources or much help from their very own spore government methods and failed past policies and other rubbish in the form of lower grade singaporeans from prisons and mental hospitals.</p>

              <p>You are right,  having less qualified migrants would burden ordinary Singaporean since these are economic migrants who are seeking a better life elsewhere in their underdeveloped homeland.  In PRC first tier cities, already the government are finding ways to restrict the influx of farmers and unskill workers. Unfortuately, as  Chinese cities they are unable to have immigration policies. Why should Singapore open the door to these unskill ppl even their own countries dont want them to flood their cities?</p>
              <p>Likewise, why should Singaporean  bear with the competition from economic migrants who flood our homeland resemblance nothing but econcomic refugees?</p>
              <p>Having open policy for economic refugees will only increase the hardship that many of the low and middle class Singaporean faces. The 'vision' of a 6m island country is at flaw. Even American and European are rethinking of their policy in overcrowding their cities. Having spending most of my time living overseas now, I am able to gain a better insight and widen my perspective of government policies in Singapore. This is not from reading more alternate views or reduced access to home news articles, it is from the experience of integrating with ppl  and cultural outside Singapore that gives me a better understanding of the flaws in many of the policies that govern Singapore now. The most glaring is one where our government accept western ideology in it totality. Did we not learnt from the internet bubble that wall street promote where billions were lost to the American in 2001? Similliiary , by buying into wall street investment banks and again lossing hundreds of billions, is it not due to our blind following and acceptance of American lie?</p>
              <p>I wish the goverrnment would stop pratice the 'elitism' policy in hiring policy makers. I believe that a truth good policy maker is one who has gone through life in its diversity with vast experience and education is secondary. Singapore will only have a future if we have ppl who have a heart to serve,humble, honest and willing to accept accountability, acknowledge and make good of the flaws and mistakes in governing.</p>

              <p>The ironic here is on one hand, they want productivity, on the other hand, they are added peoples in.</p>
              <p>Govt and organisation in Singapore behavioral had changed from a rewarding productivity industrial to a low wage industrial that will forever undermine productivity and push it down the graph.</p>
              <p>When SM Goh said he saw one middle age woman in canada serving 4 to 5 tables with speed, accuracy and courtesy like a pro. He forget to mention her pay is US$4000 per month excluding allowances and tips which can tantamount to US$6k.</p>
              <p>If you pay a Singapore waiteress S$6k, i think she will be productive, and if you pay in US dollars, i quit my pubs and motel business. If Singapore is short of people, increase their pay, it will motivate them, and you dun have to take immigrant in or have so much social problem with immigrant here.</p>
              <p>I will urge the govt to think back on their Foreign immigration policies, there is no such thing as no turning back, as some ministers said, there is no turning back in this policy, and if that is a stubborn and arrogant statement, then i think singapore has not much of a productive future. Govt should revise their policy inward instead of outward, we build singapore with only a handful of productive peoples in the 70s and 80s, why can't we do it now. Pay Singaporeans more, they will work harder, and with money, they will build family and give childrens, and when the places get less crowded, housing price will stablise, things will be better. Any typical Singaporean here will really want a place they truly call home and be proud of it, be it malay, indian, chinese or eurasian,..we want a HOME!</p>

              <p>I believe one of the factors for the lack of interest in politics is the fact that PAP wins all the time, they bloody do.</p>

              <p>The ironic here is on one hand, they want productivity, on the other hand, they are added peoples in.</p>
              <p>Govt and organisation in Singapore behavioral had changed from a rewarding productivity industrial to a low wage industrial that will forever undermine productivity and push it down the graph.</p>
              <p>When SM Goh said he saw one middle age woman in canada serving 4 to 5 tables with speed, accuracy and courtesy like a pro. He forget to mention her pay is US$4000 per month excluding allowances and tips which can tantamount to US$6k.</p>
              <p>If you pay a Singapore waiteress S$6k, i think she will be productive, and if you pay in US dollars, i quit my pubs and motel business. If Singapore is short of people, increase their pay, it will motivate them, and you dun have to take immigrant in or have so much social problem with immigrant here.</p>
              <p>I will urge the govt to think back on their Foreign immigration policies, there is no such thing as no turning back, as some ministers said, there is no turning back in this policy, and if that is a stubborn and arrogant statement, then i think singapore has not much of a productive future. Govt should revise their policy inward instead of outward, we build singapore with only a handful of productive peoples in the 70s and 80s, why can't we do it now. Pay Singaporeans more, they will work harder, and with money, they will build family and give childrens, and when the places get less crowded, housing price will stablise, things will be better. Any typical Singaporean here will really want a place they truly call home and be proud of it, be it malay, indian, chinese or eurasian,..we want a HOME!</p>

              <p>As I said many times, dun alway depend on statistic, there are hidden agenda in it, when you truly want to study something, go down to the ground or the place, ask them yourself. Yes, you might be right $11/hour, but if a waitress tell her boss, i can do better, productive and serve few more tables for you, but i expect 3x$11 per hour, and when the boss look at it, oh, good, i dun hv to admin more staffs, you can do it, so productive. Statistic are simply plug from the main source, there are lots of different negotiation within workers and their employers on the ground level, $11 is just a benchmarker or so called a mini wage expectation.</p>
              <p>When i worked for MacDonald at $3.50 per hour, i mended the cashier only, when they are short of people, we hold a meeting, the mgr said, Angel i want you to do the cleaning and frying of burger too, i told him, so i have to do 3 more jobs, it is ok, i can do it, pay me $3.50x3 per hour, i will do it. But he said, this is the company directives, you need to be multi skill and productive without extra cost. I told him, " F you, how to motivate a person without any factors built in??? then he used those normal lame excuses "Young lady, you need to learn, this is part of a training, good for your future"</p>
              <p>And i said, "F you, what type of training is this, on job working or training, why not you as a manager take the cashier and clean the table too, let us all do it together as a team, if you do it, i dun mind helping out" He got so angry, i throw my hat and resigned myself. Like this type of management is very common in singapore, how to be productive when you are using people instead of rewarding people and truly work as a team.</p>

              <p>atobe,</p>
              <p>i think angel7030 has turned over a new leaf so dun think u need to use old methods of talkin to her.</p>
              <p>the singapore gov needs foreigners in to supply them with more $$$$$ with more taxes,CPF mainly to supply them with the next $10 billion dollars so they can gamble at some "casino" at wall street or FTSE or hang seng in hong kong!the gov dont collect the money and give it back double the amount to singaporeans!!the life in spore is just an................ILLUSION.THE QUALITY OF THE ILLUSION  ONLY LAST AS LONG AS U HAVE A  DECENT JOB.</p>
              <p>IF THEY COLLECT A MINIMUM OF $300X12MTHS=$3600/YEAR FROM A FOREIGNER IN THE FORM OF CPF EVERY YEAR THEN&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;FROM 1 MILLION FOREIGNERS THEY WOULD GET $3600X1,000,000=$3,600,000,000/YEAR</p>
              <p>YES FROM THE ABOVE SPORE GOV WOULD GET $3.6BILLIION/YEAR IF THEY MEET THEIR TARGET OF 1 MILLION FOREIGNERS CONTRIBUTING MONEY POSSIBLY IN THE FORM OF CPF EVERY MONTH.NONE OF THOSE WOULD GO INTO ANY SINGAPOREAN OR FOR ANY GOOD OF SINGAPOREANS OTHER THAN NEW BUILDINGS THAT WOULD BE MADE FOR CASINOS OR LAND MADE FOR COMMERCIAL USES.NONE OF THOSE WOULD BENEFIT EDUCATED AND HARDWORKING SINGAPOREANS IN ANY USEFUL WAY.</p>
              <p>IT WOULD TAKE 10 YEARS WITH THAT MONEY CHANNELED INTO BANKS WORLDWIDE IN THE FORM OF FIXED DEPOSITS OR INVESTMENTS.AS NO ONE IN THE SPORE GOV HAVE MUCH INTELLIGENCE AND REALLY KNOW HOW TO BUILD STUFF FROM SCRATCH....INVESTMENTS OR GAMBLING WOULD BE THE ONLY WAY THEY WOULD MAKE ANY REAL SERIOUS MONEY .</p>
              <p>AS SEEN FROM LAST YEARS HISTORY......THEY LOST BILLIONS IN SOME LEHMAN SHARES ANDNOT IN ANY ECONOMIC VIABLE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORT.EVEN IF THEY BUILT A HALF COMPLETED BATTLESTAR GALACTICA  AT A COST OF $10BILLION AND SOLD IT OFF IN EBAY IT WOULD STILL FETCH BACK AT LEAST $1000 AS SCRAP METAL!!BUT THEIR LEHMAN BROS SHARES ...THEY LOST $$BILLIONS AND COULDNT EVEN GET $100 BACK!!!</p>
              <p>THEIR DECISION MAKING PROCESS FROM THEIR TEMASEK HOLDINGS TO THE PAP SIDE IS QUESTIONABLE AND EVERY SINGLE JOB THEY DO NOW THATS MORE THAN $1MILLION NEED TO BE CONSULTED WITH THE PUBLIC!I WILL DARE SAY IF WE GAVE THEM ANOTHER $1TRILLION THEY WOULD STILL LOSE THEM THE SAME WAY AS THE $BILLIONS.</p>
