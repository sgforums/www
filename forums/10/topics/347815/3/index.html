              <p>It is not easy to intervene into a banking company, with all the policies, red-tape and expect revamp everythings in time. Definitely have to come up with some thing to boast back people's confidence. Economy recoveray will be slow.

              <p><br>They are saving the bank so as to remain financial sound in term of liabilities, loan and debts. And also note that when they helped the banks, the US treaury will hold higher share in the bank asset, thus given them the right of intervention and decision. In another words, United states are trying to take over all banks into state owned banks, just as before, where are insitution are govt own, till privatisation takes over, now it is back to square one.</p>

              <p>No at this moment there are no examples of govt intervention would be a moral hazard. According to Frontline. The last decision made by Henry Paulson not to save Lehman Brothers was in his "viewed" a moral hazard as other investment banks would like to be saved. (that decision remain to be disputed because thereafter we saw AIG etc...)</p>
              <p>However we are at a critical point where Govt globally are taking measure to restore  capital market either by injecting capital into banks and merging investment bank.   </p>
              <p>If you look at Banks alone. It is also clear that Banks are currently holding onto over value loan asset that are not willing to let go or depreciate its asset if it depreciate the asset it means a 30% - 40% write off and reflect as loss. That would certainly required additional cash to cover the shortfall in deposit....they are hoping that Govt will assorb the bad loans and clean their books. While holding the newly injected capital to compensate for minimum deposit requirement and operating cash flow.</p>
              <p>If that is the case there are no market correction.</p>

              <p>I believe the U.S. might have come to a term with China that the massive injection of dollars will be gradual, allowing some time for China to adjust. We are seeing that 3 of China's top leaders, President Hu, Premier Wen, and Vice President Xi, are on whirlwind tours to South America and Africa for trade deals while Chinese companies snapped up resource deals worth $60 billion in just a week. They are gradually divesting US dollar holdings.</p>
              <p>This is telling us that US dollar can't go anywhere else but down.</p>

              <p>What you are witnessing  globally is just a remnant of that systematics revaulation of the capital market that tied to Wall Street globally. And consolidate global surplus namely the recession. So there are no USA hypocrisy here, and No conspiracy. No Freemason, No new world order. etc.   </p>
              <p>The discussion would be perharps what Role should Govt play in this global crisi. Should they even try to save the financial market ? Many times regulators globally fail to understand moral hazard of market intervention.  </p>

              <p>Doesn't the United States often push for privatisation and calls for bad loans and wayward banks to be shut down during the last Asian Financial Crisis?</p>

              <p>Precisely because the financial market was over DEregulated that led to this meltdown. Just look at the amount of "evergreen" loans......how is it even possible if not for the fact that the accountings were manipulated so that most if not all the loans get through when the risk of busting outweighs conventional wisdom?</p>
              <p>And when the day of reckoning comes, what do the creditors do? They scrammed and demanded their money right? Isn't this a moral hazard of lack of capital controls??</p>

We are seeing that 3 of China's top leaders, President Hu, Premier Wen, and Vice President Xi, are on whirlwind tours to South America and Africa for trade deals while Chinese companies snapped up resource deals worth $60 billion in just a week.

              <p>You mistook what I said. In the first place I didn't assert

              comforts your pride that much:</p>
