              <p>yup, the obligation includes ALL the money they need to pay for
              social securities and medisave to be paid in the future. Of course,
              they don't need to pay now...</p>
              <p>Sort of like singapore CPF... If pay out all the CPF, also
              heavily in debt, but Singapore don't need to pay now...</p>
              <p>Seems kind of weird to lump it together that way right? It will
              be easier to not lump it that way. just look at the situation year
              by year.for example, last year US deficit is 455 billion... 2009
              deficit is whatever... and so on...</p>
              <p>that's sort of like telling me i will be spending $12 000 in the
              next years on food, transport and whatever, while my income is only
              $1k per month... not  exactly saving money, but not exactly
              like the end of the world too...</p>

              <p>Yeah, but considering that that sum is about equal to world GDP, and 4 times the US GDP, do you really think that there is a plausible solution out of this mess, excluding bankruptcy (which the US is)? In addition, with 2 official wars on-going, plus the many unacknowledged US-backed conflicts in Latin America and Africa, there doesn't seem to be any possible solution in sight.</p>
              <p>Right now the corporatocracy are just prolonging the crisis in order to benefit all they can, screw the working class as much as possible before bringing the whole house of cards down and destroying the people who actually create the world's wealth.</p>

              <p>hhmmmm, maybe you stick to 4 times the US GDP... keep things more in prospective. It is as accurate, but and give a better view of (US spending for next few decades) to GDP.</p>

              <p>House and senate diff... that one you need to google.</p>
              <p>ehh... the republicans under president bush thought very very
                  differently than they thought under Obama. They were fine in
                  supporting a war that cost 700 billion to destroy and rebuild other
                  countries, being Iraq. now ask them to spend money to rebuild their

              <p>as for your worry for early US pull out, the threat is always
                  real, be it under democrat or republican. Somehow, the US citizen
                  voted and made the senate this way, and put their trust in the
                  democrats.... so that's the way it is. I don't know what your point
                  is pointing this out, but the fact remains that there is only 58
                  democrat senators.</p>

              <p>I think you are confused. </p>
              <p>There's 2 houses in the US legislative assembly.  The upper house is called the "senate", and the lower house, the "house of representatives."  Together that makes up the "Congress." </p>

              <p>Thats another entire issue altogether.  What I am simply saying is that Republicans, being conservatists, generally do not believe in intervening in the economy and giving out welfare.  They condemn protectionism; which is what Obama is trying to do by banning the use of foreign steel.   Their differences towards economic policies is the firm divide that causes them vote against the bill.  Its not about Iraq or playing punk as you simplistically put.</p>
              <p>"Only 58 senators" is just 2 shy of puting a filibuster-proof bill through.  That is how much control of the law making process that they have.  Now that they've got 2-3 Republican senators on their side for this bill, which was passed in such a gusto, no one is sure whether these moderate Republicans are gonna sway towards the Democrats on future issues, giving them more filibuster-proof bills. </p>
              <p>Its like, I plan a 1000-page bill.  I introduce them this evening and we vote on it tomorrow morning. How the hell is anyone able to read through all the details of it?  If there is anyone playing punk, its the Democrats who are literally saying, "Screw you republicans, we are in control now, and we do as we damn well please.  This process of voting is just for show cos we control an absolute majority anyway - end of discussion, no future debates."</p>

              <p>War is one good way to stimulate the economy. That was how the US got out of the Great Depression. The Korean War provided a boom to the Japanese economy. Thus, General Smedley Butler (I think), wrote "War is a racket".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whether or not most wars are conspiracies is another matter, otherwise the usual "conspiracy theory" bounty-hunters will come after me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It could be in the works, a war. After all, US intelligence reports that Israel may attack Iran this year. So who knows...</p>

              <p>Now you're trying to change what you said?</p>
              <p>Using your analogy, when someone said/ alledges that John killed his own father, it is a conspiracy <em>theory</em>, assuming it has not been proved yet. If it has been proved, and <strong>it is the work of two or more people scheming together</strong>, then it is a conspiracy.</p>
              <p>When reyes said something about wars could get the US out of debt and cited the examples of Germany and the US during the Great Depression, you said that it was a "<strong>conspiracy theory</strong>", meaning that you deny that WWII had an economic benefit, whether or not it was planned- though I'm sure the arms manufacturers will agree.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I think at the end what Obama himself has said he can sit down and listen to changes in the stimulus package but not philosophical approach to save the Economy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So it wasn’t screw you republicans. I think the Rep is taking 100% Risk. Its more like all hands in 1 bet. The republicans are betting on this stimulus package are not going to work.</span></p>
