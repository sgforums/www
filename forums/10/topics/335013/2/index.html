              <p><br>in the 30's the great depression had cost it to renew once, then now another time, just that now USA are more rich to support its bank, yes, bankrupt banks are allow to collapse, they are infact collapsed, just that the Fed buyout them to stay sustainable and most importantly, the ability to withhold it obligation to depositors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>USA has one of the highest tax, nearly 1/3 of your salary goes into taxation, corporate businesses pays the high tax in USA, for about a century, the govt had make great fortune from these taxation to make fireweapons to sell and make more profit from it. The Fed Reserve is very rich. Now, it is the time to plough some of these reserve back into the society.</p>
