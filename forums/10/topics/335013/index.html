            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well, personally I like the whole idea of the government having as little part in my life as possible, but tats not how it works in Singapore, I think we are as paternalistic as any state could be, wonder why when things go awry, people always blame the govt, because that is the mindset that has been imbued in our people, and how did that mindset come about? Because it is so. So I don't really understand this sudden claim of us as a liberal state, because the last I check, I think they are a lot of things I don't really have much of a choice about to begin with. </p></div>

              <p><br>Firstly, is it not too late for PM LHL to start commenting - 'IF' - "<em>it doesn’t measure up to the standards that MAS expects when you promote the financial </em>product" ?</p>
              <p>Why was the MAS not monitoring the financial packages that the local banks offer to the Singaporean public ?</p>
              <p>Are there no requirements for the banks to submit their financial products or promotion programs to the MAS for approvals, when even Cinemas are required to submit the movies for vetting prior to it being offered to Singaporean consumption ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, Singaporeans have been telling the Government not to interfere in our lives since LKY stepped into public office, and only to do the job that is expected of them to run a country efficiently.</p>
              <p>Since the 1960s - after the one and only manipulated referendum towards merger with Malaysia - Singaporeans have not been consulted even on issues that affected our private lives. </p>
              <ul type="disc">
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt;    "><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"I am often accused of interfering in the private lives of citizens. Yes, if I did not, had I not done that, we wouldn't be here today. And I say without the slightest remorse, that we wouldn't be here, we would not have made economic progress, if we had not intervened on very personal matters - who your neighbour is, how you live, the noise you make, how you spit, or what language you use. We decide what is right. Never mind what the people think." - Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Straits Times, 20 April 1987 </span></span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Thirdly, if "<em><span style="color: #ff0000;">the Government cannot be in any position to guarantee what is safe and what is not safe because there is nothing which is 100 percent safe</span></em>" - can we trust PM LHL and his team of Super-Talented Ministers on any SAFE DECISION to guide Singapore through any crisis ?</p>
              <p>In making such atrocious statement - is PM LHL denying that the Government is not responsible to supervise the MAS in its supervisionary role over the Singapore Banks - in the same manner that he has defended DPM WKS responsibility over the scandalous escape by MSK from the ISD lock-up ?</p>
              <p>With only two members from the Alternative Parties sitting in Parliament, surely PM LHL has more then enough time on his hands to fix the Government - instead of fixing the Opposition ?</p>

              <p><br>The issue is also very cut that here is a free market, u want to buy what kinds of fishes is up to you, and if a fishmonger said that his fish is better and you believe in him, so be it, you buy from him. Then you go home and cook it and find is very true that it was indeed very tasty and nice, that repay your dividends, then you start to trust from this particular fishmongers, but one day, his fishes u brought had all gone bad and when you asked for a refund, he is gone, bankrupt, no more money to give you.</p>

              <p><strong>Noam Chomsky:</strong> The <em>New York Times</em> had an article by its
              economic correspondent in its magazine section a couple weeks ago about
              Obama's economic programs. He talked about Reagan as the model of
              passionate commitment to free markets and reduction of the role of the
              state, and so on … <em>Where are these people?</em> Reagan was the most
              protectionist president in post-war American history.</p>
              <p>In fact, more
              protectionist than all others combined. He virtually doubled protective
              barriers. He brought in the Pentagon to develop the "factory of the
              future" to teach backward American management how to catch up on the
              Japanese lead in production. SEMATECH ("Semiconductor Manufacturing
              Technology") was formed.</p>
              <p>If it weren't for Reagan's protectionism and
              calling in of state power, we would not have a steel industry, or an
              automobile industry, or a semi-conductor industry or whatever they
              protected. They reindustrialized America by protectionism and state
              intervention. All of this is washed away by propaganda as though it
              never happened.</p>
              <p>It is very interesting to look at a place like
              MIT, which was right at the center of these developments. My department
              -- you're teaching a course in the Military Industrial Complex -- my
              department is an example of it. I came here in the mid-50's. I don't
              know the difference between a radio and a tape recorder, but I was in
              the electronics lab. I was perhaps the one person who refused to get
              clearance on principle. Not that it made any difference; everything was
              open anyway.</p>
              <p>The electronics lab, along with the closely
              connected Lincoln labs, was just developing the basis of the modern
              high- tech economy. In those days, the computer was the size of this
              set of offices.</p>
              <p>By the time they finally got computers down to
              the size of a marketable main frame, some of the directors of the
              project pulled out and formed DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation), the
              first main frame producer. IBM was in there, at the government's
              expense, learning how to move from punch cards to electronic computers.
              By the early l960's IBM was capable of producing its own computers, but
              no one could buy them.</p>
              <p>They were too expensive.</p>
              <p>So they were bought by
              the National Security Agency. Bell Labs did develop transistors. That
              is about the only example you can think of a significant part of the
              high-tech system which came out of private enterprise. But that is a
              joke too! They worked on technology.</p>
              <p>Their transistor producer was
              Western Electric, who could not sell them on the market; they were too
              expensive. So the government bought about 100 percent of advanced
              transistors. Finally, of course, all of this gets to the point where
              you can market them privately. It was not until the 1980's after 30
              years of development essentially in the state sector that these things
              became marketable commodities and Bill Gates could get rich.</p>
              <p>The
              Internet was the same thing. I was here when they were starting to work
              on the Internet. It was not until 1995 that it was privatized, after 30
              years. If you look at the funding at MIT, in the 1950s and 1960's it
              was almost entirely Pentagon. For a very simple reason, the cutting
              edge of the economy was electronics based. A good cover for developing
              an electronics-based economy was the Pentagon. You sort of frighten
              people into thinking the Russians are coming, so they pay their taxes
              and their children and grandchildren have computers.</p>
              <p>Through the
              70's and 80's funding has been shifting to NIH (National Institutes of
              Health). Why? Because the cutting edge of the economy is becoming
              biology-based. So, therefore, the state sector is shifting its
              priorities to developing biology-based industries. All of this is going
              on with accolades to the Free Market. You don't know whether to laugh
              or cry.</p>
              <p>The point is, to get back to the new international
              economic order: It was a serious proposal that was immediately kicked
              out the window and UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and
              Development) was reduced to a data collecting agency with no policy
              initiatives.</p>
              <p>The new information order was destroyed, along with
              UNESCO. Neo-liberal programs were rammed down the throats of the poor.
              (Although the rich did not accept them -- and to the extent that they
              do accept them, it is harmful to them too.)</p>
              <p>This went along with the
              great shift to the liberalization of finance. It was a disaster in the
              making all along; serious economists have been pointing out since the
              early 70's that the freeing up of financial capital flows is just a
              disaster in the making, with in fact periodic crises. Also, Reagan the
              great free marketer carried out one of the biggest bailouts in American
              history when he bailed out (and virtually nationalized) a major bank.</p>

              <p>To cut the chase, Angel, what I'm trying to say is that the theoretical framework of what we perceive as the free market isn't as free as we think it to be. Yes, we can buy and sell freely, but just simply look at what you are purchasing with your monthly purse every month - Electrical Bills (Singapore Power - Semi Government Owned Monopoly), Petrol (Oligopoly), Banks (Cartel Oligopoly). The 'Free-Market' aint that free after all right?</p>
              <p>Free trade - sounds very nice with the comparative and absolute advantage theroms. Truth is with every free trade agreements being signed, certain nations have to close down part of their industries, so as to barter with the other side - in the process of people lose jobs. One can argue they can gain from the trade off, but at whose expense?It takes years and time to retrain workers, there is no such thing as perfect labor flexibility - where you can just take one worker in a guns factory and make him bake bread the next day. Free trade sounds great, but it has the lingering hand of the government intervening in the market as most libertarians will call it. </p>
              <p>Yes, indeed I grant you the assumption that we are free to buy what we want, and we have to be responsible for our choices, but one cannot just argue that because of this, we have a free market, therefore those people who made bad investments got their just desserts for their bad investment choice. Because even in the quasi-'free market' we have, the firms themselves make bad choices. As I was saying in my previous post, the leviathans of the corporate world who saw "an opportunity" to increase their stake and made bad loans to people with poor credits, and ended up going bust. Under you assumption since they made bad choices, shouldn't they be responsible for those choices and be allowed to go under, just like all the other bad investments made? Yeah Lehman Brothers is gone, but the governments of the world have raised trillions of dollars to ensure that other firms do not go under. I'm not saying this is wrong, the rescue packages put out by gvernments is the right thing to do under the prevailing circumstances. But it also shows clearly, that we are not operating under a free market economy. </p>
              <p>The Resue Plan was constructed on the basis that should such firms collapse, there will be a series of ripple effects, which will be deatremental to the global economy. People will lose their jobs, etc. The rescue plan is governmental intervention, an anti-thesis of any free-market ideology. Ron Paul was crying foul when Congress announced the 700 billion dollar aid package. </p>
              <p>People make bad decisions all the time, and usually they end up with real drastic consequances which affect not just themselves, but everyone else. It is unrealistic to ask government to come out with a rescue plan for these bond buyers, cause it is just impratical. But what government has to be doing is to widen the social safety net at this time so as to ensure families who are affected by this can at least go on with their lives. We are talking about children, families, who do not deserve to bite the dust just because dad or mum made a wrong investment. I myself, my dad lost his job in the 97 crisis, I know what it is like. Thankfully, I have really generous and loving relatives, but I belief they are many out there who have nothing to lean on.</p>
              <p>Practicalism or Overt Practicalism can just blind us to the needs of those around us. </p>

              <p>Sorry lah Uncle, i simply wants to devil advocate these issue in a way to say that there is a free market. Be it oligarchism or Monopolism, it still a free market, every states and nations got is own unique product to sell in the markets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me bring u back to ancient, formerly farmer A got rice, farmer B grows vegetable, and farmer C hv pigs or cows. They all go into the free market to exchange their goods so that all hv the foods required to eat. So if u said that monopolism or oligarchy is not a free trade, then i do not comprehend it. Too bad we lack of natural resource, if not we still can sell oil in exchange for sometime.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today, in modern society we build on capital to exchange goods rather than using nos of cows for nos of pound of rice. And capital = cash. It become the most important part of our life. Then people start to manipulate with cash, that is where all problems start to bloom up. Peoples start to make quick cash thru investment without doing any farming or digging. It is still a free market for you to choose your product and choices, you get it right, you are rich, if you get it wrong, too bad. Life goes on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What the govt infuse into the banks to help those too bad investors are said be tax payers money, you, me and all of us, our money. How on earth can we pay a poor eyesight investor investing in a free market at his choices and willingness and failed badly because of his decision and choices.????</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A free market must let the nature take it course, we do pity those with family, childrens, old parents etc etc, but in a capitalism free market, there is only a minor room for compassion. That is the cruel truth of this system. </p>
