This is very important criteria now, especially for Medium &amp; Small Enterprise. As far as I know, only MNC or GLC are willingly to accept fresh with no experience but got potential.

            <div class='col-md body'>actually it's not true that jobs are always given to degree holders than diploma holders, it all depends on the nature of the work...<br>a degree holder can definitely do a job better than a poly grad, but in times where the economy is good, she sure pack-bag-and-go to find a better and high-salary job. if the company have the mindset that hiring degree holders are better than hiring diploma holders, than they can expect a high staff turnover rate...<br>for example: if u hire someone with MBA as an marketing exec at a SME, when times are good, and other MNC need these degree holders, do you tink they will stay or quit for the MNC job? it's human nature to climb higher and higher, "ren wang gao chu pa"...<br>in this case, the SME would have to take time and resources to find another person to replace this MBA holder, is it a loss or a gain?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not believe that the amount mentioned $1450 can be fixed. When one graduate from a poly, it depends on the type of diploma you are getting to command a certain salary range.<br><br>A person specialising in IT, Business or Engineering have their own starting salary range and there is a salary cap too unless experience and other factors come to play. It depends on how high you can climb up the ranking level and how high the company's willing to let you climb.</div>
