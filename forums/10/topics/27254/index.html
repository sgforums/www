Its either you hadn't read it, or you are just showing your inability to balance military actions, your gut feelings, and politics. Yeah, we are a target, so? Not afraid to admit, because we have a capable Government and various law-enforcement agencies to take care of it. What I am really worried about is those Twin Towers of yours. They very much resemble the WTC.  Maybe you should stop showing how immature you are and instead try to worry a bit about your own homeland.</div>

Why there is guns so commonly found in Malaysia? Let me tell you why, By paying S$250, i can get a Malaysia Serviceman M16.... go and check with your Army ppl and see is there is a lots of lost arms.... then you will know.  Your serviceman are actually selling arms by reporting lost during exercise.<br><br>As you say "Singapore still a terrorists major target whether you like it or not" i must agree.
