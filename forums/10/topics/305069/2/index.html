Morever, their only real ally, Syria, was less committed into an all out assault, their main interest only lying with the Golan Heights. The 3rd major player - Jordan was in an even less threatening position, with hesitant committment from their leaders regarding any attempt at war.<br><br>As for the arab version, i haven't managed to get a reliable copy, but i'm sure it will be a complete reverse of the above version - labelling Israel's strike a blatant act of war. </div></blockquote> Read the different versions, but compare with the before and after, who do we believe? Of course the arabs would label the Israel's strike a blatant act of war. But until today, many in the middle east still want Isreal wiped off the map, if the iranian, the iraqi, the palestinians had the means to do so.<br><br>It would be too late if israel only act after being attacked.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly, I think the Israelis have every right to defend themselves, and the Arabs have put themselves to shame for putting up a half-pregnant attack. Looking at the odds, 3 vs. 1, do you genuinely think that the Israelis had a chance the moment the first tank clatters across the border? Them being small and a singular party fighting for itself, they do not need to communicate with any external parties and thus their comms. can't be broken, also note that them being themselves, their only strength is that of surprise. They had to deliver the first strike when the Arabs aren't ready as they are still busy trying to sync. the attack. I would say that the Arabs should feel lucky that the Jews didn't nuke them back into the stone age.</div>
