This is similar to the Michael Faye case where Americans were pissed with SG for punishing their citizen. Even the President was pressured to ask for leniency.<br><br>As far as the case is going, Corby unfortunately hasnt gotten any proof tt someone else sneaked the marijuanna into her surfbag. So she remains the sole guilty suspect.<br><br>Personally, I do believe her side of the story, afterall, Indonesia doesnt have an acceptable crime-busting record.<br><br>At least her case has woken the world up.

It's very difficult to find evidence, trace the events n pinpoint the actual culprit.<br><br>In short, Corby is in serious sh|t.

            <div class='col-md body'>Drug case:<br>Rage or racism<br>Australians' anger against Jakarta supported by government leaders.<br>May 29, 2005<br><br>(Background) A drug smuggling case that has created anger across Australia. A 27-year-old Australian woman was found guilty of trying to bring nine pounds of marijuana into Bali and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.<br><br>The reading of the verdict, to a packed courtroom in Bali, was carried live on Australian television and radio.<br><br>The three judges who heard the case could have sentenced the defendant, Schapelle Corby, to be executed, a fate met by many foreigners convicted of drug offences in Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries.<br><br>Ms Corby claims the marijuana, which customs officials found in her luggage when she landed in Denpassar last October, had been put there by baggage handlers during her flight, which began in Brisbane and transited through Sydney.<br><br>Reactions (excerpts):<br><br>New York Times<br><br>Southeast Asian countries have strict drug laws, and airport signs, arrival cards and announcements by airlines, warn travellers about the consequences of being caught with drugs.<br><br>Trials of foreigners on drug charges are routine, and the imposition of death sentences for the convicted are not exceptional.<br><br>Ms. Corby's supporters included the Australian government, which paid part of her defence, leading to accusations that Australia was interfering in the Indonesian judicial system in a way that Australians would never tolerate another country doing in their own country.<br><br>The Australian<br><br>Underlying the "hysteria" and "Indonesia-bashing," is a tinge of racism, and a disdainful view of Indonesia as a country of corrupt politicians and Islamic terrorists, said The Australian.<br><br>The Sydney Morning Herald<br><br>It said Prime Minister John Howard and opposition Labour party leader Kim Beazley "are pandering to Australian public opinion."<br><br>If the Indonesian public and officials acted in a similar manner were an Indonesia on trial in Australia, Australians "would be insulted and angry - no, outraged," the editorial said.<br><br>Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer.<br><br>He announced that the government would send lawyers to help Corby with her appeal and was discussing a prisoner swap with Indonesia that would allow Corby to serve her sentence in Australia.<br><br>Tim Lindsey, professor of Asian law, director of the Asian Law Centre at the University of Melbourne. Sydney Morning Herald<br><br>Lindsey wrote that Australians' support for the high-profile defendant is based on damaging double standards, in what would otherwise be a relatively unremarkable drugs trial in a foreign country.<br><br>It has now become the major national story in Australia and (she) has become a martyr figureh wrote, adding:<br><br>"Popular reaction to the trial - supporting Schapelle Corby and demonising Indonesia, for the most part - has become so extreme that it is now a national political issue.<br><br>"This public pressure has pushed the Federal Government into<br>unprecedented intervention on behalf of an Australian overseas..<br><br>"The support she has received appears far in excess of what has been provided in the past to other citizens facing drugs charges and the death penalty, including ethnic Asian Australians arrested in Vietnam.<br><br>"The Government response reflects the popular hysteria in Australia asserting Corby's innocence and condemning Indonesia: she is obviously innocent and the Indonesian system is obviously pathetic; their judicial system stinks; I will never travel to Bali again. The sense of<br>aggressive certainty in these assertions is disturbing, for several reasons.<br><br>"First, it is based on a conviction of Corby's innocence that leaves no room for a judicial proceeding that will examine the evidence and conceivably come up with a different view.<br><br>"Instead, it assumes the system must be at fault, and so Indonesia's very different and emergent civil law judiciary has been grossly misrepresented and demonised.<br><br>"Second, the popular pro-Corby position is so uncompromising and emotive that it portrays any alternative view as the product of malice or stupidity.<br><br>"..In the process, rationality begins to suffer; so does policy and, in this case, our image in the region. The death penalty - rejected in Australia decades ago - is a good example of this.<br><br>"It is proper for Australia to oppose the death penalty overseas, and in particular when it is imposed on Australian citizens, but we now have a credibility problem in doing so in Indonesia.<br><br>"When Bali bombers Amrozi, Muhklas and Imam Samudra were sentenced to death by the same court that is trying Corby, this was widely celebrated here.<br><br>"Some Australians offered to pull the trigger or burn them alive, and our Government indicating that execution was appropriate.<br><br>"In light of this, how can our Government now claim that death is a barbaric punishment, as popular opinion has it, if it is imposed on Corby or, as is more likely, the Bali nine?<br><br>"The double standard on the death penalty feeds South-East Asian anxieties about neo-colonial, arrogant and racist attitudes in Australia and perceptions that we are the insular and xenophobic white tribe of Asia.<br><br>"There is a lesson to be learnt from this: what happens in Indonesia directly affects Australians. Whether it is war, terrorism, trials or tsunamis, Australians will always be part of what happens to our near north.<br><br>"It is time we focused more on building links, on repairing the catastrophic decline in Indonesian studies and language skills in Australia and engaging, rather than demonising and shunning, a neighbour, just because it has an Australian on trial."<br>May 29, 2005<br><br>Above from littlespeck.com<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The tsunami aid and drug smuggling cases should never have been connected or cross-referenced.  They were two totally different cases at two totally different levels.<br><br>Furthermore, when we help someone, we do so for the sake of helping (friendship reasons, humanitarian reasons, etc.).  If we help someone with the intention to get something back, then its not a help - instead, its a prepayment or bribe.

But then again, she could've been sentenced to death or life imprisonment (which she was not).<br><br>With the limited information, we cannot decisively conclude whether anyone is guilty or not.  But as a frequent traveller, I know for sure that if there were an extra 4.1 kg weight in my luggage, I'd notice it in a second (not to mention the space would occupy).  4.1 kg does make an obvious and immediate difference when you try to lift it up!<br><br>Any frequent traveller would know how to lock their check-in luggages after they pack it....and never to leave their hand-luggages (or any other luggage) unattended.  I know full well that if anyone slipped anything in my luggage, I would have to take the responsiblity.<br><br>It doesn't really look like a framing case to me too.  If it were, the party framing her would not use 4.1 kg of drugs (because its expensive!....and because he would be risking her finding out when she lifts her bags).<br><br>If it was someone using her as a courier (unknowingly to her), then it would probably be more sensible the other way around (carrying drugs back home).  The person using her would want to get the drugs back....and this is easier done when in your home country (they can track her to her residence address).  Its not easy to track a tourist in a foreign country....so trying to get back whats put in a tourist's bag is a gamble when the tourist is in another country (seems like too expensive a gamble in this case).<br><br></div>

I've been to the local courts before a few times (not me being charged hor? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ).<br><br>In the higher level courts, there are policemen on duty and even if you cross your leg, they will come and tell you to sit properly.  And when addressing the judge, your arms must always be at your side.  If you try to gesture, you will also be told to keep still while talking to the judge.<br><br>I'm surprised the family got away with shouting at the judges in Indonesia!  But then again, it didn't look like much of a proper courtroom (although it was).<br><br></div>
