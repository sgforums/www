              <p>With this kind of controllogy or legalistic tweaking of the election process to fix the electoral voting to stay in power using racial harmony as excuse we could consider the voting as voting for king who will could at will stop people from exercising their voting right with obstacles to the free electoral one-man-one-vote subject to finding of racial candidate to offer for election. Isn't this an artificial device to fix the one-man-one-vote voting system so that when one one is able to vote because of such artificially created impediment to candidature the whole GRC was taken by default by the ruling party.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let the power that be who chance on such artificial device to win by such default created by him sit on the throne forever and call this little red dot the Republic of GRC because unless some one form a mini-government called GRC citizens will lose their voting right.</p>

              <p>The bloody stupid election policy is that you need to have a certification of being a minority race</p>
              <p>It's like duh.... The government doesn't want racial discrimination, yet requires the minority races to apply for a certificate so that a GRC contesting group can be meets the requirement of having at least one minority race. This rule just shows that there's still some racial discrimination involved. Why do minority races need to do this extra work? For what purpose?</p>
              <p>Do they really think that Singaporeans are so stupid that they cannot see who's the minority race that a certification is required?</p>

              <p>When it comes to elections system, a lot of bullshit from PAP regime.</p>
              <p>They are bent on holding on to power.</p>
              <p>Was it Lee Kuan Yew who came up with the GRC bullshit?</p>
              <p><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DE1E3FF937A25751C0A96E948260">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html</a></p>
              <p>I think Lee Kuan Yew can take his GRC bullshit and go and die.</p>
              <p>Old fucker already still want to contest.</p>
              <p>I know Lee Kuan Yew doesn't like people to criticise him.</p>
              <p>But people will still do it after he is dead.</p>
              <p>So isn't it futile?</p>
              <p>The floodgates of criticism will open up against you Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>Now you sue sue sue, no one dare criticise.</p>
              <p>But after you die how?</p>
              <p>How you tell me?</p>
              <p>How?</p>
              <p>After Lee Kuan Yew dies, will people praise Lee Kuan Yew or will they criticise Lee Kuan Yew?</p>
              <p>The answer is obvious.</p>
