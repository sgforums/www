            <div class='col-md body'><strong><br>But the key issue is not the right to voice our views, which all of us enjoy, but the quality of the political system, the substance of the political debate and how decisions made can improve the lives of ordinary citizens.<br></strong><br><br>but our rights are not the same, as our leaders have admitted before, some are more equal than others and therefore enjoy a louder voice than the rest of us.  also, who should be the one passing judgement on the quality of our political system and substance of our debates?  you?  and about improvement of the lives of ordinary folks, no matter your attempts on the surface, we know that ordinary folks will need to serve a lifetime of servitude just to own a roof over their heads, a roof that will be taken back from them in just a few decades.<br><br><strong><br>Singapore has a hard-won international reputation for its high standard of integrity and competence in its politics. The PAP ensures this by insisting on honest, capable political leaders who fulfil their promises to the people. This has served Singapore and Singaporeans well.<br></strong><br><br>but singapore is also a laughing stock when it comes to its reputation as a 'democracy' as every foreigner you meet will have no qualms about ridiculing our impeccable dynastic succession.  again i really have to ask, who decides that we have been served well?  you?  or us?  who decides capability?  you?  or suzhou?<br><br><strong><br>In such a clean and transparent system, all allegations are investigated and lies refuted. Politicians who make scurrilous remarks must be able to back them up with facts. This applies both to the PAP as well as the opposition. This way, voters can decide better to whom they can entrust their future. Mr Cai forgets that Mr Chiam See Tong and Mr Low Thia Khiang have been in politics for over 20 years without suffering any consequences.<br></strong><br><br>just because you say our system is transparent therefore it is?  we don't even have an effective watchdog to check what you're doing how do we know you're as transparent as you claim to be?<br><br>strangely, every allegation that are being refuted always refer to the same party and individuals.  is it possible that so many different individuals have been wrong and always wrong and the same plaintiff has always and will always be right?  just like the NKF?  all these years, Durai was always right, always clean, always transparent and everybody else who spoke against Durai were severely punished.  looked what happened now.<br><br>how are we to know if Mr Chiam and Mr Low had not suffered in silence having been wisened by the examples of JB Jeyaratnam and the like?<br><br><strong><br>Our system is not perfect, but it is far better than the chaotic and dirty politics found in many other countries. Would Mr Cai prefer the political ferment in Thailand and the Philippines, where distrust of the ruling party's action and public conflict are ever present? Or the corruption of so many Asian countries, which have 'freer' political systems and media than Singapore?<br></strong><br><br>i wonder which is better, a chaotic but balanced system that ensures that we are not being taken for a ride or a supposedly 'clean' one that leads us by our noses, even if it is to our own graves?<br><br><strong><br>The PAP Government and its MPs have gained the respect and trust of the people over the years. This is something special.<br></strong><br><br>that is what you would like to believe.  get rid of the GRC and we shall see.<br><br><strong><br>In the United States and Britain - where political debates and scandals dominate - cynicism with the political system has become widespread, resulting in declining voter turn-outs in their general elections. Politicians rank lower than used-car salesmen in public esteem.<br></strong><br><br>but absence of scandals could simply mean the lack of transparency and deliberate cover up of stupendous mistakes by our leaders in the name of 'responsible' news reporting.<br><br><strong><br>According to the book, The Vanishing Voter, by Mr Thomas Patterson, a key reason for the voters' cynicism in the US is that political campaigns seem more like theatre or entertainment than something to be taken seriously. In Singapore, we take our politics seriously.<br></strong><br><br>ours?  a stock exchange where you buy votes and sell upgrading programmes?  except our stupid stock voters don't realise that the upgrades they're buying are actually theirs rightfully in the first place.<br><br>we take politics seriously?  then how come reports show that young voters are indifferent to politics and don't even know who their MPs are?<br><br><strong><br>The PAP is not afraid of different views and, in fact, encourages this. When I was interviewed to be a PAP candidate for the last general election, I made it clear that I disagreed with some of the PAP's policies. Still, I was selected, and I still maintain these views.<br></strong><br><br>more like it is not afraid to stamp out any dissenting views.<br><br><strong><br>Indeed, if the PAP wants to silence dissent, why should it introduce the Non-Constituency MP scheme to give opposition members at least three seats in Parliament? Because of this scheme, Mr Steve Chia, who lost in the last general election, could still enter Parliament as the 'best loser'.<br></strong><br><br>to silence critics i suppose.  non constituency MPs do not have a support base and therefore do not constitute a threat.<br><br><strong><br>All Singaporeans are free to voice their opinions and form associations and, indeed, are encouraged to engage actively in politics if they feel so inclined.<br></strong><br><br>yeah right, to the extent of providing a speakers corner that nobody goes to.<br><br><strong>However, we all have to play by the same rules and be held accountable for our words and actions.<br></strong><br><br>same rules?  more like your rules isn't it?  under which one side has always been penalised heavily while the other side enjoys total protection.<br><br><strong><br>Mr Cai could even consider putting these ideas to the people by contesting in the forthcoming elections himself. After all, this is a democracy.<br></strong><br><br>but the contests are hardly fair and going against the political regime often means being hounded and ruining one's own life, something that would put off even the most convicted of persons.  after all, this is only democracy.</div>
