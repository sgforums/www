              <p>Politics<br>We need a Democratic Party<br>If we want to prevent the government from moving too far towards corporatism at the expense of Singaporeans. By Seah Chiang Nee, littlespeck.com<br>Oct 5, 2008<br><br>When the US House of Representatives first rejected the $700b rescue package, I couldn’t help wondering what Singapore would have done under similar circumstances.<br><br>It took me a whole few seconds to conclude that the ruling People’s Action Party would have done pretty much what the Republicans did.<br><br>It would have rushed to save the major corporations – particularly the government-linked corporations (GLCs) - in order ‘to save the economy from collapsing’.<br><br>The Democratic Party had demanded a more equitable rescue, not just one that helped Wall Street firms hit by the credit meltdown.<br><br>It also wanted bail-out for American people who had lost their homes because of it and the ridiculously high salaries and bonuses for corporate CEOs to be capped.<br><br>Traditionally, the US Republican Party has been conservative and pro-business (not far different from the PAP) while the Democrats tend to be liberal and closer to ‘Main Street’ the people.<br><br>But while the two parties fight tooth and nail over policies, they eventually buried their differences to produce a compromise, an example of how a responsible two-party system operates.<br><br>Americans were (still are) very angry that so much of their tax-dollars are used to bail out failed companies, while millions of Americans still suffer – unaided - from the crisis.<br><br>The Democrats helped make it fairer.<br><br>Had such a rescue package gone before the Singapore Parliament, I told myself, it would surely have passed with 82 out of 84 votes without any real debate or the benefit of alternative input from a mature two-party system.<br><br>There would have been no ‘Democratic Party’ here to debate any fault or shortcoming. In such a case, Singaporeans - individually and collectively - would have paid for it.<br><br>There would have been no alternative plan that reflects the interests of ordinary citizens to balance the objective of rescuing large corporations and the economy.<br><br>This meltdown is now spilling into Singapore and the people of Singapore will suffer for it.<br><br>A sustained recession will likely arrive with Singaporeans facing the prospect of lower income, unemployment and business failure. They need an opposition party strong and capable enough to ensure their concerns and needs are looked after.<br><br>An America in trouble has shown how important a two-party system is to serve the interests of all Singaporeans - not just Big Business – when coming up with solutions to confront the coming crisis.<br><br>In fact Singaporeans need more protection than Americans against overly protective measures to protect business profits when faced with a serious economic crisis without sufficient regard to the people's welfare.<br><br>Many of the corporations that supply crucial public services - public transport, electricity (remember the 21% price hike!) rents, etc – are owned or controlled by the government.<br><br>In such troubled times, there is are tremendous pressures from these firms for increased charges or fees that often more than required. There is a political need for a credible opposition that provides a balance.<br><br>The approaching period of hardship for all will not be well served by an authoritarian government that excludes (or even ‘fixes) the opposition.<br><br>Instead, it needs a ‘Democratic Party’ type opposition to work together with the PAP to produce inclusive, equitable solutions by involving all citizens to take part.<br><br>A two-party system like presupposes there are enough Singaporeans, who are ready and capable to play the role - not an easy task.<br><br>It, of course, runs counter to Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew’s rejection of multi-party democracy.<br><br>He had always hinted that he could have done a lot more for Singapore had it not been for a one-man-one-vote system.<br><br>For years, Lee had maintained that his PAP was non-ideological, but pragmatic and doing what was best for the country.<br><br>While this was true at one time, it is less so today.<br><br>Over the years Singapore had been run like a large corporation, vigorously bent on accumulating profits and reserves. The city-state has, in fact, come to be called Singapore INC.<br><br>At this stage of development, it needs more than just a one-party rule with only minimal opposition role.<br><br>A US-type Democratic Party could bring it back a little to the centre and create a more inclusive society.<br><br>At least it could work for the interests of a large disaffected segment of citizens – not only for the nation’s gross national product.</p>
              <p><em>we definitely need another party to check and monitor the ruling party as unrestrained power will lead to abuse of power.<br></em></p>

              <p>LKY and the PAP are simply too insecure to allow any better person to stand shoulder to shoulder with him to offer any ideas that are as superior and creative as his or that of the PAP.</p>
              <p>Since the 1950s, LKY has seen many talents whom he feel are more capable then himself, and have praised them publicly.</p>
              <p>One such person was Lim Chin Siong, whom LKY introduced to then Chief Minister David Marshall as the most able Singaporean to lead Singapore into independence - being a great orator able to convey ideas and motivate the masses, especially the Chinese educated.</p>
              <p>When LKY had to tussle for political power in the in-fighting between LKY's Western-educated political philosphies against Lim Chin Siong's Eastern-ideas of people's welfare, LKY attempted to use the British Colonial Government to exercise the ISA to arrest Lim Chin Siong's group on the pretext that they were Communist agents.</p>
              <p>Amazingly, the British Colonial Government declined to be used in LKY's politics - and had instead allowed the "Free Competition of Political Ideals" to flourish in Singapore in the 1950s.</p>
              <p>It was during the competition of political wills during Singapore merger with Malaysia, that saw the Lim Chin Siong's Group split from the PAP, to establish the Barisan Socialis Party. </p>
              <p>In order to prevent the Lim Chin Siong's group from derailing LKY's ambitious plans in the merger process that Operation Cold Storage was put into effect, and almost the entire top echelon of the new Barisan Socialist Party were all put into detention without trial. This time the Internal Security acted on the instructions of the Internal Security Council - {formed by representatives from the UK Government, Singapore self-ruled State Government, and the Malaysian Government Representative, and with the Council being dominated by the PAP members}.</p>
              <p>After a few years languishing uselessly in ISA confinement, Lim Chin Siong negotiated for his own exile from Singapore - without being forced to sign any declaration that he was a Communist propagating armed revolution to overthrow the legitimately elected government of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The other leaders of the Barisan Socialists were jailed for over ten years, each being released when the political environment stabilised for LKY and the PAP - and with the World's longest Political Prisoner Chia Thye Poh being released after 32 years of ISA imprisonment that created an anomaly and a political embarrassment to LKY and the PAP Government in the 21st Century.</p>
              <p>This insecure political philosphy of self-preservation and self-centredness has been developed by LKY and the PAP - putting themselves above Singaporeans - resulted in countless other politicians being struck down. Since the politics of the 1960s, these included Dr Lee Siew Choh, J.B.Jeyaratnam, Francis Seow, Tang Liang Hong, and Chee Soon Juan.</p>
              <p>There were also many others who were younger and had the potential to have developed as leaders in the political scene for the Alternative Parties, but these were incarcerated and persecuted based on dubious charges.</p>
              <p>These included tertiary educated persons from the NUS - and not from the supposedly hotbed of communist infested Nanyang University claimed by LKY to one during the 1950s. These included Tan Wah Piow {the NUS Student Union President}, Ms Teo Sur Lung {a trained lawyer from NUS, a keen social worker}, Ms Tang Hong Har {trained lawyer from NUS} - both ladies being part of the "Marxist Conspiracy" in 1987 - and there must be countless others who are capable but had their political interests turned off.</p>
              <p>Can there be any Communists in Singapore, when the tools of a Stalinist-Communist state is firmly in the hands of a State firmly in the grip of LKY and the PAP ?</p>
              <p>In such a political environment where Stalinist-Communist politics is shamelessly and unapologetically practised by LKY and his PAP, while constructing a thin veneer of Capitalist style open market economy - can Singapore ever hope to grow into a full fledge mature First World that LKY can only dream off in his remaining years ?</p>

              <p>But still compared to any other democratic country , especially 1st world ones, how would you characterise the amount of effort put in by Opposition to make a change? Frankly but bluntly, I do not feel its presence and it seems it is hoping that voters somehow change their minds on their own and somehow decide to cast vote for Opposition.   I am sure many many agrees to some extent  with me.</p>
              <p>Do me a favor and just Question the REALity for a second.</p>
              <p>I understand the environment they operate in may not be perfect. But there are enough things they can do to make baby step changes to kick up a momentum over the years. Yet....</p>
              <p>Hong Lim park is under-utilized.</p>
              <p>Activism can be further explored as an option. An activist group can be created to raise awareness and instill some proactivism in our world-known passivism in our so-called 1st world youths. For example, organise an outing to visit our KANGAROOS and let them see for themselves what Kangaroos are and the destructive effect they can have on the society if they are not locked in zoos and go around shiiting all over polluting the youths in terms of the public spaces that Kangaroos running wild can inflict on singapore .</p>
              <p>Kangaroos must be identified and captured and may be even castrated in order to control their population to a controllable level. There might be so many kangaroos hiding around undercover in our midst . Selfishness is the biggest Public Enemy as selfish Kangaroos will sell their souls and ssss  because of selfpreservation and greed for self gain at all expense. When invaded by other animals, kangaroos will be the first to offer their 3rd leg (their muscular tail)</p>
              <p>When Kangaroos run amok, the society of innocent, kind and naive all suffer while they, these animals enjoy selfishly at all expense.</p>
              <p>oh oh, sorry i digressed...</p>

              <p>in the house of representative.</p>
              <p>it is most republicans that oppose the 700billion rescue bill, while democrats mostly vote in favour.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all i can say, singapore is not a typical model a democratic society/country. singaporeans itself it also not a typical democratic ppl. most ppl seem to ve living in a my national socialist society.</p>

              <p>PAP political repression, culture of fear and state controlled propaganda media are the main causes of ignorance and apathy.</p>
