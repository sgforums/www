            <div class='col-md body'>The family lost their 5 room flat to the bank.<br><br>The bank posseseed the flat because they did not keep up with the mortgage payemtns. Now the family is living in a rented 3 room in Hougang paying 800 dollars rent.<br><br>But the bank is also enforcing them to pay 900 dollars per month for the mortgage. The bank says it is not able to sell the flat. So it is keeping the flat locked up.<br><br>Then my question is: Why not give the flat back to the family and they can pay the monthly installments which is the same as the rent they are paying now for the 3 room.<br><br>Atleast by doing that, they get to pay for the ownership of the property while at the same time the bank gets its due. But the bank refuse. It keeps the property after possessing it, then make the family pay the 900 dollars monthly installments, till it says it can find a buyer.<br><br>But that can take ages, if the bank is not making effort to sell the house quickly or it is more interested to collect as much as possible money from the family before it decide to sell the house.<br><br>What the bank is doing is utterly wrong. such actions must be made automatically illegal so that no need to spend money on lawyers etc by the ordinary citizen against the mighty bank.<br><br>Options  Reply<br><br>To:  ALL   Advertisement<br><br>Ads by Google<br><br>Date Singapore Women<br>Singaporean women seek love, dating and marriage.

If the family can afford to pay $800 rent, then why should they default on $900 mortgage in the first place? I think it is more likely that the bank wants the arrears to be settled first before they allow the family to move back to the property. This is a debt-trap that many have fallen into when HDB flat loans were thrown open to the banks, as they were tempted by the low interest rates for the first few years of mortgage. This promotional rates is going to be over soon, and many will be stuck with high interest rates when banks decides to increase their board rates at will. My advice is to either pay up in full in you can, or take loan from HDB only and not from any banks.<br><br>Options  Reply<br><br>From:  johnny333   09:46<br>To:  GoFlyKiteBud   3 of 10<br><br>130335.3 in reply to 130335.1<br><br>Which bank?

After three years and nine months, the default rate of about one per cent is quite high as there are already about 700 foreclosures out of a total of about 70,000 HDB flats with bank loans. On October 13, HDB announced a new procedure that from January 1, 2007 , those who want to apply for a housing loan will first need to obtain a loan eligibility letter before they can commit to buying a new flat. How many Singaporeans have to lose their homes and CPF, before we re-think the policy change of giving the first charge on property to banks?<br><br>As more Singaporeans become ineligible for HDB subsidised loans because they or jointly with their parents have used up the two subsidised loans allowed by HDB, there may be more foreclosures as in contrast, HDB was quoted in the subject Business Times article that they did not repossess any flats in 2004 when only about 10 flat owners gave up their flats on their own accord.<br><br>A mortgagee foreclosure may mean no home, no CPF, and may be made bankrupt too!<br><br>Leong Sze Hian<br><br>Options  Reply<br><br>From:  FakeFacist   12:15<br>To:  GoFlyKiteBud   5 of 10<br><br>130335.5 in reply to 130335.1<br><br>GoFlyKiteBud,<br><br>You can wait and hope for this "law" till you die.<br><br>Options  Reply<br><br>From:  Pro-Singapore (Deenlee)   12:46<br>To:  LeongSzeHian unread  6 of 10<br><br>130335.6 in reply to 130335.4<br><br>We have seen that the banks' board rates are non-tranparent, and many customer have seen their mortgage rates increasing by the months, as new discounted rates only applies to new customers. As jtan45 had pointed out, HDB flat owners who took up bank loans in 2003 will start to feel the pinch when their promotional mortgage rates ends and banks will start charging flexi rates off board rates.<br><br>As for the loan eligbility letter, it only shows how one can service the mortgage at the current time while they are gainfully employed when buying flat. It doesn't help when one is being retrenched later and ends up have difficulty finding employment. So who does this eligibility letter helps?<br><br>Furthermore, it will be a double whammy for those in the 40s later with 3 kids to support. Mortgage rates will then be high, and if they are retrenched, then it will be really difficult for them if they have 3 school going kids. For the average Singaporeans, the future is bleak if they haven't realise it yet.<br><br>Think about it<br><br>Deen Lee<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Edited 22/01/2007 12:52 ET by Pro-Singapore (Deenlee)<br><br>Options  Reply<br><br>From:  GoFlyKiteBud   17:19<br>To:  jtan45 unread  7 of 10<br><br>130335.7 in reply to 130335.2<br><br>You are right. At one point in time the family went into arreas due to a period of unemployment. I think for about less than a year. That was the time when the flat was taken over.<br><br>Fine. I can understand that.<br><br>What I cannot understand is, now they are back on their feet, why not review the whole thing and give back the flat, instead of locking it up, not selling it, forcing them to stay in a rented flat. Then make them pay for the monthly loan payments under threat of bankruptcy proceedings. One can see that the main crux of the mater is, that the bank wants to make some money out of this family by doing all this.<br><br>The bank is creating needless hardship.<br><br>Options  Reply<br><br>From:  DOMtheclown (DrLohJee)   19:43<br>To:  Pro-Singapore (Deenlee) unread  8 of 10<br><br>130335.8 in reply to 130335.6<br><br>Bro Deen,<br>Hi!

But often, it's very difficult to make a decision on what support can be given to such families.<br><br>"As far as options are concerned, there are several that are already in place. One is subsidised rental flats. We look at eligibility criteria, the conditions of the family, and whether we can waive some of these conditions.<br><br>"Secondly, the market rate rentals that are available to these families. The third is an option that very few families tend to fall back on - extended families. We have to recognise that at the end of the day, we want to uphold the policy that the family is the first line of defence.<br><br>"We have to take a look at where the family is. Often times, when we look at the individual cases..., there are family support available. And we explore that with them, but they tend not to want to go back to the family for support.<br><br>"HDB is prepared to help needy cases to rent or buy a flat from HDB. However, such appeals need to be carefully scrutinised to ensure that our limited housing subsidies are fairly distributed to those in need, and are not abused."<br><br>- CNA /ls</div>

Then after that , the company retrench them because of FT or due to the fact the breadwinner was over 40 years old. They had no choice but to work as lowly paid workers because government tells them not to be fussy? Then they had to survive , pay bills , pay school fees , pay maintenance etc ......<br><br>How about that scenario ? Anything to say about it?</div>
