              <p>After 2011, singapore will fall back to 1970s and then further
              regress.  i am referring to the state administration and control over
              government agencies.  corruptions will spread and penetrate, especially
              when casino started operation.  I wonder why the SGD appreciated so
              much recently, apart from imported deflation to contain inflation,
              could it be that the money is starting to flow in at the same time
              steel structure of casino is being erected?</p>
              <p>the ruling party has
              difficulties drawing fresh talents to replace the dying and dementia.
              Oppositions will gain grounds and attract talents now living overseas
              to join forces to fight for injustices.  the growing resentment among
              singaporean can be felt everywhere. </p>
              <p>There is tenancy for
              eminent politician to destroy whatever they build in their dying age. 
              But maybe they are like tibetan monks practicing the ritual of mandala,
              destroy in seconds something they build painstakingly for days or
              months, to demonstrate that everything is impermanent.</p>

              <p>he was not known for adapting and being independent but when put to the test and give it a try, one may discover what you did not think you can accomplish.</p>
              <p>this is true.</p>
              <p>i urge and encourage all youths to either venture overseas or study overseas or work overseas or travel overseas. Just give it a try and will know the difference betw the pore and overseas, how much more fun it is on weekends for foreigners. discover what is FREEDOM.</p>

              <p>everything is a matter of getting used to it.  What everyone fears most is change, and ironically change is taking place every single moment.  People get out of their comfort zone to settle into a new comfort zone and the period in-between is the adjustment period.</p>
              <p>When you first arrived in a new country, maybe everything is strange and unfamiliar to you.  People don't speak your language and don't understand your culture.  You might find that country not as clean as Singapore, the food sucks, no chinese tv or radio programme, nobody to speak singlish to, no newspaper or any print you can read and those in english are selling at high prices, etc etc.  I would say, congratulations to you! You are in for the next level of sophistication.</p>
              <p>You are exposed to a different culture, you will learn to like new food, you will learn a different language and you will make friends of different backgrounds.  There are lots of places to go on weekends, unlike Singapore.  Enjoy the cool mountains, clean beaches with wave you can surf, breath-taking scenary you can only see in magazines in Singapore.  There are lots more you will encounter and benefits.  You bring an air of difference to a new place, everyone is curious about you and treat you nicer compared to their fellow countryman.  You are exposed to new opportunities that you can capitalized with your cross-border network and connections.</p>
              <p>And a whole new world is waiting for you.  Aren't these worth going after for a little bit of discomfort initially?  Anyway we are trained to be exported, with our command of two most important languages in the world.  Have you ever wonder why we studied Simplified Chinese instead of Traditional Chinese like in Hong Kong and Taiwan?</p>
