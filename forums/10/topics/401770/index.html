              <p>According to a report on China’s news portal sohu.com, Singapore’s
              Economic Development Board (EDB) and Manpower Ministry will be
              launching a mass recruitment exercise on 26 June 2010 at Shanghai for
              China’s electrical and software engineers.</p>
              <p>More than 250 vacancies are available in the following positions:
              RIFC Design Engineer, Application Engineer, Digital Design Engineer,
              Equipment and Maintenance Engineer and Senior Hardware Engineer.</p>
              <p>It is not known why Singapore needs to go all the way to China to
              recruit their engineers. Is there a shortage of trained engineers in
              Singapore?</p>
              <p>Each year, more than a thousand electrical and computer engineers
              graduate from NUS and NTU. Why are these vacancies not offered to
              Singaporeans first?</p>
              <p>PAP leaders always claim that foreign workers are needed in sectors
              shunned by Singaporeans. During his May Day Rally this year, Prime
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong called on the “understanding” of Singaporeans
              to accept a higher inflow of foreigners.</p>
              <p>It is unlikely that Singapore engineers will “shun” the jobs on
              offer, why then are Singapore firms still recruiting engineers from
              China?</p>
              <p>Besides engineering jobs, Singapore companies have launched job
              fairs frequently in China and other countries as well for positions
              which can otherwise be filled up by Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>In March, a Singapore bus company put up a job advertisement in a
              Sichuan newspaper to recruit bus drivers from its provincial capital
              Chengdu.</p>
              <p>A month later, EDB officials flew to Taipei to launch a recruitment exercise for Taiwanese engineers and graphic designers.</p>
              <p>As expected, these news were never reported by the Singapore media
              which continue to deceive and mislead Singaporeans that there are
              “plenty” of jobs available in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Without a free and independent press to reveal the reality on the
              ground, Singaporeans will forever live under the delusion that their
              government can “do no wrong.”</p>

              <p>see the latest saga at Foxconn. their production oeprator after the massive 60% salary raise is still only about sgd$400 ++.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>of course they go cn recruite their engineers lah. prob sgd$1000++ can get uber 'good' ones. how you going to challenge them on salary. you low they lower than you.</p>
              <p>the prob in sg is not about productivity. the old man policy don;t work any more. we are becoming like japan. time for the old man to die or just sit back and think how we can increase ouur land area. don;t always die die use our waterways and depend on logistics and transport. see how fragile our waters can be with the recent oil spill? as long as we know where to add land on our waters i rather go live and be farmer myself when land prices becomes cooler in sg. its a dream but that;'s what the old man said himself, think out of the box. don;t be afraid to do the impossible. the hardest part is stepping out to take the first steps.</p>

              <p>no, we are not Japan, and can never be a Japan, we got no big corporation like toyota or honda, and certainly, we are mix color type of people and japan are more one color type.</p>
              <p>Old man once said to those MNC who wanted to operate here in singapore but find the cost of operating too high,</p>
              <p>"You invest in Singapore, we give you good infrastructure, state of art logistic and port services both in sea and airport, peace and harmonous industrial relationship and cheap labour from oversea for you to use at a 70% against local 30%"</p>
              <p>So instead of Companies having to move to cheaper labour places and face with social and infrastructure problem such as employees' committing suicide, shipment delay due to human fault or typhoon, earthquake, workers strike or protest, riot and poor quality due to low skill or farmers turn workers condition, Companies can tap on Singapore, who are able to move the cheap labour into Singapore, yet provide a good peaceful production with just in time logistics, quality Singaporeans technician, supervisors and management, and also a financial hub and a vibrant life for companies expatriate to work in.</p>
              <p>Now, i hope people understand why sing govt open their door to work permit holders.</p>

              <p>most does not imply no, there are some good business people out there who understand the workers aspiration and difficulties, on the other hand, if business is not about making money, that is not business, that is charity and if that is not business, it will collapse and instead of few suffer, every one will suffer and go jobless.</p>
              <p>The balance hang on both side of the coin, all of us are humans, the destiny of you becoming  management or workers is in your hands, there is no wrong or right, both depend on each other with the govt standing in between. Management have the right to hire or fire a worker, and a worker also have the right to work or resign. But of course, most parents would want their childrens to grow up in the management side with more income and higher status in life, but that is not cheap, it takes hard works and education, even if you said polishing apple, it is also a skill and a sacrification.</p>
              <p>I understand my staffs well, because i was like them once, the problem mostly start is that a boss come in from some oxford or harvard U and dunno who is who and what is a worker life, then things get one sided. On the other hands, a worker must also understand the boss position, it is not easy, you need make sure you make profit, stay within your KPI and give unpopular decision.</p>
              <p>Who want to be a taitai, tai tai are the worst of all women life, eveyday worry about where the husband go, or husband have affair with someone, worry about whether can get his properties and have to serve in laws well...unlike anormal housewife of a worker, she sure know her husband well, after all, with that kind of pay, how much can her husband spent on, and which gal will like him...with a lower pay, everynite also hv to come home and eat..sleep and have sex..</p>

              <p>that means they go exploit on others low salaries and then heck care about their citizens ability to find work? no wonder alot of citizens are unhappy about the influx of these foreigners here coming here to compete jobs with us. I will make sure my vote is put to good use if my ward is not not an walkover. I shudder to think sporeans will really be a minority when the next next GE comes along. by then it will be too late.</p>

              <p><br>We do take in malaysian and indonesian talents, in fact some of our Ministers are malaysian and indonesian, and they are a high percentage of malaysian who become PR or citizenship working and living in Singapore after marrying Singapore wifes.</p>
              <p>Malaysian are our Traditional sources, unlike those Non traditional source, but not all malaysian are willing to become our PR or citizens, because working and earning here and then go back to malaysia, provide them a better and lower cost of living. We wanted malaysia to come in, especially the Chinese one, but not all are willing to come, it become a time when we needs peoples further than Malaysia.</p>
              <p>As said, PRC are chinese, not being racist here, sg govt are looking to increase the already down chinese population here,  this initiate batch maybe be that good, but we hope to see the next generation of their babies be true singapore. Just bear with it.</p>
