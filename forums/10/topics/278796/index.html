The idea was to stage a demonstration with their toys and do a photo shoot at *Scape (Slogan for the youth park: Feel the Space. Fill the Space).<br><br></blockquote>My understanding of singaporean is we are KIA.<br><br>so, how could it possibly that there are 8 who come out with banners and protest messages and assembled in group of 8 in Youth Park?<br><br>this is not possible to me.<br><br>I thus wonder what gave these young people the powers to do so.<br><br>and did they get in jail or get court sentence?<br><br>and then recently the black saturday.<br><br>I see some pattern emerging.

ODEX is the exclusive licensee of ONLY ONE anime title here, yet they could send out thousands of lawyer letters asking for compensation otherwise they see you in court.<br><br>To protest for their rights, I don't see any wrong. To protest because they downloaded anime regardless of whether ODEX is the exclusive licensee, that would be wrong.<br><br>If you have read the thread in Club Otaku... you would have found out how absurd things are. 40 odd pages + some research on the Net will take you about 2 days to digest.</div>
