            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BillyBong:</div><div class="quote_body">There is some possible truth to your views.<br><br>The Malaysian High Commissioner to Singapore wrote into the ST Forum recently to refute wild claims of singaporeans being singled out and targeted for car thefts and robberies. He cited that the on average, the figure came to no more than 1%, indicating that the majority victims were Johor-ians.<br><br>He also commented that he was personally mystified over the alleged 'blowing-up' of articles and reports by SPH that highlighted the plight of a minority group of singaporeans who have had the misfortune of suffering from petty theft or being robbed at knife-point.<br><br>He reiterated that Johor was still relatively safe, that the police was taking appropriate action and preventive measures and Singaporeans should not be too easily swayed by exaggrated newspaper reports. </div></blockquote>What is really staggering is the attitude of the authorities such as the High Commissioner. It is a fact that singaporean got mugged and cars stolen. Instead of assuring us that they would take measures to reduce such cases or set up hotlines or police posts to assist singaporeans involved, they are simply saying that what singaporeans are encountering is nothing and we need to be more careful the next time, its either you were not careful or simply your luck wasn't with you.<br><br>Mugging and car theft are everywhere in any cities but in responding to complaints from the victimes, especially the tourists, the malaysian authorities are one and only one of its kind.</div>

Why create unnecessary trouble in foreign land? The issue here is : Should they have compromised when they were at a clear advantage? Plus this happened at a crowded shopping mall.. Any gang out there with some cow sense will not dare to do anything unless they answer to the god of stupidity. A smarter solution will be to 'escort' that moron to the nearest security post or police station.<br><br>And assuming the local police sided with that moron, what can possibly happen to the 3 S'poreans?<br><br></div>
