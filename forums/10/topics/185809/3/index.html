            <div class='col-md body'>Have been watching this thread for a few days now, and think now I should say something finally <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I grew up in JB myself...was there since I was 9 until I was 18 (when I left for my studies here). I have always thought of it as a safe and peaceful place, compared to larger cities such as KL etc. Or maybe the place I used to stay in is in the suburban area in Johor, hence it has always given me the small town feeling where everything is idyllic and nothing bad ever happened. And nothing bad has ever happened before in my neighborhood, except the occasional robberies which I think would occur anywhere else in the world as well.<br><br>I do not know the situation there now, because it has been 2 years since I went back home. When I read this news I was kinda shocked because City Square used to be one of my fave haunts when I was still living in JB and I have never witnessed any sort of this kinda incidents happening there before even though I have been there lots of times.<br><br>I think one thing that can be done is to make sure you do not attract attention of the robbers and not wearing anything valuable (jewelry pieces, etc)...and maybe it is also wise if you can get a local to be with you during your trip there. Or even better "disguise" yourself as one of the locals there, if can try to speak their slangs or language... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is a fact that Singaporeans are really getting robbed there in JB. My friends and their biker friends can tell you 1001 stories about such incidents.<br>My friend on a bike was stopped by a malaysian biker claiming that he is from the Malaysian TP and flash the TP ID. My friend saw that it looked real but did not examine it carefully. ASked for driving license, my friend gave it but when asked for passport my friend got suspicious and declined. Then my friend siam and the Malaysian guy give chase. At a junction, got 2 other malaysian bikers then as my friend and his fireblade speed past them, they thought he racing with them so they join in. Now got 3 people racing after him through the lanes and backlanes in johor. After some time my friend escape the guy and found one uncle and told him about it. The uncle said the guy probably an imposter and brought my friend to the police station to make a report. There, the "imposter" all of a sudden came up to my friend and give him back the driving license and warn him say next time don't do it again. Then he siam. My friend try give chase but he siam already. Lucky!<br>Another of my friend, his parents went to malaysia with a few relatives in a family MPV. On the way home at night about 2am, on the expressway suddenly got a group of malaysian bikers surround the MPV. COnfirm kena one, but luckily up ahead got police roadblock, then all the bikers all siam. Lucky!<br>My mom recently account to me that her friend was on a bike with the husband at a traffic light in Johor. Suddenly, a biker zoom past and the pillion grab the purse and siam.

My friends and their biker friends can tell you 1001 stories about such incidents.<br>My friend on a bike was stopped by a malaysian biker claiming that he is from the Malaysian TP and flash the TP ID. My friend saw that it looked real but did not examine it carefully. ASked for driving license, my friend gave it but when asked for passport my friend got suspicious and declined. Then my friend siam and the Malaysian guy give chase. At a junction, got 2 other malaysian bikers then as my friend and his fireblade speed past them, they thought he racing with them so they join in. Now got 3 people racing after him through the lanes and backlanes in johor. After some time my friend escape the guy and found one uncle and told him about it. The uncle said the guy probably an imposter and brought my friend to the police station to make a report. There, the "imposter" all of a sudden came up to my friend and give him back the driving license and warn him say next time don't do it again. Then he siam. My friend try give chase but he siam already. Lucky!<br>Another of my friend, his parents went to malaysia with a few relatives in a family MPV. On the way home at night about 2am, on the expressway suddenly got a group of malaysian bikers surround the MPV. COnfirm kena one, but luckily up ahead got police roadblock, then all the bikers all siam. Lucky!<br>My mom recently account to me that her friend was on a bike with the husband at a traffic light in Johor. Suddenly, a biker zoom past and the pillion grab the purse and siam.
