              <p>THE Supreme Court is investigating how transcripts and audio
              recordings of a recent court hearing - to assess damages to be
              awarded to the Prime Minister and Minister Mentor in a libel suit -
              ended up on the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) website.</p>
              <p>Seven audio snippets of the May 26-28 hearing appeared on the
              SDP website between June 10 and June 15, according to their time
              stamps.</p>
              <p>Five of these focused on exchanges between SDP chief Chee Soon
              Juan and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>The other two were exchanges between Dr Chee's sister, Ms Chee
              Siok Chin, and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>Also uploaded on the website were transcripts of some of the
              exchanges that took place when Dr Chee cross-examined MM Lee on the
              witness stand.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GPN miscalculated again</strong></span> and again</p>

              <p>would get him released.He is wrong.</p>
              <p>In his 19 june 2008 blogs,he says police may charge him</p>

              <blockquote>In this case, the police had alleged they were suspecting a crime.
              Since that was done, I had no choice but to permit them to have access
              to my private Emails. Of course, I did not send any emails to anyone,
              but knowing that since my arrest, the police had seized my notebook(<strong><em>lion note:paper note book)</em></strong> containing my Email password, there was <span style="color: #ff0000;">no telling what the police
              would do, such as tampering with my Emails or implanting offending
              Emails by themselves.</span><br><br>Clearly Singaporeans do not have the right
              to privacy or the right to be free from unlawful search and seizure or
              if they did; the police have the right to just ignore it.<br><br>I had
              no choice but to permit the officer to have access to my Email account.
              I had stated in my written response that I was permitting them to have
              access to my Email account under protest since it has now transpired
              that they or others at their behest may have tampered with my Email
              account since they have produced documents falsely accusing me of
              sending Emails to Judge Belinda Ang and others. Therefor since I am to
              use the police computer, <span style="color: #ff0000;">there may be a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">strong possibility</span> that they
              may have implanted offending Emails into my email account so as to

                  Commenting that<strong> Britain should make a strong western pact with France

                  be in a position to make war again. <strong>"Russia deserves what is coming to
                  her as she will never stop undermining capitalistic governments in

                  stongest power on earth in 10 years, and may be a more dangerous enemy

              <p>No GST in free port Hk? In Brit's colonial days you might want to add. And no taxes too. 98% of HKgers dont pay taxes. They don't need to. Afterall, they robbed the citizens of its trade and rent revenues and provided only minimal social services, left the citizens to rot with corrupt enforcement and civil agencies.</p>
              <p>And no, it was not a brits that instituted no GST. It was the current HKgers who decided no. They have no worries of their future generations. It had already been decided. In 2047, their children will be ruled by the communists. Why need to build up a nest egg to be absorbed by China?</p>
              <p>No means testing means anyone can get subsidies as long as the criteria of giving is base on salary alone. Even those who comes from a large family with a bigger combined household income than the poor guy who earns $800 a mth feeding a stay home wife and 2 school kids. </p>
              <p>Since your kind love HK so much, thinking of emigrating to HK? Have fun, Communist! :-P.</p>

              <p>(2) to prevent France from honoring her alliances with these countries;  and</p>

              <p>From 1933 till 1939, England's stand was of appeasement to Hitler. Despite Hitler's tyrannical ways and facists atittudes towards non-Aryans on public display, England didn't bother. They don't care.</p>
              <p>Neville Chamberlian came to power in 1937.</p>
              <p>But by 1939, when  Poland was attacked, it became too late to stop Hitler. For 6 years, they could have saved Europe by stopping Hitler or challenging him, but your beloved Brits chosed to turn a blind eye.</p>
              <p>These are your heroes who created questionable institutions whom you now presume to worship.  </p>

                      in 1939. In the earlier period the chief figures in this group were
                      Lord Curzon, Lord D'Abernon, and General Smuts. They did what they
                      could to destroy reparations, permit German rearmament, and tear down

              <p>GPN blog of 21 june 2008 is just a classic example.</p>
              <p>1<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>.NOT one blog or two,but 300 highly defamatory,if not seditious</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>blogs</strong></span></p>
              <p>Dunt fool by his--blogger --next door--look.He is a UK trained</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">lawyer </span>of 25 years practice,10 in SG and 15 in USA.</p>
              <p>Supposed to be a mature man of 58 years old.</p>
              <p>He said</p>
              <blockquote><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";'>For doing nothing more than writing <strong>a blog
                                      critical of a judge</strong>, I was arrested by 5...</span></blockquote>
              <p>He just mentions in this blog of writing one blog</p>
              <p>then he got arrested.But he forget to tell u that from Dec 2006 to date,</p>
              <p>he wrote about 300 blogs which are all highly critical of Singapore,</p>
              <p>if not seditious and defamatory.</p>
              <p>He already confessed in his 2 infamous Made In SG blogs</p>
              <p>that</p>
              <blockquote>There is no doubt in the Singaporean sense, I have <span style="color: #ff0000;">defamed </span>him(LKY) and his

              <p><br>Now,let see if AG will prosecute him under Sedition Act.</p>
              <p>Pl note SG,like  Oz,require AG's consent to prosecute</p>
              <p>people under Sedition Act.</p>
              <p>So u see the head of AG also in chopping board</p>
              <p>if he gives his consent.</p>
              <p>GPN should know SG laws much better than u .</p>
              <p>Take a good look of my old postings.He gave u a impression</p>
              <p>that there is some special relationship between new SG Law Minister</p>
              <p>and DPM.Also,he spelled some colorful words about his peers</p>
              <p>of SG lawyers.He is just not keen to make friends here.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2.Cheat us that he still need report daily till 14 July</strong></span></p>
              <p>In this blog,</p>
              <blockquote>the court ordered me to attend the police station every day at 9 am in the morning until July 14, 2008</blockquote>
              <p> But in his 18. june blog,he said no need unless advised to do so.</p>
              <p>So,what game he wants to play now?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3. </strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";'>solitary confinement</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>He complained solitary confinement for 5 days.</p>
              <p>I think it is a norm for those ''advance and educated'' inmates.</p>
              <p>I think anyone can forget to eduacte more pple for democracy,</p>
              <p>civil disobedience etc in prison.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">No one will blame you if you cannot come to a conclusion that no stand has been made in my statements - afterall how much can a boy-boy understand about the adult world of politics ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">A boy-boy can only think of politics like he thinks of ice-cream - with the juvenile ability to lick-up any ''action'' in a "peoples party" - without knowing how to differentiate if the "action" is of any good, and to which side of the "peoples" the "party" intend to serve.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Pray tell which part of my post has the twisted views that are seen to be slanderous in your little boy-boy eyes - a point that you have still been too shy to respond ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Not so clever for boy-boy to divert attention with another juvenile retort after being slapped for the juvenile attempt at distorting history that the adults have clearly arranged. Time for a little boy to grow up, instead of retrograding.</span></p>
