                  professionals in the Singapore Citizenry - that they will

                  even before you clowns gain the mandate to rule?</span></p>

              <p>Jojo, Singapore is ruled by laws. We live in a civilised society, where the strong protects the weak, and not a society where the strongest survive.</p>
              <p>The only way in which the strong can protect the weak is thru the rule of law. Laws of which we, different individuals, with different aspirations and personalities may agree upon and live side by side, if not in harmony, at least in peace, instead of fighting with one another in order to survive and for future generations to survive.</p>
              <p>Such laws are uniform and universal, fully applicable to all in Singapore, whether he is a PM or a cleaner.</p>
              <p>Without laws, we will revert back to barbarism, no better than animals of the wild.</p>
              <p>Within our society, it is perfectly normal to accuse someone of a crime or offense. But you would have to have evidences before you do so, otherwise you are only slandering the good name of someone.</p>
              <p>Politics may be dirty to you, but no matter how dirty it becomes, no one is above the law. If anyone is accused, he would be given a fair trial, before our judges, whose credibility is unquestionable, made up of men who had provened personal integrity whom rules in an independent court without fear or favour, with rulings in accordance with our agreed upon laws applicable for all.</p>
              <p>So if you wish to accuse, you better get evidences. If not, you are slandering. Worse still if you persist or distort the truth, telling lies and half truths, espacially if it concerns the running of a country or head of state. You will be deem to be spreading anarchy or rebellion, which is totally dangerous not to leaders of state, for they are only a minority, but to the safety of men, women and children of Singapore. </p>
              <p>Never forget the race riots of our past and how innocent lives were hurt or lost through the political ambitions of a few. </p>

              <p>Gazelle, what is your view on this:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A WP statement yesterday wanted the Public Prosecutor <strong>"to explain
              why it was not an offence for Mr Goh Chok Tong, BG Lee Hsien Loong and
              Dr Tony Tan to stand, not only within the grounds of the station, but also
              to enter into the polling area to observe voters casting their votes".</strong></p>
              <p>On the advice of the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC), <strong>the police had
              dismissed the complaints last week</strong>, saying that there was no provision
              in the Parliamentary Elections Act for any offence of unauthorised entry
              into, or presence within, a polling station.</p>
              <p>But yesterday's two-page WP statement pointed out that section 82 of
              the Parliamentary Elections Act said that: <strong>"No person shall wait outside
              any polling station on polling day, except for the purpose of gaining entry
              to the polling station to cast his vote."</strong></p>
              <p>It also quoted the paragraph in the Act that said: <strong>"No person shall
              loiter in any street or public place within a radius of 200 metres of any
              polling station on polling day."</strong></p>
              <p>The statement, signed by WP chief J. B. Jeyaretnam, said that the party
              was <strong>"amazed" that the police had ruled that no offence had been
              disclosed in five police reports filed, including two made by the Singapore
              Democratic Party.</strong></p>
              <p>It also noted that the complaint against the PAP leaders and members
              was not that they were exchanging greetings and shaking hands with voters
              in the polling stations. Instead, it was that under the law<strong> they had no
              business to be present within the polling stations' precincts when they
              were not the wards' candidates.</strong></p>
              <p>Noting that the law made it an offence for non-voters to wait or loiter
              within a radius of 200m outside a polling station, the <strong>WP asked if the
              Public Prosecutor was suggesting that it was acceptable for them to enter
              the grounds of the polling station and loiter there instead...</strong></p>

              <p>Poh, I will answer on behalf of gazzelle, for i am not him, as i believe you are addressing me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You yourself, in your post had already answered your question. The answer is:-</p>
              <p>"On the advice of the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC), <strong>the police had dismissed the complaints last week</strong>, saying that there was no provision in the Parliamentary Elections Act for any offence of unauthorised entry into, or presence within, a polling station."</p>
              <p>However, WP argued that there was a provision. Why didn't they pursue the matter and seek resolution from our independent judiciary?</p>
              <p>By all means, accuse, its their rights, if they THINK they have a case. But if they fail to seek resolution, then who is to be blamed? <strong>Better you ask WP instead of speculating here. Do you wish to spread anarchy? </strong></p>

              <p>Jojo, Singapore is ruled by laws. We live in a
                      civilised society, where the strong protects the weak, and not
                      a society where the strongest survive.</p>
              <p>The only way in which the strong can protect the weak is thru
                      the rule of law. Laws of which we, different individuals, with
                      different aspirations and personalities may agree upon
                      and live side by side, if not in harmony, at least in peace,
                      instead of fighting with one another in order to survive and
                      for future generations to survive.</p>
              <p>Such laws are uniform and universal, fully applicable to all in
                      Singapore, whether he is a PM or a cleaner.</p>
              <p>Without laws, we will revert back to barbarism, no better than
                      animals of the wild.</p>
              <p>Within our society, it is perfectly normal to accuse someone of
                      a crime or offense. But you would have to have evidences before you
                      do so, otherwise you are only slandering the good name of
                      someone.</p>
              <p>Politics may be dirty to you, but no matter how dirty it
                      becomes, no one is above the law. If anyone is accused, he would be
                      given a fair trial, before our judges, whose credibility is
                      unquestionable, made up of men who had provened personal integrity
                      whom rules in an independent court without fear or favour,
                      with rulings in accordance with our agreed upon laws applicable for
                      all.</p>
              <p>So if you wish to accuse, you better get evidences. If not, you
                      are slandering. Worse still if you persist or distort the truth,
                      telling lies and half truths, espacially if it concerns the running
                      of a country or head of state. You will be deem to be spreading
                      anarchy or rebellion, which is totally dangerous not to leaders of
                      state, for they are only a minority, but to the safety of men,
                      women and children of Singapore. </p>
              <p>Never forget the race riots of our past and how
                      innocent lives were hurt or lost through the political
                      ambitions of a few. </p>

              <p>If you talking about court is independent to the common people is ok lah.</p>
              <p>But how can a court be independent when MM is involve har ??? Very strange leh.</p>
              <p>Ofcors I doubt the court will make Nair bankrupt lah.. Since he give up SG citizenship liao.. he cannot go for election lor. That already satisfy one of the disqualification for election mah. You go think about it lah.</p>

              have adequate space for the voting to be carried out. Any space has a perimeter.
              The words "within a radius of 200 metres" ' therefore mean "200

              <p>If such political groups are not satisfied with the answer given, there are peaceful parliamentary avenues to express their dissatisfaction or seek redress.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I ask you.</p>
              <p>Had they, for whom they seek to represent, usefully utilised such means?</p>
              <p>Had they exhausted every one of them?</p>
              <p>And also, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if one political group is allowed to move within the so called radius, can other groups too, not follow suit?</span> Afterall, did we see any politician, ruling or opposition, weld menacing guns and pointed at anyone going into polling stations, or intimidated anyone there with threats when citizens whose vote would ultimately be secret within the both? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Poh, in the silence of those political opposition figures who did nothing except to complain on blogs when they could have done better, we the citizens can only deem them satisfied with answers provided. The case is closed. To pursue what is already closed would amount to a will to spread anarchy. Is this your recommended course of action?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please, please pardon my presumption, but you MAY be an ex-inmate of an mental institution, thus will not be held accountable for your actions by the authorities, BUT DO spare a thought for those other innocent lives who must account for their actions if they were to follow your recommendations.</p>

                                          said to be within a radius of 200 metres of a polling
                                          station.</strong> A polling station must have adequate space for
                                          the voting to be carried out. Any space has a perimeter. The words
                                          "within a radius of 200 metres" ' therefore mean "200 metres from
                                          the perimeter of" any polling station. This point is illustrated in
                                          the diagrams in the Appendix.</p>

              <p>If Justice Belinder Ang could recall, it was MM Lee who issued the challenge to sue people for telling lies about in the blogs about government in the recent defamation suit by MM Lee and PM LHL against opposition politicians CSJ and his sister CSC.</p>
              <p>Gopalan was only responding to MM Lee'c challenge. He brought to attention in his blog Singapore government's persecution of political dissidents. Belinder Ang could be his key witness. She could be asked to take the stand to testify whether in that case whether MM Lee has actually issued the challenge to anyone for lies about government. If the judge could testify this challenge then the issue involved should be whether Gopalan was justified in calling a spade a spade offering to be sued by MM Lee to test the veracity of his challenge to bloggers as a leader.</p>
              <p>If Gopalan's calling of judges and government names of his particular description is indeed truly a spade why should Gopalan be faulted for in that case he would be just responding to MM Lee's challenge to test the integrity of the government as claimed by MM Lee.</p>
              <p>What else does MM Lee want? If people do not challenge his statement of this nature, how then could any verify the integrity of his government as he has tried to present to the court in his defamation case against CSJ and his sister.</p>

              <p>very funny that he mentioned western media using blogger to blacken the name of Singapore.   all he has been saying here in sgforums tells what sort of idiot he is --&gt; lionnoisy.   Indeed, he is really noisy with not much to contribute but noise --&gt; empty vessel makes the most noise.  Gopalan writes his own blog out of his own free will and it has nothing to do with the western media.     </p>
              <p>If the ruling party is so upright, so transparent, so democratic, western media will not keep exposing them.</p>
              <p>Either the brain of lionnoisy is totally blocked or he is plain stupid to side the ruling party blindly.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do I need to cast any aspersion on the independence of our judiciary ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Just put some of the political decision of our judiciary to any independent legal panel of international jurist - and we should be able to get a neutral and indpendent opinion that will clarify this question.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The 1992 Privy Council decision to overturn the highest Singapore of Appeal that was presided by the Chief Justice had found the decision to be flawed, and upheld a lower court decision by District Judge Michael Khoo to be correct.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">LKY had publicly stated in his challenge to JBJ that he will seek a Presidential Pardon for JBJ if the Privy Council were to find him clean of all those political charges.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Privy Council did find the charges and judgment to be in error, and LKY renegaded on his very public statement to JBJ.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The hypocrisy of it all was that LKY pushed through a bill to remove the Privy Council from being the final arbiter in Singapore Judicial System - claiming that it was out of touch with Singapore's values and culture - when he was also the very person to INSIST keeping the Privy Council to ensure high standard of judicial decision and practices.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What has values and culture have to do with the sense of justice.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The absurdity of his reason simply rapes human logic.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has LKY any respect for the Singapore Laws or is he above the Laws that he initiated simply to secure his own political relevance and power in Singapore ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">At his slightest whim he will have Chia Thye Poh, Lim Chin Siong, and ex-member of the PAP to be incarcerated for daring to differ and challenge from his political ideals and agenda.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com.sg/search?hl=en&amp;q=chia+thye+poh+&amp;meta=">‘Chia Thye Poh’  </a>- <span style="color: #0000ff;">was incarcerate for over 24 years, and to Chia's credit he managed to resist the regular taunting by his political tormentors to withstand their efforts to tempt him with freedom - if only he will submit an admission to LKY's charge that Chia was advocating a "Communist armed revolution to overthrow a legitimately elected government of Singapore".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yet without getting Chia's written admission to LKY's accusation, Chia Thye Poh was released from being incarcerate under the ISA - which was surprising as Chia was considered to be more potent a threat than the members of the Social Wing of the Singapore Catholic Church - who were similarly accused by LKY to be members of an under-ground Communist cell attempting to inflitrate the Catholic Churhc in the same manner as the events in the Philippines and Latin America had developed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">24 years of Chia's life was wasted and released as a pauper, while LKY lived in the comfort of the Istana, consolidated his own political position and passed a legislation for the Million Dollar Wages - that he need as a crutch to prevent corruption amongst his appointees as Ministers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If LKY had given the minimum justice to his political challengers, he would have been as deserving as the amount of justice that he dispenses to his political opponents.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has he not arbitrarily become the accuser, prosecutor and judge of all whom he see as challenging threats to his political fortunes and that of his successors ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do I need to slander LKY, or has the facts of the events that had transpired not true ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will LKY dare to submit himself to an International Court of Justice to redeem himself and the Singapore Judiciary of wrong doings, wrong judgments - all of which goes against the grain of human decency ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">it is in such oppressive circumstance that you have conscientious individuals like CSJ, Gopalan, Francis Seow, Tan Liang Hong, Robert Ho, daring to butt head with LKY - and there are similar individuals that appear in the Communist Soviet Union, China, East Germany, Communist Poland, Communist Czekoslovakia, Communistg Hungary, Communist Georgia, Myanmar and all the other societies and communities that are subjected to oppressive rule.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Their methods maybe disputable, but their goals remain the same - and that is to seek more space for the Citizens, and return to the Citizens the dignity of deciding for themselves their political future - in the same manner as the First World Citizens of Switzerland.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then again, what will a juvenile DeerHunter know, or even attempt to understand when all he sees is through the narrow myopic vision of his telescope ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it is not to have politicians being present at the time the ballot paper is being considered, and the Law had assumed that the presence of politicians will place undue pressure of influence on the decision making process of a Citizen.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Or is the Silence an abject resignation to a hopeless situation in which dirty politiking has been seen to be practised in the characteristic ways that are already well know ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is a fact that the majority of Singaporeans are Chinese, and LKY know that the Chinese fear violence, and hold the prospect of wealth creation above all else.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">However, LKY should not falsely assume that such an attitude will persist into perpetuity, as there will come to a point in time, when there is no hope, and no future - that will result in the Chinese taking on a more pro-active role in participating more actively in the political process.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The PRC Chinese had shown that tolerance to an existing situation will reach boiling point - as was seen in the Tian-An Men incident.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is simply bravado for LKY to speak that the shooting of 1000 person is acceptable if it ensure peace for China.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Does he believe that he can get away with the same act in Singapore ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If at all, LKY for all the blusterful of talk - in his knuckle-duster, axe-wielding, and shooting  - he is still a very careful Lawyer, ensuring that he work within the fine interpretation of the Law, even as he is prepared to stretch the legal interpretation of the Law to maximum stretchable perimeters of logic.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">China being a benign super-power, the Government can and has got away with murdering 1000 citizens in the Tian-An Men incident - do you seriously think that LKY or his Government will get away doing the same when the Singapore population is only a fraction that of China ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There is still the International Court of Justice that scrutinise the poliitcal persecution of rougue governments - especially when mass killings occur.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If LKY dare to shoot 1000 Singaporeans, do you think he can hide himself from such a murderous crime ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Before consdiering others as being mentally suspect - are you capable of knowing of your own mental inadequacies, let alone your potency ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">From your effort to be a macho DeerHunter - you can hardly even sniff out a Deer, let alone hunt it down. Perhaps hunting a Gazelle will be more rewarding for you, if you can wank some "point_blank" shots without htiting 'blank points'.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">To the credit of Chia Thye Poh he refused this conditional offer of freedom, and continued to demand for an open ttrial with evidence produced.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will LKY dare to subject his charges - that James Gomez is a liar, or CSJ is a cheat, or JBJ is a charlatan - to an independent and politically neutral tribunal that is similar to the International Court of Justices ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely if he is supremely correct, it will be in the interest of Singapore and himself - to obtain a clear and unequivocal clearance that will shut all such claims that he finds offensive ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did LKY spread anarchy or rebellion in his outrageous accusation towards JBJ, Tang Liang Hong, Francis Seow, CSJ, and even Chiam See Tong ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If at all, his derogatory remarks of Chiam's O-Level results led to an overwhelming votes given to Chiam as a outright display to spite LKY's outrageous views towards a loyal and conscientious Singaporean.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do I need to cast any aspersion on the independence of our judiciary ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Just put some of the political decision of our judiciary to any independent legal panel of international jurist - and we should be able to get a neutral and indpendent opinion that will clarify this question.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The 1992 Privy Council decision to overturn the highest Singapore of Appeal that was presided by the Chief Justice had found the decision to be flawed, and upheld a lower court decision by District Judge Michael Khoo to be correct.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">LKY had publicly stated in his challenge to JBJ that he will seek a Presidential Pardon for JBJ if the Privy Council were to find him clean of all those political charges.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Privy Council did find the charges and judgment to be in error, and LKY renegaded on his very public statement to JBJ.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The hypocrisy of it all was that LKY pushed through a bill to remove the Privy Council from being the final arbiter in Singapore Judicial System - claiming that it was out of touch with Singapore's values and culture - when he was also the very person to INSIST keeping the Privy Council to ensure high standard of judicial decision and practices.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What has values and culture have to do with the sense of justice.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The absurdity of his reason simply rapes human logic.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has LKY any respect for the Singapore Laws or is he above the Laws that he initiated simply to secure his own political relevance and power in Singapore ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">At his slightest whim he will have Chia Thye Poh, Lim Chin Siong, and ex-member of the PAP to be incarcerated for daring to differ and challenge from his political ideals and agenda.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com.sg/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=chia+thye+poh+&amp;amp;meta=">‘Chia Thye Poh’  </a>- <span style="color: #0000ff;">was incarcerate for over 24 years, and to Chia's credit he managed to resist the regular taunting by his political tormentors to withstand their efforts to tempt him with freedom - if only he will submit an admission to LKY's charge that Chia was advocating a "Communist armed revolution to overthrow a legitimately elected government of Singapore".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yet without getting Chia's written admission to LKY's accusation, Chia Thye Poh was released from being incarcerate under the ISA - which was surprising as Chia was considered to be more potent a threat than the members of the Social Wing of the Singapore Catholic Church - who were similarly accused by LKY to be members of an under-ground Communist cell attempting to inflitrate the Catholic Churhc in the same manner as the events in the Philippines and Latin America had developed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">24 years of Chia's life was wasted and released as a pauper, while LKY lived in the comfort of the Istana, consolidated his own political position and passed a legislation for the Million Dollar Wages - that he need as a crutch to prevent corruption amongst his appointees as Ministers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If LKY had given the minimum justice to his political challengers, he would have been as deserving as the amount of justice that he dispenses to his political opponents.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has he not arbitrarily become the accuser, prosecutor and judge of all whom he see as challenging threats to his political fortunes and that of his successors ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do I need to slander LKY, or has the facts of the events that had transpired not true ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will LKY dare to submit himself to an International Court of Justice to redeem himself and the Singapore Judiciary of wrong doings, wrong judgments - all of which goes against the grain of human decency ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">it is in such oppressive circumstance that you have conscientious individuals like CSJ, Gopalan, Francis Seow, Tan Liang Hong, Robert Ho, daring to butt head with LKY - and there are similar individuals that appear in the Communist Soviet Union, China, East Germany, Communist Poland, Communist Czekoslovakia, Communistg Hungary, Communist Georgia, Myanmar and all the other societies and communities that are subjected to oppressive rule.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Their methods maybe disputable, but their goals remain the same - and that is to seek more space for the Citizens, and return to the Citizens the dignity of deciding for themselves their political future - in the same manner as the First World Citizens of Switzerland.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then again, what will a juvenile DeerHunter know, or even attempt to understand when all he sees is through the narrow myopic vision of his telescope ?</span></p>

              <p>This study is an attempt to be objective, but still, written by a Western foreigner.</p>
              <p>Chia TP was a relic of our turbulent past during our infant independence days. The authorities had good reason for his incarceration, which was to protect innocent men, women and children from the volatile and dangerous communists stirring up the population, to turn SEAsia into a communist zone.</p>
              <p>Such people are akin to terrorists of today, who hides amongst us to kill and achieve their political agenda. Thus the need for ISA to clamp down on such persons. In the 60s, the terrorists were communists.</p>
              <p>You had conveniently or suffer from selective amnesia on the things Chia did. The govt will not simply arrest anyone and throw him in jail. You had failed to mentioned:-</p>
              <p>a. He studied and was a lecturer in Nanyang Uni of the 60s, the hotbed of communism activists.</p>
              <p>a. He was a member of the fiery Barisan Sosialis</p>
              <p>b. He was banned permanently from entering Malaysia in the wake of a political speech he delivered to the Perak division of the Labour Party of Malaysia on 24 April 1966</p>
              <p>c. He was convicted for publishing a seditious article in Jul 66</p>
              <p>d. He was arrested for unlawful assembly with 25 others in Jul 66 to protest the Vietnam war.</p>
              <p>e. He declared war on our govt by stepping up street demostrations, protest meetings, and strikes.</p>
              <p>Now in the 21st century, with communism as a lost cause, he can deny everything and blame everyone else for his incarceration. No one needs to fear him anymore, because China now is only paying lip service to idealogy and more concern with giving its citizens a better life through capitalism, thus his final freedom from jail.</p>
              <p>But in the 60s, many civilian lives would have been lost ( had he not been jailed,) and for purpose? Would our lives had been better if he was allowed to destroyed what MM LKY had planned for our People - freedom from hunger, freedom from poverty, freedom from illiteracy, freedom from disease, freedom from discrimination, and so much more?</p>
              <p>Go on, Atobe, twist facts, lie and present half truths to serve your attention whoring dishonest political commentating master. At least 70% of our People are discerning enough to know you and your master's  cunning ways to gain power,  which offers nothing to citizens except perhaps 'glucose water' to solve our hunger. problems. </p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">If there is Rule of Law - why did Belinda Ang tolerated the insulting acts of MM LKY and his bodyguards - when they burst into her Court when PM LHL was being cross-examined mid-way ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why did Belinda Ang not chastised the bodyguard for approaching her bench without even asking for her permission to do so ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has the strong PAP supported the weaker Alternative Politial Parties ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has the strong PAP - with 82 Parliamentary seats - protected the interests of the all the Citizens living in Pasir Ris and Hougang Constituencies, or has the PAP denied them of their basic right to the Neighborhood Improvement Schemes that are funded by Tax Payers' Money ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If it has not been the silent disgust that the Citizens - living in Pasir Ris and Hougang - towards the PAP, emotional outbursts would have been a daily occurance.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The fact that it did not happen is due to the oppressive and all pervasive tentacles of the Ruling Party and its Government machinery in their joint efforts at suppressing all legitimate protests from Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Did Belinda Ang charged MM LKY and his bodyguards for contempt, when she was so quick and liberal in charging CSJ and sister with contempt ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How did the Public Prosecutor so brilliantly intrepreted that the PAP election candidates stanind on Ground Zero position inside the Polling Station - is not within the descrition of the words that "political candidates should not be within 100 meters of a Polling Station" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It surely take leap of imagination to paint black into white - and is simply misleadingly dishonest.</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Was there any evidence produced to support LKY's 24 year claim that Chia Thye Poh had advocated "<em>an</em> <em>armed Communist revolution to overthrow a legitimately elected Governemt of Singapore</em>" ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In all his 24 years of incarceration, n</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">o trial was held, and no evidence was ever produced - but throughout the 24 years of incarceration - Chia said that he was regularly given a tour of Singapore, tempting him with "freedom" to return to Society and participate in Singapore's progress.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">To the credit of Chia Thye Poh he refused this conditional offer of freedom, and continued to demand for an open ttrial with evidence produced.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chia was finally released but no written confession was ever taken from him - in the same manner as the confessions were forced from those arrested as members of an underground Communist Cell in the Catholic Church of Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is this the kind of "Rule of Law" in Singapore ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Singapore Constitution guarantee that everyone is deemed to be innocent until proven guilty, and yet the Police is given wide powers that will arbitrarily confined an accused person without any access to legal advise, and allowed the latitude to force, trick or cajole an accused person to make statements that incriminate the accused - with no recourse of retracting such statements.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you being fickle or simply indecisive of your understanding of ''dirty politics'' even as you attempt to gloriously "teach" someone about politics ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If <em>"politics maybe dirty to you"</em> - are you suggesting that "politics is not dirty" from your own perspective ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">After stating the above - are your retracting from your cynical position, to doubt yourself by taking on a more cautious position by immediately suggesting that -</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>"no matter how dirty - politics - become.......''</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This clearly shows that you are not even clear of your own values, let alone any moral values that will dictate acceptable political principles.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can you handle evidences when you cannot even accept facts ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will LKY dare to subject his charges - that James Gomez is a liar, or CSJ is a cheat, or JBJ is a charlatan - to an independent and politically neutral tribunal that is similar to the International Court of Justices ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely if he is supremely correct, it will be in the interest of Singapore and himself - to obtain a clear and unequivocal clearance that will shut all such claims that he finds offensive ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did LKY spread anarchy or rebellion in his outrageous accusation towards JBJ, Tang Liang Hong, Francis Seow, CSJ, and even Chiam See Tong ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If at all, his derogatory remarks of Chiam's O-Level results led to an overwhelming votes given to Chiam as a outright display to spite LKY's outrageous views towards a loyal and conscientious Singaporean.</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">If you will remind Singaporeans not to forget the race riots - should you not also remind Singaporeans of the causes that led to such riots ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Who were the main political characters and the issues involved that led to these unfortunate incidences ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why will you conveniently remember parts of Singapore History, but will conveniently suffer amnesia to enter a vegetative state of denial to other not so complimentary events ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it not a fact that the political ambitions of a few in Power for the last 50 years have now taken away the political liberties and rights of Singaporeans as clearly worded in the Singapore Constitution ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Evey coin has two sides with different imprints - are you having one that show the same imprints on both sides of the coin ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you attempting to cheat on those who are not aware of your insidious ways ?</span></p>

              <p>Your insults put me off in giving you a decent reply. The only reply i will give you is crawl back into your rubbish bin and mouth your rubbish to the banana peel next to you. Before that, you have yet to reply to:-</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">"If at all, Gopalan was seeking to create a publicity to the high handed manner in which MM LKY treat the Singaopre Judiciary system - as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LKY is famous for using the judiciary as his proxy.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">MM LKY has admitted as much in claiming that "if no one fears me, I feel I am nothing!!"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> It is common knowledge that MM LKY use the judicial process as a political tool to threaten</strong></span> those who are professionals in the Singapore Citizenry - that they will have to endure similar fate as CSJ, if they enter politics on the side of the Alternative Parties"</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">There you go again, lies and half truth to push your bigoted alternative agenda.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Famous for using...? - to you alone or everyone else?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Common knowledge that ....threaten? - common to you alone?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Is MM LKY not a citizen of Singapore and entitled to justice of our courts to clear his name?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Are you depriving him of this right?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Are you claiming anyone can just slander against another freely and get away with it?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">And a more serious charge, are you casting aspersion on the independence of our judiciary? You better have facts to back it up.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Is this what your 'alternative politics' should be - freedom of speech to slander without facts or evidences, such as the despicable Gopalan and you are doing, even before you clowns gain the mandate to rule?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">If you cannot even reply to these simple questions, but to evade them, then please return to your bin. Don't even attempt to talk about rule of law, because the only law you will ever recognise is your own laws you and your whoring master sets or interpretes.</span></p>
