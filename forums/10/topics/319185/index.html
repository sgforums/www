              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore. Judge Belinda Ang's Kangaroo Court</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br><strong>This is Gopalan Nair in Singapore today,
                  May 29, 2008. I have been in Singapore since May 25, 2008, and staying
                  now at Broadway Hotel, Room 708, 195 Serangoon Road, Singapore 218067.</strong><br><br>I
                  am deliberately stating my identity and my present exact location for a
                  definite purpose. On day 2 of the trial in Singapore, day before
                  yesterday, in the Lee Kuan Yew and son verses Dr. Chee Soon Juan case,
                  Lee senior had said in answer to a question by Dr. Chee, that if he,
                  Lee Kuan Yew, knew the identity of bloggers in cyberspace who defamed
                  him (defamation being used of course in the Singaporean sense), he will
                  sue and bankrupt them.<br><br>He had earlier sidestepped the question
                  by saying, that he had difficulty suing critics of his in the Internet
                  because their identities were not usually known. When pressed, he
                  categorically and deliberately stated that he will sue if they made
                  known their identities.<br><br>Well, what you are going to read should
                  be without question defamatory of Mr. Lee and his son, that is in the
                  warped and hare brained Alice in Wonderland meaning of the word
                  "defamation". It will be interesting to see if this Singapore
                  strongman, Lee Kuan Yew and son, who strut around the small island of
                  Singapore bullying everyone who so much as criticized, will sue me now
                  for calling him nothing more than a small time street bully; since now,
                  we have myself Gopalan Nair who has the temerity to identify himself
                  and state his presence with full address in Singapore.<br><br>Mr. Lee
                  Kuan Yew, see here. I am now within the jurisdiction of your courts; I
                  repeat, "the jurisdiction of your courts" because literally they are
                  your courts, willing to commit any crime or injustice you will demand
                  of them.<br><br>During the last 3 days of the court hearing, up till
                  yesterday, in the High Court, before your stooge of a judge, Belinda
                  Ang in Court 4, you and your Prime Minister son conducted yourselves as
                  expected, no better than cowards hiding behind the coat tails of your
                  equally cowardly counsel doubling up as a PAP politician in court; who
                  managed with the full co-operation of the said judge to ensure that you
                  came to court merely for form, refusing to answer almost all questions
                  that went directly to your integrity or rather the lack of it.<br><br>After
                  the end of the 3 days in court, it left no doubt in my mind that you
                  and your son are indeed what international human rights organizations
                  say you are, nothing more than tin pot tyrants who remain in power by
                  abusing the courts to eliminate your political opponents. You are
                  clearly corrupt, as is your government, because paying yourself $3.7
                  million is corruption pure and simple and in the end you have lost all
                  credibility and moral authority to govern Singapore.<br><br>The
                  following transpired during the last 3 days in court. The judge Belinda
                  Ang was throughout prostituting herself during the entire proceedings,
                  by being nothing more than an employee of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew and his son
                  and carrying out their orders. There was murder, the rule of law being
                  the repeated victim.<br><br>The issue in the said court was the
                  determination of the quantum of damages payable by the innocent victim,
                  Dr. Chee Soon Juan who had earlier been found liable by this judge for
                  defamation of character of Mr. Lee and son, where the law was once
                  again abused through the contrivance of a process known as summary
                  proceedings, thereby disallowing Dr. Chee to produce any witnesses or
                  to cross-examine those of Mr. Lee because there were none.<br><br>The
                  said 3 day of hearing before the court was nothing more than a mockery
                  of justice; a charade, a make believe that appeared right out of the
                  pages of Alice in Wonderland with Belinda Ang playing the role of the
                  Queen of Hearts before the trial of the Mouse who stole the Tarts very
                  well indeed. It almost appeared that she was going to dispense with all
                  testimony and come straight to the verdict of guilty so as not to waste
                  her valuable time!<br><br>It would be fair to say, in fact an
                  understatement, that in effect she disallowed Dr. Chee any effective
                  cross examination of either the father Lee Kuan Yew or the son, as Mr.
                  Singh, their counsel was almost having a workout like in a gym;
                  standing up to object, and sitting down after almost each and every
                  question that Dr. Chee put to his father and son clients. In fact Singh
                  was popping up and down almost without let up during the several hours
                  of the hearing so much so, that someone suggested to me that it would
                  have been a good idea if he remained standing throughout the case to
                  facilitate his expected objections at each and every question of Dr.
                  Chee.<br><br>If Dr. Chee did manage to ask even one question, it was
                  because he went ahead and asked it despite the objection of both Mr.
                  Singh and the judge because if he did not, he would not have been able
                  to ask any questions at all!<br><br>Dr. Chee has asked Lee's son how
                  much he was being paid, that is $3.7 million, 6 times what George Bush
                  is paid! <strong>Question disallowed</strong> and the son shamefully just sits there,
                  protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br><br>Chee
                  asks whether it is just for him to corruptly steal this amount of
                  taxpayer's money while the poor in the 1 room flats starve without any
                  financial assistance! <strong>Question disallowed</strong> and the son shamefully just
                  sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br><br>Chee
                  asks why the GIC and HDB function under a shroud of secrecy without any
                  transparency, when the moneys in them is taxpayers money?<strong> Question
                  disallowed </strong>and the son shamefully just sits there, protected by his
                  counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br><br>Chee asks whether he
                  knew that those who read the Internet overwhelmingly hated him as a
                  tyrant and a bully and the only ones singing praises in his name are
                  the Singapore state owned and controlled media? <strong>Question disallowed </strong>and
                  the son shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh
                  and the kangaroo judge.<br><br>Chee asks whether the international
                  community looks at him no better than a despot and a father's son?
                  <strong>Question disallowed </strong>and the son shamefully just sits there, protected
                  by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br><br>Chee had asked
                  this Lee Kuan Yew's son why he said in the 2006 elections that " if
                  there were more opposition candidates at elections, he will have to
                  "fix" them and bribe his voters to win elections"? <strong>Question disallowed </strong>and the son shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr.
                  Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br><br>There were many more questions put
                  to him just as the above questions, all very relevant, which, had they
                  been answered, would have shown that he had no integrity or reputation
                  whatsoever, and since integrity and reputation are the issues in
                  deciding quantum of damages, Lee Kuan Yew's son should have been
                  awarded no damages at all; that is provided we have an independent
                  judiciary, which we have not.<br><br>Any honest spectator in the
                  court's gallery would have come away with one opinion alone, that is,
                  this man is Prime Minister only because he happens to be the son of his
                  father. If he really wanted to show that he was in fact in control, he
                  could have easily told his lawyer to stop being the Jack in the Box and
                  stop popping up and down with his objections and let him handle the
                  questions. At each question, he was looking meekly at his counsel to
                  see whether he has to answer it. If I could put it in a simple way, he
                  was nothing more than a helpless boy.<br><br>The following refer to Lee Kuan Yew's testimony or rather the lack of it.<br><br>Chee
                  asked him whether he came to power through unfair means in 1959, as
                  shown by declassified British Colonial Office documents in London?
                  <strong>Question disallowed </strong>and the father shamefully just sits there,
                  protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br><br>Chee
                  asks about his throwing Lim Chin Siong, his political compatriot, in
                  jail under the ISA in solitary confinement for several years in the
                  1960s and whether this was a sign of a man with a reputation and
                  integrity? <strong>Question disallowed</strong> and the father shamefully just sits
                  there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br><br>Chee
                  asks about the Operation Cold Store in the 1960s where he jails
                  political opponents because he fears he might be overthrown? <strong>Question
                  disallowed</strong> and the father shamefully just sits there, protected by his
                  counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br><br>Chee asks about Chia
                  Thye Poh, Zaid Zakaharia and Lim Hock Siew, his political opponents
                  whom he imprisons without cause for many many years?<strong> Question
                  disallowed</strong> and the father shamefully just sits there, protected by his
                  counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br><br>Chee asks whether the
                  only people who have a good opinion of him are his state owned and
                  controlled Singapore press, whereas everyone else in Singapore as well
                  as the entire list of respectable foreign organizations and countries
                  including the entire European Union consider him as a thug and small
                  time street bully? <strong>Question disallowed </strong>and the father shamefully just
                  sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br><br>Other
                  than the dubious Transparency International Kula Lumpur Chapter (not to
                  be confused with Transparency International of Berlin Germany) he was
                  asked whether anyone else considered him in high regard other than the
                  local press which he controls? His answer was that PERC and a Swiss
                  organization, both of whom cater for businessmen thought highly of him.
                  But when asked whether highly respected Amnesty International, Human
                  Rights Watch, Lawyers Without Borders, Reporters without Borders, ILRW
                  and several other international bodies considered him a crook; he had
                  nothing to say, because as usual the <strong>Jack Rabbit Davinder Singh stood
                  up once again to object and the judge obediently sustained the
                  objection.</strong><br><br>Then Lee Kuan Yew went on to insult Dr. Chee with
                  impunity, that he is a liar, a cheat a charlatan, a criminal and what
                  not. Of course the judge permitted these insults, since after all Lee
                  Kuan Yew and his son owned the courts and the judge as well.<br><br>These
                  court proceeding were nothing more than a sham, a charade and a mockery
                  of justice. It was very clear that both father and son had no integrity
                  or credibility whatsoever. They were ruling Singapore through fear and
                  those who are able to leave the country leave it in droves, only to be
                  replaced by Mandarin speaking immigrants from the Peoples Republic of
                  China who speak no English at all.<br><br>If there was one result of
                  these proceedings it was this. Dr. Chee' impeccable reputation was
                  vindicated. He came out of these proceedings truly as the statesman
                  that he is, and he demolished these two petty thugs Lee and his son,
                  perhaps not in this Singapore kangaroo court, but truly in the court of
                  truth and conscience.<br><br>And in fact despite the objection of Mr.
                  Singh and Belinda Ang, Dr. Chee Soon Juan did manage to say to both
                  father and son, that regardless of what the court decides, in the court
                  of natural justice, in the court of truth and in the court of moral
                  conscience, they had that day lost all moral authority to govern
                  Singapore.<br><br>I believe, not only me, but every single person who
                  walked away from that courthouse yesterday came away with that same
                  judgment.<br><br>As the Lees know, I am a lawyer practicing in Fremont
                  California and a member of the California Bar. My question to Lee Kuan
                  Yew and his son is this. Are you going to stand by your threat and sue
                  me for defamation as well? I am presently physically within your
                  jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of your kangaroo courts. Are you
                  going to going to send your process server to me with your writ of
                  summons? Or are you, as expected, all talk and no action, when you meet
                  those not afraid of you, just as how a petty street thug would behave?<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <h3>Singapore. Judge Belinda Ang's Kangaroo Court</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br> <br> <strong>This is Gopalan Nair in Singapore today, May 29, 2008. I
              have been in Singapore since May 25, 2008, and staying now at
              Broadway Hotel, Room 708, 195 Serangoon Road, Singapore
              218067.</strong><br> <br> I am deliberately stating my identity and my present exact location
              for a definite purpose. On day 2 of the trial in Singapore, day
              before yesterday, in the Lee Kuan Yew and son verses Dr. Chee Soon
              Juan case, Lee senior had said in answer to a question by Dr. Chee,
              that if he, Lee Kuan Yew, knew the identity of bloggers in
              cyberspace who defamed him (defamation being used of course in the
              Singaporean sense), he will sue and bankrupt them.<br> <br> He had earlier sidestepped the question by saying, that he had
              difficulty suing critics of his in the Internet because their
              identities were not usually known. When pressed, he categorically
              and deliberately stated that he will sue if they made known their
              identities.<br> <br> Well, what you are going to read should be without question
              defamatory of Mr. Lee and his son, that is in the warped and hare
              brained Alice in Wonderland meaning of the word "defamation". It
              will be interesting to see if this Singapore strongman, Lee Kuan
              Yew and son, who strut around the small island of Singapore
              bullying everyone who so much as criticized, will sue me now for
              calling him nothing more than a small time street bully; since now,
              we have myself Gopalan Nair who has the temerity to identify
              himself and state his presence with full address in
              Singapore.<br> <br> Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, see here. I am now within the jurisdiction of
              your courts; I repeat, "the jurisdiction of your courts" because
              literally they are your courts, willing to commit any crime or
              injustice you will demand of them.<br> <br> During the last 3 days of the court hearing, up till yesterday, in
              the High Court, before your stooge of a judge, Belinda Ang in Court
              4, you and your Prime Minister son conducted yourselves as
              expected, no better than cowards hiding behind the coat tails of
              your equally cowardly counsel doubling up as a PAP politician in
              court; who managed with the full co-operation of the said judge to
              ensure that you came to court merely for form, refusing to answer
              almost all questions that went directly to your integrity or rather
              the lack of it.<br> <br> After the end of the 3 days in court, it left no doubt in my mind
              that you and your son are indeed what international human rights
              organizations say you are, nothing more than tin pot tyrants who
              remain in power by abusing the courts to eliminate your political
              opponents. You are clearly corrupt, as is your government, because
              paying yourself $3.7 million is corruption pure and simple and in
              the end you have lost all credibility and moral authority to govern
              Singapore.<br> <br> The following transpired during the last 3 days in court. The judge
              Belinda Ang was throughout prostituting herself during the entire
              proceedings, by being nothing more than an employee of Mr. Lee Kuan
              Yew and his son and carrying out their orders. There was murder,
              the rule of law being the repeated victim.<br> <br> The issue in the said court was the determination of the quantum of
              damages payable by the innocent victim, Dr. Chee Soon Juan who had
              earlier been found liable by this judge for defamation of character
              of Mr. Lee and son, where the law was once again abused through the
              contrivance of a process known as summary proceedings, thereby
              disallowing Dr. Chee to produce any witnesses or to cross-examine
              those of Mr. Lee because there were none.<br> <br> The said 3 day of hearing before the court was nothing more than a
              mockery of justice; a charade, a make believe that appeared right
              out of the pages of Alice in Wonderland with Belinda Ang playing
              the role of the Queen of Hearts before the trial of the Mouse who
              stole the Tarts very well indeed. It almost appeared that she was
              going to dispense with all testimony and come straight to the
              verdict of guilty so as not to waste her valuable time!<br> <br> It would be fair to say, in fact an understatement, that in effect
              she disallowed Dr. Chee any effective cross examination of either
              the father Lee Kuan Yew or the son, as Mr. Singh, their counsel was
              almost having a workout like in a gym; standing up to object, and
              sitting down after almost each and every question that Dr. Chee put
              to his father and son clients. In fact Singh was popping up and
              down almost without let up during the several hours of the hearing
              so much so, that someone suggested to me that it would have been a
              good idea if he remained standing throughout the case to facilitate
              his expected objections at each and every question of Dr.
              Chee.<br> <br> If Dr. Chee did manage to ask even one question, it was because he
              went ahead and asked it despite the objection of both Mr. Singh and
              the judge because if he did not, he would not have been able to ask
              any questions at all!<br> <br> Dr. Chee has asked Lee's son how much he was being paid, that is
              $3.7 million, 6 times what George Bush is paid! <strong>Question
              disallowed</strong> and the son shamefully just sits there,
              protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br> <br> Chee asks whether it is just for him to corruptly steal this amount
              of taxpayer's money while the poor in the 1 room flats starve
              without any financial assistance! <strong>Question
              disallowed</strong> and the son shamefully just sits there,
              protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br> <br> Chee asks why the GIC and HDB function under a shroud of secrecy
              without any transparency, when the moneys in them is taxpayers
              money? <strong>Question disallowed</strong> and the son shamefully
              just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the
              kangaroo judge.<br> <br> Chee asks whether he knew that those who read the Internet
              overwhelmingly hated him as a tyrant and a bully and the only ones
              singing praises in his name are the Singapore state owned and
              controlled media? <strong>Question disallowed</strong> and the son
              shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and
              the kangaroo judge.<br> <br> Chee asks whether the international community looks at him no
              better than a despot and a father's son? <strong>Question
              disallowed</strong> and the son shamefully just sits there,
              protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br> <br> Chee had asked this Lee Kuan Yew's son why he said in the 2006
              elections that " if there were more opposition candidates at
              elections, he will have to "fix" them and bribe his voters to win
              elections"? <strong>Question disallowed</strong> and the son
              shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and
              the kangaroo judge.<br> <br> There were many more questions put to him just as the above
              questions, all very relevant, which, had they been answered, would
              have shown that he had no integrity or reputation whatsoever, and
              since integrity and reputation are the issues in deciding quantum
              of damages, Lee Kuan Yew's son should have been awarded no damages
              at all; that is provided we have an independent judiciary, which we
              have not.<br> <br> Any honest spectator in the court's gallery would have come away
              with one opinion alone, that is, this man is Prime Minister only
              because he happens to be the son of his father. If he really wanted
              to show that he was in fact in control, he could have easily told
              his lawyer to stop being the Jack in the Box and stop popping up
              and down with his objections and let him handle the questions. At
              each question, he was looking meekly at his counsel to see whether
              he has to answer it. If I could put it in a simple way, he was
              nothing more than a helpless boy.<br> <br> The following refer to Lee Kuan Yew's testimony or rather the lack
              of it.<br> <br> Chee asked him whether he came to power through unfair means in
              1959, as shown by declassified British Colonial Office documents in
              London? <strong>Question disallowed</strong> and the father
              shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and
              the kangaroo judge.<br> <br> Chee asks about his throwing Lim Chin Siong, his political
              compatriot, in jail under the ISA in solitary confinement for
              several years in the 1960s and whether this was a sign of a man
              with a reputation and integrity? <strong>Question
              disallowed</strong> and the father shamefully just sits there,
              protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br> <br> Chee asks about the Operation Cold Store in the 1960s where he
              jails political opponents because he fears he might be overthrown?
              <strong>Question disallowed</strong> and the father shamefully just
              sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo
              judge.<br> <br> Chee asks about Chia Thye Poh, Zaid Zakaharia and Lim Hock Siew,
              his political opponents whom he imprisons without cause for many
              many years? <strong>Question disallowed</strong> and the father
              shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and
              the kangaroo judge.<br> <br> Chee asks whether the only people who have a good opinion of him
              are his state owned and controlled Singapore press, whereas
              everyone else in Singapore as well as the entire list of
              respectable foreign organizations and countries including the
              entire European Union consider him as a thug and small time street
              bully? <strong>Question disallowed</strong> and the father
              shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and
              the kangaroo judge.<br> <br> Other than the dubious Transparency International Kula Lumpur
              Chapter (not to be confused with Transparency International of
              Berlin Germany) he was asked whether anyone else considered him in
              high regard other than the local press which he controls? His
              answer was that PERC and a Swiss organization, both of whom cater
              for businessmen thought highly of him. But when asked whether
              highly respected Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Lawyers
              Without Borders, Reporters without Borders, ILRW and several other
              international bodies considered him a crook; he had nothing to say,
              because as usual the <strong>Jack Rabbit Davinder Singh stood up
              once again to object and the judge obediently sustained the
              objection.</strong><br> <br> Then Lee Kuan Yew went on to insult Dr. Chee with impunity, that he
              is a liar, a cheat a charlatan, a criminal and what not. Of course
              the judge permitted these insults, since after all Lee Kuan Yew and
              his son owned the courts and the judge as well.<br> <br> These court proceeding were nothing more than a sham, a charade and
              a mockery of justice. It was very clear that both father and son
              had no integrity or credibility whatsoever. They were ruling
              Singapore through fear and those who are able to leave the country
              leave it in droves, only to be replaced by Mandarin speaking
              immigrants from the Peoples Republic of China who speak no English
              at all.<br> <br> If there was one result of these proceedings it was this. Dr. Chee'
              impeccable reputation was vindicated. He came out of these
              proceedings truly as the statesman that he is, and he demolished
              these two petty thugs Lee and his son, perhaps not in this
              Singapore kangaroo court, but truly in the court of truth and
              conscience.<br> <br> And in fact despite the objection of Mr. Singh and Belinda Ang, Dr.
              Chee Soon Juan did manage to say to both father and son, that
              regardless of what the court decides, in the court of natural
              justice, in the court of truth and in the court of moral
              conscience, they had that day lost all moral authority to govern
              Singapore.<br> <br> I believe, not only me, but every single person who walked away
              from that courthouse yesterday came away with that same
              judgment.<br> <br> As the Lees know, I am a lawyer practicing in Fremont California
              and a member of the California Bar. My question to Lee Kuan Yew and
              his son is this. Are you going to stand by your threat and sue me
              for defamation as well? I am presently physically within your
              jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of your kangaroo courts. Are you
              going to going to send your process server to me with your writ of
              summons? Or are you, as expected, all talk and no action, when you
              meet those not afraid of you, just as how a petty street thug would
              behave?<br> <br> Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>This american citizen thinks too highly of himself. Is he worth our court's and ministers' time? If every foreigner comes to our shore and complain, then where got time to for ministers to run the country?</p>
              <p>He call himself a liar, oops, lawyer and shamelessly without guilt claims our ministers dare not answer questions posed! What was that trial all about, in the first place? It was about allegations of fraud by our ministers, that they both kept funds meant for the public for themselves just like Durai in NKF. And did CSJ prove anything? Why should the ministers be asked questions not related to the case of assumed fraud or even answer them? This liar, oops lawyer, brings shame to the american bar. Are all american lawyers like them, blind and biased?<br>Let him talk all the crap he wants. If he talks too loudly and offend some of our not so cool brothers in public, then good luck to him.</p>
