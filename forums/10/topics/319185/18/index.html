              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">27 days in Singapore. A prisoner in the island.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>I
              have now been 27 days in Singapore. I am an American citizen. I had
              come to Singapore to witness the case of assessment of damages in the
              High Court from May 26, 2008 to May 28, 2008, for 3 days, in the case
              of Lee Kuan Yew vs Dr. Chee Soon Juan. I intended to stay in Singapore
              no longer than June 3, 2008, which would have made my stay no more than
              9 days. I had written a blog post on May 29, 2008, criticizing the
              conduct of the judge in this case.<br><br>For doing nothing more than
              writing a blog critical of a judge, I was arrested by 5 policemen at my
              hotel; manhandled; handcuffed; my hotel room ransacked before my very
              eyes, all my personal belongings seized; driven in a police car in
              handcuffs to Cantonment Police Station and kept 5 days in solitary
              confinement with the cell lights on 24 hours a day and interrogated
              each day; sometimes several times a day; and accused of all manner of
              wrong doing and treated like a common criminal, spending any time
              outside my cell in handcuffs.<br><br>I was released on bail, from
              solitary confinement on June 5, 2008; after 5 days. Not satisfied with
              having taken numerous statements from me while under custody; not
              satisfied with countless interrogation sessions; the court ordered me
              to continue to attend at the police station for even more interrogation
              sessions, which I did.<br><br>Suddenly on Monday June 16, 2008, not
              satisfied with the numerous statements already taken, from the never
              ending interrogation sessions; the court ordered me to attend the
              police station every day at 9 am in the morning until July 14, 2008
              because, believe it nor not, the police have still not completed their
              investigations and according to the prosecutor, I had not been
              cooperating with the police in turning up for these interrogation
              sessions!<br><br>And while these never ending interrogation sessions
              continue, I, an American citizen, after having spent 5 days in solitary
              confinement, continue to be held against my will in Singapore now for
              27 days; with my passport seized; while my law practice in California
              and my financial situation continues to suffer due to neglect.<br><br>And
              all this punishment for what? All for writing a blog post on my blog
              criticizing a judge in her conduct of the Lee Kuan Yew vs Dr. Chee Soon
              Juan case! Even by any third world country's standards, surely I have
              been punished enough! Surely any man with even the slightest of
              compassion; with the slightest of of humanity, would feel that enough
              is enough. Surely it is time to let me go.<br><br>The fact remains that
              all I did was to write a blog post. I have not killed anyone; I have
              not committed theft or armed robbery or high treason. All I did was to
              write. And for writing, will Singapore, this so called first world
              country, this country that claims to have the best legal system in the
              world, the best train system in the world, the best newspapers in the
              world, the best sea port in the world, the best airport in the world,
              the best airline in the world, the highest paid ministers in the world,
              the best of everything in the world; will they not be satisfied with
              the punishment I have suffered so far? What more do they want, my blood?<br><br>And
              what is the purpose of all this punishment? Is it to make sure that I
              am ruined financially? If so, they may have already achieved their
              purpose. Is it to make sure that I will never exercise my right to free
              speech again? Surely this is not possible. Unless they kill me, I will
              be able to return to the United States sometime or other. And once I am
              free, I will continue to exercise my right to free speech and
              expression; and if that is the case, what is the point of all this
              punishment? <br><br>And if the the point of all this punishment is to
              deter Singaporeans from ever criticizing Singapore judges, surely in
              this day and age, with an educated population, that result is highly
              unlikely. In fact the opposite may be true. The people might become
              instead, outraged, defiant and emboldened to speak their mind even more.<br><br>And
              while the Singapore government, intolerant of dissent, jail me in
              solitary confinement and hold me back in Singapore against my will and
              unable to return to my home in California; the free world watches the
              actions of this so called first world country. And they begin to see
              what this first world country really is. A country that rules by
              instilling fear among its citizens, threatening them with solitary
              confinement for extended periods if they ever dare to to criticize a
              judge.<br><br>This much must be told to this government. In order for
              the judiciary to function properly; in order for ministers to function
              properly; in order for policemen to function properly; in order for the
              government to function properly; what is needed is criticism. Criticism
              makes these government officials accountable. Without criticism, there
              is no check on people in authority and when there are no checks,
              judges, policemen, civil servants and ministers are liable to abuse it.
              If you want good government, you have to have criticism. Without it you
              have dictatorship and tyranny.<br><br>And by the way, this government
              has to be reminded that it is the tax payer that is paying their wages.
              And judges too have to be reminded that their wages too are paid by the
              Singaporean taxpayer. This makes them accountable for their actions and
              accountable to the people of Singapore.<br><br>I would say this to the
              Singapore administration. If you want to be taken seriously on your
              claim that you are a first world country, then act like one. First
              world countries do not go around throwing bloggers in solitary
              confinement and preventing them returning to their homes. These are not
              the actions of a first world country. More the actions of dictatorships
              like North Korea.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br>Singapore</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Is Warrant of Arrest without Bail a telling sign of Sedition Act?</strong></span></p>
              <p>I suspect when the Police arrested GPN,Sedition Act was alreday</p>
              <p>in the agenda.</p>
              <p>GPN posted 2 blogs in SG,one on 29 May</p>
              <p>and another on May 31, 2008 at 10.40am Singapore time.</p>
              <p>Police arrested him on 31 May Sat 9.30pm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First,how long can the Police detain one without Warrant of Arrest?</p>
              <p>It would be only 36 hours if Police intended charge him in court</p>
              <p>on Monday morning.</p>
              <p>So,is it absolutely a must to get a Warrant,on Saturday?</p>
              <p>Can the police detain him not more than 48 hours without Warrant ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now we look at the Sedition Act.</p>
              <p>There is a section of of time bar of prosecuting offences committing</p>
              <p>more than 6 months,</p>
              <blockquote><em><strong>''Legal proceedings.</strong><br> <strong>5.</strong> —(1)
              No
              prosecution for an offence under section 4 shall be begun except
              within 6 months after the offence is committed:
              Provided that for the purposes of this
              subsection a <span style="color: #ff0000;">prosecution shall be deemed to be begun against any
              person when</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">a warrant or summons has been issued in respect of any
              charge</span> made against that person and based on the facts or incident
              in respect of which the prosecution afterwards proceeds.''</em></blockquote>
              <p><em> <span style="color: #ff0000;">''prosecution shall be deemed to be begun against any
              person when</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">a warrant or summons has been issued in respect of any
              charge''</span></em></p>
              <p>this is the reason.</p>
              <p><strong>I assume the date of Warrant is 31 May 2008.</strong></p>
              <p>So,AG can prosecute him for offences committed up</p>
              <p>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">30 Nov 2007</span>,including those blogs sent in USA.</p>
              <p>Read his colorful Dec 2007 blogs then u know</p>
              <p>why the Warrant needed to have been issued on Saturday.</p>

              <blockquote>Secondly simply because I write from California does not mean I am
                                      entirely safe. As you know the Russian recently who had criticized
                                      <span>Yeltzin</span> from London had been murdered in
                                      London by poisoning. In 1979, while I was in London, the Bulgarian
                                      correspondent at the BBC English language section was <span>murdered</span> while crossing London Bridge by someone who
                                      stuck an umbrella into him, tipped with poison. Well Lee
                                      <span>Kuan</span> Yew may one day decide enough is enough
                                      and <span>finish</span> me off in California. Furthermore,
                                      I come to <span>Singapore</span> almost twice a year
                                      travelling on an American passport. They could stop me in
                                      <span>Changi</span>,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> arrest me and do whatever they want.
                                      These are dangers that I face by criticizing Lee <span>Kuan</span> Yew. But none of this scares</span> me. There is a
                                      <span>saying</span> in <span>Gurkhali</span> which goes like this "A brave man dies only once. A coward dies
                                      many times over".<br> <br> I believe my blog is doing a tremendous <span>amount</span> of good. <span style="color: #ff0000;">For one thing, the <span>educated</span></span> who have been reading my blog has resulted in
                                      increased rates of emigration among them, particularly to
                                      Australia. They can see that <span>Singapore</span> is
                                      nothing more than a tiny island with a dictator and his son
                                      <span>strutting</span> around as if they own the
                                      <span>place</span>. This is not the first world country
                                      they want to live in, so they leave. My blog helps them in their
                                      decision to leave. My blog has been instrumental for the increase
                                      in brain drain. This is hurting the Lee Regime. There is not enough
                                      people to run the place.<br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><br> My readership of my blog has increased in <span>monumental</span> numbers thereby spreading the message that the
                                      Lee Administration is bad for <span>Singapore</span>.</span> The
                                      government is aware of the danger of such mass dissemination of
                                      critical information. As you know in the past, as soon as any
                                      person wrote anything critical, the government pounced on them with
                                      full force with defamation action, criminal charges, the works. The
                                      reason is quite obvious. Just one piece of critical writing against
                                      the government can result in serious damage to the government, as
                                      news tends to spread like wild fire. But now <span>the</span> tables have turned. Lee <span>Kuan</span> Yew has not sued me. He cannot because he knows he will lose. The
                                      truth is on my side, not his.</blockquote>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">My 29th day in Singapore. Lee: If you defame me, I will sue you!</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>During the 3 day assessment of damages
              hearing in the High Court, Judge Belinda Ang presiding, in the Lee Kuan
              Yew vs Dr. Chee Soon Juan matter, Dr. Chee asks Lee Kuan Yew why did he
              say in his Affidavit that he (Dr. Chee) "hates" Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>Then
              Dr. Chee tells Lee that truly, he does not hate him at all. He (Dr.
              Chee) in fact feels very sorry for him. Dr. Chee tells him that he (Lee
              Kuan Yew) cuts a pathetic figure. And that Dr. Chee is really sorry for
              him.<br><br>Dr. Chee is absolutely spot on here. We should indeed fell
              sorry for the poor old man. You see, since 1959, Lee has been holding
              on to power. During this time, he has built an infrastructure and
              brought some modernity to the island. He feels he has done well. He
              says he has the support of the people and the people respect him.
              Nothing can be further from the truth. His actions betray his weakness.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Only a weak ruler will resort to violence, brutality and resort to the
              courts to cripple his opponents. A strong ruler who has the support of
              the people need not stoop so low. </span>Someone who wrote to me compared him
              to Mugabe. He says they are not too dissimilar. Mugabe uses guns to
              stay in power. Lee uses the courts. The diagnosis is the same. Both are
              weak men who can only remain in power by intimidation, torture,
              bankruptcy and subjugation. Powerful men need not resort to this.<br><br>Look
              at Lee's record. Singapore is already in the Guinness Book not only for
              the largest number of defamation actions brought on by a ruler of a
              country, but also for its staggering amounts; no less that one half
              million dollars each time. Does Lee ever believe that Dr. Chee can pay
              any of this? Of course not. The whole idea is not the money. It is to
              ensure that Dr. Chee can never stand of elections again. What a
              shameful man Lee Kuan Yew is. He ensures Dr. Chee Soon Juan can never
              oppose him in elections. To achieve that shameful objective, he uses
              the courts to finish him off. The same with JB Jeyaretnam. Till today I
              cannot understand why Jeyaretnam decided to pay the totally illegal
              damages. Yes, illegal is a strong word but apt nevertheless. In all the
              series of court cases against JB Jeyaretnam, not even once did JB
              Jeyaretnam ever defame Lee Kuan Yew, that is of course if you use the
              normal definition of the word "defame" and not the totally Alice in
              Wonderland meaning given to it by Singapore.<br><br>Take my case. I did
              say in my blog that since Lee Kuan Yew had said, in no uncertain terms,
              during the 3-day damages hearing recently in the High Court, that if
              anyone defamed him in a blog, and if they were identified, he will sue
              them; I had therefore challenged him to sue me as he had threatened.
              Instead of suing me, he goes on to order his police to arrest me on
              some dubious charge that I insulted a judge in my blog. Is this a sign
              of a man in control of himself or that of a man who is so unsure of
              himself that he has to resort to bullying each time someone challenges
              him? And mind you, I am so far a thoroughly insignificant soul compared
              to the others he has gone after previously, such as Dow Jones, Far
              Eastern Economic Review, Asian Wall Street, JB Jeyaretnam and Dr. Chee.
              All these people are giants compared to me in the scope of things. Why
              then pick on me?<br><br>The answer cannot be clearer than it ever was.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Lee can only remain in power through instilling fear in his citizenry.
              And one way to do it is to go after anyone who criticizes, hoping that
              that others would be sufficiently scared off by news of what has
              happened to me.</span><br><br>But my answer to Lee is this. It is not going to
              work. You have done this once too often. And Singapore's young are
              bolder than what you think. This action against me is already turning
              out to be counter productive. Just after my case, I have heard that
              even more are packing off for Australia and elsewhere. This is
              something that Lee cannot stop. His mistake was making English the
              lingua franca. With English Singaporeans can leave anytime and be
              accepted around the English speaking world. The Chinese imports from
              mainland China is not a replacement. They neither have English nor the
              capability.<br><br>Second, more and more young people are swelling the
              ranks of the SDP. They are coming forward. Instead of being
              intimidated, they are turning out to be lions. Not just any lion but
              African lions. The really brave type.<br><br>I understand that Lee Kuan
              Yew has been traveling to places such as Sydney with hat in hand,
              begging Singaporeans to come back. They are not coming back. And one
              more reason for them not to come back is the case Singapore Public
              Prosecutor vs. Gopalan Nair for writing a blog!<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br>Singapore</p>

              lives had been endangered by his leadership of the secretive Defence
              Intelligence Organisation.</strong></p>
              <p>Under the terms of an
              ACT Supreme Court judgment, senior defence bureaucrat and former DIO
              chief Frank Lewincamp has won damages and an apology from Martin Toohey
              over claims that the DIO had been dangerously "politicised" under Mr
              Lewincamp and that he should have been sacked.</p>
              <p>The defamation case was sparked by an article in the nowdefunct Bulletin magazine in2004.</p>
              <p>The article was based on leaks of an internal defence review, conducted in 2003 by Mr Toohey.</p>
              <p>Mr Toohey, a barrister and naval reserve captain, had reviewed a
              grievance case brought by a former army intelligence expert, Lieutenant
              Colonel Lance Collins, who had alleged there was a "pro-Jakarta lobby
              in theDIO", that intelligence hadbeen cut to Australian forces in East
              Timor and that he had been sidelined after raising his concerns.</p>
              <p>Mr Lewincamp, currently head of Defence's governance division,
              brought the defamation action not in relation to Mr Toohey's review but
              in relation to the publiccomments he made in the Bulletin article.</p>

              <blockquote>Former Singaporean lawyer Gopalan Nair, accused of insulting two High Court judges here, will get his day in court in September.
              <p>At a pre-trial conference in the High Court on Tuesday, Magistrate
                  Denise Wong set aside two weeks - Sept 8 to 19 - for the trial.</p>
              <p>But with almost two months away before the trial starts,
                  Nair's lawyer Chia Ti Lik said they would be making an application for
                  Nair to return to the US first, where he is now a resident.</p>
              <p>As a condition of his bail, the 58-year-old was required to surrender his passport to the police.</p>
              <p>The two charges carry a possible jail term of up to one year, $5,000 fine, or both, each.</p>
              <p>The first charge relates to a blog post Nair had written,
                  accusing Justice Belinda Ang of 'prostituting herself' to Minister
                  Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p> He made the comments after he returned to Singapore to observe a
                  three-day hearing presided over by Justice Ang to assess damages in a
                  defamation suit that PM Lee and Minister Mentor had won against the
                  Singapore Democratic Party, its secretary-general Chee Soon Juan and
                  his sister Chee Siok Chin.</p>
              <p>The second charge concerns an e-mail he allegedly sent in
                  2006 to Justice Lai Siu Chiu while she was presiding over a contempt of
                  court case, also involving Chee Soon Juan.</p>
              <p>In it, Nair implied that she and the others worked against critics of the PAP. He called Justice Lai and others 'corrupt'.</p>
