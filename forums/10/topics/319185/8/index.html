              <h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
              <p>This e-Brief provides background on the history of sedition as a Commonwealth 
                                      criminal offence. Some examples of past sedition prosecutions are given. 
                                      Proposals for reform in the early 1990s are outlined as well as the controversial 
                                      amendments which were made during 2005. On 2 March 2006, the Attorney-General 
                                      announced a review of sedition laws would be conducted and it is intended 
                                      that this e-brief will be updated as needed.</p>
              <h2>Sedition legislation<a id="offence" name="offence"></a></h2>
              <h3>Colonies and States</h3>
              <p>In colonial times and into the twentieth century, some colonies or States 
                                      contained the offence of seditious activities in their criminal legislation 
                                      eg <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/cc189994/"><em>Criminal 
                                      Code (Qld)</em> ss 44–46, 52</a>; <a href="http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/linkto.w3p;doc_id=69%2B%2B1924%2BAT@EN%2BCURRENT"><em>Criminal 
                                      Code (Tas)</em> ss 66-67</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/cc94/index.html"><em>Criminal 
                                      Code (WA)</em> ss 44–46, 52</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/cca115/">Criminal 
                                      Code (NT) ss 45-46</a>. In those States where criminal offences have been 
                                      codified, these offences still exist today. In the other States, however, 
                                      seditious libel, uttering seditious words, and participation in a seditious 
                                      conspiracy were, and still are, common law offences. The exceptions are 
                                      in South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory, where legislation 
                                      has repealed the common law offence.</p>
              <h3>Commonwealth</h3>
              <p>Laurence Maher (<a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/library/INTGUIDE/LAW/sedition.htm#1992">1992</a>) comments that sedition is primarily 
                                    a peacetime weapon.</p>
              <blockquote> In time of war the Commonwealth Government is amply equipped 
                                      to implement a policy of total mobilisation for the prosecution of the 
                                      war effort. This last occurred in Australia following the outbreak of 
                                      war in Europe in 1939. The basic legal mechanism was the <em>National 
                                      Security Act 1939</em> and the Regulations made under the Act. The Commonwealth 
                                      was able to exercise <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MULR/2003/3.html">extensive 
                                      control</a> over the dissemination of information and opinion by (a) the 
                                      imposition of rigid censorship, (b) the prohibition of certain organisations 
                                      (such as the Communist Party of Australia), whose aims and activities 
                                      were considered by the Government to be inimical to the war effort and 
                                      (c) the internment of alleged subversives. (page 287). </blockquote>

                                      section was also recommended (new section 28(2)). These recommendations 
                                      were set out in chapter 32 and in a draft bill attached as Part VII, but 
                                      lay dormant until 2005.</p>

                                      the removal of the references in paragraphs 24C(a)-(c) to agreeing or

              <h2>The 2005 amendments<a name="2005"></a></h2>
              <p><strong>2005</strong> <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/Act1.nsf/asmade/bytitle/9249AE71DF443FDFCA2570D80024D5A0?OpenDocument">Anti-Terrorism 
                                      Act (No. 2) 2005</a> (no. 144). This repealed most of the existing provisions 
                                      on sedition in the Crimes Act and, in their place, inserted new provisions 
                                      (sections 80.2-80.6) into the <em><a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw/management.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200401867?OpenDocument">Criminal 
                                      Code</a></em>. This was done in accordance with Government policy to put 
                                      major new offences into the <em>Criminal Code Act 1995</em> rather than 
                                      in the Crimes Act. The Code is intended to incorporate old common law 
                                      offences as well as new changes to the criminal law. The new provisions 
                                      expanded the offence to include the behaviour of ‘urging’ 
                                      and the element of recklessness. They commenced on Royal Assent on 28 
                                      December 2005. <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/library/INTGUIDE/LAW/sedition.htm#AppB">Appendix B</a> shows the seditions provisions 
                                      in the <em>Crimes Act</em> immediately before their repeal, while <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/library/INTGUIDE/LAW/sedition.htm#AppC">Appendix 
                                      C</a> shows the current provisions in the Criminal Code<em> </em>and the 
                                      Crimes Act.</p>
              <p>Although the new provisions were similar to those already existing, they 
                                      received much critical comment from a variety of sources. The main criticisms 
                                      fell into the following categories:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Some thought the Government had created a new offence and were unaware 
                                        of the existing provisions, which had been in force since 1920.</li>
              <li>Sedition was an archaic offence and should be repealed, not reinvented.</li>
              <li>Many of the provisions are covered by existing legislation (such as 
                                        those dealing with incitement) or are more appropriate in other legislation 
                                        (eg: vilification should be in human rights legislation).</li>
              <li>The Government could use the new provisions against its political 
                                        enemies.</li>
              <li>The 'good faith' defence has been watered down.</li>
              <li>It is difficult to interpret and apply, especially for non-lawyers. 
                                        For example, s. 80.2 refers to an organisation or country which 'is 
                                        specified by Proclamation ... to be an enemy at war with the Commonwealth'.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>As a result of these comments some amendments were made to the Bill, 
                                      such as clarifying the role of the media when reporting or publishing 
                                      comments. Further comment and analysis are provided in the Key Documents

              <p>When introducing the sedition law amendments on 3 November 2005, the 
                                      Attorney-General <a href="http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/TranslateWIPILink.aspx?Folder=HANSARDR&amp;Criteria=DOC_DATE:2005-11-03%3BSEQ_NUM:53%3B">announced</a> that they would be reviewed by the Government in 2006. After <a href="http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/TranslateWIPILink.aspx?Folder=PRESSREL&amp;Criteria=CITATION_ID:335I6%3B">concerns</a> were raised that the review may not be fully independent and a recommendation 
                                      (no. 28) from the <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/committee/legcon_ctte/terrorism/index.htm">Senate

              <p>The terms of reference for the inquiry were <a href="http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/TranslateWIPILink.aspx?Folder=PRESSREL&amp;Criteria=CITATION_ID:VVWI6%3B">announced</a> on 2 March 2006. The Commission was asked to review the appropriateness 
                                      and effectiveness of the amended sedition legislation and to report by 
                                      30 May 2006.The ALRC chair has written about the inquiry in <a href="http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/print.asp?article=4553">On

                                      changes including removal of the word 'sedition' since it was seen as 
                                      being archaic, but the Commission still supported the offence of urging 
                                      violence against the government and community groups. All documents may

              <h2>Prosecutions for sedition<a name="pros"></a></h2>
              <p>Commonwealth prosecutions for sedition were made mainly against members 
                                      of the Communist Party of Australia (CPA). Some examples were:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Laurence Louis Sharkey</strong>. General Secretary of the 
                                        CPA, who said he would support a Soviet invasion in certain circumstances 
                                        and might use force to allow workers to gain power. Sentenced, after 
                                        appeal, to eighteen months imprisonment and hard labour. See <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/46.html"><em>R 
                                        v Sharkey</em></a> [1949] HCA 46; (1949) 79 CLR 121 (7 October 1949). </li>
              <li><strong>Gilbert Burns</strong>. A CPA Member who publicly said that 
                                        if there was war with the Soviet Union he would support the USSR. Sentenced 
                                        to six months imprisonment. See <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/45.html"><em>Burns

              <li><strong>William Fardon Burns</strong>. The last successful prosecution 
                                        for sedition under the Crimes Act appears to be that of William Fardon 
                                        Burns, who was sentenced to six months jail in 1951 for writing seditious 
                                        articles. (<em>Sweeny v Burns</em>, unreported, NSW Court of Petty Sessions, 
                                        1950)</li>
              <li><strong>Chandler, Ogston and Bone</strong>. The last unsuccessful 
                                        prosecutions under the Crimes Act, reported by Laurence Maher (1992, 
                                        p. 288), were the cases of Herbert Bovyll Chandler, Adam Ogston and 
                                        James Bone for publishing a seditious article about the monarchy in 
                                        the June 1953 issue of the <em>Communist Review</em>. The magistrate

              <li> <strong>Brian Cooper</strong>. After the W.F. Burns case, there appear 
                                        to be no more successful prosecutions under the Crimes Act. However, 
                                        the last federal prosecution and jailing for sedition was in 1960, when 
                                        Department of Native Affairs officer Brian Cooper was prosecuted for 
                                        urging 'the natives' of Papua New Guinea to demand independence from 
                                        Australia. He was charged under the <em>Criminal Code</em> (Qld) which 
                                        at the time extended to Papua New Guinea. He was convicted and sentenced 
                                        to two months imprisonment with hard labour. He committed suicide four 
                                        years after losing his appeal to the High Court (<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1961/16.html"><em>Cooper

              <p>There were no Commonwealth prosecutions for sedition during the Vietnam 
                                      War era even though one commentator reports that seditious activity occurred 
                                      (Douglas, <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/library/INTGUIDE/LAW/sedition.htm#2004">2004</a>, p. 248).</p>
              <p>In 2006, police ruled that books promoting suicide bombings and anti-Australian 
                                      conspiracies can be sold in the Muslim community because they don't breach

              <h2>Overseas sedition laws<a name="overseas"></a></h2>
              <p>It appears that many countries have such an offence, mainly in legislation 
                                      but occasionally only at common law. In most democracies, sedition laws 
                                      are rarely used, but in other countries they continue to be used to suppress 
                                      the media and there have been several recent incidents of prosecutions.<br> The following legislation has been found, mainly from English speaking 
                                      countries, with Internet links to the text, where available.</p>

              <p>I think you guys who have been yakking about how Gopalan's nationality just missed the point. The whole focus of this episode is to expose how unfair this court has been to True opposition parties liked Chee, how the Lees' has performed, or, underperformed, face to face with Chee, how a judge, the irony of it all, is obviously unjust and how Nair, through his bold words and actions throw the entire event into media light.</p>
              <p>Obviously among the forums, there are the PAP Internet brigade, now doing their smear campaign, using Chee, (at least he is still in Singapore though I still think he is a mad dog) against Nair. And unfortunately there are some who truly believe these distorted facts.</p>
              <p>I thank Nair to have put the entire exchange between Chee and Lee onto his blog which otherwise will never be know to Singaporean. If they rely on our national newspapers... Check out the headlines then.. the focus was on the rude comments Lee and Chee exchanged.. PLEASE.. the real juicy details are not put down for all to read..</p>
              <p>Henceforth, for those reading this, please use your own judgement and evaluate the truth.</p>

              <p>A sock puppet is an <em>additional</em> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?OnlineIdentity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">OnlineIdentity</span></a> used by someone who already has another <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?OnlineIdentity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">OnlineIdentity</span></a> for participating in a given community, particularly when done in a non-transparent manner and where the identities interact with each other in some way. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The term originates with the metaphor of carrying on a conversation with oneself using a puppet in each hand.</span></strong></p>

We do not expect to discover that the guy who runs the coffee shop is also our neighbour, but with a fake mustache and beard. In most communities there is at least a social expectation, and sometimes a site policy, that each person will use only a single identity. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Thus, use of sock puppets is a</strong></span> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?DeceptivePractice"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DeceptivePractice</strong></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>
              <p>A <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?PenName"><span style="color: #0066cc;">PenName</span></a> (or anonymous posting) is about discretionary exposure of personally identifying information, and doesn't exclude the possibility of participating with a measure of integrity since discretion and deception are not at all the same thing. It is fair to expect that we all exercise a certain measure of discretion, but it is hoped that we do not engage in intentional deception. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A</strong></span> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?SockPuppet"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SockPuppet</strong></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>, on the other hand, is dishonestly represented as being a unique individual, distinct from the existing identities already in use in the community.</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
              <p>By using several Sock Puppets all posting in favour of an idea, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a dishonest person can give the impression that the idea has more grass-roots support than it really has.</strong></span> See also <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?StuffingTheBallotBox"><span style="color: #0066cc;">StuffingTheBallotBox</span></a>, which is a similar problem in a more formal, voting context. Sock puppets make it harder to enforce "one man, one vote."</p>
              <p>Sock puppet identities are disruptive in conversation because they are often used so that a person can <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">ask questions of himself and appear to be carrying on a thread between two individuals.</span></strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Internet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="color: #0066cc;">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>

              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny, frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked. Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>

              <p>A sock puppet is an <em>additional</em> <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?OnlineIdentity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">OnlineIdentity</span></a> used by someone who already has another <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?OnlineIdentity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">OnlineIdentity</span></a> for participating in a given community, particularly when done in a
              non-transparent manner and where the identities interact with each
              other in some way. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The term
              originates with the metaphor of carrying on a conversation with
              oneself using a puppet in each hand.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Deception</h3>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Use of a</strong></span> <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?SockPuppet"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SockPuppet</strong></span></a> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>is typically frowned
              on.</strong></span> The social convention against sock puppets
              arises from the <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?RealWorld"><span style="color: #0066cc;">RealWorld</span></a>. We
              do not expect to discover that the guy who runs the coffee shop is
              also our neighbour, but with a fake mustache and beard. In most
              communities there is at least a social expectation, and sometimes a
              site policy, that each person will use only a single identity.
              <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Thus, use of sock puppets is
              a</strong></span> <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?DeceptivePractice"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DeceptivePractice</strong></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>

              anonymous posting) is about discretionary exposure of personally
              identifying information, and doesn't exclude the possibility of
              participating with a measure of integrity since discretion and
              deception are not at all the same thing. It is fair to expect that
              we all exercise a certain measure of discretion, but it is hoped
              that we do not engage in intentional deception. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A</strong></span> <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?SockPuppet"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SockPuppet</strong></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>,
              on the other hand, is dishonestly represented as being a unique
              individual, distinct from the existing identities already in use in
              the community.</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
              <p>By using several Sock Puppets all posting in favour of an idea,
              <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a dishonest person can give
              the impression that the idea has more grass-roots support than it
              really has.</strong></span> See also <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?StuffingTheBallotBox"><span style="color: #0066cc;">StuffingTheBallotBox</span></a>, which is a
              similar problem in a more formal, voting context. Sock puppets make
              it harder to enforce "one man, one vote."</p>
              <p>Sock puppet identities are disruptive in conversation because
              they are often used so that a person can <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">ask questions of himself and appear to be
              carrying on a thread between two individuals.</span></strong></p>

              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in
              speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people
              the impression that there are others out there that would agree
              with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a
              false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of
              support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being
              hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in
              which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned.
              Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen
              responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never
              posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread
              called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify
              gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and
              phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by
              this "makepeace" was as such:</p>
              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually
              indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we
              can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting
              of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their
              context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos
              and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY
              make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence
              lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20
              minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace.
              Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But
              after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to
              makepeace</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Note the bad acting, where he
              pretended to be "excited" and "surprised" about what he wrote
              himself.</span></p>
              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really
              hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying
              back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny,
              frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from
              the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked.
              Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what
              really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was
              caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>

              <p>Dear forumers,</p>
              <p>If you feel that <strong>lionnoisy </strong>is spamming the forum with nonsense by just cutting and pasting without any discussion.</p>
              <p>Please send an email to <a href="/users/189"><strong>Jason</strong></a> or <a href="/users/998"><strong>FireIce</strong></a> to have him ban.</p>
              <p>I find that him spamming the thread with a dozen of post without any discussions is counter productive to any proper discussion.</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <h1>US blogger released on bail in Singapore</h1>
              <p class="hn-byline"><span class="hn-date">15 hours ago</span></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE (AFP) — A US-based blogger who allegedly accused a
              Singapore judge of "prostituting herself" was released on bail Thursday
              and had his passport confiscated.</p>
              <p>A judge ordered Gopalan Nair, a
              former Singapore lawyer who is now a US citizen, to be released on
              5,000 dollars bail (3,676 US) after more than four days in custody.</p>
              <p>A prosecutor told the court there was no need for him to be detained while further investigations were carried out.</p>
              <p>Nair, 58, who declined comment to reporters, is due back in court for another hearing next Thursday.</p>
              <p>He
              was arrested in the city-state on Saturday and charged Monday with
              insulting a public servant, his lawyer Chia Ti Lik earlier told AFP.</p>
              <p>According
              to a court document, Nair is charged with insulting Justice Belinda Ang
              Saw Ean last week by sending an email which said she "was throughout
              prostituting herself during the entire proceedings, by being nothing
              more than an employee of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his son and carrying out
              their orders".</p>

              MM Lee replied that he did not, even though Western journalists had been urging such a view on him for years.
              <p>'I take a contrary view, because I know the mentality and the
                  attitudes of the people in Singapore - and they know me by now, that if
                  anybody impugns the integrity of the Government, of which I was the
                  prime minister, I must sue,' he said.</p>
              <p>'And I must demand that either the court finds that those defamatory
                  words (are) true, in which case I am demolished, or there's a penalty.'</p>
              <p>When further pressed on the point, MM Lee said that his political
                  credo was that every lie related to the integrity, honour and rectitude
                  of the Government had to be nailed:</p>
              <p>'This Government has lasted through 11 general elections, from 1959
                  to 2006. Nobody has said the elections were rigged, not even the SDP.</p>
              <p>'I have put myself before the public, my Government, on seven of
                  those general elections. I personally led the Government and I know
                  that that was possible only because we run a clean, efficient,
                  effective, competent Government that works to the benefit of the
                  people.'</p>
              <p>For the moment, however, he had no choice but to tolerate attacks on the Government that were posted on the Internet.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'But if anybody puts his name in print or verbally identifies
                  himself out of court with those remarks, is challenging my integrity,
                  (and) is prepared to stand on his credibility, we will need to have it
                  resolved,' he added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">When asked by Mr Ravi if he would pursue those online if the law could capture the culprits, MM Lee said that he would.</span></p>
              <p>From questions of integrity, the cross-examination turned to what MM Lee thought of Dr Chee's character.</p>
              <p>After MM Lee, at one point, described Dr Chee as a 'near
                  psychopath', Mr Ravi asked if he took the SDP chief's comments
                  seriously.</p>

                  believe him. If I did not take him seriously and he keeps on repeating

              <p>As to whether most people would believe what Dr Chee said, MM Lee
                  pointed to the results of the May 2006 General Election, where the SDP
                  won 20 per cent of the valid votes in Sembawang GRC.</p>
              <p>'Obviously, 20 per cent of the people in Sembawang decided that what
                  Mr Chee and his supporters were saying in the campaign, repeatedly,
                  that the Singapore government is run like the National Kidney
                  Foundation, was put to the test.</p>
              <p>'So here's 20 per cent in Sembawang. And that's with vigorous campaigning on the PAP's side,' he said.</p>
              <p>'So you cannot dismiss the effect of such repeated attempts to discredit the reputation of the leaders of the PAP.'</p>

              <p>A sock puppet is an <em>additional</em> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?OnlineIdentity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">OnlineIdentity</span></a> used by someone who already has another <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?OnlineIdentity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">OnlineIdentity</span></a> for participating in a given community, particularly when done in a non-transparent manner and where the identities interact with each other in some way. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The term originates with the metaphor of carrying on a conversation with oneself using a puppet in each hand.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Deception</h3>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Use of a</strong></span> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?SockPuppet"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SockPuppet</strong></span></a> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>is typically frowned on.</strong></span> The social convention against sock puppets arises from the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?RealWorld"><span style="color: #0066cc;">RealWorld</span></a>. We do not expect to discover that the guy who runs the coffee shop is also our neighbour, but with a fake mustache and beard. In most communities there is at least a social expectation, and sometimes a site policy, that each person will use only a single identity. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Thus, use of sock puppets is a</strong></span> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?DeceptivePractice"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DeceptivePractice</strong></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>
              <p>A <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?PenName"><span style="color: #0066cc;">PenName</span></a> (or anonymous posting) is about discretionary exposure of personally identifying information, and doesn't exclude the possibility of participating with a measure of integrity since discretion and deception are not at all the same thing. It is fair to expect that we all exercise a certain measure of discretion, but it is hoped that we do not engage in intentional deception. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A</strong></span> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?SockPuppet"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SockPuppet</strong></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>, on the other hand, is dishonestly represented as being a unique individual, distinct from the existing identities already in use in the community.</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
              <p>By using several Sock Puppets all posting in favour of an idea, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a dishonest person can give the impression that the idea has more grass-roots support than it really has.</strong></span> See also <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?StuffingTheBallotBox"><span style="color: #0066cc;">StuffingTheBallotBox</span></a>, which is a similar problem in a more formal, voting context. Sock puppets make it harder to enforce "one man, one vote."</p>
              <p>Sock puppet identities are disruptive in conversation because they are often used so that a person can <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">ask questions of himself and appear to be carrying on a thread between two individuals.</span></strong></p>

Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sock Puppeting Caught</span></strong></p>
              <p>A senior editor at The New Republic was suspended and his blog was shut down on Friday after revelations that he was involved in anonymously attacking readers who criticized his posts.</p>
              <p>Lee Siegel, creator of the Lee Siegel on Culture blog for <a href="http://tnr.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">tnr.com</span></span></a>, was suspended indefinitely from the magazine after a reader accused him of using a “sock puppet,” or Internet alias, to attack his critics in the comments section of his blog. An editor’s apology replaced the blog on the Web site, announcing that the blog would no longer be published and noting that The New Republic deeply regretted “misleading” its readers.</p>
              <p>Franklin Foer, the New Republic’s editor, said in an interview that he first became aware of the accusations against Mr. Siegel on Thursday afternoon, after a colleague noticed a comment in the Talkback section of Mr. Siegel’s blog that accused him of using the alias “sprezzatura” to defend his articles and assail his critics.</p>
              <p>That comment, posted by a reader named “jhschwartz” on Aug. 27, said that “sprezzatura appears only to weigh in on TNR forums to admonish and taunt posters who dislike Lee Siegel” before concluding, “I would say with 99% confidence that ‘sprezzatura’ is a Siegel alias.”</p>
              <p>“We launched an investigation,” Mr. Foer said. He added that he was confident that sprezzatura’s posts were written with Mr. Siegel’s “full cooperation,” but declined to say whether the alias was used by Mr. Siegel himself because the affair was still under investigation. “As soon as the facts of the case became clear to me on Friday, we closed down the blog and made an announcement.” Mr. Foer said that while he liked to see blog posts before they were published, Mr. Siegel did not have an editor assigned to his blog entries.</p>
              <p>In a statement by e-mail, Mr. Siegel said, “I’m sorry about my prank, which was certainly not designed to harm a magazine that has been my happy intellectual home for many years.”</p>
              <p>Other bloggers noted the disclosure about Mr. Siegel. Ezra Klein, a blogger who had tangled with him, wrote in his blog on Friday, “The temptation to create a new persona and rally support for yourself in comments can be almost overwhelming.” But Mr. Klein said that most bloggers “resist the urge, take the lashing and move on.”</p>
              <p>Mr. Siegel became a polarizing figure, coining the term “blogofascism” in the midst of a debate over The New Republic’s support of Senator <a title="More articles about Joseph I. Lieberman." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/joseph_i_lieberman/index.html?inline=nyt-per"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">Joseph I. Lieberman</span></span></a> in the Connecticut primary.</p>
              <p>The user named sprezzatura, an Italian term for studied carelessness, posted comments that were hyperbolic even in the blogging environment. After readers criticized Mr. Siegel for his post about the host of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart, sprezzatura wrote: “Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.” (A later comment deplored other readers’ “inability to withstand a difference in taste without resorting to personal insult.”)</p>
              <p>Mr. Siegel is not the first mainstream blogger to use an Internet alias or the first to be unmasked. In April, The Los Angeles Times suspended the blog of a reporter, Michael A. Hiltzik, after he admitted using aliases on his own blog and other Web sites. Mr. Foer said that as print publications engage the Internet, it can be difficult to clearly define and apply journalistic principles. “Obviously, this all happened in a newer medium where the rules are more ambiguous,” he said. “But we simply don’t tolerate the misleading of our readers.”</p>

              <blockquote style="font-family: arial;"> From: Pranay Gupte<br>To: Gopalan Nair<br><br>Dear Gopalan:<br><br>Thanks
                      for your note. Let me emphasize at the outset that, as a foreign
                      journalist, it's not my place to interfere in the conduct of domestic
                      policy in Singapore. I am a professional observer, not a player, and
                      it's my job to listen to all points of view and report as truthfully as
                      I can. Whatever my private views as an Indian-born US democrat, these
                      do not affect my journalism.<br><br>That having been said let me address your question as to why I am an admirer of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br><br>I've
                      long been an admirer of Mr. Lee because of the way he set about
                      nation-building. As I see it, three things were emphasized right from
                      the start: the rule of law; developing strong institutions of public
                      governance; and a corruption free society. To this was added a vital
                      element: secularism in what is a multi-racial society.<br><br>My
                      admiration flows from how Mr. Lee stuck to this plan despite
                      overwhelming odds. When Singapore began its nation-building experiment
                      nearly 40 years ago, the fashion in the former colonial territories of
                      the world was to pursue statist socialism. I have covered virtually all
                      of the Third World's 135 countries during my four-decades-long
                      journalistic career, and let me tell you that socialism did not work
                      out. Hence, the sad, sad spectacle of dozens of failed states in
                      Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. Eastern Europe, of
                      course, was sui generis, and its countries are still paying an enormous
                      economic and social price for pursuing communism.<br><br>As I see it,
                      Mr. Lee Kuan Yew's model of economic development and nation-building
                      has worked out. Granted, Singapore's scale is small. But demography and
                      geography have less to do with successful nation-building than skillful
                      leadership in the public interest. Mr. Lee and his associates
                      demonstrated such leadership; other developing countries did not have
                      such visionary leaders.<br><br>I have learned during my lifetime in journalism that societies and nations take time to evolve. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
                      sort of participatory democracy that many Singaporeans yearn for will
                      undoubtedly come. It's bound to be a healthier system because of the
                      foundations that were laid by Mr. Lee.</span><br><br>Thanks again for writing to me.<br><br>With best wishes,<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Pranay</blockquote>

              <p>This gentleman claimed he is liable to SG gavaman and Law Society</p>
              <p>a good S$200k and he just laughed at the two org in the end of 2007.</p>
              <p>i dunt know if these 2 orgs would reopen the outstanding amounts.</p>
              <p>Good luck to him.</p>
              <blockquote>It would appear that the total amount I was required to pay the Law
              Society and the Singapore government would appear to be nearly
              $200,000.00.<br> <br> To date I have not paid a cent. I refuse to pay.
              And by the way, I have been to Singapore several times, the latest
              being this year from Nov 1, 2007 to Nov 13, 2007. They have not taken
              any steps against me to recover their money.<br> <br> I wonder why. Or is the reason why they do not go after me is because I am not afraid of them.<br> <br> Any
              lawyer reading this blog should perhaps ask the Singapore Law Society
              about their loss of this huge sum of money, which I have refused to pay.</blockquote>
