              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Gopalan Nair to report to Central Police Station every day</span></strong></p>
              <p>Former Singaporean lawyer 58 year old Gopalan Nair will have to report
              to the Central Police Division daily at 9am from tomorrow.</p>
              <p>This is to help officers in their investigations into his alleged
              insults against two High Court judges, Justice Lai Siu Chiu and Justice
              Belinda Ang.</p>
              <p>Previously, he only had to report as and when required by the authorities.</p>
              <p>Nair will have to report to the authorities every day until his presence is no longer required.</p>
              <p>That's because the Deputy Public Prosecutor, Francis Ng said, Nair
              had failed to turn up at the division at 3pm last Friday even though he
              was supposed to do so.</p>
              <p>DPP Ng said no explanation was given for Nair's absence.</p>
              <p>However, Nair's lawyer Chia Ti Lik refuted this.</p>
              <p>Mr Chia said, he informed the Investigating Officer that Nair was unable to turn up that day.</p>
              <p>"Due to the short notice, Mr Nair was unable to attend at the
              appointed time that the IO wanted him to. The prosecution took the
              position that they had difficulties contacting him over Thursday,
              Friday and Saturday. And because of that, they applied to court to have
              one of the conditions of bail varied."</p>
              <p>Nair is currently out on a five thousand dollar bail and he also had to surrender his passport to the police.</p>
              <p>The prosecution has also amended one of the two charges faced by Nair.</p>
              <p>Mr Chia said, it now states that Nair had allegedly insulted Justice Ang on his blog.</p>
              <p>"The prosecution seems to be taking the position that there was no
              email being sent to the judge, Belinda Ang as originally alleged in the
              first charge."</p>
              <p>Justice Ang presided over the recent defamation suit that Prime
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kwan Yew won against
              the Singapore Democratic Party and some of its leaders.</p>
              <p>It's believed Nair had stated in his blog that Justice Ang was
              "nothing more than an employee" of PM Lee and the Minister Mentor.</p>
              <p>Nair's other charge alleged that he had sent an insulting email to Justice Lai in 2006.</p>
              <p>It's believed he stated that Justice Lai as well as her fellow
              judges are " corrupt" as they are "misusing the law for personal gain".</p>
              <p>Nair gave up his Singapore citizenship in 2005 and is now a citizen of the United States.</p>
              <p>The case will be mentioned again on 14th July. - 938Live</p>

              <p>This will be beginning of the end of SG if AG look at</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why change the charge</strong></span></p>
              <p>well.i support u guys to query why DPP changes the charge from</p>
              <p>sending e mail to insulting by posting on blog.</p>
              <p>I have one theory.To charge him sending e mails ,and he denys,</p>
              <p>just make a impression that police frame him up.</p>
              <p>To Charge him on blogs make the evidences open</p>
              <p>to public.</p>
              <p>From CEO of MNC and layman in AMK can be the</p>
              <p>Judge whether the 2 blogs sent in SG and</p>
              <p>the 300 plus blogs sent in US are offenses.</p>
              <p>If so,is it within SG juridictions to prosecute him?</p>
              <p>Justice is in one's heart.</p>
              <p>U can say SG court belong to so and so.</p>
              <p>But at the end,people in the world can see who is right</p>
              <p>or wrong.I like the cases heard in High Court.</p>
              <p>CSJ said</p>
              <blockquote>While the prosecution is keen for the trials to take<span style="color: #ff0000;"> place at the
              Subordinate Courts,</span> the defence is insisting that they be heard at the
              High Court so that the final judgment could find its way into legal
              publications.</blockquote>
              <p>Does he  hint DPP afraid the case go into law report?</p>
              <p>I dunt think so.</p>
              <p>I think SG gavaman just want this case to promote</p>
              <p>SG as a hub of Justice!!</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Has GPN thrown away all his law text book?</strong></span></p>

              a civil servant, on May 29, 2008 by what I had written on my blog of

              <p>Whether he had not invited or gone to her court to insult her are irrelevant.</p>

              <p>this summary looks good:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Here is the sequence of high-profile flip-flops thus far:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>02 June:</strong></span> Gopalan Nair is charged for using insulting words towards High Court judge Belinda Ang in an email that he was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>alleged</strong></span> to have sent to the judge last week.                           Nair is also <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>alleged</strong></span> to have copied the same email to many people, including the Attorney-General. Nair was charged under <strong>Section 13D (1) (a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act</strong>.</li>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>05 June:</strong></span> Gopalan Nair is further administered a Section 122(6) caution statement
              under the Criminal Procedure Code which paves the way for a sedition
              charge under <strong>Section 4(1) of the Sedition Act</strong>. However the Sedition charge itself is not administered on the day itself.</li>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>09 June:</strong></span> Gopalan Nair is further administered two Section 122(6) caution
              statements under the Criminal Procedure Code for two further charges
              under Section 228 of the Penal Code relating to sending insulting
              emails.</li>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>12 June:</strong></span> Gopalan Nair faces yet another charge, under Section 228 of the Penal
              Code, of insulting a public servant sitting in a judicial proceeding.
              This time, he is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>alleged</strong></span> to have sent an e-mail to High Court Justice Lai Siu Chiu in 2006
              which, among other things, accuses her of being corrupt. At a press
              conference on Thursday afternoon, Nair said he would be claiming trial
              to all charges tendered when his case is mentioned again on Monday 16
              June, and he denied sending any emails to Belinda Ang or the
              Attorney-General in the most current case.</li>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>16 June:</strong></span> Gopalan Nair’s charge for insulting Belinda Ang under <strong>Section
              13D (1) (a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance)
              Act is replaced with a charge under Section 228 of the Penal Code</strong>.
              The amended Penal Code 228 charge now alleges insulting High Court
              Judge Belinda Ang on his blog rather than through an e-mail. <strong>The Sedition charge is never tendered</strong>.</li>

              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">How did you so brilliantly arrive at your statement that I "<em>claim to speak on behalf of the citizens of Singapore</em>" ? If you wish to play to a wider audience, I certainly do not indulge in this kind of vain fantasy that is so characteristic of your replies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you not mention that "</span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Chia TP was a relic of our turbulent past during our infant independence days</em></span><span style="color: #0000ff;">" and that we are now in the "</span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>in the 21st century</em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>" </em>?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The reference piece that you brought up about the "Dogs and Chinese are not allowed" was an issue that occurred in 1917 - when China was divided; and also with your reference piece being a dissertation written in 1997.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not being hypocritically dishonest by denying Chia Thye Poh's situation as being a relic of the past when his situation had occurred far more recently in the History of Singapore then your ''Dog and the Chinese" incident that had occurred more then 91 years ago in China ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is the ''Dog and Chinese" issue more relevant to Singapore History then the injustice that Singaporean were forced to witness with the incarceration of Chia Thye Poh ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is this the kind of value and culture that is a Singapore Identity ?</span></p>

              <p>This study is an attempt to be objective, but still, written by a Western foreigner.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have I offended the Chinese with my honest statement on a situation that has no connection to Singapore's History ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If at all, the uncalled for preposterous remarks made by MM LKY that he "will shoot 1000 Chinese if it is to keep law and order in China" has hurt the sensitivities of the families who have lost their loved ones in the Tian-An Men incident - which was a struggle by the Chinese to gain more space for themselves in their society that is rife with corruption and nepotism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has that referenced piece that you claimed to be an objective study meant to serve the Chinese, or merely to serve the interest of the authors to gain 'guan-xi' with the Chinese Governent - in the same preposterious manner in LKY's statement that his approval of the armed and violent response by China's Government ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Chia TP was a relic of our turbulent past during our infant independence days. The authorities had good reason for his incarceration, which was to protect innocent men, women and children from the volatile and dangerous communists stirring up the population, to turn SEAsia into a communist zone.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Chia Thye Poh was a physics lecturer in the University of Singapore, and a loyal Singaporean who is not afraid of his personal political values that is more honest then what you can even claim to possess.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For his beliefs he had the option of signing a false statement admitting to the false charges that LKY had insisted Chia had committed - i.e. that Chia is a Communist, advocating for the armed overthrow of a legitimately elected Government of SGP.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chia's principled stand stood the test of time for 32 years of incarceration - 24 years in prison followed by 8 years of restricted movement on Sentosa Island - when he refused to submit to the tautings of the ISD officials that cruelly brought him on infrequent tours of Singapore - simply to show what he is missing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why will LKY and the ISD not bring Chia to trial if there are evidence to prove his guilt ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it not a fact that Chia was an elected Member of Parliament and walked out of Parliament in protest to LKY and his PAP methods of passing legislations ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It was to fulfill LKY's own desire to have Singapore merged with Malaysia without any active political opposition that got Operation Cold Store into motion, with all the leading members of the Barisan Sosialis being arrested with the help of a Colonial Legislation known as the ISA.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This arbitrary colonial relic remains to this day, when the Privy Council is thrown out while it has its usefulness to protect the interests of Singaporeans against the autocratic political abuse of the Ruling Party.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is there any neutral and equally powerful body to provide some semblance of checks and balance to the Ruling Party that dominate a Parliament and able to pass legislations at will that are detrimental to S</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">ingaporeans ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Such people are akin to terrorists of today, who hides amongst us to kill and achieve their political agenda. Thus the need for ISA to clamp down on such persons. In the 60s, the terrorists were communists.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Where are the evidence that the ISA and LKY could not produce and avoided any open trial, and preferring to incarcerate Chia for 32 years, letting him free without even a statement of assurance from Chia for Singapore's security.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are concientious persons who object to Singapore's entry into Malaysia akin to terrorists ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely those conscientious political objectors have now been fully exonerated based on the political baggage that Singapore and Malaysia is left with - after the petulant insistence of LKY in designing a Referendum that only force Singapore into a single Merger option ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>You had conveniently or suffer from selective amnesia on the things Chia did. The govt will not simply arrest anyone and throw him in jail. You had failed to mentioned:-</p>
              <p>a. He studied and was a lecturer in Nanyang Uni of the 60s, the hotbed of communism activists.</p>
              <p>a. He was a member of the fiery Barisan Sosialis</p>
              <p>b. He was banned permanently from entering Malaysia in the wake of a political speech he delivered to the Perak division of the Labour Party of Malaysia on 24 April 1966</p>
              <p>c. He was convicted for publishing a seditious article in Jul 66</p>
              <p>d. He was arrested for unlawful assembly with 25 others in Jul 66 to protest the Vietnam war.</p>
              <p>e. He declared war on our govt by stepping up street demostrations, protest meetings, and strikes.</p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Unfortunately, you have been fed with the horse-shit from the sycophantic droning sound of a single voice that drummed up the ''half-truths'' and conveniently "left out the more substantial embarrasing facts - for those who are too dumb to digest the truths.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was Chia Thye Poh a threat to society then, or did he not believe in LKY - who had advised the unionists of their Rights as individuals - and LKY's public statements in the mid-1950s ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Incidentally, the British Colonial Government had - in the 1950s - suspected that LKY was a possible Communist considering his active work with the Trade Unions as their legal adviser. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>It was to the credit of the British ISD for being honest in their dealings that LKY was not falsely labelled or charged for his vociferous participation in union work - something which is not tolerated LKY by towards any Singaporean Lawyers in the same circumstances in these present oppressive days even as we are independent.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Are Singaporeans not treated as Dogs by LKY in an independent Singapore and not allowed to enter or gather in public places ?</strong></span></p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Is your guilty conscience
                  leading you to feel insulted by the truth of the statements made,
                  or are you jumping to the wrong conclusions based on your own
                  narrow reading of my reply ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Which statement, or sentence, or
                  word have I used that cause you to feel pricked by feelings of
                  being insulted ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why will you persist with your own
                  vanity with the need for others to know what is going on in this
                  ongoing exchange ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you so certain that anyone is
                  paying attention, if not will you feel your position being less
                  defensible for the weak arguments that you are depending on
                  ?</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">How did you so brilliantly
                  arrive at your statement that I "<em>claim to speak on behalf
                  of the citizens of Singapore</em>" ? If you wish to play to a wider
                  audience, I certainly do not indulge in this kind of vain fantasy
                  that is so characteristic of your replies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you not mention that
                  "</span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Chia TP was a relic of
                  our turbulent past during our infant independence
                  days</em></span><span style="color: #0000ff;">" and that we are now

                  century</em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>"</em> ?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The reference piece that you
                  brought up about the "Dogs and Chinese are not allowed" was an
                  issue that occurred in 1917 - when China was divided; and also with
                  your reference piece being a dissertation written in
                  1997.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not being hypocritically
                  dishonest by denying Chia Thye Poh's situation as being a relic of
                  the past when his situation had occurred far more recently in the
                  History of Singapore then your ''Dog and the Chinese" incident that
                  had occurred more then 91 years ago in China ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is the ''Dog and Chinese" issue
                  more relevant to Singapore History then the injustice
                  that Singaporean were forced to witness with
                  the incarceration of Chia Thye Poh ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is this the kind of value and
                  culture that is a Singapore Identity ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have I offended the Chinese with
                  my honest statement on a situation that has no connection to
                  Singapore's History ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If at all, the uncalled
                  for preposterous remarks made by MM LKY that he "wil
                  shoot 1000 Chinese if it is to keep law and order in China" has
                  hurt the sensitivities of the families who have lost their loved
                  ones in the Tian-An Men incident - which was a struggle by the
                  Chinese to gain more space for themselves in their society that is
                  rife with corruption and nepotism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has that referenced piece that you
                  claimed to be an objective study meant to serve the Chinese, or
                  merely to serve the interest of the authors to gain 'guan-xi' with
                  the Chinese Governent - in the same preposterious manner in
                  LKY's statement that his approval of the armed and violent response
                  by China's Government ?</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Chia Thye Poh was a physics
                  lecturer in the University of Singapore, and a loyal
                  Singaporean who is not afraid of his personal political values
                  that is more honest then what you can even claim to
                  possess.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For his beliefs he had the option
                  of signing a false statement admitting to the false charges that
                  LKY had insisted Chia had committed - i.e. that Chia is a
                  Communist, advocating for the armed overthrow of a legitimately
                  elected Government of SGP.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chia's principled stand stood the
                  test of time for 32 years of incarceration - 24 years in prison
                  followed by 8 years of restricted movement on Sentosa Island -
                  when he refused to submit to the tautings of the ISD officials that
                  cruelly brought him on infrequent tours of Singapore - simply to
                  show what he is missing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why will LKY and the ISD not bring
                  Chia to trial if there are evidence to prove his guilt ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it not a fact that Chia was an
                  elected Member of Parliament and walked out of Parliament in
                  protest to LKY and his PAP methods of passing legislations
                  ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It was to fulfill LKY's own desire
                  to have Singapore merged with Malaysia without any active political
                  opposition that got Operation Cold Store into motion, with all the
                  leading members of the Barisan Sosialis being arrested with the
                  help of a Colonial Legislation known as the ISA.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This arbitrary colonial relic
                  remains to this day, when the Privy Council is thrown out when
                  it has its usefulness to protect the interests of
                  Singaporeans against the autocratic political abuse of
                  the Ruling Party.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is there any neutral and equally
                  powerful body to provide some semblance of checks and balance to
                  the Ruling Party that dominate a Parliament and able to pass
                  legislations at will that are detimental to S</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">ingaporeans ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Where are the evidence that the
                  ISA and LKY could not even produce and avoided any open trial, and
                  preferring to incarcerate Chia for 32 years, letting him free
                  without even a statement of assurance from Chia for
                  Singapore's security.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are concientious persons who
                  object to Singapore's entry into Malaysia akin to terrorists
                  ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely those conscientious
                  political objectors have now been fully exonerated based on
                  the political baggage that Singapore and Malaysia is left with
                  - after the petulant insistence of LKY in designing a
                  Referendum that only force Singapore into a single Merger option
                  ?</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Unfortunately, you have been
                  fed with the horse-shit from the sycophantic droning sound of a
                  single voice that drummed up the ''half-truths'' and
                  conveniently "left out the more substantial
                  embarrasing facts - for those who are too dumb to digest the
                  truths.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was Chia Thye Poh a threat to
                  society then, or did he not believe in LKY - who had advised the
                  unionists of their Rights as individuals - and LKY's public
                  statements in the mid-1950s ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you suffering
                  from selective amnesia, or simply to juvenile to even know the
                  early History of Singapore ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Incidentally, the British Colonial
                  Government had</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chia Thye Poh has denied the false
                  and baseless accusations against him from the first day he was
                  arrested, and throughout his 32 years of incarceration.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If Chia is denying the
                  charges after he is released, why has the ISD not re-arrested him -
                  in the same manner that the ISD had re-arrested those accused
                  as Communists in the Catholic Church of Singapore - when
                  they retracted their statements of confessions and
                  had claimed that they had to make such admission due
                  to torture ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You can re-interprete History in
                  any way you like, the fact remains in the events that transpired,
                  and in the public statements printed by Chia Thye Poh - which you
                  can read if you will Google his name with the ISA
                  following.</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Were there not lives lost
                  during the 1960s - even with Chia being incarcerated ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chia was part of the Barisan
                  Sosialis exco-members who were vociferous in objecting to
                  LKY's idea of gaining independence for Singapore through
                  merger with Malaysia; and LKY depended on the British
                  Colonial Masters to neutralise the Barisan Sosialis - whom the
                  Colonialist had viewed as Communists, but not Singaporeans - by
                  arresting the leadership.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With Singapore's merger with
                  Malaysia, were the problems lessened for Singaporeans ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Or was it not a fact that problems
                  had exacerbated with racial politics being the order of the day -
                  with the constant strife that LKY had with the Malay Politicians
                  from Malaya ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The lives that were lost in the
                  60s were a result of racial clashes from the fiery speeches and
                  political debates between LKY and the Malay politicians.</span></p>

                  will help the Ministers go a long way for their

                  70% of the Singapore population of 4.5 Million support the Ruling
                  Party - when only about 2 million are eligible
                  participants in the political process, and from which less then
                  half actually participate in any elections due to the continued
                  shifting of the rules and boundary lines that are changed in favor
                  of the incumbent Political Party.</span></p>

              <p>You do have a masochistic joy in putting down sane persons who would not agree with a clown like you. But then, your insults do not bother me, for only in your salivating rants will others see the mad incredibility you lend to your flawed reasoning of every statement.</p>
              <p>You can enjoy the despicable Chia TP all you want in your bedroom behind close doors, but nothing will change the fact that back in 1966, he was a dangerous man to society, who would lead innocent lives to their doom in his attempt to declare war on society. You mentioned he only taught in University. Why did you not mention which? Fear readers would know it was Nanyang U of the 60s, the breeding ground of fanatic communists?</p>
              <p>Make him a hero all you want. He is no longer a threat to society. All his supporters had either fled or had turned capitalist, enjoying the good life our society can offer without his brand and your brand of rubbish, twisting history to suit your agenda.</p>

              supporters without whose help, life would have been infinitely more
              difficult in the already difficult circumstances.<br><br>I am also
              grateful to the representatives of the US Embassy who have continued to
              maintain their presence in court. I understand the US State Department
              is being briefed daily on my situation.<br><br>I am an American blogger who had intended to remain in Singapore only from May 25<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> 2008 to no later than June 3, 2008. My being charged for criminal
              offenses for writing a blog criticizing a Singapore Judge on May 29,
              2008 is forcing me to remain in Singapore much longer than I had
              expected. This is causing me untold misery by my inability to attend to
              my law practice in the US and other financial difficulties including my
              inability to attend to my house mortgage and other financial affairs.
              Regardless of what I have to undergo, I refuse to surrender to this
              punishment by the Singapore authorities. What I had said in my blog is
              what I had witnessed during the 3 days of the hearing before the High
              Court Singapore in the case of Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew vs Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> Soon Juan from May 26 2008 to May 28, 2008. I strongly believe it is
              the right of every free man to speak freely without fear or favor,
              without which he no longer is a man but a coward. This right is a right
              enshrined in the Constitution of Singapore as well as constitutions
              throughout the world as well as the Universal Declaration of Human
              Rights. Money can be had today or tomorrow but once a man loses his
              freedom, he loses everything. This has always been my belief which I
              will cherish till the end.<br><br>In court today, the prosecution took
              another U turn. Call it flip flopping if you like. You will recall from
              my last post the tortuous course these proceedings are taking. During
              my time in custody in solitary confinement from May 31, 2008 to June
              05, 2008 (6 days) the following occurred. First they charged me with
              sending an Email to Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span>, alleging that I insulted her. Second they charged me with sending an Email to Judge <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">Lai</span> Sui <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chu</span> more than 2 years ago alleging the same. Third they withdrew all
              charges and charged me under the Sedition Act of Singapore for what I
              had written on my blog of May 29, 2008. Fourth, they withdrew the
              Sedition charge and wanted to proceed on the earlier Email charges.<br><br>Today in court there was a further U Turn. Now they are no longer proceeding with the Email charge to Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span> or the Sedition charge and have instead charged me with having insulted Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span> on May 29, 2008 by reason of what I had written on my blog as well as the 2 year old matter with Judge <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">Lai</span>. I cannot remember whether I did or did not send the 2 year old Email.<br><br>The Judge <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span> charge is that I had offered an insult to Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span>,
              a civil servant, on May 29, 2008 by what I had written on my blog of
              the same date. As to how I could have possibly insulted this Judge by
              writing something on my blog is no doubt mind boggling. I had not
              invited the Judge to read my blog and neither did I go to her court and
              insult her personally. I had merely written a blog post and nothing
              more.<br><br>I am not surprised why the Singapore authorities have decided not to proceed with the charge that I had sent an Email to Judge <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span>.
              I had all along claimed that the police had seized my note book which
              contained my Email password. I had all along maintained that if anyone
              had sent any Emails to this Judge, it wasn't me. It appears that the
              police have finally accepted my claim that I had not sent any Email to
              this judge or anyone else on May 29, 2008.<br><br>During the time I was in custody, the police had shown me Emails with my Email address which had <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">purportedly</span> been sent to Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span>,
              the Attorney General of Singapore and one other person in authority
              whom I cannot recall. This was after my notebook containing my Email
              passwords were seized by the police. I had all along denied ever
              sending any of these Emails. The question therefore arises as to who
              sent them!<br><br>So the latest position as regards the charges now is firstly, an accusation that I had insulted Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_18" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span> on May 29, 2008 by reason of the contents of my blog post of the same date and the accusation that I had insulted Judge <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-error">Lai</span> in an Email to Judge <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-error">Lai</span> more than 2 years ago in March 2006, keeping in mind that I had
              travelled to Singapore more than once during the last 2 years without
              incident. If indeed I had sent any Email to Judge <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-error">Lai</span>, which I deny; why Judge <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_22" class="blsp-spelling-error">Lai</span> should now be suddenly offended by an Email which may or may not have
              been sent to her more than 2 years ago from California, is puzzling.<br><br>Not
              satisfied by keeping me in solitary confinement for 6 days from the
              time of my arrest, the court had today ordered that I am to report
              everyday at 9 am at the Cantonment Police Station for interrogation
              until further notice. The police have claimed that despite my
              incarceration for 6 days in a police station cell since my arrest in
              solitary confinement where I was interrogated at least twice each day,
              they claim that they still have not completed their investigation and
              therefore the need to interrogate me each day, and every day, until
              such time they finally decide that they have had enough. One would have
              thought that I had killed 20 people in cold blood! For Heavens sake, I
              only wrote a blog.<br><br>I do not know the purpose of this all but
              perhaps they had miscalculated my reaction. Perhaps they thought that I
              would buckle under at the first opportunity and grovel as other
              Singaporeans are expected to do. Well, I am not guilty. I wrote a blog.
              I wrote what I saw. I was exercising free speech. Free speech is
              essential for good governance. If the Singaporean authorities are
              unwilling to accept this, it is time they did.<br><br>After all they
              claim Singapore to be a first world country. With international banking
              trade and commerce. All of this requires free speech. The sooner they
              realize this the better.<br><br>I have to get some sleep now so as to report to Cantonment Police Station to be interrogated in the morning.<br><br>Good night.<br><br><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_23" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was he a dangerous man and by whose standards ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">At least Chia was more honest a character in representing Singaporean's interest to object to LKY's plans to merge Singapore into a Federation of Malaysia, which had also the support of those familiar with the mentality of the Malayan Malays during that period of Singapore's History.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not more despicable in your own dubious knowledge and preference to re-interprete historical events that are based not on recorded facts that transpired, but has shown to be regurgitated information from the sycophantic propaganda machine from the Master Recording ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you know that the Nanyang University was built with donations from the Chinese Community in Singapore, with the land donated by Ngee Ann Kongsi ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">LKY had conveniently purveyed this Colonial view to suit his own political agenda to remove Chia Thye Poh and his group of Barisan Sosialis from the ongoing political events - so as not to influence the outcome of a political process which LKY had initiated to have Singapore enter a Grand Merger Scheme of an enlarged Malaysia that was LKY's brainchild with the help of the Colonial Government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not being despicable towards the Chinese Community in Singapore with your derogatory remarks that the Nanyang University was a hotbed of communism - when the students there were more politically concious then the meek and non-chalant youths in the current universities in Singapore today ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is this not a sense of insecurity that after 50 over years of nation building, Singapore is yet to be a Nation, so much so that there is no such a term as a 'Nationalist' ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This is the act of an impotent and incapable hunter. DeerHunter, I wonder if you can even have any potency being a ''DearHunter" and even contribute a solution to LKY's small talent pool.</span></p>

              <blockquote>In Singapore, as we all know, judges, registrars in all the courts in
                  Singapore are beholden to the Lee Administration. One of their duties
                  as judges is to ensure that they are not seen to side a political
                  opponent lawyer, no matter how much justice is on his side, lest their
                  masters think they are opposition sympathizers, which will invariably
                  result in their falling off in favor, losing out on promotions and
                  perhaps even being dismissed from their judgeships. Any judge wanting
                  his promotions and looking forward to a peaceful and successful career
                  in the Singapore Bench will ensure that all cases brought by opposition
                  politician lawyers are <em>sua sponte</em> lost.</blockquote>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Another day of U Turns and Fishing Expeditions by the Police</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Just to reassure any reader new to my
              case, who may quite reasonably think after reading this blog spot that
              I had actually killed 20 people in cold blood and had I not been
              stopped in time, I would have butchered another 400 just for the fun of
              it; please be reassured I have done nothing of the sort! All I did,
              believe it or not, was to write 2 blog posts on my blog the Singapore
              Dissident criticizing Judge Belinda Ang, a Singapore High Court Judge
              on her conduct of a defamation case recently.<br><br>June 17, 2008, Tuesday, Singapore Cantonment Police Station.<br><br>The
              time is 8.45 am. As required by the Court Order of June 16, 2008, I
              appear for interrogation at the police station at 9 am. The court had
              on June 16, 2008 ordered that I appear every day at 9 am at the police
              station for interrogation until next month because the police claim
              they are investigating further unspecified offenses.<br><br>3rd Floor of the Police station, Tuesday, June 17, 2008, 8.45 am.<br><br>At
              9.04 am Assistant Superintendent of Police (officer) Mr. Razak Jakaria,
              the Investigation Officer appears and takes me to an interview room.
              Another officer sits in the room.<br><br>Now the officer says that I am
              being investigated for an offense under Sec 4 (1) of the Sedition Act
              which he deliberately stresses is a seizable offence, obviously to
              threaten me into confessing something or other. He repeats that this
              offense carries a maximum jail term of 3 years, to stress it's
              seriousness.<br><br>The Section reads as follows: Any person who does
              or attempts to do or makes any preparation to do or conspires with any
              person to do any act which has or which would if done have a seditious
              tendency shall be guilty of an offense and shall be liable on
              conviction of a first offense to a fine not exceeding $5000.00 or to
              imprisonment not exceeding 3 years or both.<br><br>After showing me the charge, he begins the questions.<br><br>This
              is yet another day of U Turns by the police. You will recall the
              several changes that the police have made to date on what to charge me
              with. First it was an Email to Judge Ang. Another charge that I sent
              Judge Lai an Email more than 2 years ago. Then the decision to drop
              everything and proceed with a Sedition Charge. Then the dropping of the
              Sedition Charge and charging me with insulting Judge Ang though my
              blog. Now this latest version of resurrecting the Sedition charge one
              more time!<br><br>Mind you, from the time of my arrest on May 31, 2008
              Saturday and my detention in solitary confinement for 5 days
              continuously, and despite my having been brought to court several
              times, up till now the police have not formally charged me with any
              single offense and neither have they taken any plea from me.<br><br>One can only assume that the police are just continuing with their roundabouts.<br><br>This
              time, the officer goes back and covers the same ground he covered in
              the past by showing me Emails which he claims I sent to Justice Belinda
              Ang and others. As before, I again deny having sent any Emails to any
              of these people.<br><br>He then produces an extract of the Criminal
              Procedure Code which requires an accused or witness to allow his
              computer system (I suppose including Email account) to be looked into,
              when a crime is suspected and failing to allow the police to look at
              it, itself becomes an offense. He then asks if I am prepared to log
              into my Email account to the computer at the police station for him to
              inspect the contents of my Email account.<br><br>The Singapore police
              system clearly, as in this case, does not provide due process to an
              accused. Here, once the police had articulated a suspicion that an
              offense has been committed, regardless of whether or not they had a
              single shred of evidence, they can insist that my Email account be
              available for their examination; failing to provide co-operation
              becoming an arrestable offense immediately.<br><br>In this case, the
              police had alleged they were suspecting a crime. Since that was done, I
              had no choice but to permit them to have access to my private Emails.
              Of course, I did not send any emails to anyone, but knowing that since
              my arrest, the police had seized my notebook containing my Email
              password, there was no telling what the police would do, such as
              tampering with my Emails or implanting offending Emails by themselves.<br><br>Clearly
              Singaporeans do not have the right to privacy or the right to be free
              from unlawful search and seizure or if they did; the police have the
              right to just ignore it.<br><br>I had no choice but to permit the
              officer to have access to my Email account. I had stated in my written
              response that I was permitting them to have access to my Email account
              under protest since it has now transpired that they or others at their
              behest may have tampered with my Email account since they have produced
              documents falsely accusing me of sending Emails to Judge Belinda Ang
              and others. Therefor since I am to use the police computer, there may
              be a strong possibility that they may have implanted offending Emails
              into my email account so as to falsely accuse me of having sent them.<br><br>I
              was brought down to the computer or meeting room of the Cantonment
              Police Station. There were 2 photographers there. I was asked to key
              into my Email account. I demanded that that they stand away while I
              keyed in my password so as to avoid its detection by them. They
              complied.<br><br>I was asked to open each item in my Email, namely the
              Inbox, Sent, Thrash and Bulk. The police photographers took several
              photographs of each page of those items. The officer then asked me to
              open several of those Emails, which he read. He could find nothing
              offensive or suspicious. The Emails that he had accused me of sending
              to Judge Belinda Ang and others were not there, and neither were the
              undeliverable messages he accused me of having received.<br><br>By this
              time the interview which had stated at 9.04 am had reached 2.30pm, that
              is 5 1/2 hours. Suddenly the officer disappeared and came back with a
              letter from the police that I need not attend everyday at the police
              station at 9am until the middle of July 2008 as ordered by the court,
              and I only need to attend if I was so advised. Another U turn, you may
              say.<br><br>Finally I must add how the officer uses one psychological
              technique to try to wear me down. He gets another officer to sit next
              to him at the computer while he works on it. The other officer then
              looks at the computer as if he has discovered something incriminating
              against me. Then both the officer and this other officer talk in
              whispers. All this must be to intimidate me into believing that there
              is something highly incriminating against me in the computer, thereby
              suggesting that I come clean by confessing at the first opportunity.<br><br>This
              observation, consultation and whispering between the officer and his
              second, at the computer carried on not only at the interview room but
              also at the computer room. I realised what they were doing and objected
              to the other officer being present but the officer's stand was that it
              was his office and he could do what he wanted.<br><br>It was quite
              apparent to me that this constant U Turns and checking my Emails is
              nothing more than a fishing expedition. Not having anything concrete,
              they are going over the same ground repeatedly hoping that they will
              find some contraditions in my statements; or looking into my private
              Emails hoping that they could find something new to charge me with.
              This sort of investigation is only done by police forces not intent on
              detecting crime but rather to eliminate government opponents. These are
              political police forces working for tyrants and despots, not
              independent ones.<br><br>And so was wasted the whole of a very good
              morning at Cantonment Police Station. I have been here now for 25 days,
              since my arrival on May 26, 2008, when I should have gone back to
              California on June 3, 2008, 16 days longer and still in Singapore. My
              law practice is already in serious jeopardy and so is my other
              financial situation. But I remain adamant in standing my ground.
              Mahatma Gandhi had said, "you may imprison my body, break my bones,
              even kill me, but you cannot take my spirit and my resolve. That will
              remain with me till the end". Mahatma Gandhi was right.<br><br>In the
              meantime, I am grateful for the massive congratulatory messages sent to
              me asking me to remain strong during this difficult time. I am also
              been reviving offers of help from people both in Singapore and
              worldwide to whom I remain eternally grateful.<br><br>It seems the
              longer I remain in Singapore, the greater the worldwide interest in my
              case. It truly does appear to me, that no matter what the Singapore
              government may or may not think of the right to free speech and
              expression; the people of the free world do really take it very
              seriously. And if Singapore is at all concerned about its standing
              among the free countries in the world then it too should take it
              seriously.<br><br>So I am clearly not alone in this. Good people not
              only in Singapore but worldwide stand with me on this important
              question of free speech and expression. And this is reassuring. Very
              reassuring.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br>Singapore</p>

              of a recent court hearing - to assess damages to be awarded to the
              Prime Minister and Minister Mentor in a libel suit - ended up on the
              Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) website.</p>
              <p>Seven audio snippets of the May 26-28 hearing appeared on the
              SDP website between June 10 and June 15, according to their time
              stamps.</p>
              <p>Five of these focused on exchanges between SDP chief Chee Soon Juan and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>The other two were exchanges between Dr Chee's sister, Ms Chee Siok Chin, and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>Also uploaded on the website were transcripts of some of the
              exchanges that took place when Dr Chee cross-examined MM Lee on the
              witness stand.</p>
