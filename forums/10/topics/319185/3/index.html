              <p>Nair is presently in police custody. He will be charged in court on Monday.</p>

              <p>unless you know him personally, it's hard to deduce that he's well versed in law. even so, what type of law? you can give him credit for being familiar with the political happenings here, and no doubt he's armed to the brim on his grouses. that's about it.</p>
              <p>in some ways, one salutes him for taking the chance to try to create some chinks and dents in lky's armor, others may think he is a fool for taking such uncalculated risk.</p>

He fled to USA and studied Law and he is now a US citizen. He tried to run down LKY in his blog because LKY procecuted many dissidents who were in opposition politics. Now he is a blogger and he is challeging lKY to catch him. He claimed that the court is biased towards opposition. My personal view is that we have no freedom in politics when you         oppose the regime. LKY is a dictator, every body knows abt it. You can't oppose him at all. But reading the declassified statement by the British, you will know that LKY is a coward.</p></div>
