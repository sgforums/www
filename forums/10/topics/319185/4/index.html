              <p>Round 1 to Lee Kuan Yew!</p>
              <h3 class="mainblock">Gopalan Nair arrested!</h3>
              <p>Now the stage for another showdown has been set.</p>
              <p>Former WP politician Gopalan Nair has been arrested and awaiting to
              be charged in court on Monday. The former Singaporean who is now an
              American citizen and a lawyer in Fremont, California issued a challenge
              to have him arrested in his latest posts.</p>
              <p>Our state media revealed the news of the arrest in this format:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Police have arrested a former Singaporean for the offence of “threatening, abusing or insulting a public servant”.</p>
              <p>In response to media queries, police confirmed that Gopalan
              Pallichadath Nair, who is now a US citizen, was arrested at Broadway
              Hotel along Serangoon Road on Saturday.</p>
              <p>A warrant of arrest without bail was granted by the courts for the arrest.</p>
              <p>Nair is alleged to have sent an email to the Attorney-General and
              the Solicitor-General which contained statements amounting to the
              offence of insulting a public servant.</p>
              <p>The statements were directed against Justice Belinda Ang, a Supreme Court judge. The statements were also posted on Nair’s blog.</p>
              </blockquote> <blockquote>
              <p>Nair is presently in police custody. He will be charged in court on Monday.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Read Gopi’s posts below which have been reproduced for the sake of
              posterity. But the real lesson here is that we common sheep is not
              allowed to air our disgust and frustrations towards the incorruptible
              and infallible members of the ruling government. Your impertinent
              challenge will not be taken lightly and you will be taken to the
              cul-de-sac, you insolent bastard.</p>
              <p>Our superior brand of democracy unlike Jeffersonian types cannot be
              tarnished and voices of dissent must be silenced. Have you not learned
              anything that our system is superior and perfect? That we are above
              suspicion and hearsay? We will never be a first world country if
              insolent dissident types like Mr. Gopi Nair and Dr. Chee are allowed to
              sow discord and lies.</p>
              <p>Foreigners or former Singaporeans are not exempt from this mode of
              justice. Even if you are American, Jamaican or Martian- consider
              yourself warned! You will be pursued even in cyberspace and thrown into
              jail.</p>
              <p>Swift is our retribution and the justice meted out is fitting! Throw
              these annoying people to jail and to hell whatever they are saying. We
              must protect our integrity. For the glory of Sheep City and the good of
              the people.</p>
              <p>For <em>my</em> million dollar salary.</p>

              <p>Police catch Gopalan Nair, this will make LKY look even worst, in bad light. The US will side their citizen, remember Micheal Fay case. Gopalan purposely challenge LKY to expose the latter's weakness. I suggest Lee retire from politics, he is in power too long, dont want to let go.</p>

              <p>Should be fun to see how it unfolds after lau Lee wins his defamation suit against him, which I have no doubt he will win if the case is heard in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Wonder how is he going to enforce the damages as all of Gopalan's assets are in the US. I would also think he would be smart enough to transfer all his assets to someone else.</p>

              <p><br>So what you are saying is that all Singaporeans have no right to their personal opinions? There is only 1 opinion and you cannot deviate from it and have to follow it 100%. There is a difference between going to a hospital and telling the staff that they are stupid, and going to a hospital to yell profanities at them. Tell you what, next time anybody calls you stupid. You take him to court to sue him, see if you win.</p>
              <p>Opinions are different from statement of facts. Don't be kuku and get the two mixed up like you always do.</p>
              <p>Even if I know you, I can tell you straight in the face that you are stupid and you can't do anything about it.</p>
              <p>A word makes alot of difference. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
