              <p><br>Frankly, if it was anybody else, why would the person being an American citizen be bothered about the plight of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>I guess most Singaporeans prefer to live in monarchy instead of democracy, where rights are subjugated, my assumption is 66.6% less the Royals of Singaporeans are closet masochist devoid of intelligence. Li Ao was right in saying that Singaporeans are the dumbest compared to Hong Kong, China and Taiwan, probably a result of our heritage, most of the immigrants that relocated to Singapore from China are peasants. Therefore it's the peasants' mentality to be ruled and trampled over, it's also in their mentality that it's the mandate of heaven that the holy trinity rule over them.</p>

              <p>wow, you do know your history boy, hmmm respect, not many singaporean know li ao,</p>
              <p>to refresh on what li ao master has said,</p>
              <p>AND DUN FLAME ME ok, Not i say one, LI AO SAY ONE</p>
              <p>In the olden days, only the poorest people and the most uneducated people in china come to singapore to try to make a living, as singapore is deemed a terrible place to live in, due to the weather and the olden generations of staying in their homelands, NO MATTER what due to them wanting to die in their homelands, you can ask your grandparents the first generations, if you wanted to know more about the history then..... during that time life was very harsh in singapore.......... thus that was the basis of li ao used to support his argument......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However in the case of hongkong, during the british takeover, the richest PEOPLE in china generally moved to HK, to avoid their money from falling into communist hands, thus that explains why the people there are considered the richest and the people there are showed traits of their roots of business making....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the case of taiwan, all the political Elites moved there, after the fight of KMT and the communist during the rise of mao, that explains the spirit of the current taiwanese people liking to protest and stuff, fight for rights....etc etc if you like to look it in that way. These people are very politically aware........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those remaining in china are the middle class average joes, and started to show their true potentials in the current years, after better rule....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway, this statement from our friend maurizio13 has said reminds me of the statement the our own LKY has said to the then LATE Deng Xiao Ping, when he visited singapore in the 1980s.....</p>
              <p>DENG: Lee, singapore has progressed so much, you have done well</p>
              <p>LKY: i am sure in the future china will progress more than us, as we are made up of the worst from your country. As long as you take the right steps.... (LKY is a strong believer of <strong>eugenics</strong>) ( i believe he has the thought of using this to show off his 'leadership' )</p>
              <p>DENG:....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT I BELIEVE that humans are highly adaptable and we should really look at ourselves carefully, why these outsiders are looking at us in this way?</p>
              <p>are we really like what li ao has said? if not why do our actions prove otherwise?</p>
              <p>why do a majority of us, shows traits of labourers, like our forefathers, very obedient and fearful of everything? Ok i know that there are still people like <a href="../../../users/225283">Poh Ah Pak</a> etc etc,</p>
              <p>i am glad to say we still have hope..... :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i am still expectin to have some people to flame this statement by li ao,</p>
              <p>I think that we should look into what he said, rather than rejecting it before even thinking about it.</p>
              <p>when you criticize someone, you obviously hope that they can learn and improve, which is a act of helping them, you dun criticize someone you would want them to be condemned and never to improve right?</p>

              <p><br> Frankly, if it was anybody else, why would the person being an
              American citizen be bothered about the plight of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>I guess most Singaporeans prefer to live in monarchy instead of
              democracy, where rights are subjugated, my assumption is 66.6%
              less the Royals of Singaporeans are closet masochist
              devoid of intelligence. Li Ao was right in saying that Singaporeans
              are the dumbest compared to Hong Kong, China and Taiwan, probably a
              result of our heritage, most of the immigrants that relocated
              to Singapore from China are peasants. Therefore it's the
              peasants' mentality to be ruled and trampled over, it's also in
              their mentality that it's the mandate of heaven that the holy
              trinity rule over them.</p>

              <p>Tell you what, Poh, why don't you mail this to MFA or the PM's office? This site is probably of low significance to the ministers, whom i doubt read sites such as these or even their officers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Better yet, tell the american citizen to go to the speakers corner and shout it out, in hong lim, if he truly have the guts, instead of hiding here where there is low probability of any government officer here. You would only be flattering yourself, just like that crap foreigner, to think there is here. </p>

              <p>Why should I, over a claim by a small fry like him? And let our police force, who have better things to do such as catch Mas, to entertain him? He's only a guest but a crap foreigner who does not understand hospitality, on our shores. Bo liao!</p>
