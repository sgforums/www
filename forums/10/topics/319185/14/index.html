              <blockquote>Being forced to remain in Singapore against my will, I naturally have
              to live among Singaporeans. What I have found so far is by and large;
              educated Singaporeans are recent immigrants from somewhere else. From
              India, from Europe and from elsewhere.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> I am not seeing any local
              educated Singaporeans</span>. I have no doubt that they have left the country.
              They have emigrated to other countries in the world, and left Singapore
              for good.<br></blockquote>

              The great efficiency and strength of the Singapore Judiciary has won
              her several accolades and a strong international reputation (see the
              rankings of the world’s legal systems by Political and Economic Risk
              Consultancy (PERC) and Institute for Management Development
              (IMD)). Strict case management and Alternative Dispute Resolution
              methods (see <a href="http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/LegalSyst.html#Section9">Section 9</a> below) have reduced drastically the backlog of cases which had plagued
              both the Supreme Court and Subordinate Courts in the 1980s. <br></span></p>

              <p>confiscate GOPALAN passport is standard procedure for "defendents" who has shows a high potential of "run road", as singapore's law do not extend beyond our shores, a precautionary approach.

              <p>Green harvesting of bright students is a common practice in America. It shows how hard top companies try to recruit top talent. We may lose many Singaporeans this way.</p>
              <p>Other small countries face similar problems retaining talent. New Zealand is a good example. Many New Zealanders work overseas, in Australia, Britain or the US. So many New Zealanders have emigrated that newspapers write about "the flight of the kiwis", even though kiwis cannot fly.</p>
              <p>Recently, an eminent professor from the London School of Economics, Professor Robert Wade, spoke at a conference in Auckland. He said:</p>
              <p>"Once a threshold density of skilled people is lost, the rate of out-migration is likely to accelerate, companies and organisations will have increasing trouble meeting staffing needs, the quality of public services will decline, the tax base will erode, and so on."</p>
              <p>Professor Wade also spoke of how overseas Taiwanese and Koreans are offered considerable incentives and subsidies by their governments to return home. Even China is now doing this. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">How much more critical must it be for Singapore to attract talent from around the world, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to retain our own talent</span>?</span></strong></p>
