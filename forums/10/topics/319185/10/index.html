              <p>Are you now stating that Gopalan Nair did not return to Singapore in response to the Government call to overseas Singaporean to stay engage with Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Gopalan Nair may have taken it literally and return to Singapore to engage the PAP and expose the shiny facade created.</p>
              <p>If you had read the text of LKY's call for more political space - he had even cry out for tolerance to include anyone who will even preach heresies.</p>
              <p>Gopalan Nair has already exposed the true colors of the Mentor, who had so diligently covered his skin tones that became darker as he aged.</p>

              <p>In your(lionnoisy) feverish efforts to support and defend the Great
              Mentor's position, are you not making similar errors as the
              clueless 'Point_blank' character in allowing yourself to
              be a 'bastardised' version of the Great Mentor ?</p>
              <p>Have you not considered that Goapalan Nair was actually
              responding to the call from the Singapore Government to remain
              engage with Singapore even if they have left our shores.</p>
              <p>Did you confuse yourself with the US Laws that give the Bloggers
              their rights to free expressions, as much as those liberties do not
              threaten, instigate malice or violence that will impinge on the
              Civil Rights of others ?</p>
              <p>Such regulations are quite different from the Singapore Laws
              that prevent anyone identifiable individual from making an honest
              criticism to the political envirnment which they live in.</p>
              <p>As was mentioned in the article included in my response dated 8
              June 2008 - 02.25AM on Page 8 of this Thread - the author

              <p>A and B is nothing wrong mah.. Infact.. many Singaporean also think like that wat.</p>

              <p>As for C , it amounts to nothing but cursing mah. Is cursing a crime ?</p>

              <p>The opposition are all very smart people, but not smart enough. The media just like to make them look and sound stupid.</p>
              <p>If you are not confident of winning, why destroy yourself? Why walk into a trap? I guess Gopalan is too bored in America haha...If he is looking for justice, he would not be able to find it. Maybe some sympathies... Lives destroyed under the law, really sad.</p>
              <p>I can say that he writes very well, how i wish i can write essays like him haha...nothing less from an outstanding lawyer whom MM Lee views as one of the greatest political threat.</p>

              <p>Eh how come lionnoisy still never answer us ah?</p>
              <p>lionnoisy, why did you use a clone called makepeace and then start talking to yourself?</p>
              <p>Please answer to every one.</p>
              <p>Notice how lionnoisy likes to make challanges and calls to people that he know will not be seeing this, much less answer to him and refute him, but instead chooses not to even dare to talk about or face the real questions raised by very real people in here.</p>
              <p>As you can see, his posts in here are not really any real challanges to debate or what so ever, but more about making himself feel brave and big without the risk of actually facing up to a real challange.</p>

              <p>However notice how quickly lionnoisy folds when he is faced with a real challange... for example when he was exposed for using clones he started going crazy and coming up with increasingly irrational and panicky replies that were really funny to watch.</p>
              <p>Let's look at his replies when he was exposed, notice how he desperately tried to spin some tall tale about his com being hacked, and then said that he needed time off for some treatment computer addiction:</p>
