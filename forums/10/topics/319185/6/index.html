              <p><strong>Did Goplan Nair threaten Belinda Ang?<br>Posted by Charles on June 1, 2008</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to Channel News Asia, the Singapore police has recently arrested a former Singaporean for sending ‘insulting statements to a public servant’ to the Attorney General and the Solicitor General. The allegedly offensive statement has also been posted on his blog (Channel News Asia, 2008).</p>
              <p>A quick search online in Singapore Statutes throw up one possible offense that the police might prosecute him under - The Penal Code, Chapter 10 - Contempts of the Lawful Authority of Public Servants - Section 189, ‘Threat of injury to a public servant’ which states that:</p>
              <p>Whoever holds out any threat of injury to any public servant, or to any person in whom he believes that public servant to be interested, for the purpose of inducing that public servant to do any act, or to forbear or delay to do any act, connected with the exercise of the public functions of such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both (Singapore Statutes, n.d.).</p>
              <p>In his latest post, ‘Singapore. Judge Belinda Ang’s Kangaroo Court’, Nair claims that the court has been misappropriated for political means (Nair 2008). However, any references to the judge, Belinda Ang, cannot be deemed as threatening to the public servant. For the purpose of a closer examination, we have reproduced any references to Belinda Ang which was found in his blog posting:</p>
              <p>1. ‘your stooge of a judge, Belinda Ang’;<br>2. ‘The judge Belinda Ang was throughout prostituting herself during the entire proceedings, by being nothing more than an employee of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew and his son and carrying out their orders’;<br>3. ‘right out of the pages of Alice in Wonderland with Belinda Ang playing the role of the Queen of Hearts before the trial of the Mouse who stole the Tarts very well indeed’;<br>4. numerous references to her as the ‘kangaroo judge’;<br>5. ‘and the judge obediently sustained the objection’;<br>6. ‘ Of course the judge permitted these insults, since after all Lee Kuan Yew and his son owned the courts and the judge as well’;</p>
              <p>While it is true that in his posting, he accuses the court and the judge of political persecution, sometimes using language that might be deemed as offensive, there was no hint or openly declared threat to cause any injury to the public servant. This is a clear distinction that one should keep in mind.</p>
              <p>While it is true that he had openly declared his address, name and laid down a challenge for the Senior Minister to serve him with a writ of summons, there are still no plausible grounds for the arrests.</p>
              <p>Given that the Singapore law society has recently announced its intentions to lobby for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be incorporated into the law books, it should seek to represent Mr Nair if the police decides to press ahead with charges. There is no time to be lost given the authorities have said they will put him on trial by Monday.</p>

              <p>In response to media queries, Police confirmed that we have arrested a
              person on 31 May 2008 at Broadway Hotel, Serangoon Road for the offence
              of “threatening, abusing or insulting a public servant”. The person is
              identified as Gopalan Pallichadath Nair, a former Singaporean who is
              now a US citizen.</p>
              <p>A warrant of arrest without bail was granted by the courts for the arrest.</p>
              <p>Nair is believed to have sent an email to the Attorney-General and the
              Solicitor-General which contained statements amounting to such an
              offence. These statements were directed against Justice Belinda Ang, a
              judge of the Singapore Supreme Court. These statements were also posted
              on Nair’s blog.</p>
              <p>Nair is presently in Police custody. He will be produced in court on 2 June 2008 .</p>

              court here on Monday with insulting a public officer.
              <p>Gopalan Nair, 58, an ex-Workers' Party member who is now a US
              citizen living in California, was arrested in Singapore on Saturday and
              charged on Monday with insulting Justice Belinda Ang, who presided over
              the libel case brought by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister
              Mentor Lee Kuan Yew against Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) leader
              Chee Soon Juan and his sister, Siok Chin.</p>
              <p>He is being remanded for one more week as the authorities
              said they needed to investigate further, Nair's lawyer Chia Ti Lik told
              told reporters on Monday.</p>
              <p>He is due back in court next Monday.</p>
              <p>'We can confirm that Gopalan Nair, a US citizen, was arrested
              on May 31,' a US embassy spokesman said, adding that 'we are monitoring
              the case closely'.</p>
              <p>According to a court document, Nair is charged with insulting
              Justice Belinda Ang Saw Ean last Thursday by sending an email.</p>
              <p> Mr Chia said the comments in the email essentially repeated those Nair
              made in a recent blog about a defamation case filed by PM Lee and MM
              Lee against the Chee siblings and SDP.</p>
              <p>In the blog, Nair strongly criticised a three-day legal hearing last week to assess damages in the defamation suit.</p>
              <p>In another post on his blog on Saturday, Nair taunted
              authorities, saying he was in Singapore at a particular hotel, and also
              gave his phone number.</p>
              <p>'I am now within your jurisdiction...What are you going to do about it?' Nair wrote.</p>
              <p>If convicted, Nair faces a fine of up to S$5,000 or one year in prison. -- AFP.</p>

              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              HE LEFT for the United States
              shortly after he had been fined $8,000 on contempt of court charges,
              for comments made in a speech at a 1991 election rally.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              But Gopalan Nair maintained a
              keen interest in the political scene in Singapore, returning several
              times to attend hearings of opposition politicians including Mr J B
              Jeyaretnam and Dr Chee Soon Juan.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              And most recently, the former
              Workers’ Party (WP) member, who ran as a candidate during the 1988 and
              1991 elections, was back in town for the defamation suit filed by
              Singapore’s Minister Mentor and Prime Minister against the Singapore
              Democratic Party (SDP) and two of its leaders.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              At the hearing last week, Mr
              Nair, 58, who sat in the public gallery for all three days, was
              overheard briefly exchanging heated words with a woman behind him, <span style="color: #ff0000;">whom
              he told to “shut up”.</span>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">He was also overheard
              remarking, loudly, to the person next to him — after SDP
              secretary-general Dr Chee made his closing submissions — that “it was
              like listening to Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela”. </span>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span></div>
              But then, Mr Nair went further — a step too far, in the eyes of the authorities.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The day following the
              conclusion of the hearing, the lawyer allegedly sent an email to the
              Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General, stating: “The judge Belinda
              Ang was throughout prostituting herself during the entire proceedings,
              by being nothing more than an employee of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his son
              and carrying out their orders.”
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              For that, he was charged in
              court yesterday with insulting a public servant, an offence which
              carries a $5,000 maximum fine or imprisonment of up to one year upon
              conviction.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Mr Nair, who is now an
              American citizen and specialises in immigration law, has launched other
              attacks on the judicial system before.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The 1991 contempt of court
              charges were brought against him after he criticised the system of
              promotion of judges in the subordinate courts. Besides the fine, he
              also had to pay the Singapore Government $13,000 in legal costs.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">The following year, the
              lawyer was suspended from practice for two years and ordered to pay
              costs after he sent two threatening letters to former Attorney General
              Tan Boon Teik. The letters were in relation to a Privy Council appeal
              case which involved then-WP leader Mr Jeyaretnam. </span>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              By then, Mr Nair had moved to the US and was not present for his hearing.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Since 2006, he has kept a blog
              with regular posts on Singapore politics. His last post on Saturday
              morning <span style="color: #ff0000;">– hours before his arrest at the hotel</span> he was staying in –
              contained strong words about the defamation hearing. He ended the post
              by taunting authorities.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “Mr Lee Kuan Yew, look here.
              I am now within your jurisdiction ... What are you going to do about
              it?” he wrote, and included the hotel’s address and his mobile phone
              number.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              No plea was taken yesterday
              from Mr Nair, who is represented by ex-WP member Chia Ti Lik. An
              American consul and numerous SDP members and supporters sat in for the
              hearing.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Judge Miranda Yeo acceded to
              the prosecution’s application to remand Mr Nair for one more week for
              further investigations on the current charge and <span style="color: #ff0000;">“other potential
              charges”. </span>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The case will be mentioned next Monday.</span></div>

              <blockquote>From the article, one thing is certain. This young man's entry into
                      politics, his joining a law firm, his being given law cases and
                      ultimately being appointed Minister for Law has all been orchestrated
                      and arranged by Professor Jayakumar the immediate past Minister for
                      Law, both Tamil Indians by the way.</blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>''The love story starts more than 2 decades ago when a young man walked
                      into Professor Jayakumar's constitutional law class at National
                      University of Singapore when the Professor immediately noticed; or
                      rather fell in love with the said young man. Nothing short of love at
                      first sight.<br> <br> The article claims that as soon as the said young
                      man, the present Minister for Law walked into his constitutional law
                      class, the Professor immediately knew that that this was the man, or
                      the chosen one.<br> <br> There was an unmistakable chemistry in the air.
                      Had the young man been a woman instead, it looks as if Jayakumar, the
                      Professor would have dropped everything and proposed on the spot!...</p>
              <p>Coming back to the intimate private tryst between the lovers Jayakumar
                      and S Shanmugam, in their meeting of love, it appears that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">young
                      man was wearing a hat and there was a ring in the private room and when
                      he was thus provoked with the question of politics, this boy Shanmugam
                      forthwith took off his hat </span>and gallantly threw it into the ring
                      aforementioned. Why he did what he did and did it mean anything, that
                      is throwing his hat into the ring, is a puzzle we will never know!''end of quote.</p>

              <p>''His main qualification from the beginning is complete loyalty to one
                  man, Lee Kuan Yew. Meaning exactly that. A complete and utter
                  subservience to him. And the willingness to carry out his any command,
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;">just as a dog</span> will faithfully carry out his master's orders.''</p>
              <blockquote>Despite all the worldly pleasures, it can only be said that Mr. K
                  Shanmugam lives a miserable life. He is not a free man. He is on Lee
                  Kuan Yew's<span style="color: #888888;"> short leash</span>. Dr. Chee Soon Juan on the other hand, is a
                  giant, lives as a free and happy man; a man respected not only by
                  Singaporeans but by politicians and people all over the world.</blockquote><blockquote>And during all these years as Member of Parliament, no Singaporeans has
                  any respect for him. None at all. Indeed they don’t even care who or
                  what he is. He merely goes about doing his job. His job includes
                  sitting at resident committee meetings and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the monthly meet the people
                  sessions</span></strong>, which he does mechanically.</blockquote>
              <p>My question is how Indian feels if he or she labelled as  a dog?</p>

              <h3>Exclusive Interview with Gopalan Nair in California</h3>

              <div class="itemtext">It
              was a cold morning. The whole San Francisco bay area was covered by
              dense fog, like a pall of gloom, as I was driving along the highway
              from San Jose to Fremont. Surprisingly the traffic was not as bad as
              what Shitty Times would like me to believe back home, even during such
              severe weather condition. Visibility was only less than 100 metres at
              times, but most American drivers were pretty patient and cutting lanes
              by signalling seemed to "work" in this part of the world. My mission
              was to pay homage to an old freedom fighter, Gopalan Nair, who had been
              persecuted and fined by the PAP system in the early 90s for saying the
              "wrong" thing. We connected before embarking on this USA trip and were
              given detailed directions on how to reach his office in Fremont.<br><br>The
              sky started to clear when I reached the destination. There was a nice
              public park right across this 2 storey office building in surburb
              settings. Greeneries, mountains and open space, all luxuries in our
              homeland, but seemed abundant in this part of California.<br><br>I was
              10 minutes early and Mr Nair was meeting a client in his office at that
              time. I looked around and had this strange feeling that I was
              transformed back home. The settings and office layout were so similar
              to those lawyers' offices in Singapore.<br><br>"You must be X," an old fatherly voice exclaimed from the background.<br><br>"Welcome
              to my humble office!" This 170cm, well built gentlemen in dark suit
              came forward to shake my hand and this was followed by an exchange of
              greetings. I was even more surprised to hear from someone who had been
              living in USA for the past 10 yrs to use typical Spore style
              ice-breakers like "I grew up in Somerset Rd Indian corners where the
              PUB building stands now" and "Tell me where you live in S'pore, X",
              etc. This place was certainly more like home than any yankee office.<br><br>So
              this set the tone for our two-hour conversation that morning. Among
              which were issues he raised during his campaign period in the 88 and<br><br>91 elections and the events following the court cases afterwards.<br><br>"It
              was a tough battle, not during elections, but the days after that,"
              said this old fighter who spoke with a commanding voice. He related
              with disappointment on how his friends deserted him, his law business
              in S'pore suffered and his dignity's being diminished.<br><br>"You know what?  I'm lucky," he said. "I have a very supportive wife!"<br><br>He
              recalled on how his family had to depend on his wife to bring food on
              the table during his days of selling Worker's Party's "Hammers" on the
              street to spread the words of democracy more than 10 yrs ago.<br><br>Without his wife's support, Nair said he would not have the stamina to continue his fight after the loss in 88 election.<br><br>But
              during the height of the 91 election, Nair mentioned his
              dissatisfaction of the lack of independence of the judicary system in
              S'pore during an election rally. The PAP government took offence on
              this remark and fined him $8000 for contempt and struck off his roll.<br><br>"I have only two choices at that time," sighed the old fighter who had<br><br>3 young toddlers at that time, "Either kow tow to PAP or find another place to make a living."<br><br>"The
              PAP wanted to cripple me, just like what they had done to my hero JBJ,"
              Nair said angrily. "But I'm determined not to let they enjoy seeing me
              &amp; my family suffered." Armed with a law degree, Nair knew that he
              was in a much better position than many of his comardes at that time to
              find greener pesture outside S'pore.<br><br>"I sold off everything and
              with $25,000, we came here, California," he tapped on his 2 metres long
              teak wood office desk. I then asked about why he chose America, instead
              of more popular Singaporean favourites like Australia, UK or New
              Zealand.<br><br>"Each place has its merits, but I believe California is
              a place where for most people, a dream would come true if you are
              willing to work hard, regardless of your background," said this lawyer.
              "But let me warn you... this is also a very cruel place where only the
              fittest survives."<br><br>This was followed by sharing of his
              experiences when he first stepped foot on this "Land of Opportunities",
              initial hiccups and how he slowly built up his business and eventually
              established himself in the local immigrant communities.<br><br>"You see
              those Vietnamese, Mexicans, Indians, Pakistanis, Chinese, Russians
              etc... Everywhere!" he pointed out from his office windows, which had a
              nice paranomic view of the neighbourhood. "And you know, most of them
              can't even speak good English and for many, none at all!"<br><br>"If that Vietnamese can own a petrol station right across the street,"<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">he said. "what is the problem of S'poreans who had such a good headstart and strong foundation in terms of English education?"</span></div>
              <div class="itemtext"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>(lion note:thanks to SG education lah.)</strong></em></span></span><br><br>He leant forward, pointing to his head slowly,"It's here!  Creative and independent thinking!"<br><br>Sensing
              that the California sunshine had cleared the morning dense fog and the
              sun was once again embracing the land, we decided to take a walk
              outside.<br><br>"I practically live in this office," Nair laughed. I
              was then being told that he had devoted most of his time in his work
              and once he had holidays, he would fly back to S'pore to see his family
              and old friends.<br><br>"I don't understand those S'poreans here, why
              subject yourselves to being monitored by PAP by joining those S'porean
              clubs in USA," he remarked. "You can always spend US$600 to go home as
              &amp; when you have time to eat your laksa and char kway teow," and he
              recalled an interesting encounter days ago on a heated exchange with
              the S'pore Consul General in San Francisco in one of those S'porean
              functions.<br><br>"Jai is a big disappointment," he shoke his head. "A
              shame for the PAP government to have such a representative in this
              land." Nair recalled how Jai-sohan, the Consul-General, took on him in
              a public debate because he raised an issue about overcoming that bad
              image of S'pore during the meeting.<br><br>According to Nair, Jai-sohan
              challenged him to talk about human rights issues of S'pore infront of
              many S'porean expatriates and Americans, probably thinking that Nair
              was just another overseas S'porean who cared nothing much about the
              political scene back home. That was a wrong move and as soon as Jai
              sensed his foolishness, he quickly wanted to call an end of the debate
              &amp; even claimed that Dr Chee Soon Juan "deserved all these" because
              "he broke the law" by asking that kind of question during election. It
              was a clear indication of the presence of PAP affiliation with such
              sensitive topics being discussed in PAP lingo at such event.<br><br>Noting
              that many Spore government missions of "persuading overseas S'poreans
              to return home" had been closed down recently, Nair pointed out that
              Sporean folks who wanted to escape that political stiffening place
              would never want to be subjected to another PAP brainwashing or
              organisation again. "Having people like Jai-sohan to do MARKETING is
              certainly a big turn off for many."<br><br>As we walked, Nair recounted
              his happy days of being a Worker's Party's member and the days of
              having the company of his old comrades.<br><br>He never failed to express his outmost respect for JBJ and great respect for LTK at every chance.<br><br>"Ben is a gentleman," sighed Nair. "He played by the dirty rules set out by PAP and I'm sure history would be kind to him."<br><br>Asked
              about if he still kept in contact with the present WP's leadership,
              Nair shook his head. "Many of those old guards are no more there, many
              many unsung heores like that bike shop owner in Toa Payoh and those
              ex-Barisan guys. They put their hearts and souls for the country. I
              respect them."<br><br>As for other oppositions, Nair seemed not to have much knowledge excpet CSJ.<br><br>"I
              went to CSJ's court hearings, you know?" he clunched his fist while we
              were walking along the busy street. "It's a total sham. How can the
              judge do such things to a guy who is not trained in law at all?"<br><br>We
              came to a restaurant in a Mall and Nair was stopped by one of his
              clients whose kid had run into legal problem. I excused myself and saw
              from a distance his client's eyes filled with tears while he's holding
              Nair's hands.<br><br>"You see, it's all about long term relationship
              and trust," said Nair as we sat down in a restaurant. "People know you
              can do the job and what is more satisfying than helping others while
              earning a living of being a lawyer at the same time?"<br><br>We had a
              decent lunch and as we ate, Nair never stopped asking about the current
              political and social situation in S'pore. He had a strong interest of
              his motherland and he also shared with me his impression on S'pore from
              afar.<br><br>Asked about what he felt about the future of S'pore.
              "S'poreans are going to be extinct," he sighed. "Somewhat like some
              middle east countries where only 10% of the populations are locals
              while 90% are made up with foreigners who are there to make a living."<br><br>Unfortunately, not many S'poreans can live like those oil shieks in the middle east.<br><br>"If
              you are not connected," said Nair, "Don't expect to live like what a
              normal American does." Nair pointed out that despite all odds against
              new immigrants, USA still attracted all the talents in the world while
              not many real talents wanted to take root in S'pore. "If these foreign
              talents see how S'pore government treat their own citizens, would they
              want to subject themselves and their children to the same?"<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nair
              further illustrated that point on how his clients, who were immigrants,
              had no problem amassing US$1-2 million in their working lifetime and
              will eventually retire happily in Asia, while many of S'pore lawyer
              friends were still barely surviving under the PAP system.</span><br><br>At the
              end of the two-hour session, I was able to get an insight into the
              man's political reasoning behind some of the current issues and
              understanding his post election endeavours from a veteran's viewpoint,
              something which Shitty Times can never provide.<br><br>Nair had been in
              USA for over ten years now. He remained a cheerful person full of
              humour at mid-50s. But somehow the sadness of not being able to fight
              for the underdogs back at home and lines of weariness from years of
              hardwork were beginning to show in his face.<br><br>Does it also mean
              that fighting against PAP is a deadend unless one is willing to play
              some nice guy opposition character in local politics?<br><br>But the
              saddest part is that the whole political process has resulted many
              ordinary "unconnected" Singaporeans only making a decent living outside
              his motherland. No one should be deprived of chances to develop his
              fullest potential at own country. Not if the PM says that every
              Singaporean matters.</div>

              <p><strong>Did Goplan Nair threaten Belinda Ang?<br> Posted by Charles on June 1, 2008</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to Channel News Asia, the Singapore police has
                              recently arrested a former Singaporean for sending ‘insulting
                              statements to a public servant’ to the Attorney General and the
                              Solicitor General. The allegedly offensive statement has also been
                              posted on his blog (Channel News Asia, 2008).</p>
              <p>A quick search online in Singapore Statutes throw up one
                              possible offense that the police might prosecute him under - The
                              Penal Code, Chapter 10 - Contempts of the Lawful Authority of
                              Public Servants - Section 189, ‘Threat of injury to a public
                              servant’ which states that:</p>
              <p>Whoever holds out any threat of injury to any public servant, or
                              to any person in whom he believes that public servant to be
                              interested, for the purpose of inducing that public servant to do
                              any act, or to forbear or delay to do any act, connected with the
                              exercise of the public functions of such public servant, shall be
                              punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years,
                              or with fine, or with both (Singapore Statutes, n.d.).</p>
              <p>In his latest post, ‘Singapore. Judge Belinda Ang’s Kangaroo
                              Court’, Nair claims that the court has been misappropriated for
                              political means (Nair 2008). However, any references to the judge,
                              Belinda Ang, cannot be deemed as threatening to the public servant.
                              For the purpose of a closer examination, we have reproduced any
                              references to Belinda Ang which was found in his blog posting:</p>
              <p>1. ‘your stooge of a judge, Belinda Ang’;<br> 2. ‘The judge Belinda Ang was throughout prostituting herself
                              during the entire proceedings, by being nothing more than an
                              employee of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew and his son and carrying out their
                              orders’;<br> 3. ‘right out of the pages of Alice in Wonderland with Belinda Ang
                              playing the role of the Queen of Hearts before the trial of the
                              Mouse who stole the Tarts very well indeed’;<br> 4. numerous references to her as the ‘kangaroo judge’;<br> 5. ‘and the judge obediently sustained the objection’;<br> 6. ‘ Of course the judge permitted these insults, since after all
                              Lee Kuan Yew and his son owned the courts and the judge as
                              well’;</p>
              <p>While it is true that in his posting, he accuses the court and
                              the judge of political persecution, sometimes using language that
                              might be deemed as offensive, there was no hint or openly declared
                              threat to cause any injury to the public servant. This is a clear
                              distinction that one should keep in mind.</p>
              <p>While it is true that he had openly declared his address, name
                              and laid down a challenge for the Senior Minister to serve him with
                              a writ of summons, there are still no plausible grounds for the
                              arrests.</p>
              <p>Given that the Singapore law society has recently announced its
                              intentions to lobby for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
                              to be incorporated into the law books, it should seek to represent
                              Mr Nair if the police decides to press ahead with charges. There is
                              no time to be lost given the authorities have said they will put
                              him on trial by Monday.</p>
