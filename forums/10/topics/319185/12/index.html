              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Internet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="color: #0066cc;">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>

              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>
              <blockquote>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Note the bad acting, where he pretended to be "excited" and "surprised" about what he wrote himself.</span></p>
              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny, frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked. Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>

              <p><strong><span>Can we arm it(1) with missiles or (2) to reduce the payload ,just attach explosives and Fantail just crash into the targets.?</span></strong></p>
              <p>I think it will be quite accurate fro it to hit GPMG site,APC,tanks etc</p>
              <p>2.Ok lah.Just crash Extender to a enemy fighter.Few thousand $$ can save SG soldiers life.It worth every single dollar!!</p>

              <p>If you want to avoid the issue at the very least don't try to post meaningless posts... it just shows that you lack intellectual intergity, or basic comprehension skills.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The question is do you think it's a good idea for the SAF to crash such things into people and equipment, something that you have been pushing for since this whole sorry thread started, a thread that no doubt exposed you lack of understanding on most things even most basic book camp.</p>

              <p>Is there any lionnoisy with the english skill that can finish this book? I dunt think so!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As to answer your question on if there's any other UAV with the size so small:</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>All smaller then Fantail.... and made by many other countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So please tooting our horn about Fantail, you are disgracing our country with your lack of understanding of even our OWN equipment.</p>

              <p>Following that post, lionnoisy quietly slipped out of the thread and left it entirely.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he learnt nothing from his experience only to start another thread that was just as disasterous:</p>
              <p>Australia are buying helicopter landing ships to launch F-18Es, which anybody with some basic knowledge of military stuff will know that is a very stupid idea.</p>
              <p>Amazingly, despite his ability to dig up all the "dirt" about Australia's military and comment as if he knows a lot about military stuff, this blatant fact is somewhat missed out on him:</p>

              <p>Despite everyone in the forum telling him that LHDs are not for launching F-18s, he insisted and kept on trying, coming up with crazier ideas:</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>The rebuttal:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:</span></p>
              <p>Everybody can see the ski ramp on board, but they are smart enough to know it's not for Superbug use.</p>
              <p>Man you really are that ignorant are you not?</p>
              <p>You enlarge also no use, you simply do not understand how things work at all.</p>
              <p>Ski jump or not, there is no way for the Superbug, or most non STOL combat planes for that matter, to reach their takeoff speed in that short a distance on an LHD. The Ski jump is to enable a better AOA when you clear the ship, but it had no effect on your takeoff speed... if you are too slow you'll simply stall the moment you leave the Ski jump and crash into the sea. Unfortunately the LHD (or any ship for that matter) lacks the required length for the Superbug (or any non STOL for that matter) to reach a viable speed to take off, Ski jump or not.</p>
              <p>What is required is a catapult, which of course this ship does not have.</p>
              <p>And of course landing is another issue without an angled deck, it means that it cannot retrieve aircraft without having to do a full deck turnover because to do an aborted landing would mean having the plane smack straight into whatever's parked in the way on the deck. So much for tactical flexibility.</p>
              <p>All this of course, is no surprise because the LHD was NEVER intended to launch non STOL aircraft.</p>
              <p>LOL, lionnoisy's notion of launching Superbugs from LHDs is prehaps akin to us launching recon bikes from within our Bionixes... or having Abrams tanks airdropped from C-130s <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> </p>
              <p>Fixed wing aircraft that would operate from the LHD would be STOL/VTOL examples such as the Harrier, or the JSF, but NOT the Superbug.</p>
              <p>What's next? lionnoisy is going to say the aussies are going to retrofit their superbugs to be VTOL aircraft? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Seriously lionnoisy, if we had people like you giving advice to our military, the SAF is totally doomed.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>And a very funny reply about why lionnoisy just can't seem to get it right:</p>

              <p>The DUH factor here is astounding.  Australia's waiting for the JSF, and ski ramps a la HMS Invincible have long been established for STOL aircraft.  Noisy Pussy's fucked it up once again - as if that's any surprise.</p>

              <p>And finally with the weight of the forumers and evidence stacked up against him, lionnoisy finally submits and runs away, never even speaking about the topic again:</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Not OK. You admit to having no information linking Superbugs to ski ramps but you carry on like a two-bob watch about this numbskulled idea.  Then you turn around and demand news about the first two LHDs being for V/STOLs.

              <div>
              <div>Abstract:</div>
              <div>A skate with inline wheels is disclosed that employs a lever (termed a mast) to provide the upright support and lateral control usually supplied by a stiff boot or shell. The lever doesn't trap heat and perspiration as will the boot or shell, particularly since these must be lined with heavy padding to provide a modicum of comfort.</div>
              <div>Moreover, unlike the skate boot, the mast may be folded back along the frame of the skate when not in use to enhance portability and minimize the need for storage space. Additionally, the various embodiments of the invention are easier to put on and take off than traditional designs. These features gain additional utility when considered in combination, which have the collective efficacy to usher the inline design into entirely new applications.</div>
              <div>The inventor considers that the impressive speed of inline skates generally, combined with the features disclosed herein, may someday cast this erstwhile toy and sports accessory into a new role as a practical transport machine.</div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Pl invent and apply patent or talk to MINDEF,DSTA,DSO,or IE Spore for appling patent.Good Luck!!</p>

                                      up and left for Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the UK and Sweden.

              <p>I remember one topic that lionnoisy kept dragging on and on until an Australian went into it and simply blew his arguments to pieces:</p>
              <p>The crux of lionnoisy's simplistic arguments in that case was that the Singapore Navy was superior because it had more ships then the Australian Navy and that the Australian Navy could not defend its coasts.</p>
              <p>Of course as usual he left out the fact that our navy combatants are mostly light craft while the Australian combatants are often up to four to five times as massive and packing more firepower and endurance to boot.</p>
              <p>But as usual he dragged on and on coming up with increasingly ridiculus ideas and name-calling and dismissal of the Australians until finally an Australian had to blast him:</p>
              <blockquote><span style="color: #888888;">Originally posted by Asian Aussie:</span>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hi, my first post here. This is a v interesting thread. I'm from Oz and I think I can clear up some issues.</p>
              <p>1. Lionnoisy is an idiot who's probably still in his teens and doesn't know anything military about from video games and the news. I'm impressed with SG Tyrannosaur's level of knowledge.</p>
              <p>2. The Collins Class SSK is noisy and has heaps of problems. In Oz, we prefer that the rest of the world thinks this is the case. ;) It gives us the element of surprise. Besides this point, it is the largest SSK in the world at over 3000 tons displacement with the same combat system as the Virginia SSN. It is armed with ADCAPS and is fitted for special forces. There is discussion of fitting Tomahawk capability.</p>
              <p>3. A smart country only spends what is neccessary for effective defence and not a penny more. A lot of teenage boys are obsessed with large military forces when clearly the country doesn't need it. For example Singapore doesn't need an aircraft carrier.</p>
              <p>4. Taking into account point 3, you can't compare SG's navy to Aust's navy. We're a blue water navy because we have to be with so much ocean. SG is a green or brown water navy because it only has to defend itself from Malaysia and Indonesia. There is no open ocean to consider.</p>
              <p>5. Lionnoisy claims that Australia has only 10 ships defending its borders. Have you heard of JORN? With JORN we don't need to have ships physically there for defence. We have electronic "eyes" scanning our borders all the way up to Singapore Harbour and possibly to Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>6. Apart from SE Asia, the corvette platform is a redundant platform. Outside SE Asia's islands, the corvette is ineffective. Australia chooses to have large ships instead of smaller ones like SG, even though SG may have a larger number of ships.</p>
              <p>7. Australia's future navy is looking very good and Lionnoisy should be aware of this since even the news is reporting it.</p>
              <p>2 LHD @ 27000 tons, 1 RoRo ship ( to be ordered by 2010), 3+1 Aegis Destroyers @ 6250 tons, 8 Anzac Frigates @ 3600 tons, 6 Minehunters, 6 Collins Class Subs, 14 Armidale Patrol Boats.</p>
              <p>SG has 6 Formidables? @ 3200 tons. Please lionnoisy, get a brain, SG navy more than kicks Malaysia's, but Australia is a Top 10-15 Navy.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>After that lionnoisy didn't dare to reply anymore.</p>
              <p>Imagine what lionnoisy is doing to the reputation of our country with his infantile behaviour to the point a person from Australia had to come to this forum, a Singaporean forum, to correct him.</p>
              <p>Seriously, I wonder if lionnoisy feels any shame.</p>

              <p>I remember that lionnoisy is always very into posting numbers and cutting and pasting, he even spent a lot of effort coming up with URD (Unit Ready Days) figures for the Australian Navy.</p>
              <p>So to reward him for his effort, we came up with something called the ERD for him, that is English Ready Days.. as you all know lionnoisy has shown a serious lack of basic logic and comprehension as well as the use of the English language in here:</p>

              <p>That is he believes in the supremacy of the SAF no matter what and the incompetency of the ADF, no matter what flaws and blunders the SAF makes and what achievements the ADF has. No matter what people who have served in the military and trained with the equipment tells him, he refuses to believe in anything other then his "side" of the coin, which does not exist to begin with.</p>

              <p>Also his reliance on the media and inability to make any sort of critical thinking shows that he quite truly suffers from the spotlight fallacy:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span>Spotlight fallacy</span></p>
              <p>The Spotlight fallacy is committed when a person uncritically assumes that all members or cases of a certain class or type are like those that receive the most attention or coverage in the media. This line of “reasoning” has the following form:</p>
              <p>1. Xs with quality Q receive a great deal of attention or coverage in the media. 2. Therefore all Xs have quality Q.</p>
              <p>This line of reasoning is fallacious since the mere fact that someone or something attracts the most attention or coverage in the media does not mean that it automatically represents the whole population. For example, suppose a mass murderer from Old Town, Maine, received a great deal of attention in the media. It would hardly follow that everyone from the town is a mass murderer.</p>
              <p>The Spotlight fallacy derives its name from the fact that receiving a great deal of attention or coverage is often referred to as being in the spotlight. It is similar to Hasty Generalization, Biased Sample and Misleading Vividness because the error being made involves generalizing about a population based on an inadequate or flawed sample. The Spotlight Fallacy is a very common fallacy. This fallacy most often occurs when people assume that those who receive the most media attention actually represent the groups they belong to. For example, some people began to believe that all those who oppose abortion are willing to gun down doctors in cold blood simply because those incidents received a great deal of media attention. Since the news media typically cover people or events that are unusual or exceptional, it is somewhat odd for people to believe that such people or events are representative.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong></strong></span> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>"No need to remind us how powerful of weapons</strong></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>in Oz Patrol Boats.But I pity the PB crews that they</strong></span></li>

              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>fight with Oz PB ?"</strong></span> </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Did I say that or did you invent it because you failed your english comprehension?</p>
              <p>Let me remind you then to exercise basic english comprehension.</p>
              <p>note a keyword:</p>
              <p>COIN</p>
              <p>TERROR</p>
              <p>This lionnoisy fantasy situtation of PVs going to face heavy naval combatants would only happen if the RAN had your kind of thinking, the same kind of thinking that have you wanting to launch F-18s off LHDs <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Unfortunately for you, the RAN has far more common sense meaning your point is invalid.</p>
              <p>The RAN PVs are dedicated to the role of facing the threat that hit the USS Cole, as well as other smaller threats on which a heavy surface combatant would be a waste of resources. The RAN is not going to use them to fight an heavy combatant just because they are in the navy.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>"which are on station in any day,happen</strong></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to be around ?What is the chance that the help can reach in ,say within 1 hour ?"</strong></span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Just because you use your limited command of the language and put words together does not mean your poorly-thought out fantasy scenarios are going to happen.</p>
              <p>You seem to have this fantasy that a fleet of multi thousand ton ships can just teleport out of nowhere across thousands of miles of ocean and surprise the Australian navy without getting picked up by radar or sonar or other forms of sensors when such a journey will take days and leave plentry of time to get detected and having actions taken by the right kind of naval unit long before they even come close to Australian waters. </p>
              <p>What that can suddenly happen anyday is the small, terror suicide boat that the PV is designed to handle that our current navy and coastguard cannot effectively, an Iowa class battleship is not going to "anyday, happen to be around". You might as well say 15,000 enemy tanks "anyday, happen to be around" Orchird road. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>This is not surprising given your inline skates, F-18s off LHDs and crashing Fantail ideas all defy good common sense.</p>
              <p>Going by your logic, you might as well say that our Primus is useless and has no role because it is totally defenceless if an MBT suddenly teleported next to it and the closest help is too far away.</p>
              <p>Going by your logic you might as well say we shouldn't have people doing guard duty because all they have is a SAR-21 and 5 rounds because what if a Gundam suddenly show up?</p>
              <p>Going by your logic, you might as well say we have to use Leopard 2s to do guard duty <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Your idea of a PV having to face an enemy fleet is pure fantasy. Such an action would be picked up days before they have even entered into Australian waters and dealt out with far out in the Ocean via the Collins or Frigates. In fact the things that do slip through and get close are those small terror/smuggler vessels that don't show up on radar until too late. This is what they have the PVs for.</p>
              <p>Unlike you, the RAN knows what unit to pit against what unit. The Fearless class PV with all the wrong weapons, as well as our short-ranged Police Coastguards armed with old 20mm cannons in a few ships and mainly GPMGs will be far less capable of in the COIN/terror ops as the modern, sea-state 5 capable, 25mm stabilized deck mounted autocannons.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>"pl be reminded that our Coast Guard just tasked to catch II</strong></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>,pirates,illegal fishing boats(SG have not claimed EEZ)etc</strong></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>. our terrority water just 3 nm...</strong></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SG CG IS NOT navy.They are not ,as their counter part in Oz,</strong></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>expected to fight with invading enemy navy."</strong></span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>So what? You think the terrorist suicide craft is going to care if your are Police Coast guard or not? Do you think they are going to surrender just because you have some WW1 20mm cannon and mostly GPMGs?</p>
              <p>Note that our vital installations like Jurong Island or Changi Naval base still have to be protected? By who? Our limited numbers of Fearless class that are not even suited for the role with the clunky weapons loadout? By our police coast guard who is armed just with manually operated WW1 20mm cannons and GPMGs?</p>
              <p>You seem to have this inability to use good common sense about anything, which is no surprise you think the RAN are going to make bad choices... because you think they have YOUR kind of ideas <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <ul>
              <li> "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Dunt mix up the role of Navy and CG!</strong></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It is becos OZ do not get CG!!</strong></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>THats why navy is tasked with CG jobs!!"</strong></span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>You are just playing on labels, nothing you said changes the fact that the Aussies still have a more capable COIN/terror platform then us. And nothing changes the fact that despite the lame idea you are trying to push on them, they're not going to use their PVs to fight heavy combatants, even if those fictional lionnoisy ships can cross thousands of miles of ocean in one hour without being detected and spring up beside a PV. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>And going by your label-playing logic, are you saying our Air Force is mixing up the roles because we use the RSAF to ferry our troops around while the US Army they have their own air wing to fly their troops in helicopters and let the USAF concentrate on the air war?</p>
              <p>Of course, going by your logic of needing to cover each and every 18,000 km of coastline then Australia needs somewhat like 300 ships daily patrolling it's water costing billions to operate, a force that can rival and exceed even the USN.</p>
              <p>LOL, you not only failed to comprehend that your arguments have been totally destroyed, but it seems your poor comprehension of my points have led you to make arguments that only backfired on yourself.</p>
              <p>Work on your ERD (English Ready Days) first before you make your next move <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <div id="articleBody" class="artText"><span> <span style="color: #666666;"><strong> Gopalan Nair accusedof having insultedJustice Lai two years ago </strong></span>
              <div> </div>
              <br>Leong Wee Keat 
              <br>weekeat@mediacorp.com.sg
              <div> .......</div>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              According to the charge filed
              in the Subrodinate Court yesterday, Nair had accused Justice Lai of
              having “no shame”. He also accused other judges of “selling their souls
              (and) their conscience for money”. He charged: “Your Singapore judges
              including Lai are corrupt judges.”
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              This offence allegedly took
              place while Justice Lai was sitting in a judicial proceeding. The High
              Court judge had sentenced Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) leader Chee
              Soon Juan to a one-day jail term and fined him for contempt of court,
              on the same day Nair had allegedly sent the email.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              This new charge was filed
              under the<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Penal Code.</span> The earlier charge, in which Nair is accused of
              insulting Justice Belinda Ang last month in the execution of her duty
              as a public servant, fell under the<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Miscellaneous Offences (Public
              Order and Nuisances Act). </span>Both carry a maximum punishment of a year’s
              jail and a fine of $5,000.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              ....And yesterday, Nair apologised for the impact his words might have had — but stood by his blog’s contents.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “It was never my intention to
              malignor cause distress to anyone and if thewords that I have used have
              this effect, I withdraw them and apologise. But as far as the contents
              of my blog go, as to the events that occurred in the three days of
              court, it is an accurate observation which I have stated under my
              rights as a free man,” he said during a 25-minute press conference at a
              coffeeshop at Peck Seah Street following his court appearance.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Nair said the incident involving the 2006 email was<span style="color: #ff0000;"> “too long ago” </span>and he <span style="color: #ff0000;">“probably did not send” it to Justice Lai. </span>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span></div>
              He also claimed he did not send any emails to Justice Ang or anyone else<span style="color: #ff0000;"> regarding last month’s incident. </span>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span></div>
              Law Minister K Shanmugam had earlier this month condemned attacks made on the Judiciary as “totally unacceptable”.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “To make sure that you protect
              the integrity of the Judiciary ... you have to be very, very strict
              about anyone who attacks the judiciary in scurrilous ways, or calls
              into question its independence,” he added.</span></div>

              <blockquote><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">''It was too long ago.It's impossible for me to really</span></em>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">say that I did or I did not send it.I probably did not send it.''</span></em></p>
              <p>.......</p>
              <p>Asked whether he was issuing a challenge to MM Lee to sue him</p>
              <p>when he gave the address of his hotel and his mobile telephone  no.</p>
              <p>in his 29 May blog post,Nair said he was ''just stating information''.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">2.Anyway ,his apology in the statement is not sincere.</span></em></p>
              <blockquote>It was never my intention to malign or cause distress to anyone and if the<br> words that I had used had this effect, I withdraw them and apologize.</blockquote>
              <p>Usually,in any statement of apology,u will see words like</p>
              <p>''I withdraw them unconditionally ,without any reservation''</p>
              <p>The statement seem  drafted by a lawyer in hurry</p>
              <p>3.Since SDP site is not always accessible,i post his statement here</p>
              <p>which i get fr SDP site on 12 June evening.</p>
              <p>He stands by his blogs.</p>
              <p>SG shall stand by her rights to defend her reputations in judiciary.</p>

                  Statement / 11 June 2008</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;">I am an American citizen and a
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;">Singaporean by birth </span>and have always been concerned about the welfare of
                  Singaporeans and Singapore.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;">I have been a Singapore
                  political opposition supporter and politician from 1980 to 1991, a member of
                  the Workers Party. I contested the 1988 and 1991 Singapore general elections
                  under the Workers Party ticket, the former in Tiong Bahru and the latter at
                  Bukit Merah.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;">I believe as a human being, it
                  is my right and my duty under the constitution of the Republic of Singapore and
                  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be able to speak free as a free
                  man and to state what I have seen and heard. This benefits Singaporeans and the
                  world at large. If I did not say what I saw, I would in fact be hiding the
                  truth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;">This is what I did. It was never
                  my intention to malign or cause distress to anyone and if the words that I had
                  used had this effect, I withdraw them and apologize. But as far as the contents
                  of my blog post; as to the events that occurred during the 3 days in court, it
                  is an accurate observation which I have stated under my right as a free man.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;">Even though I left for the
                  United States in 1991, I have throughout my stay in the US been closely
                  monitoring the political situation in Singapore and writing about it in my blog
                  the Singapore Dissident, even though as an American citizen, I could have, like
                  countless other overseas Singaporeans completely ignored Singapore.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;">As a blogger on human rights and
                  the rights of human beings around the world, my efforts are directed to the
                  plight of human beings who are denied their human rights and how I can expose
                  the injustices they suffer. Not only Singaporeans but also every human being is
                  my concern but as I am a Singaporean by birth, naturally I am more concerned
                  with the plight of Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;">Today, not only the West but
                  every country including ASEAN and Singapore is seen to move towards more human
                  rights, as seen by human rights issues becoming more prominent in ASEAN and
                  other Asian countries. This is evidenced by organs such as the Law Society of
                  Singapore, and other organizations becoming more concerned with human rights
                  affairs. The Law Society of Singapore has recently set up a human rights
                  committee confirming the great interest in this area.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;">In the US where I come from, the
                  judiciary just as any other government or official body is open to criticism
                  and they accept it as necessary for the advancement and improvement of the
                  administration of justice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;">My blog was written as a message
                  to the world about my views of matters of public interest. I have been accused
                  of sending Emails to Judge Belinda Ang and others but this is not true. I did
                  not at anytime send any Emails to Judge Belinda Ang or anyone else as far as
                  this incident is concerned. The police had seized my notebook containing my
                  Email password and my blog access.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;">In the Lee Kuan Yew vs. Dr. Chee
                  Soon Juan et al, case, the assessment of damages against Dr. Chee was going to be
                  heard between May 26 2008 to May 28 2008 in the High Court in Singapore, I made
                  arrangements to come to Singapore to attend the hearing. I am a Singapore
                  patriot at heart and whatever I have done and do as regards my activities
                  relating the future of Singapore is because I care for Singapore and Singaporeans.
                  I worry about the future of Singapore and Singaporeans and am always on the
                  lookout to see where and how I can be of assistance for the welfare and
                  interest of Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;">In Singapore I attended the said
                  hearing at the High Court as an observer in the gallery from May 26 2008 to May
                  28 2008 attending every hearing entirely.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;">During the High Court hearing, I
                  found Judge Belinda Ang to be completely unfair and prejudicial to the interests of
                  Dr. Chee, Chee Siok Chin and the SDP. Almost every question put by Dr. Chee,
                  Chee Siok Chin and Ravi on behalf of the SDP were disallowed and each and every question put up by the
                  lawyer for Lee Kuan Yew and his son were invariably allowed. Almost every objection
                  raised by the lawyer for Lee Kuan Yew was sustained, keeping in mind that the lawyer
                  for Lee Kuan Yew and son, objected to almost every question that Dr. Chee and
                  company raised.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;">To state plainly, Dr. Chee and
                  his company was denied the right to cross-examine the Plaintiffs in any meaningful
                  way. In fact we could go even further and say that he and Siok Chin were denied
                  the right to cross-examine Lee and Son almost entirely. In fact if Dr. Chee
                  managed to put any questions to Lee and Son, it was over the refusal of Judge
                  Belinda Ang to allow the questions, so much so that Judge Belinda Ang had to
                  repeatedly prevent Dr. Chee and Siok Chin from conducting any meaningful cross
                  examination.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;">My honest observation of the
                  entire 3 days left me in no doubt at all that this Judge was clearly unfair towards Dr. Chee
                  and Siok Chin and she did not appear to conduct herself as an impartial judge
                  in court sitting in judgment between the parties.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica;">Having seen this, there was a
                  compelling need for me to tell the world what I saw, and not publicizing this
                  would be denying the right of Singaporeans to know the truth of what happened in court during the 3
                  said days; and it was also necessary for me as a human being, to make it public and to
                  the world what this court actually was, since they would not have had the
                  luxury of being in court during the 3 days.</span></p>
