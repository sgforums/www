              <blockquote>Following the decision in <em>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc v Gutnick</em> (2003) Aust Torts Reports ¶81-682, Australian courts, at least, will
                  treat defamatory material on a server outside Australia as having been
                  published in Australia if it is downloaded or read by someone in
                  Australia. Under private international law, a plaintiff successful in
                  obtaining a judgment against, for example, an American defendant in an
                  Australian court may then enforce that judgment against a person
                  domiciled in the United States through the US legal system.</blockquote>

              <blockquote>
              <p>169 The appellant publishes for profit the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, a daily financial newspaper, and <em>Barron's</em>, a weekly magazine, which is also concerned with financial matters.  The edition of <em>Barron's </em>dated
                  Monday, 30 October 2000, but which was available publicly two days
                  earlier, contained an article by a journalist working for
                  the appellant, Bill Alpert, headed "Unholy Gains" and sub-headed "When
                  stock promoters cross paths with religious charities, investors
                  had best be on guard." A large photograph of the respondent appeared on
                  the first page of the magazine.</p>
              <p>The article, of about 7,000
                  words, also contained photographs of other persons including Mr Nachum
                  Goldberg. <em>Barron's</em> has a large circulation in the United States. Altogether, it was likely
                  that 305,563 copies of the magazine were sold. A small
                  number of them entered Australia, some of which were sold in Victoria. <em>Barron's</em> also put the article on the Internet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The relevant article appeared on
                  the appellant's website on 29 October 2000. Subscribers
                  who paid an annual fee were able to obtain access to that site at its
                  address wsj.com. The site had about 550,000 subscribers. The appellant
                  has an office that it calls a "corporate campus" in New Jersey where it
                  has a web server on which its website is stored. It was conceded by the
                  appellant that it could not identify the addresses of all of its
                  subscribers but that 1,700 or so of them
                  paid subscription fees by credit cards whose holders had Australian
                  addresses.</p>

              <p class="intro"><strong>AFTER
              succeeding in his latest defamation action against opposition
              politicians, former Singapore prime minister Lee Kuan Yew has turned
              his attention to a visiting US lawyer who has criticised Mr Lee on the
              internet.</strong></p>
              <p>The latest target is California lawyer
              Gopalan Nair, a former Singapore citizen, who dared Mr Lee to take
              action over a critical posting on his internet blog.</p>
              <p>Soon after the posting appeared, Mr Nair was arrested and held in solitary confinement for several days.</p>
              <p>Although a US citizen since 2005, Mr Nair was in Singapore to
              observe Mr Lee's defamation action against Chee Soon Juan, who heads
              the opposition Singapore Democratic Party.</p>
              <p>The final posting on his blog before his arrest.</p>
              <p>Mr Nair was arrested on May 31 and, on June 2, he was charged with
              insulting Judge Belinda Ang, who was presiding at the Chee trial.</p>
              <p>He was released on June 5 and charged on June 12 with insulting another judge over an incident that took place in 2006.</p>
              <p>When he was in prison Mr Nair was kept in a cell that was illuminated around the clock.</p>
              <p>He had no bedding and had to sleep on the ground.</p>
              <p>Mr Nair's case is due to go to trial this month.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee has been released from prison after serving 11 days for scandalising the court during his cross-examination of Mr Lee.</p>
              <p>The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists has issued a statement expressing its concern over Mr Nair's treatment.</p>
              <p>"Singapore's detention of Gopalan Nair for public comments about
              such a highly politicised case is completely unwarranted," the
              committee's Asia program co-ordinator Bob Dietz said.</p>
              <p>"Freedom to criticise the judiciary is fundamental to a modern society.</p>
              <p>"This case illustrates the Singapore Government's ongoing commitment to silencing opposition voices both in print and online.</p>
              <p>In the Chee case, which is at the centre of the affair, Dr Chee
              personally cross-examined Mr Lee about the Singapore Government's use
              of defamation law to silence its critics.</p>
              <p>Under cross-examination, Mr Lee said: "There are various parts of
              this Government which do not comply with Western practices, including
              the law of libel.</p>
              <p>"But it is a system that has worked."</p>
              <p>Mr Lee noted also that the International Bar Association had
              "honoured" Singapore by holding its annual conference there last year.</p>
              <p>The association president had said "how impressed they were by the
              standards they found to obtain in the judiciary", Mr Lee said.</p>
              <p>Before moving to the US, Mr Nair had been an active member of the
              Singapore Workers Party and had been found guilty of contempt of court
              over a 1991 political speech.</p>
              <p>According to his blog, Mr Nair completed his legal education in Britain and practised for 10 years in Singapore.</p>
              <p>He stood for election in 1988 and 1991 but he claims he was harassed and persecuted for his beliefs.</p>
              <p>He is admitted to the California Bar and practises in the city of Fremont near San Francisco.</p>

              <h2>Bloggers in Singapore</h2>
              <p>SIR – Contrary to your article about politics on the web, no
              bloggers have been jailed in Singapore for “posting materials that
              those in power dislike” (“<a href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11622401">Blog standard</a>”,
              June 28th). There is no such offence under Singaporean law and many
              websites post highly critical views of the government. However, two
              bloggers have been jailed and another put on probation for posting
              virulently racist remarks that could damage racial harmony. Singapore
              is a multiracial, multireligious society, yet its threshold as to what
              is objectionable in such matters is higher than in some European
              countries, which make it an offence to deny the Holocaust.</p>
              <p>Another blogger currently faces charges for writing that a female
              High Court judge had “<span style="color: #ff0000;">prostituted” </span>herself in a case that she was
              trying. Unless we uphold the standing and reputation of the judiciary,
              there is no basis for the freedoms that citizens expect, either on the
              internet or in the real world.</p>

              <h1>UK businessman wins Facebook libel case</h1>
              <p class="published">Posted <span class="timestamp">2 hours 37 minutes ago</span></p>
              <p class="first">A British businessman has won a libel case and 22,000
              pounds in damages at London's High Court after false claims about him
              were posted on the hugely popular social networking website Facebook.</p>
              <p>In a test case, Matthew Firsht sued a former school friend over a
              false personal profile on the site that included private information
              about him and untrue allegations about his sexual orientation.</p>
              <p>Mr Firsht said freelance cameraman Grant Raphael had put up the
              information on Facebook, which has about 90 million members worldwide,
              under the heading "Has Matthew Firsht lied to you?".</p>
              <p>The Facebook entry alleged that Mr Firsht was signed up to other
              groups, including "Gay in the Wood...Borehamwood" and "Gay Jews in
              London".</p>
              <p>The profiles remained on the site for 16 days until they were spotted by Mr Firsht's brother and removed.</p>
              <p>Raphael had claimed that the profile was created on a computer at
              his home without his knowledge by someone who had attended a private
              party there.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But that was dismissed by Deputy Judge Richard Parkes who awarded Mr
              Firsht 15,000 pounds and his television company Applause Store
              Productions 5,000 pounds in libel damages.</span></p>
              <p>Mr Firsht was also awarded 2,000 pounds for breach of his privacy.</p>
              <p>In a hearing earlier this month Mr Firsht's lawyer Lorna Skinner
              said "Facebook enthusiast" Raphael had borne a grudge since the two men
              fell out in 2000.</p>
              <p>She said he had created the false entry to cause Mr Firsht anxiety and embarrassment.</p>

              <p class="title">Jeffry J. Andresen, M.D.</p>
              <p class="body">SOME PEOPLE TALK TO THEMSELVES. They speak aloud but address their words to no one around them. This habit, psychoanalytic investigation reveals, can be highly pleasurable. But, conversely, the habit is also somewhat notorious, for many jokes make talking to oneself the cardinal sign of mental illness.</p>
              <p class="body">This phenomenon of pleasurable talking to oneself deserves investigation, and I have assembled evidence bearing on the matter, evidence drawn from the treatments of five patients. Four were analysands, all with a capacity for triadic love relations. The remaining patient was less mature. The sample is, then, a limited one, for it does not include people who have never been patients, people of foreign cultures, or people who are psychotic. The sample is limited in another respect in that it does not include examples of all forms that talking to oneself can take. It does not include, for example, instances when such talks are unpleasurable or when solitary speaking is actual.</p>

Muttering to oneself for one or 2 days may not be pathological. If somebody laughs without any reason when alone or talking with himself for a prolonged period, along with other behavioral abnormalities like hallucination, social withdrawal, emotional upsets, odd behavior, etc. the person needs immediate psychiatric consultation. <br><br>Hallucination is a false perception in any of the five sensory modalities when no external stimulus exists, as when a nonexistent object is seen. Hallucinations may occur in the twilight state between sleeping and awakening, or in delirium, delirium tremens, or exhaustion; they also may be induced under hypnosis. The visual sense is most often affected. Persistent hallucinations are characteristic of schizophrenia. In one type of schizophrenia, victims believe that they hear accusing or commanding voices, to which they may react in panic, with abject obedience, or with attempts at self-protection or even suicide. Hallucination is distinguished from illusion, a false perception of an actual stimulus, and is common following self-administration of certain <a class="link" title="drugs" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/theme/1494/drugs.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">drugs</span></span></a> such as mescaline, marijuana, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).

                  the government is feeling insecure that Malays are having more
                  children. This Chinese dominated government of Singapore, feels that if
                  the Malays become the majority, the Chinese would be relegated to their
                  inferior positions as in Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>

              <blockquote>Dr. Chee and his supporters have staged protests. For that he has been
              arrested and imprisoned. But at the same time, you can see that Lee is
              hesitating. They are no longer so confident. Dr. Chee could have been
              given a long jail term for deliberately telling Judge <span class="__mozilla-findbar-search" style="padding: 0pt; background-color: yellow; color: black; display: inline; font-size: inherit;">Lai</span> Siew Chew<span style="color: #ff0000;">(lion note: i think Nair means Lai Siu Chiu)</span>, in open court, in full view that she is corrupt.
              Surprisingly Dr. Chee's sentence was unbelievably lenient. A small
              fine, in default a week in jail. A very lenient sentence for a serious
              contempt. The people know the truth. There is no avoiding it. Is that
              the reason for the leniency?. Lee is beginning to look silly.</blockquote><blockquote>
              <p>Dr. Chee and his supporters should not let up on the protests. Do it
              repeatedly. Challenge them to arrest you repeatedly. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Send you to jail
              repeatedly.</span> They will soon realize that their punishments are not
              having the desired effect. With world and public opinion squarely
              against them, they will have to come down from their high horse.</p>
