              <blockquote>Let me explain with a few examples without identifying individuals in
              some cases. One individual at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">official Assignee's Office</span> deals with
              Dr. Chee Soon Juan's bankruptcy, individual <span style="color: #ff0000;">"A"</span>. That individual is a
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">government employee</span>. I had pointed out to that individual, that even
              though the Government has asked A to demand that Dr. Chee pay Lee Kuan
              Yew large sums of money in court judgements, A should know that the
              judgment itself against Dr. Chee was clearly unjust, being politically
              motivated, and therefore A should refuse to do the dirty work of Lee
              Kuan Yew, and refuse to persecute Dr. Chee. I had informed A that there
              were various other <span style="color: #ff0000;">honorable ways to make a living </span>and that A should
              not <span style="color: #ff0000;">prostitute </span>himself or herself by acting as a PAP politician. My
              entreaties to A has fallen on deaf ears. "A" continues to<span style="color: #ff0000;"> punish</span> an
              innocent Dr. Chee knowing he did no wrong.</blockquote>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Dear Mr. Jeyaretnam,</p>
              <p>I agree with your press release of March 23, 2005, “Lee Hsien Loong’s Fairy Tales.</p>
              <p>Take real cases. I practiced law in Singapore for 11 years. Let me
              tell you what I know. Take <span style="color: #ff0000;">Davinder Singh of Drew and Napier.</span> He is
              praised as one of the best lawyers in Singapore. Personally I do not
              see anything special in him. There are lawyers much more capable, and
              especially much more experienced than him. Yet the government makes him
              a Senior Counsel, Drew and Napier makes him their Chief Executive
              Officer and he gets all the big government cases. He does pretty well.</p>
              <p>March 27th, 2005 </p>
              <p>He has one quality that others may not have. He is a card carrying
              member of the Peoples Action Party, a PAP Member of Parliament, and has
              absolute unshakeable loyalty to Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, his son and the PAP.
              Singh knows this, the legal fraternity knows this and everyone in
              Singapore knows this. In any other free country, a self respecting
              individual would be ashamed of receiving special treatment not because
              of his ability but because of his connections. I have seen Singh at the
              trial of Dr. Chee soon Juan in November last. He did not seem to be at
              the least bothered. I suppose, if Lee asked him to jump, he would ask
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">“how high”?</span></p>

              <p>SINGAPORE--A
              US-based blogger accused of calling Singapore judges "corrupt" could
              face up to a year in jail, according to charges filed on Thursday.</p>
              <p>It was the second charge filed this month against Gopalan Nair, a
              former Singaporean lawyer who is now a US citizen, for his alleged
              comments about the judiciary.</p>
              <p>Nair, 58, was in court to hear the latest allegation against him. He
              is charged with insulting Supreme Court Justice Lai Siu Chiu in an
              e-mail on March 17, 2006.</p>
              <p>The e-mail said Lai has "no shame" and that judges "are selling
              their souls and their conscience for money," according to a court
              document.</p>
              <p>"Your Singapore judges, including Lai, are corrupt judges," the document cited his e-mail as saying.</p>
              <p>Lai had sentenced opposition party leader Chee Soon Juan to a
              one-day jail term and fined him for contempt of court on the date Nair
              allegedly sent the e-mail.</p>
              <p>Nair, who has not yet entered a plea in court and is free on bail, was to hold a press conference later Thursday.</p>
              <p>Earlier this month he was charged with insulting another judge,
              Justice Belinda Ang Saw Ean, over comments his lawyer said repeated
              those made in a blog about a defamation case filed by Singapore's
              leaders against Chee and his party.</p>
              <p>In the blog, Nair strongly criticized a legal hearing at which
              Singapore founding father Lee Kuan Yew and his son, Prime Minister Lee
              Hsien Loong, testified.</p>
              <p>Court documents allege he sent an e-mail accusing the judge of
              "prostituting herself during the entire proceedings, by being nothing
              more than an employee of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew and his son and carrying out
              their orders."</p>
              <p>Singapore's legal system has been praised by foreign investors for its efficiency.</p>
              <p>The latest charge against Nair carries a maximum fine of S$5,000 dollars (US$3,623), or one year in prison, or both.</p>

              answer. Lee has placed obstacles to every avenue for change through the
              ballot box. The system has to be forced to change through
              non-conventional means, through non-cooperation, through telling the
              government that their laws are morally repugnant and we will not obey
              them.</blockquote><blockquote>Again, Jeyaretnam, in 1974 was best suited to fight Lee in an
              unconventional sense. Both his children were grown and self sufficient.
              His wife was dead. There was nothing for him to lose. One word from
              him, and the Barisan Socialis component of the Workers Party would have
              mobilised and set up pickets on the main road. Just the thought of the
              possibility existing then, makes me excited.<br> <br> Alas, now the
              people of Singapore have gone into a state of inertia through long
              period of indoctrination and subjugation. They have become almost
              inanimate, humorless lifeless automatons, who will function at the
              press of a button. It is more difficult now to galvanize a movement.<br> <br> But
              still I think it is possible. Dr. Chee should continue organizing
              protests and civil disobedience. With time more will come. And if
              Jeyaretnam can read this, I wish him well and if he is up to it, with
              his age, it would be great public service if he could join Dr. Chee and
              guide and advise him and join the protests<br> <br> Gopalan Nair<br> 39737 Paseo Padre Parkway, Suite A1<br> Fremont, CA 94538,<br> USA</blockquote>

              <p><span class="postbody">Li Ao is right, Singaporeans are without spine
              and civic-mindedness allowing the government to ride roughshod over
              them for years without remedy.
              <br> <br> Yet without civic-mindedness and love of freedoms or human rights do Singaporeans have a brighter future?
              <br> <br> Here is a simple test of Singaporeans' level of community spirit or civic-mindedness:-
              <br> <br> (1) JBJ's speaking up on Government's wrongfulness - what do Singaporeans do. Have they given any support to JBJ?
              <br> <br>(2) Tang Liang Hong, a well-known professional standing for
              election at Cheng San - why can't he speak on government wrongful
              policies. Just because he said he has made a police report against
              leaders he was sued for defamation by innuendos or "implied" defamatory
              statement made in the course of election campaign. Are Singaporeans
              able to discern this kind of behavior amounts to bullying of active
              citizens. Have we heard of any citizens telling off their MPs for such
              fixing of opposition politicians.
              <br> <br>(3) CSJ speaking up on issues and problems getting sued for such
              actions - any citizens condemning fixing of our political freedom
              fighers.
              <br> <br>(4) Gopalan Nair fearless fighting for citizens' rights and
              freedoms - any citizens speaking to their MPs or Ministers to stop such
              non-sense of fixing the patriotic citizens or ex-citizens of his
              courage to help bring justice and equity in our courts.
              <br> <br>Think, citizens !!! Do you have the courage to bring up such
              matters to your MPs and Ministers. What is your views on such bullying
              attitude and behavior among our leaders? Is that attitude going to help
              us to build a better and more cooperative society which we are living
              in ? How many Gopalan Nair can you or your children produce to help you
              ? If you do not have then when there is one Gopalan, what do you do if
              such fixing still continues in the hypocrisy of law and order or
              integrity of the court. <br> <br> No wonder the citizens are facing rising costs of living and losing
              their CPF withdrawal at age 55 due to use of power one time after
              another without check by any one.
              <br> <br>No wonder even if we have all the surpluses there will be increases
              of fees, charges and GST only to be lost unaccountably in some shin
              corp deals disapproved by the people.</span></p>

              <p>i support Gopalan Nair for what he dare to do and criticise. i believe that singapore court though not corrupted by monetary sense are in a way biased towards the ruling regime.</p>
              <p>what why the elite who dare to voice out or criticse the ruling regime are often prosecuted severely to sent out a stern warning to all elite class of singaporean to stay out of sg politics.</p>
              <p>a country without the citizens participation in politics is indeed souless and will eventually lead time to corruption, and downfall of a country, which the ppl will suffer the most.</p>

              <p>The question is do you think it's a good idea for the SAF to crash such things into people and equipment, something that you have been pushing for since this whole sorry thread started, a thread that no doubt exposed you lack of understanding on most things even most basic book camp.</p>

              <p>Amazingly, despite his ability to dig up all the "dirt" about Australia's military and comment as if he knows a lot about military stuff, this blatant fact is somewhat missed out on him:</p>

              <p>1.I must admit i have not get confirmation that the</p>
              <p>ski--jumping board is for Super Hornet only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i can sure the board must be for CV aircraft.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can JSF take off and land in this mini CV??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.Then,can Super Hornets take off and land in this mini</p>
              <p>CV?</p>

              <p>The rebuttal:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:</span></p>
              <p>Everybody can see the ski ramp on board, but they are smart enough to know it's not for Superbug use.</p>
              <p>Man you really are that ignorant are you not?</p>
              <p>You enlarge also no use, you simply do not understand how things work at all.</p>
              <p>Ski jump or not, there is no way for the Superbug, or most non STOL combat planes for that matter, to reach their takeoff speed in that short a distance on an LHD. The Ski jump is to enable a better AOA when you clear the ship, but it had no effect on your takeoff speed... if you are too slow you'll simply stall the moment you leave the Ski jump and crash into the sea. Unfortunately the LHD (or any ship for that matter) lacks the required length for the Superbug (or any non STOL for that matter) to reach a viable speed to take off, Ski jump or not.</p>
              <p>What is required is a catapult, which of course this ship does not have.</p>
              <p>And of course landing is another issue without an angled deck, it means that it cannot retrieve aircraft without having to do a full deck turnover because to do an aborted landing would mean having the plane smack straight into whatever's parked in the way on the deck. So much for tactical flexibility.</p>
              <p>All this of course, is no surprise because the LHD was NEVER intended to launch non STOL aircraft.</p>
              <p>LOL, lionnoisy's notion of launching Superbugs from LHDs is prehaps akin to us launching recon bikes from within our Bionixes... or having Abrams tanks airdropped from C-130s <img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> </p>
              <p>Fixed wing aircraft that would operate from the LHD would be STOL/VTOL examples such as the Harrier, or the JSF, but NOT the Superbug.</p>
              <p>What's next? lionnoisy is going to say the aussies are going to retrofit their superbugs to be VTOL aircraft? <img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Seriously lionnoisy, if we had people like you giving advice to our military, the SAF is totally doomed.</p>

              <p>And a very funny reply about why lionnoisy just can't seem to get it right:</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Not OK. You admit to having no information linking Superbugs to ski ramps but you carry on like a two-bob watch about this numbskulled idea.  Then you turn around and demand news about the first two LHDs being for V/STOLs. I said it before, I'll say it again - <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>HYPOCRITE</strong></em></span></span>.</span></span></p>
              <p>Do you see the USMC building a ski ramp and launching their Bugs off the Tarawa?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The rebuttal:</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>It is apparent that you have no experience whatsoever in any kind of infantry tatics, much less that of the SAF, not to mention another case of you bending reality to fit your own expectations.</p>
              <p>Have you even trained with the SAR before in real life infantry combat situtations? Obviously not, I have.</p>
              <p>If you need to clear 50 meters of open ground under heavy fire with no cover, it does not matter how you run, you will almost certainly get gunned down for sure... in fact it's probably only a mission you would go on, smarter grunts have other ideas to do so.</p>
              <p>Secondly, any soldier who has sprinted with a rifle can tell you that the best method to sprint with it is to hold it close to your body with TWO HANDS, and run in low profile. Keeping the weight of the rifle close to your body makes it easier to run with.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, holding 4 kilos of rifle in one hand like a shopping bag is one of the WORST ways to carry it while running. You have the full weight of the weapon away from your own center of gravity as well as unbalanced on one side (due to a the single hand carry).</p>
              <p>In other words, you do not RUN slower with two hands, but instead carrying the rifle by the handle single handed is prehaps the worst method to run with it.</p>
              <p>If you note, just watch the videos in iraq of grunts sprinting for cover while under fire. See any of them holding their M-16s by the handle?</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: Former Singaporean lawyer and ex—Workers’ Party election
              candidate, Gopalan Nair, is facing another charge of insulting a High
              Court judge.</p>
              <p>On Thursday morning, the court heard that Nair, now a US citizen,
              had on 17 March 2006 insulted Justice Lai Siu Chiu in an email while
              the judge was hearing an Originating Summons case.</p>
              <p>Nair’s lawyer
              Chia Ti Lik told the court that his client may take a certain cause of
              action and so the case has been adjourned to Monday for a further
              mention in the Subordinate Courts.</p>
              <p>Nair has been released on bail.</p>
              <p>If found guilty of the offence, Nair could be jailed up to a year or fined up to S$5,000, or face both jail and fine.</p>
              <p>Earlier this month, Nair was charged with insulting a public servant, Justice Belinda Ang. — CNA/so</p>

              <div class="post-body entry-content">Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>After
              I had posted the blogpost of May 29, 2008, at about 9 pm, May 31, 2008,
              I was arrested by at least 5 plain clothes policemen including at least
              2 women. I had just promised Mr. Gandhi Ambalam, Chairman of the
              Singapore Democrat Party and Mr. Jeffrey George, committee member of
              the same that I will join them for a drink at a nearby coffee shop. I
              was appropriately dressed in shorts, T-shirt and slippers, not to
              offend the Singapore heat and humidity. I entered the elevator on the
              8th floor of the hotel and descended to the 1st. When the door opened
              the aforementioned police were there blocking my way. Among them was
              Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Mr. Razak Jakaria, from the
              Cantonment Police Station, the police station in charge of my arrest.<br><br>At
              the ground floor when the elevator opened with me inside, the said
              police blocked my way. They showed their police identification.
              Forcibly restrained me inside the elevator. Handcuffed me while they
              took me back to the 8th floor into room 708.<br><br>Inside my hotel
              room, while I was in handcuffs, ASP Jakaria produced a warrant for my
              arrest. He stated that I was arrested under some section of the
              Singapore statutes. He refused to state what I was being arrested for.
              This procedure seems highly improper. Telling a citizen that he was
              being arrested under Section 200 or 2000 of the Penal Code without
              telling him what that meant is totally ridiculous! Did they expect
              every citizen to have studied Singapore law and the provisions of the
              Penal Code! Yet that is exactly what is done in a case where the
              accused is merely told of a particular section of the Penal Code!
              Despite my asking what I was being arrested for, I was not told what it
              was. Jakaria's answer was that he would tell me later. This was no help
              at all!<br><br>I was driven to Cantonment Police Station in a police
              car. ASP Jakaria was seated next to driver's seat. Next to me was a
              Chinese policeman. I was in handcuffs.<br><br>At the police station,
              there were usual procedures of taking account of my belongings and
              storing them. I was ordered to change into prison clothes and taken in
              handcuffs to a cell. From that moment I was kept in solitary
              confinement alone in a cell. The light was kept on 24 hours. There was
              no bed or even a mattress on the floor. I had to sleep on a hard floor.
              Although it can become cold there was no blanket. Unable to withstand
              the cold, I began shivering uncontrollably. I asked for a blanket from
              a passing guard. He provided it. This was on the 3rd or the 4th day of
              my confinement. Truly, it was not a blanket at all. It was a thin
              plastic sheet, which was not even long enough even to cover your feet.
              It did not keep you warm. But anything was better than shivering.<br><br>As
              the floor was solid hard, I could not sleep. Each time I had to toss
              and turn after a few minutes because it hurt. The light being on 24
              hours, you did know it was day or night. Being kept alone in solitary
              confinement did not help either.<br><br>I was kept in this manner from May 31 2008. Since it was a weekend, I had to be kept till Monday morning to be brought to court.<br><br>I
              was kept in this manner till June 5th 2008. Between this period I was
              taken for interrogation many times on different days before ASP
              Jakaria. The interrogation was held in interview rooms. Each time I was
              walked in handcuffs from my cell to the interview room.<br><br>I was
              told that I was being charged for various offenses during this period
              at various different times. It was as if the police were at a loss what
              to do. First it was a charge that I had sent an insulting Email to
              Judge Belinda Ang. Later I was accused of insulting Judge Belinda Ang
              through my blog post. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Later I was told that the earlier charges were
              dropped and I was charged under the Sedition Act of Singapore because
              of my blog. Later an additional charge that I had sent an Email to
              Judge Lai Sui Chue in March of 2006 more than 2 years ago.</span><br><br>As
              far as the accusation that I had sent an Email to Judge Belinda Ang;
              this is entirely untrue. I never sent any Emails to Ang or anyone else.
              All I did was to post my blog post. There were no Emails at all. The
              police had seized my documents and belongings from my hotel room. Among
              the items seized was an old blue tattered notebook. This is not a
              computer, which has been wrongly described as one in the papers. It was
              a tattered old notebook. In it there was my password for my Email and
              other personal numbers.<br><br>As far as the Email to Judge Lai Sui
              Chu, this was more than 2 years ago. I cannot remember if I sent that
              Email. Even if I did, I was not in Singapore at the time. I was
              physically in Fremont, Northern California. <span style="color: #ff0000;">If I sent the Email, it was
              from Fremont Northern California</span>. From 2006 March to present I had
              traveled to Singapore on at least one occasion on November 2006 without
              incident. It is odd that they want to proceed on a matter that I did or
              did not do more than 2 years ago! If indeed anyone had been insulted,
              it was more than 2 years ago, for Heavens Sake! Even if there was
              insult, which is denied, surely anyone would have got over the insult
              by now, unless of course they are afflicted with incurably delicate
              nerves!<br><br>On Monday June 2nd, 2008, I was brought to court in
              handcuffs in a police car. I have not been officially charged with
              anything in court. The prosecution requested and was allowed to keep me
              in custody for a further one week. I was taken back to solitary
              confinement in Cantonment Police Station.<br><br>I was suddenly told
              without prior warning that I was going to be released from custody
              prematurely on June 5th 2008 on bail while the police continued with
              their investigations. Bail was fixed at fixed at $5000.00 for the
              accusation that I had sent an Email to Judge Belinda Ang. As there was
              another charge being tendered for the accusation that I sent Judge Lai
              an Email more than 2 years ago, I was ordered to appear before Court 26
              on Monday June 09, 2008, another court, in the Court complex for the
              matter to be looked into.<br><br>On June 09, 2008 this other charge, being the over 2 years old accusation, was looked into. I was again given bail of $5,000.00.<br><br>For both cases I have been bailed out. I am presently out on bail.<br><br>The
              police had impounded my passport and I cannot travel. I am forced to
              remain in Singapore during these proceedings. I had originally intended
              to return to the US no later than June 3 2008, having arrived in
              Singapore on early morning May 26, 2008. Forcing me to remain in
              Singapore and being unable to return to the US is by itself causing me
              untold harm. My law practice in the US is suffering and various other
              matters such as my house mortgage cannot be attended to. This alone is
              causing extreme hardship to me.<br><br>Furthermore I am facing severe financial hardship in having to remain in Singapore much longer than expected.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">The
              American Embassy,</span> Singapore has been monitoring my case. I am grateful
              to Miss Julie Kavanagh, Consul and recently Mr. Learned Dees, Vice
              Consul together with another officer from the Embassy who have been
              taking special interest in my case. They have always been present at
              all my court hearings making it known to the Singapore court that they
              are watching.<br><br>This whole matter boils down to one question. A
              right to free speech and expression. It appears to me as well as anyone
              watching this case that what the Singapore authorities are trying to
              say is this. Do not criticize the Singapore judiciary no matter what.
              Even if the Singapore judiciary were to say, two and two is ten, the
              Moon is made of cheese and Christmas Day does not fall on December
              25th, we have to keep our mouths shut and go about our business as if
              nothing happened! What the Singapore authorities are trying to say, if
              I correctly understand it, is that human beings are disallowed from
              criticizing the judiciary, period! They are above criticism. They are
              beyond question. They are invincible. Infallible. They are the best,
              and need no criticism from mortal human beings! That they are Gods.<br><br>I,
              as a human being cannot understand this to be correct, surely. I was
              born a Singaporean. I lived my life here in Singapore. I am a former
              Singapore politician. The welfare of Singapore and Singaporeans should
              be more my concern than that of Central West Africa! Surely. Criticism
              is necessary for any organization to improve, to get better. Without
              criticism, there is stagnation. And with stagnation there is no hope.
              This has always been the case. What I had done and said was for the
              welfare of Singapore, a country that I care for and a country in which
              I have a stake, even if I am now an American.<br><br>Forcing me to
              remain in Singapore for a long period is no doubt causing me great
              hardship. Of course I also worry as to what is in store for me at the
              end of the court hearing.<br><br>But one thing is certain. Regardless
              of what I have to suffer, I will not admit to anything I did not do. I
              have a right to free speech and expression and I had exercised that
              right as a free man; as a human being. If have to pay a price for what
              I had said in my blog, so be it.<br><br>The Singapore government would
              be better off if they faced reality. In this day and age, and in a
              country such as Singapore with an educated population, demanding that
              citizens keep their mouths shut and comply as obedient sheep is not
              only untenable, it is counter productive. I have said this many times
              before, and it has to be said again. You cannot expect to become a
              first world country by forcing people to remain silent when criticism
              is warranted. This refusal of Singapore to face the reality of the
              times is the very reason why Singaporeans flee their country in droves.<br><br>Being
              forced to remain in Singapore against my will, I naturally have to live
              among Singaporeans. What I have found so far is by and large; educated
              Singaporeans are recent immigrants from somewhere else. From India,
              from Europe and from elsewhere. I am not seeing any local educated
              Singaporeans. I have no doubt that they have left the country. They
              have emigrated to other countries in the world, and left Singapore for
              good.<br><br>Perhaps, like me, they too think that the administration
              should be subject to criticism. And that includes the judiciary. Judges
              are not Gods after all.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br>Singapore</div>
