              <p>SINGAPORE : Former Singaporean lawyer and ex—Workers’ Party (WP)
              election candidate, Gopalan Nair, is out on bail after nearly four days
              in custody.</p>
              <p>The prosecution said there was "no need" to remand him further.</p>
              <p>Nair’s passport is impounded and he has been ordered to report for further investigations as and when required.</p>
              <p>The 58—year—old American citizen was charged on Monday with insulting High Court judge Belinda Ang.</p>
              <p>He
              is alleged to have sent an email accusing Justice Ang of "prostituting
              herself" during an ongoing court proceeding involving Prime Minister
              Lee Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Hsien Loong against opposition
              figures Chee Soon Juan and his sister Chee Siok Chin.</p>
              <p>The remarks were also published on his blog.</p>
              <p>Nair’s lawyer told the court that his client might need to leave Singapore for a short while to settle affairs back in the US.</p>
              <p>The
              judge said Nair could apply to leave the country after he was released
              on a S$5,000 bail. His next court date has been set for June 12. — CNA

              to do so and cited section 3(1)(c) of the Sedition Act (Singapore, Cap.
              290):<br> <br> <blockquote>A seditious tendency is a tendency to bring into hatred or
              contempt or to excite disaffection against the administration of
              justice in Singapore.</blockquote><br> <br> I am not persuaded by this explanation. As will be discussed later,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> the
              courts of Singapore have a reputation for fairness in deciding cases
              between private commercial parties.</span> Without cogent evidence that
              alleging bias or corruption in a court case would lead to charges of
              sedition, I have difficulty with the allegation that Enernorth was
              barred by the Sedition Act of Singapore from bringing objections until
              now. <br> </blockquote>

              <p>The following piece is an extract taken from the first Solicitor-General of Singapore - Francis Seow :</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span>THE New York City Bar Association, after a fact-finding mission to Singapore led by the late Robert B. McKay, then dean of the New York University Law School, observed:</span></p>
              <p><span> What emerges ... is a government that has been willing to decimate the rule of law for the benefit of its political interests. Lawyers have been cowed to passivity, judges are kept on a short leash, and the law has been manipulated so that gaping holes exist in the system of restraints on government action toward the individual. ... Any US venture contemplating business in Singapore or with a Singapore company is likely to encounter a wide variety of enterprises in which the government has an economic interest. If a dispute arises with such an enterprise, the US company faces the prospect of a law suit before Singapore's judiciary. The same forces which have led that judiciary to be sensitive to the PAP government's political interests would lead it to take account of its economic interests. ... The only check on the Singapore judiciary is the prospect of ultimate appeal to the Privy Council in London.</span></p>
              <p><span> That report was published in October 1990. Since then, appeals to the privy council have been abolished. The supervisory powers of the courts have been removed.<br><br></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it a surprise that the Singapore Political Leadership is reluctant in taking out legal actions against those who will insult the Singapore political and judicial system in foreign countries ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span>Bernard Levin’s case, on the other hand, shows that no matter how grave the provocation, the prime minister does not easily embark on litigation outside his own bailiwick. Levin, a highly-respected columnist with<em> The Times</em>, had published two other hard-hitting op-ed essays on Singapore, regarding which the prime minister complained in a letter to the editor of <em>The Times </em>as "`unrestrained indictment' of my premiership ... and is false in so many respects ... so unfair, and indeed irresponsible as a piece of journalism ... Just as he [Levin] makes the outrageous allegation that judges in Singapore are `bent or cowed', ..."</span></p>
              <p><span>In spite of all this, the prime minister did not see it fit to sue nor even threaten to sue Levin or <em>The Times</em> for defamation. Instead, he offered to "discuss" those allegations with Levin in a debate on British television. Levin refused the proposed discussion. It does not require any great leap of imagination to realise that the prime minister knew that he could not influence their lordships at the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand. Like Sun Tzu, the celebrated Chinese military strategist, he knows his ground, and chooses it with care.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If the Singapore Government believe that the Singapore Judiciary is equal to that of other First World Countries, surely, the same quality and standards in legal judgment based on legal fairness and transparency is to be expected ?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span class="marron_titulo_big">MEDIA-SINGAPORE:</span> <span class="marron_titulo_big">Restrictions Follow Critics to Cyberspace</span><br><span class="marron">By Lin Quan Zhong - Asia Media Forum</span><br><span class="texto1"><br><strong>SINGAPORE, Jun 7 (IPS) - When Lee Hsien Loong became Singapore’s prime minister after his father, Lee Kuan Yew, four years ago, he encouraged citizens to "feel free to express diverse views, pursue unconventional ideas, or simply be different". Today, these hopes for a city-state that can be more relaxed about criticism and more open to frank debate appear to have been too high. </strong><br><br>While Singapore’s restrictions on the media are no surprise to anyone, the ongoing legal action against a foreign blogger who criticised the country’s justice system has raised fears that these tight controls are now being pushed into what has so far been a freer environment -- cyberspace. <br><br>On Jun. 2, U.S. blogger Gopalan Nair, who used to be a Singaporean citizen, became the first foreign blogger to be arrested and charged with "threatening, abusing or insulting a public servant" -- a High Court judge. His trial was scheduled to start Friday. <br><br>Writing about testimony given by the older and younger Lee in connection with a defamation suit they brought against opposition leader Chee Soon Juan, Nair accused Judge Belinda Ang of "all throughout [the Chee libel case] of prostituting herself during the entire proceedings, by being nothing more than an employee of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew and his son and carrying out their orders." <br><br>Nair, who runs the blog ‘Singapore Dissident’ (http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/), called Ang a "stooge of a judge" and a "kangaroo judge". <br><br>A lawyer, Nair openly challenged the statements of Lee Kwan Yew -- now called Minister Mentor -- at the hearing and provided details of his own identity and location on his blog. <br><br>How this case plays out is being closely watched in the region, including in neighbouring Malaysia where Internet-based independent media have a strong presence. <br><br>Over the last decade or so, the Internet has provided alternative space for media, giving audiences more options in writing, reading and discussing viewpoints not always possible for mainstream media to carry. Views expressed on the Internet have also been more protected than those appearing in traditional media, such as print, television or radio. <br><br>"Nair’s arrest is a confirmation that Singaporeans do not have the supposed privilege of being safe on the Internet," Supinya Klangnarong, vice chair of the Bangkok-based Campaign for Popular Media Reform, said in a telephone interview. <br><br>Singapore ranks at 141 out of 169 countries in the 2007 Worldwide Press Freedom Index, released by the Paris-based Reporters Sans Frontiers. <br><br>In recent years, Singapore has acquired a reputation as a country where lawsuits are used against political opponents of the ruling party, in some cases leading to situations where the accused face bankruptcy due to the costs of the legal proceedings. <br><br>In the ongoing case, Singaporeans were preoccupied with a three-day court hearing in May for the Lees’ defamation suit against Chee, whose Singapore Democratic Party newsletter was charged with defaming them as key figures in the government. The publication had compared the furore over the disclosure of the huge sums of money that the executives of the non-profit National Kidney Foundation (NKF) were earning, with what it called unjustifiably high salaries of government officials. <br><br>"It is impossible not to notice the striking resemblance between how the NKF operated and how the PAP [People’s Action Party] runs Singapore," the newsletter said in February 2006. <br><br>In reply to a question posed by an SDP lawyer on the first day of the damages hearing against Chee, Lee Hsien Loong was quoted as saying by local media: "I do consider Dr. Chee as a Liar, as a cheat, somebody who has brought discredit to the opposition in Singapore, but I do not hate him." <br><br>Singaporeans have also been following reporting on a raid on the private screening of the anti-government documentary ‘One Nation Under Lee’ on May 19. Made by political activists, this 45-minute video is about Lee Kuan Yew’s rise to power and his crackdown on dissidents. <br><br>These incidents were covered by the pro-government print media including the English-language daily ‘Straits Times’, which focused on Nair’s political background and referred to him as either a "former Singaporean" or "former [opposition] Workers’ Party member". <br><br>The blogger Kengho Yap also said that the free daily newspaper ‘Today’ had two versions of reporting on Nair’s arrest. Yap posted photos of the paper on his blog ‘News Release by Uncle Yap’ (http://uncleyap- news.blogspot.com/2008/06/146th-today-changed-title-of-gopalan.html). The first version carried the headline "American Jailed for Insults", and the second one that was actually released said "Man ‘Threatened Judge’". <br><br>"They had first wanted public perception of Mr. Gopalan Nair to be American," Yap wrote. <br><br>But reactions on the Internet to Nair’s blog postings and views also vary. "I think he went too far," said Singaporean blogger Havok in an interview. "After reading some of his older posts, I can only say that he is looking for trouble." <br><br>Nair’s actions and disclosure of his personal details and location in Singapore, which to many sounded like an open challenge, were probably "the most daring or foolish act ever in the history of the blogosphere," added the writer of the blog called ‘I.Z. Reloaded’ (http://izreloaded.blogspot.com/2008/05/blogger-challenges-mm- lee.html). <br><br>But in his blog ‘Sheep City’ (http://aidilomar.com/), Aidil Omar wrote that the real lesson in the Nair case is that "we common sheep are not allowed to air our disgust and frustrations towards the incorruptible and infallible members of the ruling government". <br><br>"The thing is no government is really true and honest, so every government tries to clamp down on these things [criticism]. But Singapore overdid it," said Tyler Goh, a Malaysian studying in Singapore." He added that "everything praises the People’s Action Party," the ruling party of the Singaporean government. <br><br>Nair’s lawyer Chia Ti Lik wrote in his blog (http://chiatilik.wordpress.com), "Perhaps the case concerned Mr. Gopalan Nair. Perhaps the case centred on Gopalan Nair’s support for Chee Soon Juan and [his sister] Chee Siok Chin. Perhaps it was because Gopalan had the audacity to insult/threaten a High Court judge," he wrote. "Perhaps it was because of Gopalan’s open challenges to the Minister Mentor in his blog." <br><br>Nair was released on bail Jun. 5 for 5,000 Singapore dollars [3,663 U.S. dollars] and his passport was confiscated. Chia wrote in his blog that sedition charges are also expected to be filed by the government against his client. <br><br>Nair was an active member of the Workers’ Party, and had stood for elections in 1988 and 1991. He later moved to California where he practised law, but had returned to support oppositionist Chee and his sister, who are in the midst of their own defamation court hearing. <br></span></p></div>

              <p>This Gopa lanpa guy just join the Chees for one reason. They all hate LKY and his party becoz they can't win a place in election. They want LKY down. Nothing but personal agenda. If you really care abt Singapore, why you give up your Spore citizenship?</p>
              <p>We all hope for constructive efforts from anyone who can make our lives better. But these goons think their bombastic words have done any good at all.</p>
              <p>What have the Chees done? They only show concern only for their direct party supporters who are arrested. Hold vigils and protest. Have they made an effort to meet those illterate who voted for them?</p>
              <p>Chaim did that and I have full respect for him. Suffer health problems but still make it to meet-the-ppl session rain or shine.</p>

              <p>What has the Chee siblings done ?</p>
              <p>If not having achieve much in political terms, it has embarrassed the Judiciary for its submissive impotency in not being able to respond to the abuses from the Executive; and has at least awaken Singaporeans to the farcical nature of the democratic practices based on the convenient interpretation of the members from the Ruling Political Party.</p>

Comment. Gerald Giam.<br>Jun 7, 2008</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; ">The Online Citizen</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; "><br>“People must have confidence that the judiciary is independent…In order to make sure that we protect the integrity of the judiciary, and to make sure that people’s confidence in the judiciary is not affected, you have to be very, very strict about anyone who attacks the judiciary in scurrilous ways, or calls into question its independence.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">These were the words of newly-minted Law Minister K Shanmugam, when asked for his opinion on the recent convictions of political activists Chee Soon Juan and Chee Siok Chin for contempt of court. (The Straits Times called their actions “attacks on the court”.)</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Shanmugam was quoted mentioning “independence” in reference to the judiciary at least two more times. He also talked about Singapore being “based on democratic principles”.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">I am not a lawyer but I do subscribe to democratic principles (albeit probably of a different form than PAP cabinet ministers do). </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Personally I find it quite an anachronism that in a democratic society, there can be a particular public institution that seems to be legally protected from any criticism.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">The Minister has warned that the government will be “very, very strict about (sic) anyone who…calls into question (the judiciary’s) independence”, otherwise the people’s confidence in the judiciary will be affected.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Does that mean that if — heaven forbid — the judiciary really becomes corrupt and partisan, Singaporeans would be sent to jail if they question its integrity? </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">And would jailing these critics somehow restore citizens’ trust in the judiciary?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">That is foolish, ivory-tower logic that is based on the assumption that Singaporeans are unthinking sheep who believe everything the Government tells them.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">I once asked a former Supreme Court judge why the courts always ruled in favour of PAP ministers who were suing opposition members. His reply was that most of those cases should have never been brought to court. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Once they were, however, the judges had no choice but to judge according to the letter of the law, which in Singapore is very strict when it comes to defamation.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Is it then the judiciary’s fault if Singaporeans think — rightly or wrongly — that the courts are less than independent when opposition figures are sitting in the dock? </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">In some cases, blame might lie with the powerful ministers who use the courts to settle their political disputes.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Political defamation suits aside, I would say that I have full confidence in the integrity and independence of our judiciary. (Well, at least I haven’t seen any YouTube videos of influential lawyers fixing judicial appointments in Singapore yet.) </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">The PAP leaders who have been bringing lawsuits against their political opponents all these years never cease to boast about the independence of our judiciary. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Unfortunately, what they don’t seem to realise is that every frivolous lawsuit they launch only serves to chip away at ordinary Singaporeans’ confidence in the judiciary. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">At the end of the day, it is the court of public opinion that they have tried, but failed to convince.</span></p>

              <p><br>Another one of your amateur attempt at imitating the ways of the Mentor, plagiarising his style as if you can defend it with your own definitive ways.</p>
              <p>The choice of words are more reflective of the vendetta from the Mentor towards all who dare to pop their heads at him - and can be seen from a string of events that began with - Chia Thye Poh, Lim Chin Siong, Dr Lee Siew Choh, and the countless fallen names from the Barisan Socialist in the 1960s; J.B Jeyaratnam and Tan Wah Piow in the 70s, Vincent Cheng, Teo Soh Lung and the Catholic Church in the 80's, Francis Seow, Tang Liang Hong and J.B.J again in the 90s, CSJ since the late 90's</p>
              <p>Only in your own preferred deluded plagiarising of the mentor's propaganda and its continued propagation through your thoughtless words that you will hope the image of the Opposition has been damaged by CSJ.</p>
              <p>If CSJ is as much a fool that the Mentor has made him out to be, why will the Mentor fear him so much that he has to put in a personal appearance in his Court, and make a mockery of the Court rules and ettiquette ?</p>
              <p>Only you will believe that CSJ is an impotent threat that do not require any attention to be paid, yet you and your mentor have spared no efforts to deride CSJ and pulling the plugs to prevent him from telling the truth of events that transpired daily in Singapore.</p>
              <p>For one who is not even in Singapore and spending half of your useless life in UK, what do you know about events in Singapore that make you such an authority ?</p>
              <p>You should join the 'Point_blank' juvenile in his efforts at 'bastardising the opposition supporters' in his same inimitable ''bastardised version'' that feature parallel ways at bastardising the image of your common Great Mentor - the Shepherder of all white wooly sheep.</p>

              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><em>quote from comment by Gerald Giam</em></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><em>"I once asked a former Supreme Court judge why the courts always ruled in favour of PAP ministers who were suing opposition members. <span style="color: #ff0000;">His reply was that most of those cases should have never been brought to court.</span></em></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><em>Once they were, however, the judges had no choice but to judge according to the letter of the law, which in Singapore is very strict when it comes to defamation."</em></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Besides the who, invention, fear...... there is also the context. Civil suits end up in court only as a last recourse. The first being settlement out of court. When that fails, then both parties goes to court.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In defamation suits, the defendent has the opportunity to make an offer of amends. If the offer of amends is accepted by the plaintiff, and duly performed, no proceedings may be continued by the plaintiff. That is what the judge meant. Once it goes to court, the letter of the law is applied.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In court the plaintiff must prove:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. The words must be defamatory.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. They must refer to the plaintiff.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. They must be "maliciously" said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The good judge always shakes his head, that the defendants choose to go to court. That what he meant when he said that those cases should never have been brought to court. Its the plaintiff right to sue, when he has a case. The defendant should assess his own position, and not expect the plaintiff to give "chance lah".</span></p>

              <p>I invite u to read Gopalan Nair blogs again,at least in the past 6 months.</p>
              <p>Is He  just a blogger--next--door?</p>
              <p>Will a ordinary blogger called for killing of LKY</p>
              <p>A..by bombing his private residence</p>
              <p>B..flys a plane from Seletar and crush on the house</p>
              <p>HE WAS NOT IN MAKING JOKES.</p>
              <p>There are many things he had propsed.It is unfair</p>
              <p>for me to comment here.</p>
              <p>Read at least 30 of Nair'sarticles then come back and talk.</p>
              <p>NO RESEARCH.NO DISCUSSION.</p>

              <p>In your feverish efforts to support and defend the Great Mentor's position, are you not making similar errors as the clueless 'Point_blank' character in allowing yourself to be a 'bastardised' version of the Great Mentor ?</p>
              <p>Have you not considered that Goapalan Nair was actually responding to the call from the Singapore Government to remain engage with Singapore even if they have left our shores.</p>
              <p>Did you confuse yourself with the US Laws that give the Bloggers their rights to free expressions, as much as those liberties do not threaten, instigate malice or violence that will impinge on the Civil Rights of others ?</p>
              <p>Such regulations are quite different from the Singapore Laws that prevent anyone identifiable individual from making an honest criticism to the political envirnment which they live in.</p>

Accessing public information, participating in public policy consultations and providing feedback to Government can now all be done online with ease.  Our iGov2010 efforts will continue to complement existing non-electronic service delivery initiatives and take the Government-citizen relationship to the next level, one where citizens are actively engaged in the policy-making process.<br><br>To achieve these, online information need to be clear and useful and presented in a vibrant and interesting manner.  The Singapore Government Online Portal <a href="http://www.gov.sg/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">www.gov.sg</span></span></a> – the gateway to all Government information and e-services - will have an improved look-and-feel, better content search facilities and clearer presentation of information on Government policies and services.  For example, illustrations and bite-size video snippets could be used to bring across messages in a more vivid manner.  In addition, the effectiveness and appeal of online Government channels need to be enhanced to attract citizens to participate in online exchanges and provide feedback to the Government.<br><br>We will also provide separate consultation spaces for Businesses, Youths and Overseas Singaporeans in the Government’s one-stop, interactive Online Consultation Portal for national issues and policy proposals (<a href="http://www.feedback.gov.sg/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">www.feedback.gov.sg</span></span></a>).  <br><br>These spaces will focus on the dialogues, themes and consultations which are of concern and interest to the respective groups.  For example, a business does not have to comb through the entire slew of consultation papers to determine if they are relevant to the business.  Correspondingly, it will also be easier for public agencies to hear views coming from the different segments.<br><br>Besides engaging citizens in policy-making and reviews, online channels will also be leveraged to foster greater bonding within different communities such as youths.  The Youth Portal, Youth.sg, set up in 25th February 2006, is a first stop resource portal for community participation, and a virtual space for young Singaporeans who want to make a difference to the people around them. Youth.sg offers young Singaporeans easy access to information on how to start their own community activities, as well as information on initiatives that fellow youth are engaged in.</span></p>
