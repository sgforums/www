              <p>You are asking a parrot to think? That is an anomaly. Bird brains have not yet evolved to the point where independent thoughts are possible. The most that they are able to do is mimic their masters. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>I think LKY doesn't have facts to win his defamation suit against him, that's why he has to resort to charging him on insults to public servants, next will be jaywalking, littering, talking in public, not flushing toilet after use.</p>
              <p>I think as the years weighs down on him, his testicles once descended during his teenage years has ascended back to whence it came from. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
