              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Clouds over Singapore's blogosphere</strong></span><br> By Lin Quan Zhong
              																	<br> <br> SINGAPORE - When Lee Hsien Loong four years ago followed in his father's 
              																	footsteps as Singapore's prime minister, many hoped he would break with Lee 
              																	Kuan Yew's authoritarian tendencies when the younger man encouraged citizens to 
              																	"feel free to express diverse views, pursue unconventional ideas, or simply be 
              																	different".
              																	<br> <br> It's now apparent that hopes the younger Lee's government would take a more 
              																	relaxed approach to political criticism and open debate were set too high. 
              																	While Singapore's restrictions on the mainstream media are nothing new, legal 
              																	action recently taken against a foreign blogger who criticized the island 
              																	state's justice system has raised fears that those tight controls are now being
              																	applied in cyberspace.
              																	<br> <br> On June 2, US blogger and former Singapore citizen Gopalan Nair was the first 
              																	online writer to be arrested and charged with "threatening, abusing or 
              																	insulting a public servant", in his particular case a high court judge. His 
              																	trial started on Friday and is being closely watched by the country's scores of 
              																	critical on-line writers and commentators.
              																	<br> <br> Writing about testimony given by the older and younger Lee in connection with a 
              																	defamation suit they brought against opposition leader Chee Soon Juan, Nair 
              																	accused Judge Belinda Ang of being an order-taking "employee" of Lee Kuan Yew 
              																	and his son. He presented no concrete evidence to back those claims on his 
              																	blog.</p>
              <p>Nair, who runs the blog "Singapore Dissident", which may be accessed at 
              																	http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com, also questioned in strong language the 
              																	judge's impartiality in deciding the case. Trained as a lawyer, Nair openly 
              																	challenged the courtroom statements of Lee Kwan Yew - who now holds the 
              																	position of Minister Mentor - and provided details of his own identity and the 
              																	location of his blog.
              																	<br> <br> Nair was an active member of the opposition Workers' Party and stood for 
              																	elections in 1988 and 1991 before moving to California, where he practiced law. 
              																	He recently returned to Singapore to support opposition leader Chee and his 
              																	sister, who are in the midst of a high-profile defamation court hearing that 
              																	could land both political activists in prison.
              																	<br> <br> How Nair's case plays out in court is being closely watched throughout the 
              																	region, including in neighboring Malaysia, where Internet-based media and blogs 
              																	have likewise developed a strong following through critical reporting and 
              																	editorials. Over the past decade, the Internet has provided space for 
              																	alternative media to discuss news and views not carried in the 
              																	government-controlled mainstream media in Singapore.
              																	<br> <br> Until now, controversial views expressed over the Internet have not come under 
              																	the same scrutiny as reporters who have tried to report critically for 
              																	traditional media, including print, television or radio. "Nair's arrest is a 
              																	confirmation that Singaporeans do not have the supposed privilege of being safe 
              																	on the Internet," Supinya Klangnarong, vice-chair of the Bangkok-based Campaign 
              																	for Popular Media Reform, a press freedom advocacy group.
              																	<br> <br> Singapore ranked at 141 out of 169 countries in the 2007 Worldwide Press 
              																	Freedom Index released by the Paris-based Reporters Sans Frontiers. In recent 
              																	years, Singapore has acquired a global reputation for using punitive civil 
              																	lawsuits to silence political opponents of Lee's ruling party. In some cases 
              																	the accused have faced bankruptcy due to the high costs of the legal 
              																	proceedings and the amount of damages sought.
              																	<br> <br> (Chee and his sister, fellow activist and co-defendant in the defamation case 
              																	Chee Siok Chin, last week opted to go to jail after being sentenced to 12 days 
              																	and 10 days respectively for contempt of court during the Lee trial, AFP 
              																	reported. Chee Siok Chin told AFP on Wednesday that they were unable to pay the 
              																	S$2,000 (US$1,470 US) in court fees required to file their appeals against the 
              																	contempt finding. The Chees had defied the judge's admonitions about the way 
              																	they grilled the two Lees, the AFP report said.)
              																	<br> <br> Singaporeans were glued to the three-day defamation court hearing in May in 
              																	which the Lees' had filed against the Chees, whose Singapore Democratic Party 
              																	newsletter was charged with defaming both elder and junior Lee in their 
              																	capacities as government figures. The publication in February 2006 compared a 
              																	controversy over financial opacity at the non-profit National Kidney Foundation 
              																	(NKF) with how the People's Action Party (PAP) manages Singapore's national 
              																	accounts.
              																	<br> <br> The court proceedings provided plenty of quotable fodder for bloggers. In reply 
              																	to a question posed by an SDP lawyer on the first day of the defamation 
              																	hearing, prime minister Lee was quoted in the local media saying: "I do 
              																	consider Dr Chee as a liar, as a cheat, somebody who has brought discredit to 
              																	the opposition in Singapore, but I do not hate him."
              																	<br> <br> At the same time, Singaporeans have also followed closely on-line reporting of 
              																	the May 19 raid of the private screening in a Singapore hotel of the 
              																	anti-government documentary "One Nation Under Lee". Created by political 
              																	activists, the 45-minute video chronicles and criticizes Lee Kuan Yew's rise to 
              																	power and his sustained crackdown on political dissidents. Although government 
              																	authorities stopped the film's screening, it is still available over the 
              																	Internet.
              																	<br> <br> Coverage of recent events in the mainstream media, including the 
              																	English-language daily Straits Times, has underscored its pro-government bias. 
              																	News of Nair's arrest focused mainly on his political background and referred 
              																	to him variously as either a "former Singaporean" or "former [opposition] 
              																	Workers' Party member" rather than a trained US lawyer.
              																	<br> <br> Popular blogger Kengho Yap noted that the free daily newspaper Today had two 
              																	conflicting versions of Nair's arrest, apparently underscoring the government's 
              																	indecision on how to couch the news. Yap posted photos of two different 
              																	versions of the pro-government paper on his blog, with the first version 
              																	carrying the headline "American Jailed for Insults", and the second one, which 
              																	was actually published, under the headline "Man Threatened Judge".
              																	<br> <br> "They had first wanted public perception of Mr Gopalan Nair to be American," 
              																	Yap wrote on his blog, "News Release by Uncle Yap". Cyberspace reactions to 
              																	Nair's blog postings and views on Chee's trial have also varied widely. "I 
              																	think he went too far," said Singaporean blogger Havok in an interview. "After 
              																	reading some of his older posts, I can only say that he is looking for 
              																	trouble."
              																	<br> <br> Nair's actions and disclosure of his personal details and location in 
              																	Singapore, which were perceived by many as an open challenge to the government, 
              																	were probably "the most daring or foolish act ever in the history of the 
              																	blogosphere", wrote the writer of the blog I Z Reloaded.
              																	<br> <br> In the blog Sheep City (http://aidilomar.com/), Aidil Omar wrote that the real 
              																	lesson in the Nair case is that “we common sheep are not allowed to air our 
              																	disgust and frustrations towards the incorruptible and infallible members of 
              																	the ruling government.”
              																	<br> <br> Meanwhile Nair's lawyer, Chia Ti Lik, was more circumspect in his blog 
              																	(http://chiatilik.wordpress.com). "Perhaps the case concerned Mr Gopalan Nair. 
              																	Perhaps the case centered on Gopalan Nair's support for Chee Soon Juan and Chee 
              																	Siok Chin. Perhaps it was because Gopalan had the audacity to insult/threaten a 
              																	High Court judge," he wrote. "Perhaps it was because of Gopalan's open 
              																	challenges to the Minister Mentor in his blog."
              																	<br> <br> Nair was released on June 5 on S$5,000 bail and had his passport confiscated. 
              																	Lawyer Chia wrote in his blog that sedition charges are also expected to be 
              																	filed by the government against his client. As such, expect more critical blog 
              																	entries in Singapore's blogosphere in the weeks and months ahead.</p>

              <p>How come you never apologized or admitted your mistakes that you made in military nuts, intead running away to create more threads and making more mistakes in there?</p>
              <p>You like to call for justice, but you are the one who is truly perverting honesty and justice in here.</p>

              <p>As long as you cannot answer to all this, and refuse to be an honest person in here, you can forget about anybody listening or even bothering to read your posts.</p>
              <p>Here is something you should learn:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Honesty</strong></p>
              <p> is the human quality of communicating and acting <a title="Truth" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Truth"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">truthfully</span></span></a> related to <a title="Truth" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Truth"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">truth</span></span></a> as a value. This includes listening, and any action in the human repertoire — as well as speaking.</p>
              <p>Superficially, honesty means simply stating facts and views as best one truly believes them to be. It includes both honesty to others, and to oneself (see: <a title="Self-deception" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Self-deception"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">self-deception</span></span></a>) and about one's own motives and inner reality. Honesty, at times, has the ability to cause misfortune to the person who displays it.</p>
              <p><span class="mw-headline">Western views on honesty</span></p>
              <p>The concept of honesty applies to all behaviors. One cannot refuse to consider factual information, for example, and still claim that one's knowledge, belief, or position is an attempt to be truthful or is held in "good faith." Such willful blindness is clearly a product of one's desires and simply has nothing to do with the human ability to know. Basing one's positions on what one wants — rather than unbiased evidence gathering — is dishonest even when good intentions can be cited — after all even villains could cite good intentions and intended glory for a select group of people. Clearly then, an unbiased approach to the truth is a requirement of honesty.</p>
              <p>Because intentions are closely related to fairness, and certainly affect the degree of honesty/dishonesty, there is a widespread confusion about honesty. There is also a general belief that one is necessarily aware that dishonest behavior is dishonest. But it's at the moment when one disregards information in order to benefit, or protect their beliefs, that one shows whether they are interested in the truth or whether they have a lack of respect for the truth, which is dishonesty, regardless of whether they mislabel it stubborness or conviction. <a title="Socrates" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Socrates"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Socrates</span></span></a> had much to say about truth, honesty and morality, and explained that if people really <em>understood</em> that their behavior was wrong — then they simply would not choose it. Furthermore, the more dishonest someone is, the less likely they are to understand honesty and to characterize their behavior as wrong. Unfortunately, honesty and morality have been marginalized to specific lists of behaviors that change over time(like fashion). The understanding that honesty requires an unbiased approach to the truth and to evidence gathering at all times, collides with ideologies of all types. This would explain why honesty, although often discussed -- has failed to become a cultural norm. Ideologies and idealism inherently exaggerate and suppress evidence in order to support their perspectives. They essentially state that their way is the <em>only</em> right way to view the world. This erodes the practice and understanding of honesty and creates ongoing conflicts in all human relationships.</p>

              <p><a id="Studies_of_Confucius_about_honesty" name="Studies_of_Confucius_about_honesty"></a></p>
              <h2><span class="mw-headline">Studies of Confucius about honesty</span></h2>
              <p><a title="Confucius" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Confucius"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Confucius</span></span></a> recognized several levels of honesty, fundamental to his <a title="Ethics" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Ethics"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">ethics</span></span></a>:</p>
              <p>His shallowest concept of honesty was implied in his notion of <em>Li</em>: all actions committed by a person to build the ideal society - aiming at meeting their surface desires of a person either immediately (bad) or longer term (good). To admit that one sought immediate gratification could however make a bad act better, and to hide one's long term goals could cloud a good act. A key principle was that a "gentleman" must strive to convey his feelings honestly on his face, so that these could help each other coordinate for long term gain for all. So there was a visible relation between <a title="Time horizon" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Time_horizon"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">time horizon</span></span></a>, <a title="Etiquette" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Etiquette"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">etiquette</span></span></a> and one's image of oneself even in the mirror. This generates self-honesty and keeps such activities as <a title="Business" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Business"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">business</span></span></a> calm, unsurprising, and aboveboard. In this conception, one is honest because it suits one's own self-interest only.Deeper than <em>Li</em> was <em>Yi</em> or righteousness. Rather than pursuing one's own interests one should do what is right and moral - based on reciprocity. Here too <a title="Time" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Time"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">time</span></span></a> is central, but as a time span: since one's parents spent one's first three years raising one, one spent three mourning them after they die. At this level one is honest about one's <a title="Obligation" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Obligation"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">obligations</span></span></a> and <a title="Duty" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Duty"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">duty</span></span></a>. Even with no one else to keep one honest or to relate to directly, a deeply honest person would relate to ancestors as if they were alive and would not act in ways that would make them ashamed. This was part of the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Moral code" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Moral_code"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">moral code</span></span></a> that included <a class="mw-redirect" title="Ancestor worship" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Ancestor_worship"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">ancestor worship</span></span></a>, but <a title="Confucius" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Confucius"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Confucius</span></span></a> had made it rigorous.The deepest level of honesty was <em>Ren</em>, out of which flowed Yi and thus Li.Confucius' morality was based upon <a title="Empathy" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Empathy"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">empathy</span></span></a> and <a title="Understanding" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Understanding"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">understanding</span></span></a> others, which required understanding one's own <a class="mw-redirect" title="Moral core" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Moral_core"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">moral core</span></span></a> first, rather than on divinely ordained rules, which could simply be obeyed. The Confucian version of the Golden Rule was to treat one's inferiors as one would want one's superiors to treat one. Virtue under Confucius is based upon harmony with others and a recognition of the honest reality that eventually (say in old age) one will come under the power of others (say one's children). So this level of honesty is to actually put oneself in context of one's whole life and future generations - and choose to do or say nothing that would not reflect one's family's honour and reputation for honesty and acceptance of <a title="Truth" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Truth"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">truth</span></span></a>, such as eventual death.</p>

It’s not simply admitting where we are - that’s a beginning step, it’s not the end step. So be honest about where you are but also be honest about what your possibilities are. That keeps the challenge of the path always before us.” (From <a class="external text" title="http://www.mettaforest.org/Audio%20Dhamma3.htm" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mettaforest.org/Audio%20Dhamma3.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Thanissaro's “True Honesty.”</span></span></a>) </dd></blockquote>

              <p>Ya PAP is really smart. To be fooled or not, its up to the individual to decide. The education system all along doesnt advocate so much of critical thinking, students just accept what is being told. Im talking about secondary level and below. Until when they go up to tertiary level old habits become hard to change.</p>
              <p>PAP knows this very well 'you cant teach an old dog new tricks' already :D So they become obedient :P</p>

              <blockquote>Coverage of recent events in the mainstream media, including the
              English-language daily Straits Times, has underscored its
              pro-government bias. News of Nair's arrest focused mainly on his
              political background and referred to him variously as either a "former
              Singaporean" or "former [opposition] Workers' Party member" rather than
              a trained US lawyer.</blockquote>

              <blockquote>Popular blogger Kengho Yap noted that the free daily newspaper Today
              had two conflicting versions of Nair's arrest, apparently underscoring
              the government's indecision on how to couch the news. Yap posted photos
              of two different versions of the pro-government paper on his blog, with
              the first version carrying the headline "American <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jailed</span> for Insults",
              and the second one, which was actually published, under the headline
              "Man Threatened Judge".</blockquote>

Honesty is the awareness of what is right and appropriate in one’s role, one’s behavior, and one relationship. With honesty, there is no hypocrisy or artificiality which create confusion and mistrust in the minds and lives of others. Honesty makes for a life of integrity because the inner and outer selves are a mirror image. <br><br>Honesty is to speak that which is thought and to do that which is spoken. There are no contradictions or discrepancies in thoughts, words, or actions. Such integration provides clarity and example to others. To have one form internally and another form externally creates barriers and can cause damage, since one would neither be able to come close to anyone else, nor would others want to be close. Some think, "I am honest, but no one understands me." That is not honest. Honesty is as distinct as a flawless diamond which can never remain hidden.

              <p><strong>Inner honesty needs to be examined to provide wisdom and support and ensure strength and stability. Positive firmness within creates an oasis of spiritual resources, giving confidence to be grounded in one’s self-esteem. That is assertiveness. If internally there is attachment to a person, object, or idea, that attachment poses an obstacle to reality and objectivity, and action cannot be taken in the interest of the whole. The internal state should not be influenced by the negativity of one’s nature, feelings, or personality traits Selfish motives, hidden agendas, and negative feelings and habits are stains on the mirror of life. Honesty acts as the stain remover.<br><br>For self-growth, there should be cleanliness in one’ efforts and truth in one’s heart. Cleanliness mean exploring and changing consciousness and activity which blemish the self and raise doubts in others. There should be honesty of the heart and also honesty of the head; otherwise, there will be self-deception or a tendency to deceive others by clouding issues with excuses or long-winded explanations. When the mirror of the self is clean, feelings, nature, motives, and objectives are clearly visible, and the individual reflects trustworthiness. There is the saying, "The boat of truth may rock, but it will never sink." Even with honesty, the boat sometimes rocks, but trustworthiness guarantees the boat will not sink. The courage of truth makes one worthy of trust. <br><br>To be trusted and to trust provide the foundation and cohesion necessary for untarnished relationships. It is also necessary to share with honesty the feelings and motives of one another. When there is honesty and cleanliness, there is also closeness. Without these principles, neither individuals nor societies can be functional.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Personal and collective application of such ethics and principles involves experimenting to see what works best, to see what is meaningful and useful. Such is a continuous process of application and learning. Progress comes through experimenting with honesty and implementing it as completely and sincerely as possible at any given moment. When there is the experience of success, commitment to honesty and integrity is strengthened. To carry out a task out of force, compulsion, or with a careless or selfish attitude does not reflect pure motives. To be honest with one’s real self and true to the purpose of a task earns trust and inspires faith in others. For progress to be sustained requires purity of motive and consistency of effort. <br><br>An honest person is one who aspires to follow the highest codes of conduct, who is loyal to the benevolent and universal principles of life, and whose decisions are based clearly on what is right and wrong. Such an individual maintains standards which provide guidance and courage to understand and respect the subtle connections of the world in relation to his or her life. An honest person appreciates the interconnectedness of the natural world and does not misuse, abuse, or waste the wealth of resources provided for the well-being of humanity. An honest person does not take for granted his or her own resources such as mind, body, wealth, time, talents, or knowledge. Honesty means never to misuse that which is given in trust. There would always be the concern that resources be used in a worthwhile way - for the basic human, moral, and spiritual needs of all people. Well-used resources create well-being and are a means for those very resources to multiply. The individual who is deeply committed to development and progress keeps honesty as a constant principle in building a world of peace and plenty, a world of less expenditure and greater splendor.</strong></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Former Singaporean lawyer and ex-Workers' Party
              election candidate, Gopalan Nair, is facing another charge of insulting
              a High Court judge.
              <br> <br>On Thursday morning, the court heard that Nair, now a US citizen,
              had on 17 March 2006 insulted Justice Lai Siu Chiu in an email while
              the judge was hearing an Originating Summons case. <br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">In the email, Nair had alleged that Judge Lai had no shame and the
              reason why she and her fellow judges had punished and silenced PAP
              critics was because judges were well paid and had comfortable lives. </span><br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">He also alleged that judges were misusing the law for personal gain and Singapore judges, including Justice Lai, were corrupt. </span><br> <br>Nair's lawyer Chia Ti Lik told the court that his client may take a
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">certain cause of action </span>and so the case has been adjourned to Monday
              for a further mention in the Subordinate Courts.
              <br> <br> Nair has been released on bail. 
              <br> <br> If found guilty of the offence, Nair could be jailed up to a year or fined up to S$5,000, or face both jail and fine. 
              <br> <br> Earlier this month, Nair was charged with insulting a public servant, Justice Belinda Ang. 
              <br> </span><span>He is alleged to have sent an email to the judge, accusing her of
              prostituting herself during a proceeding involving Prime Minister Lee
              Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew against opposition
              figures, Mr Chee Soon Juan and Ms Chee Siok Chin.<br> - CNA/so</span></p>

                  — Gopalan Nair said he might have gone too far in lashing out at
                  Singapore officials who then had him jailed on a sedition charge.</p>
              <p>But
                  the Fremont immigration attorney said he was speaking from the heart
                  when he attacked the foreign government on his blog for suing leaders
                  of an opposition political party, then taunted the judge in the case
                  for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">"prostituting herself</span></strong></em></span>" during the trial.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I was so enraged,"
                  said Nair, 58, of San Jose, whose office is in the same building as The
                  Argus. "I was listening to the charade, the comedy that was going on
                  there. It was not a trial at all."</span></p>
              <p>Nair, who was released last
                  week on bail but had his passport confiscated and faces a hearing today
                  in Singapore, has run afoul of Singapore's political establishment
                  before.</p>
              <p>Born of Indian immigrant parents on the island nation
                  at the tip of the Malay Peninsula, he fulfilled mandatory military
                  service and studied law in Britain before returning to Singapore to
                  start a law firm.</p>
              <p>He ran for parliament in 1988 and 1991 as a
                  Workers Party member and said he was "harassed and persecuted" for his
                  beliefs. He sought asylum in the United States in the early '90s. and
                  became a U.S. citizen in 2005.</p>
              <p>He traveled to Singapore last
                  month to observe a defamation case against two leaders of the Singapore
                  Democratic Party who suggested a lack of financial transparency in the
                  government during a campaign two years ago.</p>

              has
                  ruled Singapore since 1959 under Lee Kuan Yew and his sons, the eldest
                  of whom serves as prime minister, and the family has a history of
                  filing libel suits against rivals to try to put them out of business.
              <p>"This is a shameful means by which the government stays in power," Nair said.</p>
              <p>In
                  blog posts on the court proceedings, he said the judge was basically a
                  stooge of the ruling patriarch and his prime minister son, whom Nair
                  called "nothing more than tin pot tyrants who remain in power by
                  abusing the courts to eliminate your political opponents."</p>
              <p>And he
                  didn't stop there. Regarding a comment Yew reportedly made about
                  wanting to sue anyone who attacks him online, Nair said: "Are you going
                  to stand by your threat and sue me for defamation as well? I am
                  presently physically within your jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of
                  your kangaroo courts. What are you going to do about it?"</p>
              <p>That
                  resulted in a visit by plainclothes police who ransacked Nair's hotel
                  room and arrested him. He said he was put in solitary confinement over
                  a weekend and held for another week as a case was built against him
                  alleging that he also threatened the judge by e-mail, something he
                  denies.</p>
              <p>The case centers on the country's Sedition Act, which
                  bars speech intended "to bring into hatred or contempt or to excite
                  disaffection against the Government (and) the administration of justice
                  in Singapore."</p>
              <p>Asia Times reported that this is the first
                  instance in which the law has been used against an online writer. The
                  government has sued The Wall Street Journal and other foreign media for
                  libel as well.</p>
              <p>Reporters Without Borders, a press freedom group,
                  issued a statement saying: "We urge the authorities to drop charges
                  against Gopalan Nair, who has only exercised his right of free
                  expression. This charge is improper and will add to the intimidation of
                  bloggers and Internet users who express themselves about Singapore's
                  political life."</p>
              <p>Opinion in the blogosphere is mixed. Somes
                  bloggers who have discussed the case praised the concept of free speech
                  but still bashed Nair for provoking the Singaporean government and
                  brashly breaking the law.</p>
              <p>"Go ahead and make your voice heard,
                  but don't assume that there's some shiny blogger badge that you can
                  waive [sic] like a diplomatic immunity card," Andy Beal said on <a href="http://marketingpilgrim.com/">Marketingpilgrim.com</a>. "Especially when you happen to be in a nation that's already proven to value its stability over your free speech."</p>
              <p>On <a href="http://mashable.com/">Mashable.com</a>., a social networking news blog, Ryan Olson of <a href="http://gimpysoft.com/">Gimpysoft.com</a>.
                  said, "Sure, the language is strong, but I can't imagine any more
                  straightforward example of political speech that should be protected:
                  the calling out of an official of the government for corruption."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">For
                  now, Nair said he has support from the American Embassy, but that he is
                  lying low when not being asked to come in for more police interrogation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">His
                  legal assistant in Fremont, Arjun Pisharodi, said he began the job
                  about a year ago and that he has been trying to handle Nair's cases
                  despite having no prior law training. He said Nair also is an Alameda
                  County court-appointed attorney.</span></p>
              <p>"It's a brave thing he did," Pisharodi said. "It's also very risky."</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Of the tenor of his blogging, Nair said: "On hindsight, perhaps I shouldn't have done that. You act on your conscience."</span></span></p>
