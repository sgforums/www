              <p>Ths issue here is, if his blog deflamated PAP in USA, that mean he is in USA, not caught in Singapore. The Singapore govt can sue n seek US attorney General to issue an arrest on him, but the court proceeding will be base on US state of laws. If committed in Singapore, of course use singapore laws lah, you never take aeroplane meh, when it land in singapore, it sure to announce that drug trafficking is a capital offence in SINGAPORE.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Laws are set by poeples, and peoples are born to make mistakes, so laws is definitely not perfect, that is why there is constant change of laws, and PAP are good in that, i am sure you agreed.</p>
              <p>And it must be blind otherwise if you give sentence such as death sentence, how can you give with eyes open, cos laws knows no human feeling. Understand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if you look at the balancing weights on both sides, if can never be balance indicating, the laws can never be fair, cos all of us have different opinons and idealogies, the laws may sound good to one but not fair to others.

              <p>oh.Our PhD follows the instruction of this US lawyer:</p>
              <blockquote>If Dr. Chee Soon Juan and his friends are deliberately going to defy
              these laws, and if the police are going to arrest him, try him in the
              Subordinate Court for 2 months, levy a small fine which he will refuse
              to pay, go to jail for a week; come out and do it all over gain. You
              see it is this government that is losing its respect, its time and
              money; Dr. Chee loses nothing. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Instead he gains international respect
              and admiration as a freedom fighter</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">And if a few can join him and with
              a few more as time goes on; you will have another Intramuros Manila
              Filipinos who ousted the dictator Marcos.</span><br><br>Moreover, Lee being an
              octogenarian or whatever name he may have, he will die soon. That too
              must give an added impetus for the movement for change.<br><br>The good
              news. Singaporeans are very suitable for democracy. Over the years they
              have become a civil people. A law abiding people. A gentle people. They
              are not like Pakistanis or the Afghans who are out to kill.
              Singaporeans will not kill anyone. Such people are best suited to
              democracy. And for making them a gentle people we can thank Lee Kuan
              Yew for that. But having thanked him, we should ask him to step aside.
              Right now.<br><br>So my dear Dr. Chee. Please do something. Talking
              about electoral reforms within 4 walls are good but not enough. <span style="color: #ff0000;">What is
              needed is physical action.</span></blockquote>

              <p>Sometime after 640pm and near 7pm this
              evening(lion note:04 jun 20008), i receive a call from Gopalan Nair. He was calling from the
              police station. He called to inform me that he would be produced in
              Court tomorrow morning to face a fresh charge. At that point, my heart
              sank - another charge. And this one is for sedition. I asked if there
              would be further remand and the indication was there was no such
              indication.</p>
              <p>Upon hearing that I then stopped my work. I had finished some
              research and completed the Notice of Appeal when the phone call came.
              The preparations for the appeal against remand can be put on hold but
              only for the time being - at least i could take a breather until 9am
              tomorrow morning.</p>
              <p>The time is 2219hrs 4th June 2008. I shall now leave the office for
              home and prepare to appear for Gopalan Nair tomorrow morning. We hope
              for all the best for Gopalan Nair.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <div id="text">
              <p>A US-based blogger who allegedly accused a
                          Singapore judge of "prostituting herself" was released on bail Thursday
                          and had his passport confiscated.</p>
              <p>A judge ordered Gopalan Nair, a
                          former Singapore lawyer who is now a US citizen, to be released on
                          5,000 dollars bail (3,676 US) after more than four days in custody.</p>
              <p>A prosecutor told court there was no need for him to be detained while further investigations were carried out.</p>
              <p>Nair, 58, who declined comment to reporters, is due back in court for another hearing next Thursday.</p>
              <p>He
                          was arrested in the city-state on Saturday and charged Monday with
                          insulting a public servant, his lawyer Chia Ti Lik earlier told AFP.</p>
              <p>According
                          to a court document, Nair is charged with insulting Justice Belinda Ang
                          Saw Ean last week by sending an email which said she "was throughout
                          prostituting herself during the entire proceedings, by being nothing
                          more than an employee of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his son and carrying out
                          their orders".</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Chia said the comments essentially repeated those
                          Nair made in a recent blog about a defamation case filed by Singapore's
                          leaders against an opposition party and its members.<span style="color: #800000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(lion note:does Chia mean anyone can say anything</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in his /her blogs and not liable?)</span></span></p>
              <p>In the blog,
                          Nair strongly criticised a three-day legal hearing last week at which
                          Singapore founding father Lee Kuan Yew and his son, Prime Minister Lee
                          Hsien Loong, testified.</p>
              <p>In another post on his blog Saturday,
                          Nair taunted authorities, saying he was in Singapore at a particular
                          hotel, and also gave his phone number.</p>
              <p>"I am now within your jurisdiction... What are you going to do about it?" Nair wrote.</p>
              <p>He
                          is charged with insulting a public servant, which on conviction carries
                          a maximum fine of 5,000 dollars (3,660 US) or one year in prison.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nair's lawyer told reporters outside court that he expects a fresh charge to be laid against his client, without elaborating.</span></p>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title"><em>Democratic action in Singapore</em><br></h3>
              <blockquote>This is the sad situation in Singapore whether you like it or not. Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew has got you in a vice from which there is no escape. If you do
              nothing, you are doomed to spend the rest of your lives, waiting for
              the handouts that Lee will throw at you, if he pleases, while he and
              his friends in government will continue to steal millions of dollars of
              your money. Yes, your money.<br><br>This is what you can do. Keep in
              mind that any action you take has a cumulative effect. A positive
              multiplier effect. Even the distribution of one leaflet to one
              individual is enough. The receiver will repeat the message to others,
              and in degrees, at least sections of the population becomes emboldened.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">There
              is no need to do any political activity through any political party</span>; if
              that is what you prefer. On the one hand, you can do it through
              political parties like the Singapore Democratic Party. Political
              activism through political parties is of course preferred. But it is
              not a requirement. On the other hand, you can do it alone or among
              friends, if you prefer. As and when and where you like it.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br>One
              method is to print sufficient leaflets to distribute at busy places.</span> The leaflets can encourage the people to protest. You can mention
              matters such as the unacceptably high salaries or theft being committed
              against the people by the ministers. You can mention the lack of a free
              press. The demand to be able to assemble. The demand for an independent
              judiciary. The leaflets can refer to the Singapore Democratic Party and
              their contact particulars. It can also request volunteers to distribute
              them at other places. Hopefully this way, Singapore island will be
              inundated with leaflets. And if you persist in this, you may well be
              able to move things. But regardless of whether you move things forward
              immediately, your actions alone would have made some dent in the
              illegal edifice of the Lee Administration. Also while distributing
              leaflets, you can wear a placard or poster over you body with the words
              "Down with Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew" or "More Freedom Now" or any other catchy phrase you prefer and with a cry "Freedom now" etc.<br><br>And mind you, according to the Penal Code of Singapore distribution of leaflets is not illegal.<br><br>Another
              thing that is good is to get your friends together <span style="color: #ff0000;">wearing the same T
              Shirts</span> of similar color with a catchy slogan such as "Freedom now" and
              march long Orchard Road. While marching, you can also distribute
              leaflets.<br><br>Important thing to remember is to constantly inform
              others of what you have heard such as by sending out these messages of
              mine to others, Emailing others, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">constantly spreading the news of
              your agitation.</span><br><br>As for distributing leaflets and holding marches
              and other political activity, <span style="color: #ff0000;">I suggest you do not publicise it before
              the activity.</span> Any publicity of it will attract undercover police to
              harass you and disrupt your activity. Get a cameraman there while you
              are involved in the activity. After the activity, post it on the
              Internet as a video or in pictures, preferably on Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee's</span> web page Singapore Democrat. This way others will know what you have
              done; they will hopefully be emboldened and do the same just as you
              did. The idea is to get more and more involved in some sort of
              political protest. This will bring about change.<br><br>I understand
              that the government cannot block the Internet in Singapore. They have
              tried and failed. Whether they like it or not, they have to accept the
              overwhelming criticism against them on the Internet. With more and more
              Singaporeans becoming Internet savvy, they are unable to stop the
              hatred against them on the Internet spreading.<br><br>Remember, now it a situation of them and us. Them, being the moneyed millionaires who are Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his chosen friends in government. They take millions of
              dollars. They are the only ones happy with this dictatorial regime.
              Then there is us. That is, the overwhelming majority of Singaporeans
              like you, who are not millionaires, and can never hope to be. You live
              at the pleasure of Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_18" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew. And you will starve, if Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew wishes it. Many of you are nearly in that position now. And without any rights.<br><br>Now the ground is ripe for change. The people of Singapore hate this dreaded government. If you act now, you will succeed.<br><br>Thanks for reading.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br>39737 Paseo Padre Parkway, Suite A1<br>Fremont, CA 94538, USA<br>Tel: 510 657 6107<br>Fax: 510 657 6914</blockquote>
