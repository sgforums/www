If Msians work in Msia they also have to pay EPF. Over the years S$ saved in CPF in Singapore has doubled in value compared to ringgit. Besides, to many of them it is saver to put the money with the spore government than the msian government. So are the Msians complaining? NO, unless they were allowed to withdraw the money out and go straight into their individual bank account. If it is to each individual account, then it does not benefit the Msian government!! Why are they bargaining?<br><br>The point is that if the CPF money were to be transferred, it would go to the Msians EPF accounts, not straight into the Msians pocket!!! The Msians government will have a lot of money to build a few more towers or bridges but it does not benefit the Msians CPF account holders. That explains why no sound from the Msians CPF members and they are still coming to work in Spore and pay CPF!!<br><br>It should be noted that CPF pays members 2.5% for ordinary account, and 4% for special account, while banks pay for saving 0.125%. That is why Singapore government is asking us to invest our CPF money.<br><br>There is no doubt that the CPF money, legally and rightfully belongs to the members, sporeans and msians. Do the msians account holders want the money in CPF or EPF? and if msians were allowed early withdrawal then wouldnÂ’t sporeans be disadvantaged? It may be a matter of time before msians are treated like all foreign workers, but before that, we donÂ’t have to give up our bargaining chip.<br></div>

Do the Malaysian govt give a damn about them other than the bumiputra? CPF is like a long term safe deposit with a good interest rate - anyone who know better will want to leave their money there for a while and withdraw it when they are 55 years old.<br><br>Singapore , herself , is  vulnerable because if Malaysia cuts off Singapore's water supply - that's it . The population will be in trouble - that is why we have new water ( recycled shit water)  and the govt is exploring options before we run out of water. Singapore , sadly , doesn't have any bargaining power over Malaysia because of water.<br><br>Frankly it is a give and take situation  until we can find a better option of getting potable water- look after Malaysia and get along with her rather than to argue with Malaysia and get our water supply cut off .</div>

How is it that the Malaysian government is making the claim? We have PR from so many different countries.<br><br>Agree there is no evidence that any one can be safer than the other. My conclusion comes from Malaysians whom I know and they made that judgement comparing how the two governments spent money and the reserve of each country. One can still argue that Malaysia has more resources than Singapore, but the question remains is the Malaysian government carrying out the wishes of the Malaysian with CPF in Singapore?<br><br>Once money is transferred, there is no return. Malaysia can agree to open their airspace to RSAF today, but tomorrow they can close it again, like what they did before. That is why I agree that we should not give away easily.<br></div>

It should remain where it is until time for withdrawl according to existing rules.<br><br>The money was collected over the years by the Singapore government and held for the Malaysian. Every cent plus interest is accounted for, and will be returned to the rightful account holder when it is due. Thats alot of hard work.<br>Over the years the amount has risen to billions.<br><br>Now the Malaysian government want to take over the Malaysian accounts. Just like that.<br>You think Singapore government so stupid.<br><br>The Singapore government prefers to return the money to the Malaysian worker and have the worker undertake not to return to Singapore to work again. This is not good because this would reduce the manpower available to Singapore.<br>The Malaysian government want the money transfered to them (the Malaysian government),not to the Malaysian workers.<br>Sorry not so easy lah, Billions of dollars collected painstakingly and held over the years handed to them, just like that. If not they continue to bully Singapore. It won't work.<br>No way Singapore government will collect money for the Malaysian government.<br><br>But things can be worked out. Thats the Singapore attitude.<br>The Malaysian government, they want eazy money.<br>Billions of it.<br><br></div>
