              <p>Two days ago, I googled for a Singapore's community site to post birthday greetings to our  Singapore Founding Father Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and chanced upon this site.</p>
              <p>Emailed my friend Joyce Tan yesterday to share her insights in this forum and appended below is excerpts of her response and the article she would like to share with everyone:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">When I was a little child, we live in a small rented flat in Toa Payoh. My parents could only afford to buy chicken and new clothings/shoes for the children during Chinese New Year. Never tasted prawns before during my childhood days. My dad cycled to work everyday, regardless of the weather....no TV, fridge, washing machine, telephone.....Due to the foresight and leadership of MM Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore was transformed from a poor, smelly, chaotic country into one of the cleanest, safest, richest, and most efficient big cities in the world. I and my family are grateful for the vision shown by our beloved wise leader and the PAP for the harmonious and wonderful lives we now lead... Many people from other countries still have to go overseas to work as labourers to earn a living...</span></p>

              <p>While watching a Discovery Channel presentation of The <a style="text-decoration: underline! important;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.articlediscovery.com/blog/2007/02/09/leadership-in-singapore-lee-kuan-yew/#"><span style="color: #3c657b;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 8.3pt; font-family: Georgia;">History</span></span></a> of Singapore a few days ago I was once again impressed about the vast difference in results that are obtained by visionary <a style="text-decoration: underline! important;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.articlediscovery.com/blog/2007/02/09/leadership-in-singapore-lee-kuan-yew/#"><span style="color: #3c657b;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 8.3pt; border-bottom: 1px solid; font-family: Georgia; background-color: transparent;">leadership</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>One of the great leaders of the 20th century was Lee Kuan Yew, former Prime Minster of Singapore from 1965 until 1990. Under Mr Lee’s leadership Singapore was transformed from being a sleepy third world island nation with rather dismal prospects of even surviving as a city nation state into a thriving Asian tiger economy.</p>
              <p>How was this accomplished? Can the effort be duplicated by larger more populated nations?</p>
              <p>The answer to the first question is that from the beginning of Lee Kuan Yew’s term in office he insisted that whatever economic activity that Singapore engaged in must make <a style="text-decoration: underline! important;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.articlediscovery.com/blog/2007/02/09/leadership-in-singapore-lee-kuan-yew/#"><span style="color: #3c657b;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 8.3pt; font-family: Georgia;">economic</span></span></a> sense and rather quickly make profits. He insisted that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/news/news/2000/lee_kuan_yew.htm"><span style="color: #3c657b;">Singapore find it’s own way</span></a> and not blindly follow in the footsteps of other nations. Thus while Singapore was in many ways run as a socialist society the state owned enterprises had to quickly prove themselves by being profitable.</p>
              <p>An example of this is Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines was profitable against all odds because even thought state owned it made it’s own rules for operating and frequently did things totally out of the ordinary compared toÂ airline industry norms.</p>
              <p>Singapore replaced it’s aircraft fleet far earlier in the operation cycle compared to other airlines. And people the world over preferred to fly on Singapore Airlines because for one thing it’s fleet was fresh and extremely well maintained.</p>
              <p>The cabin crews were trained longer than at other airlines. They were young, attractive, could speak several <a style="text-decoration: underline! important;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.articlediscovery.com/blog/2007/02/09/leadership-in-singapore-lee-kuan-yew/#"><span style="color: #3c657b;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 8.3pt; font-family: Georgia;">languages</span></span></a>, and attentive. The “Singapore Girl” with their excellent service became the standard for excellence in the airline industry.</p>
              <p>Another example of Lee Kuan Yew’s enlightened leadership is that while the majority of housing in Singapore was build by state owned enterprises rental of the properties was discouraged. Instead the apartments were sold to Singapore residents and the decline so often seen in the condition of state owned rental properties worldwide was completely avoided. The new home owners took pride in their homes, their communities, and in Singapore.Â </p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew knew that to attract world leaders in business to set up operations in Singapore you needed a well trained disciplined work force, a friendly business regulatory environment, the free exchange and ability to repatriate currencies, English speaking workers, and a viable banking system and good <a style="text-decoration: underline! important;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.articlediscovery.com/blog/2007/02/09/leadership-in-singapore-lee-kuan-yew/#"><span style="color: #3c657b;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 8.3pt; font-family: Georgia;">infrastructure</span></span></a>, especially in transportation and communications. With great foresight andÂ careful planning all of these things were provided by Singapore.</p>
              <p>Can Singapore’s and Lee Kuan Yew’s example be followed by other nations? Of <a style="text-decoration: underline! important;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.articlediscovery.com/blog/2007/02/09/leadership-in-singapore-lee-kuan-yew/#"><span style="color: #3c657b;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 8.3pt; font-family: Georgia;">course</span></span></a>, it is possible, even on a much larger scale. But first you need excellent enlightened leadership.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the world of today seems to have a critical shortage of qualified leadership along with enough competent bureaucrats to help plan and to oversee the implementation of the necessary efficient government infrastructure.</p>
              <p>In order for economic development to take place that is up to the standard set by Singapore you must not politicize the development process. Ministers and high ranking bureaucrats must be empowered because of their competence, not their political connections. Witness the mess that the US has made out of their occupation of Iraq to see the truth behind that statement.</p>
              <p>Today Dubai, UAE is probably the world’s leading center for new economic development. I feel certain that Dubai’s leaders spent a considerable amount of time researching the progress made by Singapore under the leadership of Lee Kuan Yew.</p>

              <p>Without PM Lee Hsien Loong and his current team, do you think
              Singapore, a small nation without any natural resources,
              could continue to thrive and survive regionally and
              globally? </p>
              <p>Leaving this forum......</p>
              <p>Best wishes to everyone.....</p>
              <p>Salute to Singapore and our wise leaders....</p>
