              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">The
                      latest Off the Cuff column in the lifestyle section of Singapore's Business Times is
                      hilarious.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">I'm
                      sure many Malaysians and Singaporeans can relate to it. Enjoy and forward it! :</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Looks
                      like I wrote this - did I?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">By
                      JAIME EE</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">MY
                      fellow lawyers, citizens and other distinguished friends who may have been
                      caught in an incriminating video or two - greetings.<span>  </span>Welcome to our workshop titled: '<strong>Never Say
                      Die Even When Your Face Is Staring At You From The Video</strong> - henceforth known as
                      the Lingam Defence.'</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> Now,
                      this is a very interesting strategy, inspired not by a famous brand of chilli
                      sauce, but by a well-known lawyer of the same name across the Causeway
                      currently caught in a judge-fixing scandal.<span>  </span>Upon watching a video allegedly of him talking on the phone and being
                      asked to confirm his identity, he told the court, '<strong>It looks like me, and the
                      voice sounds like me,' but would not say if it was him, or not him, or even
                      possibly him in the video</strong>.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> Now,
                      any armchair litigator or court kaypoh would pooh-pooh him for trying to pull a
                      fast one.<span>  </span>But, my friends, we who live
                      by the mantra 'open to interpretation' have found this to be a ground-breaking
                      defence that, with some modifications, can be used not just in court but in all
                      manner of situations that require deflection of blame.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">The
                      focus of this workshop then, is to show you how to use the Lingam Defence in
                      almost any scenario.<span>  </span>For example, in the
                      original case, it could subsequently be argued that if one does not look at
                      oneself in the mirror all the time, it is entirely possible to look at a video
                      and think 'that can't be me', especially if one's mental picture of oneself is
                      20kg lighter and with a more trendy hairstyle.<span>  </span>Alternatively, one could also be struggling with philosophical issues,
                      hence he could be referring to himself in the metaphysical sense as in 'Is that
                      really me in the mirror?<span>  </span>Or is that just
                      someone else with the same face?'</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Similarly,
                      depending on what situation you find yourself in, the same principles can
                      apply.<span>  </span>Say, for example, you are
                      presented with a video of yourself having sex with a florist-cum-personal
                      friend.<span>  </span>You could delay a public
                      resignation by arguing, 'It looks like me and uh, sounds like me, wait a
                      minute, oh wow, is that really me? Am I that athletic? I didn't know I could do
                      that . . . no no that definitely can't be me. But you know, if it was me, I
                      think I'm pretty hot.<span>  </span>But I'm not saying
                      it's me.'</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Or,
                      in another scenario where you are caught feeding monkeys in the nature reserve
                      and are being fined $4,000.<span>  </span>'Sir, it may
                      look like me and sound like I was feeding the monkeys, but have you considered
                      the possibility that I was minding my own business when a monkey which did not
                      like the bread someone else gave him, came and shoved it in my hand just before
                      I was filmed?<span>  </span>It sounds like I was
                      saying 'here, monkey, have some bread', I was actually saying, 'Eee, monkey,
                      loathsome breed'.<span>  </span>Hence, I feel that you
                      should send this tape to an overseas expert for verification and to prove that
                      it was a human who taped it and not another monkey.'</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Or,
                      in the case of a chikungunya-carrying mosquito mistaken for a dengue-causing
                      one:<span>  </span>'It looks like me and sounds like
                      me, the resemblance is so uncanny that when I look in the mirror I try to swat
                      myself.'<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">And
                      there you have it. The Lingam Defence workshop - it looks and sounds like a
                      workshop, but it may or may not have been one.<span>  </span>We might offer more, but I can't confirm or deny it.<span>  </span></span></p>
