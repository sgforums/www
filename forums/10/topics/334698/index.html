              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Can we trust them?</strong></span></p>
              <p>Nowadays,it seem we can trust no body.All the fallen big 5 investments</p>
              <p>banks In USA have been rated very good,but still fall.</p>
              <p>Again.Oz banking system has just been rated no.4 in the world.</p>
              <p>If u look at the recent saga of Oz bank gurantee,u will wander why.</p>
              <p>Even primary schools students know SG gavaman is not poor.</p>
              <p>But how come WEF Global Competitiveness Report 2008/2009</p>
              <p>ranked her Government Debt at 121 out of 131 countries?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do they think SG government owe so much $$?</span></strong></p>
              <p>Yes They do.The problem is they just look at Gross Debt,which now</p>
              <p>reach 100% GDP.SG net debt is negative,ie lot of reserves!!</p>
              <p>Remember Temasek <span style="color: #ff0000;">Net assets</span> S$160 billion,GIC well over USD$100 b etc</p>
              <p>I think our learned forumers here know SG gavaman borrows</p>
              <p>$$ not to spend,but to:</p>
              <p>----issue interest to CPF holders</p>
              <p>----borrow to invest,not to spend ,among other things</p>
              <blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Unlike</span> many other countries, the Singapore Government<span style="color: #ff0000;"> does not need</span> to finance its expenditures through the issuance of
                  government bonds as it operates a balanced budget policy and often
                  enjoys budget surpluses.</span></blockquote>
              <p>http://www.sgs.gov.sg/macro_overview/macrooverview_intro.html</p>
              <p>read recent statement by Finance Minister on change of Constitution.</p>
              <p>He talked in length about this Programme.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Will it be more realistic to comopare the <span style="color: #ff0000;">net</span> cash gavaman debt,</p>
              <p>iso of Gross Debt?Why i say cash debt.Becos almost all gavaman</p>
              <p>is carring burden of civil servants pensions which is very hard</p>
              <p>to estimate.So i just restrict to cash or cash like debts.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore ,Australia and USA---WEF just make it damn wrong<br></strong></span></p>
              <p>If u arrange in ascending order of net debt for central governemnt  in term of GDP,</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore</span>---No net debt.(wealth minimum 100% of GDP)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Australia-</span>--net debt from o% to 5%,and is counting</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">USA-</span>---74% of GDP and counting(Debt clock just break 10 trillion mark!!)</p>
              <p>But u guess how WEF ranked them,in term of Gross Debt?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>WEF arrange in ascending order of Australia,USA and Singapore!!</strong></span></p>
              <p>So,u will get the impression from this  well respected and widely quoted</p>
              <p>WEF report that SG suffer from most debts in term of GDP ,followed by</p>
              <p>USA and Australia.</p>
              <p>Even a secondary student know that SG gets SWF while USA dunt get SWF </p>
              <p>and in heavy debts.This report is a big Joke,even SG is ranked no.5</p>
              <p>in overall ranking.Smart guys will not trust this kind of report</p>
              <p>100%.So,it will be naive to believe Oz banking system is no.4 in the world!!</p>

              <p>i have no mood to see why.If WEF experts just look at % of budget</p>
              <p>to determine of ranking,then i futher discount the usefulness</p>
              <p>of this kind of Report!!</p>

              <p>Below is good essay on how to write clearly in english:</p>
              <h3>George Orwell, "Politics and the English Language,"</h3>
              <p>Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the English language is
              in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that we cannot by conscious action do anything
              about it. Our civilization is decadent and our language -- so the argument runs -- must
              inevitably share in the general collapse.</p>
              <p>It follows that any struggle against the abuse
              of language is a sentimental archaism, like preferring candles to electric light or hansom
              cabs to aeroplanes. Underneath this lies the half-conscious belief that language is a
              natural growth and not an instrument which we shape for our own purposes...</p>

              <p>Sample writing to consider on clear writing:</p>
              <p><strong><a name="4"> Chapter 4: The Pattern of Change</a></strong></p>
              <p>In order to obtain perspective we sometimes divide the culture of a<em> </em>society,
              in a somewhat arbitrary fashion, into several different aspects. For
              example, we can divide a society into six aspects: military, political,
              economic, social, religious, intellectual. Naturally there are very
              close connections between these various aspects; and in each aspect
              there are very close connections between what exists today and what
              existed in an earlier day.</p>
              <p>For example, we might want to talk about
              democracy as a fact on the political level (or aspect). In order to
              talk about it in an intelligent way we would not only have to know what
              it is today we would also have to see what relationship it has to
              earlier<em> </em>facts on the political level as well as its relationship
              to various facts on the other five levels of the society.</p>
              <p>Naturally we
              cannot talk intelligently unless we have a fairly clear idea of what we
              mean by the words we use. For that reason we shall frequently define
              the terms we use in discussing this subject.</p>
              <p><strong>The Organization of Power</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>     The military level is concerned with the
              organization of force, the political level with the organization of
              power, and the economic level with the organization of wealth. By the
              "organization of power" in a society we mean the ways in which
              obedience and consent (or acquiescence) are obtained.</p>
              <p>The close
              relationships between levels can be seen from the fact that there are
              three basic ways to win obedience: by force, by buying consent with
              wealth, and by persuasion. Each of these three leads us to another
              level (military, economic, or intellectual) outside the political
              level. At the same time, the organization of power today (that is, of
              the methods for obtaining obedience in the society) is a development of
              the methods used to obtain obedience in the society in an earlier
              period.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Major Change in the 20th Century</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>     These relationships are important because in the
              twentieth century in Western Civilization all six levels are changing
              with amazing rapidity, and the relationships between levels are also
              shifting with great speed.</p>
              <p>When we add to this confusing picture of
              Western Civilization the fact that other societies are influencing it
              or being influenced by it, it would seem that the world in the
              twentieth century is almost too complicated to understand.</p>
              <p>This is
              indeed true, and we shall have to simplify (perhaps even oversimplify)
              these complexities in order to reach a low level of understanding. When
              we have reached such a low level perhaps we shall be able to raise the
              level of our understanding by bringing into our minds, little by
              little, some of the complexities which do exist in the world itself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Military Level in Western Civilization</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>     On the military level in Western Civilization in
              the twentieth century the chief development has been a steady increase
              in the complexity and the cost of weapons. When weapons are cheap to
              get and so easy to use that almost anyone can use them after a short
              period of training, armies are generally made up of large masses of
              amateur soldiers. Such weapons we call "amateur weapons," and such
              armies we might call "mass armies of citizen-soldiers."</p>
              <p>The Age of
              Pericles in Classical Greece and the nineteenth century in Western
              Civilization were periods of amateur weapons and citizen-soldiers. But
              the nineteenth century was preceded (as was the Age of Pericles also)
              by a period in which weapons were expensive and required long training
              in their use. Such weapons we call "specialist" weapons.</p>
              <p>Periods of
              specialist weapons are generally periods of small armies of
              professional soldiers (usually mercenaries). In a period of specialist
              weapons the minority who have such weapons can usually force the
              majority who lack them to obey; thus a period of specialist weapons
              tends to give rise to a period of minority rule and authoritarian
              government. But a period of amateur weapons is a period in which all
              men are roughly equal in military power, a majority can compel a
              minority to yield, and majority rule or even democratic government
              tends to rise.</p>
              <p>The medieval period in which the best weapon was usually
              a mounted knight on horseback (clearly a specialist weapon) was a
              period of minority rule and authoritarian government. Even when the
              medieval knight was made obsolete (along with his stone castle) by the
              invention of gunpowder and the appearance of firearms, these new
              weapons were so expensive and so difficult to use (until 1800) that
              minority rule and authoritarian government continued even though that
              government sought to enforce its rule by shifting from mounted knights
              to professional pike-men and musketeers.</p>
              <p>But after 1800, guns became
              cheaper to obtain and easier to use. By 1840 a Colt revolver sold for
              $27 and a Springfield musket for not much more, and these were about as
              good weapons as anyone could get at that time.</p>
              <p>Thus, mass armies of
              citizens, equipped with these cheap and easily used weapons, began to
              replace armies of professional soldiers, beginning about 1800 in Europe
              and even earlier in America. At the same time, democratic government
              began to replace authoritarian governments (but chiefly in those areas
              where the cheap new weapons were available and local standards of
              living were high enough to allow people to obtain them)...</p>

              <p><em>Singapore's exports fell the most in 17 months in May [2008] as the island's manufacturers shipped fewer electronics and other goods to the US and Europe. Non-oil domestic exports dropped 10.5% from a year earlier, the trade promotion agency said today [17 Jun 2008]. Manufacturers across Asia face easing demand amid slowing growth in the US, the region's largest overseas market. Pharmaceutical shipments dropped 48.5% in May from a year earlier, while electronics shipments slipped 8.5%, the 16th consecutive drop. Semiconductor shipments dropped 12.6%. Sales to the European Union fell 28% in May and US shipments dropped 22.3%.</em></p>
              <p>- The Singapore economy continues to be confronted by stagflation as economic weakness persists and shows signs of actually worsening, while <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/singapore_cpi_inflation_rate_for_may_2008_continues_at_26_year_high_of_7_5"><span style="color: #993311;">inflation continues to run at 26-year highs</span></a>. As I have <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/singapore_industrial_production_unexpectedly_dropped_in_apr_2008_on_drugs_electronics"><span style="color: #993311;">commented earlier</span></a>, this is as classic as it gets regarding the definition of stagflation : stagnant or slowing economic growth in a time of rising inflation.</p>
              <p>Sure, biotech manufacturing is subject to some "lumpiness" as equipment needs to be cleaned and re-setup for the next batch of medicines, but a 48.5% drop year-on-year? This is as good as "falling off the cliff", a sinking sensation that many in the peakoiler community are very, very familiar with. And electronics? 16 consecutive drops in 16 months. They could be trying for some kind of record here, together with semiconductors. A very ugly picture, especially given that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/singapore_cpi_inflation_rate_for_may_2008_continues_at_26_year_high_of_7_5"><span style="color: #993311;">inflation is still ongoing</span></a>, and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/crude_oil_hits_140_39_record_on_nymex_as_libya_warns_of_output_cut"><span style="color: #993311;">crude oil continues to set new record highs</span></a> regularly.</p>
              <p>This is the kind of situation that can lead to restlessness amongst the population, and in extreme cases descend into disorder and chaos and in fact it already has in some countries. You can be very sure that the government has got to be very concerned about it. Meanwhile, as an individual, in order to hedge against slowing economic growth, you might want to look into getting a job in a traditionally defensive sector, such as government, military, education, healthcare, and such. And as an investor, in order to hedge against inflation, what you can do is to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/a_fund_of_my_own"><span style="color: #993311;">buy into commodities</span></a>, hold on to them, and sit tight. Gold and oil and uranium and food and other resources are going higher. Much, much higher. We ain't seen nothing yet.</p>

              <p><em>Singapore's consumer prices rose at a slower-than-expected pace last month [May 2008], reducing the need for further currency gains to rein in inflation. The consumer price index [CPI] jumped 7.5% from a year earlier, matching April's 26-year high record, the Department of Statistics said [23 Jun 2008]. The Monetary Authority of Singapore [MAS] had forecast a 5-6% inflation rate for 2008. The central bank has allowed its currency to strengthen against the US dollar, saying the exchange rate remains its most effective tool to fight inflation.</em></p>
              <p>- The Singapore inflation rate is reportedly stabilizing and analysts are already predicting that it will come down in the second half of 2008. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pDdh4Uw2rkej6LyR_3gBREQ"><span style="color: #993311;">Singapore M3 money supply</span></a> figures also appear to be stabilizing around the 12-13% level in the past half year, down from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/23_62_singapore_m3_money"><span style="color: #993311;">a high of 23.62%</span></a> in 2007. But the money supply growth rate is only half the story - the other half is its relationship to the growth of available goods and services in the economy. For the inflation rate to be stable, economic growth has to at least keep up with money supply growth. With a looming global economic slowdown and imminent worldwide recession, the economic growth factor is the big wildcard.</p>
              <p>Gold and crude oil prices may have paused from breaking new all-time record highs for the time being, but the inflationary storm is far from over as yet. We may only be passing through the eye of the hurricane here - just when people start to get lulled into complacency, the winds of inflation could well pick up with renewed force - perhaps even stronger than ever. We need to remain vigilant against inflation. This is no time to let down your guard yet.</p>

              <p>The latest Singapore money supply figures are out. For the month of Dec 2007, the Singapore M3 money supply growth has continued to slow, and it now stands at 14.14% year-on-year. However, real inflation shows no signs of abating because we are at the point where economic growth is falling (crashing) faster than M3 money supply growth is slowing. The Singapore economy is thus stuck in mud, and the stagflation formula goes as follows :</p>
              <p>14.14% M3 growth - (-4.8% economic growth) = 18.94% real inflation rate.</p>
              <p>For your reference, the money supply figures for the year of 2007 are as follows (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pDdh4Uw2rkej6LyR_3gBREQ"><span style="color: #993311;">click here for the spreadsheet</span></a> if the inline frame is not shown) :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you can see, in 2007 we have been roaring along with an average M3 money supply growth of 20.6% year-on-year. It was only in the last 3 months (Oct-Dec 2007) that the money supply growth has slowed down considerably.</p>
              <p>However, if anything else, this is even worse than the time where it was reported on this blog when <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/23_62_singapore_m3_money"><span style="color: #993311;">M3 growth hit a high of 23.62% back in Jun 2007</span></a>. At the time, GDP growth was reported to be a still-healthy 8.6% so the M3-to-GDP differential was 23.62% - 8.6% = 15.02% then.</p>
              <p>Hence, for myself and for those of you readers who subscribe to the classic Austrian-school definition of monetary inflation as money supply growth relative to economic growth, the fight to maintain our purchasing power has just gotten a lot harder, and this stagflationary environment just makes things even worse.</p>

              <p><em><strong>Trusts may still get big lift from higher rents, higher hotel rates, say analysts</strong></em>SOARING inflation across Asia has sucked the life out of real estate investment trusts (Reits), whose high-yielding dividends have made them wildly popular among investors in recent years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_YlvEjlIelzk/R79rIYLNY_I/AAAAAAAAJDE/hErJ0nHxZwM/s1600-h/1.jpg"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; cursor: hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_YlvEjlIelzk/R79rIYLNY_I/AAAAAAAAJDE/hErJ0nHxZwM/s400/1.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="160"></a><strong><span style="font-size: 85%;"><em><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Investors had wrongly penalised Reits with concerns over acquisition growth and credit-tightening conditions. They have ignored the ‘organic’ boost Reits may get from higher rents and hotel rates. - MORGAN STANLEY, in a report recommending property trusts to its clients — ST FILE PHOTO</span></span></em></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Reits, in general, have fallen about 32.5 per cent in value from their peaks last year, but those with assets in inflation-prone economies, such as China, have fared even worse, according to financial portal Shareinvestor.com.</span></span></p>
              <p>CapitaRetail China Trust, for instance, has fallen 52 per cent in four months, as inflation in China galloped to 7.1 per cent - its highest level in over a decade.</p>
              <p>Reits are financial instruments investing in real estate like shopping malls, office buildings and hotels.</p>
              <p>Investors can buy units, which are much like shares, offering attractive dividend yields of 6 per cent to 8 per cent derived from rents.</p>
              <p>This is far higher than the 1.5 per cent interest on one-year fixed deposits at a bank.</p>
              <p>Historically, a low interest rate environment has been good for Reits - if accompanied by low inflation.</p>
              <p>Take CapitaMall Trust, the first Reit listed in Singapore. Its assets include the Tampines Mall and Junction 8 shopping centres.</p>
              <p>It received an overwhelming response from investors when it listed six years ago, rising from just 96 cents in July 2002 to a record high of $4.32 in July last year. Inflation played its part by staying at a benign 1 per cent.</p>
              <p>As the consumer price index, however, surged from 1.3 per cent in June to 4.4 per cent in December, CapitaMall slid 20 per cent over the period.</p>
              <p>The inflation pressure is unlikely to abate in the near future.</p>
              <p>Last week, the Government revised its estimates upwards to between 4.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent for the year, from an earlier forecast of 3.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent.</p>
              <p>So, while fears of a United States recession are causing much grief among investors as they watch the value of their growth stocks evaporate, inflation is becoming a big threat to those with high dividend-yield plays like Reits.</p>
              <p>One trader explained: ‘A Reit may offer 6 per cent in dividend yield. But if inflation is running at 4.5 per cent, the actual yield an investor is getting is only 1.5 per cent.’</p>
              <p>To compensate for the lower return, an investor will demand a lower price for the Reit, which escalates the pressure on its share price.</p>
              <p>Still, analysts have not stopped promoting Reits, despite their lacklustre performance, to clients.</p>
              <p>Morgan Stanley made a case last month with a report arguing that investors had wrongly penalised Reits with concerns over acquisition growth and credit-tightening conditions.</p>
              <p>Investors have ignored the ‘organic’ boost Reits may get from higher rents as leases expire and hotel rates are jacked up during peak periods.</p>
              <p>Citigroup noted on Tuesday that while there may not be a clear growth strategy for Reits this year, some are trading at hefty discounts to their net asset values, despite offering single-digit or even double-digit dividend yields.</p>
              <p>‘This makes Reits potential takeover targets, if they have loose shareholding structures,’ it added.</p>
              <p>Its top picks include Ascendas Reit, Suntec Reit and Parkway Life Reit.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE, Oct 10 - Singapore has slipped into recession and the Government has revised its 2008 growth forecast to around 3 per cent from a previous estimate of 4 to 5 per cent.</p>
              <p>The economy shrank at an annualised, seasonally adjusted rate of 6.3 per cent in the third quarter, according to third quarter advance estimates released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry on Friday morning, pushing the export-dependent economy into its first recession since 2002.</p>
              <p>The government also revised down its 2008 growth forecast to around 3 per cent from a previous estimate of 4 to 5 per cent.</p>
              <p>Economists had expected the Republic to narrowly escape a recession in the third quarter by growing 1.1 per cent, lifted by a slight improvement in electronics output.</p>
              <p>A recession is often defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contractions.</p>
              <p>The deepening financial crisis, which sparked banking crises in the United States, Iceland, Britain, Germany and Ireland, is threatening to drag the world economy into recession.</p>
              <p>The advance estimate, based largely on July and August data, gives an early indication of the economy's performance during the July-September period.</p>
              <p>MTI said the Singapore economy is estimated to contract by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, than a year ago.</p>
              <p>On a seasonally adjusted, annualised quarter-on-quarter basis, real GDP declined by 6.3 per cent, following a 5.7 per cent decline in the previous quarter.</p>
              <p>On the outlook for the year, MTI said since the revised GDP forecast in August, "external economic conditions have deteriorated more than expected and some sectors of the economy have weakened significantly on account of industry-specific or domestic factors.</p>
              <p>"The worsening of the financial crisis in the US in recent weeks has deepened the credit crunch, making it more difficult for businesses to sustain economic activities. With unemployment on the rise and house prices continuing to fall, US consumer sentiment has weakened further and will affect demand for exports from Asia and the rest of the world."</p>
              <p>It added that Singapore's export-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing, will be affected, noting that Europe is also facing severe strains in the banking sector, tighter credit conditions, and adjustments in housing prices.</p>
              <p>Growth in major economies such as Germany, France, Italy and the UK has dipped sharply in the second quarter.</p>
              <p>Growth forecasts for several Asian economies, such as China, India and South Korea, have been revised downwards since the start of the year.</p>
              <p>The estimates showed that Singapore's manufacturing sector continued to be weighed down by the negative growth in biomedical sciences, as pharmaceutical companies are still producing a mix of pharmaceutical ingredients with values lower than compared to a year ago.</p>
              <p>The precision engineering and chemicals clusters have also slowed, because of weaker external demand.</p>
              <p>The construction sector grew by 7.8 per cent in the third quarter, compared to the 18.3 per cent growth in the first half of 2008. Despite a strong pipeline of construction projects, a shortage of contractors, a tight labour market for engineers and project managers, and longer waiting times for equipment, have delayed the realisation of these projects.</p>
              <p>MTI said the financial services sector is likely to see slower growth in the coming months as the ongoing global financial crisis has heightened uncertainties for sentiment-sensitive segments such as stocks trading and fund management activities.</p>
              <p>"Taking into account the slowdown in the global economy and key domestic sectors, MTI has revised the 2008 GDP growth forecast to around 3 per cent. The inflation forecast of 6 - 7 per cent for 2008 remains unchanged," it said. - The Straits Times</p>

              <p>Singapore becomes the first Asian victim of recession</p>
              <p><br><span>AFP, SINGAPORE</span><br>Saturday, Oct 11, 2008, Page 1</p>
              <p>Singapore has become the first Asian economy to fall into recession, analysts said yesterday, after the government revised downward its full-year growth estimate and eased monetary policy for the first time in years.<br><br>The Ministry of Trade and Industry lowered the city-state’s full-year growth forecast to around 3 percent, citing a slowdown in the global economy and key domestic sectors.<br><br>The move came as the ministry released preliminary data showing that real GDP declined by 6.3 percent in the third quarter after contracting 5.7 percent in the previous quarter, the ministry said.<br><br>While it did not describe the economy as being in recession, a technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction in economic output.<br><br>“Singapore will be the first Asia economy to fall into a technical recession,” DBS Group Research said in an assessment of the data.<br><br>In a move to confront the downturn, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) — its de facto central bank — said it was easing monetary policy for the first time in more than four years.<br><br>“The Singapore economy has weakened over the course of 2008, alongside an escalation in the turmoil in financial markets and a more severe deceleration in global economic activity,” MAS said.<br><br>These developments meant new uncertainties for the Singapore economy, while slower Asian growth would restrain activity in a range of service industries such as transportation and tourism, it said.<br><br>“The risks to external demand conditions continue to be on the downside and a more severe global downturn cannot be discounted,” the bank said.<br><br>Singapore is Southeast Asia’s wealthiest economy in terms of GDP per capita, but is heavily dependent on trade. This makes it sensitive to hiccups in developed economies, particularly key export markets the US and Europe.<br><br>Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter rise in GDP, the value of goods and services produced in the economy.<br><br>Compared with the third quarter of last year, the ministry said Singapore’s economy contracted by 0.5 percent in real terms, against the 0.8 percent expansion foreseen in the Dow Jones poll.</p>

              <div>SINGAPORE'S economy has slid into its first technical recession since 2002, as a slump in exports pushed quarterly growth into negative territory for the second quarter in a row.</div>
              <div>The economy shrank by a worse-than-expected 0.5 per cent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, according to estimates from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) released on Friday morning.</div>
              <p>MTI has also revised its full-year growth forecast for the second time this year, lowering it to 'around 3 per cent' from 4 to 5 per cent previously. This would make it the weakest pace in seven years.</p>
              <p>Recognising growth concerns, the Monetary Authority of Singapore also changed its policy stance to zero appreciation of the Singapore dollar, reversing the gradual appreciation policy it has adopted since 2003.</p>
              <p>On a quarterly basis, third-quarter GDP contracted 6.3 per cent from the second quarter, on top of a 5.7 per cent decline in the previous three months. A technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of decline.</p>
              <p>Manufacturing led the slowdown again this time around, weighed down by a poor performance in the biomedical sciences segment. It was also hit by weakened global demand for exports as the United States-triggered financial crisis spreads around the world.</p>
              <p>The sector shrank by 11.5 per cent in the third quarter, after declining 4.9 per cent in the previous quarter.</p>
              <p>Growth in construction and services also slowed. Construction, in particular, saw its pace of expansion halved to single-digit growth, as projects were delayed by the construction squeeze, said MTI.</p>
              <p>Services, touted as a key driver of growth this year, is likely to take a hit as well as financial services falters in the wake of the global credit crunch.</p>
              <p>Most economists expect the economy to grow even more slowly next year, with the chance of a technical recession turning into a 'real' one.</p>
              <p>'With external conditions deteriorating and the lack of domestic demand support, we expect Singapore to register no growth next year... with a muted recovery, if at all, expected only in the second half of next year at the earliest,' said Morgan Stanley economists in a report.</p>
              <p><strong>Inflation peaks</strong><br>Inflation, which reached a 26-year high earlier this year, has peaked, said MAS. Consumer prices will rise between 6 per cent and 7 per cent this year, and gains will ease to between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent in 2009, it predicted.</p>
              <p>'Against the backdrop of a weakening external economic environment and continuing stresses in global financial markets, the growth of the Singapore economy is expected to remain below potential in the period ahead,' said MAS.</p>
              <p>'Inflation is expected to trend down in 2009 as the global and domestic economies slow.'(Straits Times Singapore)</p>

              </div>
              <p>&lt;!-- /NOLImage --&gt;The recession-hit economy of Singapore has shrunk by a record 5.6% during July to September.</p>
              <p>The sharp contraction was expected by analysts, and the government is now forecasting that the economy will contract by 3% for the full year.</p>
              <p>"In the light of the uncertainty in the global economy, Singapore has now revised its full year growth forecast to minus 3.0%," said Trade Minister George Yeo.</p>
              <p>Previously the government had forecast 0.5-1.5% growth.</p>
              <p><strong>US ties</strong></p>
              <p>The country is suffering from its exposure to the US - its biggest trading partner - which is battling with its own economic problems.</p>
              <p>Last month's terrorist attacks on the US have also exacerbated problems by denting consumer confidence.</p>
              <p>"The appalling attacks on September 11 and the resulting train of events have probably tipped the global economy into a recession," said Mr Yeo.</p>
              <p><strong>Electronics downturn</strong></p>
              <p>The sharp contraction in the third quarter was blamed on the downturn in the electronics sector.</p>
              <p>The goods producing sector in the trade-driven country fell by 15% while manufacturing output fell by 21% compared with a year ago.</p>
              <p>This constitutes the sharpest fall since the 1985 recession.</p>
              <p>"From the data so far, it certainly describes the economy is in a far worse shape than it has ever been," said Song Seng Wun, a regional economist at GK Goh brokerage.</p>
              <p>However, Aberdeen Asset Management's Hugh Young told the BBC's World Business Report:"The feeling on the streets is not nearly as bad or as gloomy as it was when the Asian crisis hit. Certainly there is a lot of fear over job security right through Singapore at the moment."</p>

              <p>The Ministry of Trade and Industry also revised downwards full-year growth forecast to around 3pc, citing a slowdown in the global economy and key domestic sectors.</p>
              <p>Southeast Asia's wealthiest economy saw gross domestic product fall by 6.3pc during the third quarter having previously contracted by 5.7pc.</p>
              <p>While the ministry did not describe the economy as being in recession, a technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction in economic output.</p>
              <p>In a move to confront the downturn, the Monetary Authority of Singapore - its de facto central bank - said it was also easing monetary policy for the first time in more than four years.</p>
              <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 7.7pc last year but have been signs of a slowdown following contractions in Singapore's key manufacturing sector, which includes the country's electronic and pharmaceutical industries.</p>
              <p>Construction growth slowed to 7.8pc from 19.8pc, during the quarter, although service industries grew by 6.1pc, marginally down from 7pc in the second quarter.</p>
              <p>Singapore's last technical recession was recorded in 2002, when the economy contracted by 2.4pc during the year. The country is seen as an important indicator of economic trends in the rest of Asia due to its export-dependent economy.</p>
              <p>Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Asian economies face a "rough ride" for at least the next year as weakening consumer demand from developed countries hurt the region's exports.</p>

Goldman Sachs predicts the Singapore dollar would weaken to $1.54 to the greenback in the next six months, while UBS expects it to reach $1.50 by the end of the year, according to Bloomberg. The Singapore dollar was trading at around $1.48 yesterday evening, almost 10 per cent off its recent high of $1.35 on July 16. .............</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE manufacturers are cautious about the business prospects in the next six months, a Government survey released on Thursday showed, reflecting concerns over a slowing global economy.</p>
              <p>In the latest quarterly survey conducted by the Economic Development Board (EDB) among manufacturers, 87 per cent said the outlook for the next six months will not improve from the previous quarter when manufacturing output contracted 5.6 per cent.</p>
              <p>A separate survey by the Department of Statistics showed companies in the services sector sharing the same cautious sentiment over the six-month period.</p>
              <p>According to the survey, 24 per cent of the services firms polled expected business conditions to improve, while 22 per cent were less optimistic.</p>
              <p>The responses are weighted by operating receipts and value added.</p>
              <p>&lt;!-- show media links starting at 7th para --&gt;Chemical makers had the gloomiest outlook, with a net weighted 23 per cent of firms expecting business conditions to worsen on the back of high material costs.</p>
              <p>Producers in the general manufacturing industries, which include the food, tobacco and printing sectors, were the most optimistic, with a net weighted 11 per cent expecting business to improve.</p>
              <p>Singapore's economy shrank 6.6 per cent in the second quarter after seasonal adjustments, its biggest contraction in five years amid a slowdown in key export markets the United States and the European Union.</p>
              <p>The less positive business outlook comes against a backdrop of rising unemployment in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The jobless rate in the second quarter went up to 2.3 per cent after seasonal adjustments, compared to the previous quarter's 2 per cent, according to latest estimates released by the Ministry of Manpower on Thursday morning.</p>
              <p>The data showed that employment grew by 70,600 in the second quarter this year, which is slightly lower than the increase of 73,200 in the previous quarter.</p>
              <p>In his National Day message for Singaporean workers, NTUC chief Lim Swee Say on Thursday urged workers to moderate their wage expecations for this year, warning that pushing wages up to fully offset inflation is a risky move, as they will end up paying ever higher prices.</p>
              <p>'Instead of pushing wages up to fully offset inflation, we must continue to link built-in wage increase to productivity gain and help our people through various non-wage measures', he said.</p>
              <p>This will prevent a 'price-wage spiral', he said.</p>

              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Internet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="color: #0066cc;">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>

              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Note the bad acting, where he pretended to be "excited" and "surprised" about what he wrote himself.</span></p>
              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny, frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked. Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore shares plunged 8.33 per cent on Friday on fears of a global recession hurting corporate earnings, dealers said. <br><br>The Straits Times Index fell 145.39 points to 1,600.28. It was the index's lowest closing level since September 2003. <br><br>Volume was 1.36 billion shares. Losers led gainers 486 to 116. <br><br>"The mood on the trading floor is just terrible, the Nikkei is collapsing... There are worries over the banks' results," a trader with a local house told Dow Jones Newswires. <br><br>Japan's Nikkei index plunged more than nine per cent on Friday, coming close to its post-bubble low after the yen surged and technology giant Sony slashed its profit forecasts. <br><br>"Absolute carnage in Asia as recession fears spread like a wild fire. Risk aversion is happening on a massive scale," Knight Equity Markets vice president Ioan Smith said. <br><br>Among Singapore's leading blue chips, Singapore Airlines plunged S$1.22 to S$10.52, Singapore Telecommunications was off 22 cents to S$2.06 and Neptune Orient Lines dropped 13 cents to S$1.03. <br><br>Property stocks also closed weaker after the latest figures showed private residential property prices fell in the third quarter, the first decline in more than four years. <br><br>CapitaLand sank 19 cents to S$2.58, City Developments retreated 46 cents to S$6.10 and Keppel Land was nine cents lower at S$1.59. <br><br>As for banks, DBS gave up 94 cents to S$10.04, United Overseas Bank lost S$1.72 to S$12.08 and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp was down 61 cents at S$4.88. - AFP/ms </span></p>
