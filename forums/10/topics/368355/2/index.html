              <p>But after saying that, corruption is good if the fellow citizens also enjoy the fruits of corruption, with the situation in Singapore the past few decades, we had been in good times, unlike other country whereby the top is corrupted but the below are living in dust and dirt.</p>

              <p><br>Correct, the Indonesian military do have power to change the govt but it is past matter. Matter relating to internal security which used to be role of the Indonesian military has been transfered to the cops. In fact, some of the Indonesian students have gone to Malaysia and I personally knew some of them. In fact if ur claim that the military is the one behind changing govt, u think the present president could have been voted back for a second term? Who chose the president? The military? How do u explain the fact in 04 Indonesian election, Megawati could have been defeated in the poll. The military is more supportive of Megawati than the present president. The Caucasian saying about plenty of Indonesian is that plenty of them seek refuge in here but most of them went back to Indonesia after that. In fact, many of the Indonesian go other countries to study university.</p>

              <p>Boy this Malaysian idiot's article is filled with so many more holes than Swiss cheese, it's stupid.</p>
              <p>A writer like that doesn't even understand basic economics, military and politics but gets to publish this crap ... no wonder M'sia is so screwed up.</p>
              <p>I'll juz address 1 point, where got time to edit this writer's shitty article (which I actually read in full), his/her editor is just as shitty to allow it to go to print?</p>
              <p>Getting the US navy to help patrol the Malacca Straits is a way to cut off all trade/shipping to China? How dumb can that statement be?</p>
              <p>Malaysia and Indonesia are so incompetent they cannot even guarantee the safety of shipping in the Straits between them. Their navies and govt can't even do anything about the pirates operating from their coastal villages or the terrorists bombing Bali and Jakarta, this Malaysian writer wants to whine?</p>
              <p>World trade will be affected if there is a major terrorist attack in the Straits u idiot writer! It'll obviously affect Singapore, so rather than wait for those 2 idiot countries to get their act together, which will be in the year 3000 A.D., we do the right thing by getting the world's strongest navy to do it for us and the region and the world. G.E.D.D.I.T.?!?!</p>
              <p>The global economy is so closely linked that if China's economy goes belly up, the US will bleed dry. Hell M'sia will go bankrupt too. The US needs China more than the other way round. China is the no. 1 lender of money to the US in the way of US Treasury Bonds owned for Pete's sakes.</p>
              <p>In times of war with any country, the US Navy chief role is to blockade. Why block the Malacca Straits just to spite China? How to stop shipments to China from other Asian countries and South American oil, metals, food? What an ass... a naval blockade of China will  obviously be implemented along China's coastline,  easily done by US carrier battle groups based in Japan or the Philipines!</p>
              <p>As for the rest,  if I ever feel very eng, I might come back to slam this sphincter of a clown.</p>

              <p>The global economy had thrived before Deng Xiao-peng opened China's doors and offered itself as the sweat shop for the world's manufacturers.</p>
              <p>Do you think that the World cannot reverse back to where it was if China remain intransigent about following fair trade practices by disadvantaging other countries while she enjoy the highest surplusses every year ?</p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe that in a mutually dependent global economy, the USA needs China more then China needs the USA ?</p>
              <p>It certainly show up the shallow thinking of a poppy-cock raring to release a full broadside aimlessly.</p>
              <p>If only you will allow yourself to fill the holes in your brain you will note that China requires technology that it does not possess, and a market for all the products that she can produce cheaper than anyone.</p>
              <p>No other country has the capacity to consume what China can produce except for the USA; and the USA can easily replace the cheap Chinese labor by retooling the long neglected US industries to reignite its manufacturing efficiency and re-absorb the large number of unemployed.</p>
              <p>China will face a formidable competitor in the USA that possess the technology, the knowledge in R &amp; D that produce new products, and when pushed to the wall the USA has shown itself to be able to rebound and face the challenge.</p>
              <p>If one relook at the US strategy in allowing China to buy the Treasury Notes - which over the years are usually reserved for selected allied countries - there seem to be a hidden agenda to get China to sink their trade surplus deeper into the USA.</p>
              <p>This is another way of getting the US Currency to return to the USA when China has no wish to adjust its currency to allow for fair trade to exist between the two countries that result in a lop sided trade balance in China's favor.</p>
              <p>The US strategy seems to have worked, as China's PM Wen Jia-bao has already publicly stated China's deep concern with US Government ability to turn the US economy around to stop the US currency from losing any more value - as it will affect the value of the huge holdings of US Treasury Bonds, and the huge Chinese surplus held in US Currency.</p>

              <p>Your method of coastal blockade predates the sail galleons of the 17th century, and your lack of familiarity in naval technological advancement in the 21st Century has resulted in the fool's vision of confronting a formibable opponent by placing all the naval assets in a row for China's sophisticated military response in kicking your butt.</p>
