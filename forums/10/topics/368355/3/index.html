              <div class="quote_body">
              <p> </p>
              <p>Big talk from a small fry who would not even attempt to write a
                  serious article but will know how to critic without even the
                  slightest idea about geo-politics.</p>
              <p>If you cannot understand how jealously the Malaysians and the
                  Indonesians guard their territorial waters and keep the US Navy
                  from interfering in law enforcements - it will be
                  interesting for you to find out how the Americans and the
                  Canadians will react to the Russian efforts in planting their flag
                  below the North Pole.</p>
              <p>Obviously, you know too little about the the reactions from the
                  USA and the Canadians towards the Russians attempt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Throughout 2008, without any help from the US Navy - the
                  naval vessels from Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand has managed to
                  keep the piracy levels down from the tip of Northern Sumatra
                  through the Straits of Malacca; and at the southern end - there is
                  the naval co-operation between the navies of Singapore, Malaysia
                  and Indonesia that had kept our end of the Straits incident
                  free.</p>
              <p>If the Indonesian are idiots when they could not keep the
                  surreptitious terrorists from bombing Bali, then by
                  comparison - Singapore must received the super title of buffoons
                  for  the tremendous job in letting a captive terrorist
                  skip out of jail and limp out of this tiny red dot, and
                  waddle across the Johor Straits to Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Brilliant intelligent thinking from a juvenile brain that
                  must resemble the holes in a block of cheese.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The global economy had thrived before Deng Xiao-peng opened
                  China's doors and offered itself as the sweat shop for the world's
                  manufacturers.</p>
              <p>Do you think that the World cannot reverse back to where it was
                  if China remain intransigent about following fair trade practices
                  by disadvantaging other countries while she enjoy the highest
                  surplusses every year ?</p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe that in a mutually dependent
                  global economy, the USA needs China more then China needs the USA
                  ?</p>
              <p>It certainly show up the shallow thinking of a poppy-cock raring
                  to release a full broadside aimlessly.</p>
              <p>If only you will allow yourself to fill the holes in your brain
                  you will note that China requires technology that it does not
                  possess, and a market for all the products that she can
                  produce cheaper than anyone.</p>
              <p>No other country has the capacity to consume what China can
                  produce except for the USA; and the USA can easily replace the
                  cheap Chinese labor by retooling the long neglected US
                  industries to reignite its manufacturing efficiency and re-absorb
                  the large number of unemployed.</p>
              <p>China will face a formidable competitor in the USA that possess
                  the technology, the knowledge in R &amp; D that produce new
                  products, and when pushed to the wall the USA has shown itself to
                  be able to rebound and face the challenge.</p>
              <p>If one relook at the US strategy in allowing
                  China to buy the Treasury Notes - which over the years are usually
                  reserved for selected allied countries - there seem to be a
                  hidden agenda to get China to sink their trade surplus deeper
                  into the USA.</p>
              <p>This is another way of getting the US Currency to return to
                  the USA when China has no wish to adjust its currency to allow for
                  fair trade to exist between the two countries that result in a lop
                  sided trade balance in China's favor.</p>
              <p>The US strategy seems to have worked, as China's PM Wen
                  Jia-bao has already publicly stated China's deep concern with
                  US Government ability to turn the US economy around to stop the US
                  currency from losing any more value - as it will affect the
                  value of the huge holdings of US Treasury Bonds, and the
                  huge Chinese surplus held in US Currency.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Obviously, you are no strategiest, and practically
                  have no clue in the strategic use of naval assets.</p>
              <p>Your method of coastal blockade predates the sail galleons of
                  the 17th century, and your lack of familiarity in naval
                  technological advancement in the 21st Century has resulted in
                  the fool's vision of confronting a formibable opponent by placing
                  all the naval assets in a row for China's sophisticated
                  military response in kicking your butt.</p>
              <p>If ever you have the energy, try reading the basics of naval
                  warfare and politics between nations in the 21st Century
                  before you are made to look like an ass.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, is there any Democracy in Singapore to support your statement ?</p>
              <p>Democracy in Singapore has been non-existent when LKY set out to bastardise the Singapore Constitution into a useless piece of printed document that nullify all the clauses into unrecogniseable forms from the intended spirit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From the beginning of LKY's entry into Singapore Politics, he had set his priority of removing all forms of political threats.</p>
              <p>First, he set out to arrest all those who threaten his political position by initial attempts to persuade the British Colonial Government to use the ISA to arrest his political rivals.</p>
              <p>When the Colonial Government declined, he got Tunku Abdul Rahman to jointly urged the Colonial Government to arrest those who LKY falsely accused to be Communists - so as not jeopardise the dream of a greater Malaysia that LKY planted in the simple mind of a playboy Tunku.</p>
              <p>Having arrested his political rivals, LKY sought to neutralise the threats from a politically active citizenry, and he did this through several ingenious measures - by bastardising the Singapore Constitution, controlling the number of tertiary educated graduates with fertile minds that will challenge his position, neutralising private capital that support any political parties, and neutralise a citizenry's political instincts by hard and soft methods.</p>
              <p>The all encompassing method was briefly outlined in an interview when LKY explained the potent threats from an educated class of citizenry - unless their "<strong>stomachs are filled so as to dull their minds</strong>"..</p>
              <p>It is obvious that LKY and the PAP met their goals set in the early 1960s, as evident by the stupendous pseudo-intellectual display in your satisfaction that LKY and the PAP has offered Singaporeans <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"most of Maslow's hierarchy - in proper order!"</span></em>.</p>
              <p>We certainly must have a classic gullible Singaporean fool bred by LKY and PAP to be a pseudo intellectual with well drilled stereo-typified ability to only compare Singapore with the worst that exist in the Third World, and to ignore what Singapore can be by comparing with the brilliant successes of the First World.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When there is no Democracy to make any reference to - what offer in Maslow's Heirarchy did LKY or his PAP made that has been met ?</p>
              <p>After 52 years at the helm of Singapore politics - has LKY and the PAP met the basic of Maslow's heirarchy ?</p>
              <p>What is the position of Singaporeans today, compared to 1957 ?</p>
              <p>Were Singaporeans not owning homes in 1957, or were those homes demolished by LKY's plan of making 90 per cent of Singaporeans dependent on the PAP Government for housing ?</p>
              <p>Why the deliberate action of forcing 90 per cent of Singaporeans to be dependent on public housing - which are over-priced even as these are built on land seized from Singaporeans, and with the infrastructure and the buildings constructed from the enforced CPF saving made available at cheap 2.5 percent interest per annum ?</p>
              <p>Why should the PAP Government ruthlessly pass legislature to seize private land, re-zone areas for development that nullify land titles, and force land owning Singaporeans to become industrial workers ?</p>
              <p>Were the jobless numbers in 1957 as high as they are today in 2009 ?</p>
              <p>Were Singaporeans struggling to make ends meet in 1957, or are we not seeing the situation of income disparity become even wider today ?</p>
              <p>Can future Singaporeans ever get to receive in hard cash the accumulated CPF funds that will surely meet anyone's ultimate objective in Maslow's Heirarchy, or are all Singaporeans being led into a huge Ponzi bubble waiting to explode with an ever reducing birth rate and an ever increasing aged group?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From the perspective of a common Singaporean, it would seem that LKY and his PAP cronies have achieved THEIR own Maslow's Heirarchy at the expense of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you intend to piss anyone off - try pissing at the end of a rope and suck on it.</p>

              <p>But then LKY wants everyone to learn English as 1st language,so as to show off to ppl his proficiency in English.</p>
              <p>But now,English is such an important language that almost every country around the world are imposing it as a "Must learn language".But surprisingly,Lee Kuan Yew want his countrymen n women to learn back their own language.So that he can show off to ppl again that he know both English n his mother tongue well.</p>
              <p>To sum it up,whatever Lee Kuan Yew does,its all about himself n his trying to show off character.</p>

              "Because PAP does have capable people in their ranks, just because the senior leaders are screwed up, doesn't mean that every member of PAP is corrupt.

              Never be so sure.
