"we're not referring to you, we're referring to rafflesians in GENERAL," they say.<br>the fact is, all the rafflesians they have met are fine. they're making unprovable statements based on some random people on the street.<br>i know this because they told me.<br>these are people that they dont even know.<br>people that they dont even bother to understand.<br>period.</div>
