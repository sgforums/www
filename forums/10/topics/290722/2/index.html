So when rentals go up, you are not affected because you have your house and you have something for your old age to retire by,' he said in response to a concern raised by a party activist on the rising cost of living.<br><br>There is also Workfare, he added, which sees the Government topping up the wages of low-income workers.<br><br>For example, those who earn $1,000 a month would get $1,000 plus of 'hongbao' from the Government a year in cash, CPF and Medisave, and this goes on continually.<br><br>But while these policies are important and helpful to the people, he believed the Government can do a better job in explaining them to Singaporeans.<br><br>He said that while the fine print of policies can be complicated, the principle behind them is not.<br><br>'The principle is to help yourself - you work, the Government will help you. But you must make the effort, and that is how Singapore will succeed. That is how you will succeed,' he said.<br><br>'And I think that is an approach that has worked for the economy, for the country, and we must keep that.'<br><br>Mr Lee was on a nine-member panel in the 90-minute dialogue at the meeting for cadres to speak on issues and challenges the party has to tackle.<br><br>Flanked by PAP chairman Lim Boon Heng, five MPs and a pair of activists, the PM tackled concerns that centred on the convention's catchy theme, 'Young and old, high and low', which refers to Singapore's ageing society and the growing income gap.<br><br>Mr Lee noted that Singapore's approach to battle the wealth divide has attracted the attention of other countries.<br><br>Referring to his recent interview with Chosun Ilbo, he said the South Korean top daily printed almost everything he said and displayed it over two pages.<br><br>Major newspapers and magazines in the West such as the Economist have also written about Singapore's changes, he said.<br><br>Urging the party to continue to serve Singaporeans so that it can win their support, he said: 'You are wearing white because it is a symbol that you care...and you are not just sitting there and letting somebody else take charge of the train.'<br><br>shpeh@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>AFFORDING THE BASICS</strong><br><br>'We help, we do a lot, but we don't help by keeping the prices individually controlled.
