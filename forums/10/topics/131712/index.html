Many have since become singaporean. If we can't get along with malaysian, i don't think we can get along with anybody else.<br><br>what you described here is most likely an isolated case of a bad boss, a lousy supervisor, a poor manager, he can be a malaysia, a singaporean or anybody. For there are good guys, bad guys and the assholes among malaysian, and singaporeans. That's life and you friends mom obviously knows it and know how to handle the situation.<br><br>Lets not generalize because of one incident.</div>
