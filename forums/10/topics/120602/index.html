            <div class='col-md body'><br>It depends on what you wanted for your kid and with that kind of edu, can the kid go to upper sec and catch up.  Children adapt to change quite easily but as people always like to remain status quo.  Most public school teachers are like this... they are just there for the $.  Its hard to find any passionate ones left...<br><br>Its not important what the school teaches but its more important to influence in your child that its a good thing to learn and imbue in him the curiosity to go learn and go seek information for himself...  but if the teachers are unprofessional, then you guys as parents can influence him more at home.  Schools only provide basics and if that's the case, then really, you guys got to be more actively involved. But if you want to change his school, you guys better do it sooner than later. And also, explain to him why you are doing this. Get him involved in the change process as well and coach him during the change and also recognise the possible loss, and other feelings that will occure during the change.<br><br>I might be wrong but I have this feeling that schools in the north is more catered to Jorhorians?<br><br>If you ask me, education starts at home.  I was very disciplined bcause that's what I see in my parents.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You may be right lor...  Still, when it comes to this sort of things, the normal advise is to leave alone if it doesn't affect the child too much.  On the other hand, a change of school may be good for him.  Will listen to your advise and chat with my wife and we will then sit down to discuss his future...

            <div class='col-md body'>Last year I met my elder son school principal.  He was telling us the the "N" level is coming and that we have to start monitoring our children study blah blah blah... As thought we don't know.  What I was interested is what the school is going to do on it part.   Finally, the principle say, to get tution of our kids,  That is the only way and practical way. He himself a school principal also get tutor for his children.  For him, he set aside something like 1 k every month.  He say this money cannot be save.  I was damn fed up.  Does this mean the school can wash hand ???  I did not meet the principal personally as I know I'll likely to f him.....<br><br>See, even principal behave like tat, how to expect the teacher to do a good job.  I didn't blame them for my son failure. Afterall, he is the one taking the exam and he have to study for it, but the support should be coming from the school, instead the school is interested in holding my son back and say he dye his hair. ( HIs hair is naturally light brown ).  Then want him to dye black or get letter from Doctor to say his hair is natural...  CAn you believe that ?  He was sick and bought a black jacket to wear when the weather was cold.  He was asked to bring a brown one or not to bring at all....!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>If the principal is like that... consider very carefully the kind of school the kid is in. Principlas set the mood, goals and values of the school  ...   I was lucky enough to get into private school and was very luck to be in good public schools as well.<br><br>Here's the real deal. I had a fren in teaching line. After 1 year of teaching, all her passion died and she just stuck in teaching cause there was no where else to go because she gave up her I.T. cause she hated I.T. .. she just can't deals with the pressure and tot idealistically she like children and got into teaching. And after that year, she hated the school children except her own.<br><br>Now, if the children needed extra coaching outside of school to make up for the bad  teaching in school, then might as well save up and stop sending the child to school ...  This is totally not correct anymore! My mom sent me to mission schools (I am not xtian) cause somehow these schools usualy are run with a (xtian) value system that is slightly better than public schools. I just keep a open mind...<br><br>For most schools, most are extremely inflexible unless you're talking about private schools. I don't mind some discipline but it must be reasonable and flexible. However, most schools just penalise the child for reasons not in his control and makes the kid feel inadequate and thus develop poor self image...<br><br>My bf has naturally curly hair .. imagine having hair like this in school where ever teacher accuse him of perming his hair. To add to the issue, he's got that kind of gangster face .. so he gets picked on by the teachers simply because of his looks. For me, I look gong gong.. so teachers don't bug me.<br></div>

His Chinese so bad and the stupid teacher always scold for his poor Chinese.  Actually, we are at  fault becaue at home we don't speak Chinese mah...

Started my kids on Chinese tuition from young. It makes a difference to start them early. Expose them to Chinese programmes &amp; pop songs. Get them to attend group tuition in  lang sch. with Beijing teachers, it abt $100 p/mth. don't stress them &amp; they will produce results.</div>

Now the tution side have been cancelled....  no more vacancies, in the mean time, the remedial is off indefinately.  Before, the start of the remedial, already got problem.  Spoke to the VP and had heated arguement.  It seem we owe them a living....   My experience with the school is, you even go personally and leave message, they never call back.  When you confront them with it, they can give all kind of excuses.  They thought we are all primary school students....  The excuses is damn very lame ....   Anyway, your suggestion is worth considering.  Got to check with my wife and seek her opionion too...  Thanks ....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my daughter is in pri 5 studying in a neighbourhood school. nowadays her english teacher conducts remedial classes at 9 am, my daughter studies in the afternoon session, and then her higher chinese teacher conducts remedial classes at 7.45pm till 9 pm. when my daughter comes back home, she has to complete piles of homework before sleeping at around midnight. and remedial class again the next day. i don't envy her. but nothing i, as a parent, can do to stop this nonsense, cos from what i know, the other kiasu parents were pretty supportive of it. and by the way, not all classes got night lessons though. only the best two classes of her cohort. i hope this is not their way of making the better students 'elite'. i rather my daughter is enjoying a less stressful childhood.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>oh, another neighbourhood school nearby also has night classes. so i wonder what's up with that.</div>
