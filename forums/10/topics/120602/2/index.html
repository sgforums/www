When he was in primary one.. he sent a book flying at this poor teacher cos she ignored him when he tried to call her.<br><br>Got a lot of phone calls from form teacher to discuss about son's improvement, mostly at night. Hubby went down to see principal a few times also.<br><br>Now son is Primary two, sitting just right in front of the teacher. Having two desk for his own cos he is super messy with his books.<br><br>I know my son well, hard to control  and tolerate his nasty temper at times.

My daughter was with this neighborhood school who want to excel in art.  They were raising fund fot the new school. so they hold musical night and all students expect to pay for tickets to go.  Even students participating in the concert and got no chance at all to see the musical got to pay...  The school deduct from edusave even without the parents consent !!!  This go on for two years until someone cannot tahan anymore, complain to press.  There was a report but the school dismiss the whole episode as mistake on one of the staff for deducting without consent.  MOE did not even bother to check on it..  The school got away scot free.  Meanwhile my daughter edusave becomes zero....  This was about two to three years ago...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NO offence to the better neighbourhood schools but I thank God that I never stepped foot in their hallways.Mission schools have been a big part of my upbringing and I seriosuly shake my head at the calculating ways the schools and society is inculcating in our youth, rat race being uppermost on their minds, and a lack of care and concern for their classmates.<br><br>Geez.If you have the money, please send your kids to an international school or send them to a mission school.</div>
