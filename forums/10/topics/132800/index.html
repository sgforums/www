            <div class='col-md body'>Do you think it's feasible to implement the American system of tipping in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">restaurants</span> in Singapore? (Excluding fast food outlets, since there isn't that much service as compared to the service in restaurants where the waiter hands you the menu, takes your order and brings your food &amp; bill to you).<br><br>Currently in Singapore, tipping is not illegal but officially discouraged. The result of this is the increasingly abysmal service standards in Singapore, as imposing a standard service charge encourages lousy service Â– if servers are not going to get more money by devoting extra time and attention to customers, they probably will not bother doing so.<br><br>Recently. there have been a spate of complaints from members of the public regarding negligent waiters and the poor standard of service in Singapore in general. Therefore, should the Singapore government reconsider its no-tipping policy in keeping with its movement toward providing a more service-orientated industry which will reflect well on Singapore, especially as it seeks to attract more tourists?</div>

However, like you said, it's worth a try. Recent charity events have shown that Singaporeans can actually be quite generous, and if the tipping system is introduced <strong>in place of the standard 10% service charge</strong>, I'm sure more customers would be willing to tip in accordance to the service they received.</div>

Still, I feel that some Singaporeans may prefer to tip in accordance to the service they get; and will be more than happy to give a substantial tip if they receive good service rather than having to pay a standard service charge regardless of service quality. This is a form of progression toward a more friendly, compassionate society isn't it? (:<br><br>Also, as the government seeks to make Singapore more service-oriented and famed for having quality tertiary industries, this is one way of improving service. A rise in service standards may also make Singapore a more pleasant place to live in!</div>
