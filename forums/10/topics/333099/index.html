              <p><br>How you know there is no fraud?</p>
              <p>Were the leaders honest?</p>
              <p>If not honest, how confident to say that there is no fraud?</p>
              <p>I am a layman but its also quite obvious that my concerns are valid.</p>
              <p>Did they inform their investors about the potential problems?</p>
              <p>Lets be blunt and honest, does audit prevent frauds? does sarbanes oxley etc prevent frauds? Are there loopholes? I think accounting is full of tricks.</p>
              <p>You cannot deny that a rotten company can show investors and all auditors they are healthy. Can you please tell me what you think about this statement and then advise on the efficacy of Auditing , accounting and compliance rules in preventing Frauds ?</p>
              <p>I am sure frauds cannot be prevented by current systems. why ?</p>

              <p>Okay I didn't say there were no fraud in Lehman brothers. Just that there are no facts currently to say that fraud exists within lehman brothers that led to their downfall. Although the CIA seems to be investigating</p>
              <p>Enron created SPE's for the purpose of misleading their users. Worldcomm inflated its profits to mislead it's investors. Lehman brothers fell because their MTM derivatives fell, that by no means constitute to fraud.</p>
              <p>Well in order to determine whether leaders were honest, that is why corporate governance came into place. Whether the leaders were honest or trying to hide the losses are again, not proven.</p>
              <p>Let's assume that lehman brothers informed their investors of the problems, how many of them would sell their shares and speculate in short selling? Short selling is  an ethical issue, not a fraud issue. And that is what happed to some banks like HBOS.</p>
              <p>Auditing will to a certain extent prevent fraud. But it depends on the independence of the auditors.</p>
              <p>Sabox and comply or explain will not prevent fraud totally. But a little bit of control is better than nothing right? That is why CG exist to provide more transparency to its stakeholders. Anyway this issue has been going on and on and it's not up to me to decide whether it works.</p>
              <p>Well you mentioned accounting is full of tricks, maybe that's why IASB keeps revising it's accounting standards. (30+ changes in FRS next year). They are covering on all the loopholes faster than some companies are able to exploit them.</p>
              <p>Yes a rotten company will not care about showing them being a healthy company when in fact they are not. Well u mentioned efficiency, but I suppose u want to mean effectiveness. Imagine a financial statement drawn up in a way the company would want, would it even be more correct and as the law and auditor terms it, 'true and fair'?</p>
              <p>Yes fraud cannot be prevented totally by our curent systems, but that's because greed exist in humans as i keep emphasing in all my posts. That, is not the fault of the system but the company itself. And that is why CG auditor and accounting standards are constantly revising to prevent such things from happening again. But again fraud will repeat and new revisions will appear, and the cycle goes on and on...</p>
              <p>Does that answer your question?</p>

              <p>Cannot means cannot. Cannot prevent all frauds means cannot prevent all frauds.</p>
              <p>Not transparent means not transparent. Don't say 50% transparent. I might as well say 3.928% transparent also transparent? Do not give excuses to crooks.</p>
              <p>if there is a loophole for crook CEOs to play with, under intense pressure they will use it. Either that or due to greed for bonus by inflating earnings, they can do that.</p>
              <p>Look at Lakeman brudders. After given fat check of 700 billion by usa government, they the top execs spent on 400K USD luxury enjoyment.</p>
              <p>Come on, we are not children and not naive like some unique people.</p>
              <p>Its all about playing around the perimeter, pushing the envelop if not cooking the books. There are many ways to get things done. Remember, its PEOPLE who came up with rules. Its PEOPLE who can bypass systems of any kind.</p>
              <p>why is it said that black can be said as white and vice versa?</p>
              <p>the more rules, the more to play with.</p>
              <p>Its all like a game. The best player gets away clean clean.</p>
              <p>Its valuable to learn law and accounting.</p>

              <p>corporate goverance had to work hand in hand with govt regulation.</p>
              <p>eg of such is every 2yrs changing of auditors firm. board of directors should not have members of relatives related to the firm.</p>
              <p>if such action are taken, it would make fraud more difficult to happen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>lehman bros was over leverage. meaning investment bank has no control over how high it can go. if the fed/treasury has such control in place for investment bank, the world would not be in the current state of tormoil.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>because greed happen, the more we need regulation to prevent it although i must admit it, never 100%.</p>
