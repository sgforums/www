Wah, I almost cried when I watched him.<br><br>According to him, his pay has been withheld for several months and as a result, he can't pay his agent in Bangladesh the couple of thousand dollars he owes as an introducer fee.  I heard this high agency fee is partly the result of the high charges imposed by MOM, no doubt to feed the fat pay packages of their Minister and Perm Secs.<br><br>His voice breaking and wiping away tears, the Bangladeshi told the interviewer that the agent had been sending thugs to threaten his wife who stays alone.  He said he doesn't dare to complain to MOM because he feared that his employer would cancel his work permit and repatriate him without paynig him anything.  <strong>This is the result of a stupid MOM ruling that says that the employer has the right to cancel the work permit anytime without providing reasons.

What is this??  Modern day Nazism in Singapore condone by the Government????  Are you telling me that the MOM is not aware of the problem???

These are two different things.<br><br>2. thugs sent to threaten his wife in his country were no doubt sent by his local agent. It remains his plight no doubt, but that is something his government should take care and not put in singapore account and label us "modern day nazism."<br><br>3. many young indonesian ladies ran to their embassy or the singapore police for help when they felt threatened, unfairly or ill treated. Recognising the plight of this bangadlashi, he needs to take courage to fight for himself, like the little indonesian girls.<br><br>4. "foreign talents" not only refer to the angmohs, but also the chinese, the indians, the bangadeshi. there are also chinese and indians who come in as foreigner workers and not talents.

It will be appreciated. And I also believe the government can do more about controlling the unscrupulus local contractors. there are many other social ills, unfair treatments in this society, highlight them if you know so that more people can help, but labelling these as "Modern Day Nazism" is simply stupid!!</div>

Chinese National workers:</span><br><br>They are a calculative bunch, pick up skills fast and willing to slob plenty of OT so long as they are paid for it. Rude, sometimes nasty and unfriendly, takes quite a bit to earn their respect.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Indian / Banglas</span><br><br>They always shake their heads, whether yes or no, can't make decisions, always CHANGE their minds, tend to slow down their work around 3pm in the afternoon just 2h before knock off time, pick up skills at an alarmingly slow rate and are usually unreliable: quality and independence-wise.<br><br>It's obvious the show was meant to highlight the plight of foreign workers in SG. And they're probably right. But the stories from these banglas are probably hyped up, especially when they have nothing more to lose.<br><br>There's probably such devious contractors around unafraid to make a quick buck at the expense of poorer people whom they bully without any kind of repercussions. But it's probably a minority.<br><br>Well, maybe MOM should sit up and take notice after this episode. Or they may just do....nothing.</div>

This situation here is about some employers  "exploilting"  "ill treating"  "cheating" "neglecting" some foreign workers and the "inactive" "condoning" "noncaring" attitude of the relevant authority.
