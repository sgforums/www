Profounder showed his unhappiness at my comments,  lotus999 reminded me that "stupid" is not an appropriate work to use. Who are the 2 I am fighting against?? cindyfeh and iveco? have you posted anything on the subject matters worthy of being my "opponents" in a "battle"?<br><br>BTW, who is musakazim, don't think i've seen many of his post here.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by iveco:</div><div class="quote_body">I wonder what does Lazerlords have to say on this issue. He seems like one of the few who can hold out against Sgdiehard.</div></blockquote>many people exchanged different opinions with me lately. the latest was on gays with earthing73 and Heng@ and we just stopped exchanges by agreeing on "to each his own". I think we are all happy with that, no win or lose.<br><br>I agreed with Lazerlords on the need to restrain chinese nationalists sentiments, especially among singaporean and those new immigrants, but I disagreed strongly with him when he proposed to buy weapons and join the US against china in the big boys game in Asia. Lazerlords is very knowledgable in military matters, hardwares and tactics but I questioned his military strategies. We have finally agreed that if we can't agree, we are entitled to our own opinion. Lazerlords is different from you guys, for he never resort to names callings, and for that I respect.<br><br>I have not seen any posts by iveco worthy of my reply. As for Cindyfeh, he is totally disillusioned with singapore, wanting to migrate but not successful so far, he has no pride in singapore or as a singaporean and before he takes on a new national identity, I hope he manages to retain some pride for himself as a man, or a woman, and his intellegence level will be decided if he would post something worthy of a second look. meantime, good luck to him in searching for a country who will take him.<br><br></div>

It then proves that their news are credible and reliable.<br><br>It's funny how some people trust the credibility of the "good news" but not the bad ones.

Maybe with a little more heart this time.<br>Our local media is ranked 130th in the world!!!<br><br>Their credibility is as good as what they see or understand? That's good - that's being objective. They report exactly what they see - that's telling the truth.. unless you don't value the truth?<br><br>I am not doubting the credibility of their reports on these foreign workers. I don't have an issue with that. What I have an issue, and cannot comprehend is, how you tell everyone that our local media can be trusted over and above internationally acclaimed media powerhouses like CNN and BBC. The statistics speaks for itself. To trust them or to trust some lowly 130th placed media? Your guess is as good as mine.</div>

In dirty practices, the contractors engaged foreign workers agent to arrange workers for other countries. Hence, the the foreigner workers have to pay a hefty sum of money inorder to get to singapore for a job.  The sum of money paid by the workers were usually shared between the main contractors and the agents.<br>This was happened at many job sites that in fact the main contractors sold the man year to many sub-contractors or assisted by the agent to sell it to other contractors, where the foreign workers were meant for that particular project were not working there.<br>That why, between 1993 to 1998 many job sites were caught with many workers working with no work permt. Many main contractors' big bosses pocket with tonnes of unaccounted sum of money!<br><br>I had this experience which the fcuking boss made tonnes of money from the man year and instructed me to appointed general workers to be the security guards of the job site; and when the job site (about S$80 million dollars project) was caught with illegal workers.  The fcukung u grad boss with master degree still putting blame on me for not taking care of the job site's security properly and turned the other way round and put to me that I connived with sub-contractors to plant illegal workers into the job site.<br><br>I just cannot believe that this fcuking super educated bastard boss with high profile could do such inhumane, disgusting, shameful things to me in court.<br><br>I remembered that at one time, this inhumane boss said to me that ; hey! you must learn to push away blames or mistakes by twisting and turn it round to become other people's fault.<br><br>I thought to myself why was this high proifle boss like that.  I tendered two times of my resignation and the last resignation (three month notice) before two months of my last day of service with company.  I fcuk him and he verbally terminated me and one year after, I was compensated by the company for breaching of our employment obligation .<br><br>What a shameful boss~!~!~!~! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>[/b]</blockquote></div>

Like it or not, they reveal the truth about your beloved CNA network. And like it or not, your beloved local media just got placed 130th in the worldwide media rankings.. Awwwwwwww... that's so....... sad?<br><br>Let me repeat myself. Maybe with a little more heart this time.<br>Our local media is ranked 130th in the world!!!<br><br>Their credibility is as good as what they see or understand? That's good - that's being objective. They report exactly what they see - that's telling the truth.. unless you don't value the truth?<br><br>I am not doubting the credibility of their reports on these foreign workers. I don't have an issue with that. What I have an issue, and cannot comprehend is, how you tell everyone that our local media can be trusted over and above internationally acclaimed media powerhouses like CNN and BBC. The statistics speaks for itself. To trust them or to trust some lowly 130th placed media? Your guess is as good as mine.</div></blockquote>can I have website of this independent ranking that places our local media as the 130th in the world? before? thanks</div>

Nazism means one race supremacy over the rest, as the aryan race, or the germanic race was claimed to be supreme over the rest. This situation here is about some employers  "exploilting"  "ill treating"  "cheating" "neglecting" some foreign workers and the "inactive" "condoning" "noncaring" attitude of the relevant authority. (all words in " " are not representative of the whole situation, IMO). Which racial supremacy???</div></blockquote>You finally got the point.  Yes, there are Singaporeans out there who think they are a supreme people over these "lowly" foreign workers.<br><br>And yes, the actions of these contractors are symptomatic of that, treating their foreign workers as nothing more than a herd of cows.  Barging into workers' quarters to seize them and forcibly send them back?  That sounds like a scene out of "Schindler's List" and "The Piano"!<br><br>And no, Nazism does not refer to Singapore in totality. It refers to select batches of people.<br><br>I once attended a seminar by the PMO and a PMO officer commented on Foreign Talent Policy.  He said that the Policy is focused on bringing high-end professionals into Singapore, not those workers...as there are simply too many of them as you can see in Little India on weekends.  An Indian participant was so offended by the comment she immediately stood up to rebuke him on the racially-loaded statement.<br><br>It would be unfair to tar the entire Civil Service based on the statement of one highly paid goon.  But let's just say that in this case, it's extremely puzzling that MOM can be blind to such practices by our local contractors and allow employers to cancel the foreign workers' employment pass with the mere click of a mouse.<br><br>The Government has started to legislate employment of domestic helps to protect their rights.  The same should be extended to such foreign workers who build all the beautiful condos springing up all over Singapore.<br><br></div>
