Yes, there are Singaporeans out there who think they are a supreme people over these "lowly" foreign workers.<br><br>And yes, the actions of these contractors are symptomatic of that, treating their foreign workers as nothing more than a herd of cows.  Barging into workers' quarters to seize them and forcibly send them back?  That sounds like a scene out of "Schindler's List" and "The Piano"!<br><br>And no, Nazism does not refer to Singapore in totality. It refers to select batches of people.<br><br>I once attended a seminar by the PMO and a PMO officer commented on Foreign Talent Policy.  He said that the Policy is focused on bringing high-end professionals into Singapore, not those workers...as there are simply too many of them as you can see in Little India on weekends.  An Indian participant was so offended by the comment she immediately stood up to rebuke him on the racially-loaded statement.<br><br>It would be unfair to tar the entire Civil Service based on the statement of one highly paid goon.  But let's just say that in this case, it's extremely puzzling that MOM can be blind to such practices by our local contractors and allow employers to cancel the foreign workers' employment pass with the mere click of a mouse.<br><br>The Government has started to legislate employment of domestic helps to protect their rights.  The same should be extended to such foreign workers who build all the beautiful condos springing up all over Singapore.<br><br></div></blockquote>now you are talking sense. It is not news that some singaporean are super arrogant, think they know all, and look down on every other nationality, from china, to vietnam, to indonesia and india. But I believe these are just frogs from the well and they soon learn their lessons. Even these singaporean do not think others should be exterminated.<br><br>The actions of contractors symptomatic of that of the nazis? I question the statement "these unscrupulous contractors would hire a few thugs and go to their quarters in the middle of the night and round them up and send them to the airport".  Flight to Dhaka leaves usually around 8 - 9 pm which means they should be at the airport around 6 pm!! why should any employers want to round up the foreign workers at midnight and send them to airport? then riots by groups of unhappy workers at the airport are waiting to happen.<br><br>There is no doubts some foreign workers had their problem in singapore, some are exploited, some cheated. and if such situations were not handled properly, there will be riots like that in Taiwan recently involving thai workers. We need to highlight their plights and kick the asses of those at mom. To label that as Nazism is totally inappropriate of the situation or your understanding of the word Nazism is simply too swallow.<br><br>I believe in what channel U reported but i believe we should also hear from the contractors, many smaller ones are already getting out of business.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I mostly agree with what sgdiehard has said so far.<br><br>Anyway that's the reality of things. Non payment of works done is, IMO, a very common practice, especially in the building industry. I guess most of us are too used to paying things upfront, like shopping in a supermarket. Or paying for utilities, with the threat of it being cut off.<br><br>It's a matter of integrity. Size matters. Contractors run out of business on a near daily (not actually a known fact, just a figure of speech) basis because larger companies allow lawsuits to drag to a point where they run out of business. you see, they are being paid for their works *done*, not what they're going to do. it's an opportunity for non-payment; where the money goes eventually depends on who's holding on to the money.<br><br>It's a dog eat dog world. 2 wrongs don't make one right, but they dont' necessarily prevent a 3rd or 4th wrong either. nobody has to get used to it if they don't want to, and i guess it's a right to exercise their views, whether on national tv or in sgforums. but like what sgdiehard said, lip service is cheap.<br><br>I know for one, i'd rather not do anything about foreign workers; it's nice and all to be doing something for them but really, it's way down on my priority list. I don't have a very good impressino of foreign labour's conduct in singapore,<br>their idea of festivity dosen't quite coincide with mine. take a walk down orchard road on New Years, and you'll see what i mean... where they gather = girls being molested.<br><br>If anything, we should probably id-tag them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Anyway, I'd rather fight for singaporeans being treated with higher equity in terms of works done and payment elsewhere.<br><br>No intention of picking off where sgdiehard left. but really, for anyone, whether if you're an activist (hrrhrr) or a lawyer, who's thinking of doing something, and 'getting off your armchair', <strong>do something for your fellow countrymen instead!</strong> keep your frontyard clean before your backyard!<br><br>seriously...</div>
