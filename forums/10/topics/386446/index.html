              <p>Former transport minister Mr Yeo Cheow Tong will not be taking part in the next general election due by February 2012 and will retire from politics for good.</p>
              <p>Mr Yeo, who have been a MP since 1984, felt “it’s time to call it a day and let a younger person take over.”</p>
              <p>He left the Cabinet in 2006 but stay on as a MP at the request of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>However, according to some unverified rumors circulating in cyberspace, Mr Yeo was “removed” from his cabinet position because of some “problems” in his personal life.</p>
              <p>A <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/www.yeocheowtong.com"><span style="color: #a91b33;">website</span></a> bearing Mr Yeo’s full name set up two years ago by an anonymous blogger claimed that Mr Yeo was in “financial distress” from his wife’s “investments” in property.</p>
              <p>It also alleged that Mr Yeo is now working for Indonesian conglomerate Lippo Group and drawing a salary of around $18,000 a month.</p>
              <p>Mr Yeo has not refuted the allegations publicly or taken any action against the blog so far.</p>
              <p>Another minister who has retired is Dr Lee Boon Yang who was appointed as a non-executive Chairman on the board of Keppel Corporation, a gigantic state-owned company. Dr Lee is a vet by training.</p>
              <p>With the announcement of Mr Yeo’s retirement, it appears that the next election is around the corner.</p>
              <p>As in the past, the ruling party will first announce the retirement of its ministers followed by introduction of its new candidates in the media.</p>
              <p>The electoral boundaries and polling date are usually revealed only in the last minute to catch the opposition off guard.</p>
              <p>With the mainstream media firmly in its control, the ruling party has managed to keep scandals of its leaders under wraps and allowed only good news to be released to the public.</p>
              <p>This explains why over 90 per cent of Singaporeans had expressed confidence in their leaders and public institutions in a survey done by the United Nations Development Programme, the highest in the world.</p>
              <p>The opposition is also disadvantaged by the short campaign period of only nine days which hampers their efforts to get their message across to the electorate.</p>
              <p>With the ruling party giving out Singapore citizenships like freebies to foreigners, it will be an uphill task for the opposition to mount a credible challenge against it in future elections to come.</p>

              <p><br>First, he react too slow, secondly, he was panic, third, he can't deal with the taiwan authority, who was also in the wrong but managed to turn around and blame him and singapore pilots? that really pissed LKY off.</p>
              <p>Other than that, LKY expected him to control the traffic in Singapore, increase transportation cost to leverage on SMRT books, ability to negiotate with taiwan transport minister on the compensation of the SIA accident, he failed all. When Lky visited taiwan to speak to their head of state on the fair equal compensation to the american victims who sued SIA a large amount of money, he was told that the talks is over between both countries at the transport ministers' level, and the rest of the taiwanese minister laughed, Lky knows that he was taken for a fool. That is where, my taiwanese Uncle Li Au said, "Singaporean are stupid".</p>
              <p>My Dad told me in the 90s, which i was still very young, there was a case in San Francisco where a Singaporean Air Steward (malay) raped and killed a Singapore airline's taiwanese Air stewardess in a hotel. That malay guy came back to singapore, till the SF police discovered the body, they called for a interpol intervention, the Malay guy was trial in Singapore court and sentence to death, but he argued that he wanted to be trial in US, because the crime was in US and an international one, Singapore court release him to repariate him back to US, he was given 20 years with payroll in nice US of A prison. I think by this time, he is a free man. My Dad told me, the mother of taiwanese Air stewardess voted for revenge, she covered her daughter body with red cloth, in taiwan custom, that means blood for blood, and she set a curse on Singapore.</p>

                  deal with the taiwan authority, who was also in the wrong
                  but managed to turn around and blame him and singapore pilots? that
                  really pissed LKY off.</p>
              <p>Other than that, LKY expected him to control the traffic in
                  Singapore, increase transportation cost to leverage on SMRT books,
                  ability to negiotate with taiwan transport minister on the
                  compensation of the SIA accident, he failed all. When Lky visited
                  taiwan to speak to their head of state on the fair equal
                  compensation to the american victims who sued SIA a large amount of
                  money, he was told that the talks is over between both countries at
                  the transport ministers' level, and the rest of the taiwanese
                  minister laughed, Lky knows that he was taken for a fool. That is
                  where, my taiwanese Uncle Li Au said, "Singaporean are stupid".</p>
              <p>My Dad told me in the 90s, which i was still very young, there
                  was a case in San Francisco where a Singaporean Air Steward
                  (malay) raped and killed a Singapore airline's taiwanese Air
                  stewardess in a hotel. That malay guy came back to singapore, till
                  the SF police discovered the body, they called for a interpol
                  intervention, the Malay guy was trial in Singapore court and
                  sentence to death, but he argued that he wanted to be trial in US,
                  because the crime was in US and an international one, Singapore
                  court release him to repariate him back to US, he was given 20
                  years with payroll in nice US of A prison. I think by this time, he
                  is a free man. My Dad told me, the mother of taiwanese Air
                  stewardess voted for revenge, she covered her daughter body with
                  red cloth, in taiwan custom, that means blood for blood, and she
                  set a curse on Singapore.</p>

              <p><br>But that is how politics works, if lky is not dirty, i will not vote for him, same goes to all people, if you are the boss, and a manager is not coperating with you, you will remove him but not directly, millions and tons of hours spend in close door meeting is not for nothing ya. Some will become blue eye boys and girls, some will be slaughtered for sacrification for the Glory of PAP.</p>
              <p>As Men in White, I havd doubt in their Underwears or boxers, most likely their underwears is not white.</p>
