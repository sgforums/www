                  about Anna Nicole Smith was jailed for contempt last week in a
                  defamation case brought by the late <em>Playboy</em> model's mother.</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Legal experts said bloggers are increasingly the targets of such litigation, which are testing the bounds of free speech.</p>
              <p>Lyndal Harrington, who is accused of helping to spread falsehoods that Smith's mother <a class="media-search-keyword" title="Search for more about Virgie Arthur  across the News Network" href="http://search.news.com.au/search//0/?us=ndmnews&amp;sid=5014239&amp;as=news&amp;ac=technology&amp;q=Virgie%20Arthur">Virgie Arthur </a> married her stepbrother and abused Smith as a child, spent four nights
                  in jail after she failed to comply with a court order to turn over her
                  computer.</p>
              <p>The 53-year-old grandmother claimed her computer was stolen during a burglary less than a week after it was subpoenaed.</p>
              <p>A police officer testified that he believed the theft was staged and judge <a class="media-search-keyword" title="Search for more about Tony Lindsay  across the News Network" href="http://search.news.com.au/search//0/?us=ndmnews&amp;sid=5014239&amp;as=news&amp;ac=technology&amp;q=Tony%20Lindsay">Tony Lindsay </a> ordered Harrington to produce the computer by July 2 or she will again face incarceration.</p>
              <p>Harrington says she is shocked that she is being sued for comments posted on someone else's blog to pass the time.</p>
              <p>"I just voiced my opinion," said <a class="media-search-keyword" title="Search for more about Lyndal Harrington  across the News Network" href="http://search.news.com.au/search//0/?us=ndmnews&amp;sid=5014239&amp;as=news&amp;ac=technology&amp;q=Lyndal%20Harrington">Lyndal Harrington </a> of her posts about Smith and Arthur on the website Rose Speaks.</p>
              <p>Like many bloggers, <a class="media-search-keyword" title="Search for more about Harrington doesn't  across the News Network" href="http://search.news.com.au/search//0/?us=ndmnews&amp;sid=5014239&amp;as=news&amp;ac=technology&amp;q=Harrington%20doesn%27t">Harrington doesn't </a> consider herself a publisher and did not realise she could be held liable for her posts.</p>
              <p>"I got into this because my business had fallen apart in this economy and it was something to do," she said.</p>
              <p>"I developed a lot of friendships with women who are retired or ill at home."</p>
              <p>Three other bloggers are named in the suit along with Smith's former
                  companion, Howard K. Stern, and Larry Birkhead, the father of her
                  daughter, Dannielynn.</p>
              <p>Ms Arthur alleges that the defendants conspired to defame her so she
                  wouldn't get custody of Dannielynn, who could inherit up to $US88m
                  ($109.59m).</p>
              <p>"Lyndall Harrington is a liar who faked a burglary," said Neil McCabe who represents Ms Arthur.</p>
              <p>"She's part of a conspiracy to defame my client and she's done her own defaming of my client."</p>
              <p>Lawsuits against bloggers in the US have been doubling every year
                  since 2004 with $US15m ($18.68m) in judgments so far against them,
                  according to Robert Cox, president of the Media Bloggers Association.'' EOQ</p>

                                Specifically this quote: Every one ,from Mr Average Joe to Prime Minister and King,can defend his/her name. Abuse of the law. <b>Men descend has begun law is not about justice but about winning those who are in power and abuse the misunfortunate weak</b> <b>for voicing their opinion which just might be the truth.</b>
                                                                                      <br><br>
                     In today's national paper there's an article about a mother of two children that lost a court battle on defamation suit because she wrote an email and sent it to her friends in which she complained about the service a local hospital gave her. The hospital won over 5 US million dollar in reparation. Wtf? What did she write I want to read them? Fark a murderer would not even be fined with millions of dollar in my country. Justice the primal style. The jungle style imo.
                                                                                      <br><br>
              She is not the first victim just couple months ago another person lost a legal battle for posting an article to a magazine complaining about his apartment developer. Another victim of defamation suit.<br><br>
              it's the trend now. Yay <br>

               Yea contempt she lied. Just read the article.
               Still what's happening in Singapore gets carried over to Indonesia. Sad.
