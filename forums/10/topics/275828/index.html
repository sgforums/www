There are also a handful like me who don't cause their GRC was walkover in the last GE.<br><br>It only been a year since last GE and LHL has managed to come up with so many unpopular mandatory policies (GST hike, ministers salary increment, ERP, CPF annuity, etc). I shudder at the thought of what other policies PAP going to come up next in the 4 years.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

However, I do have 6 or 7 friends in the govt. sector openly admitting doing so. Granted, that's not even close to a tiny, micro "sample" but it does provide one of the main reasons why you hear so many grumbling murmurs throughout the island and yet no massive impact on the elections.</div>
