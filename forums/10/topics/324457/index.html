              <p><strong>Uniqueness of perfection that sits to our north:  </strong></p>
              <p>Business Day, Michael Backman, July 17, 2008</p>
              <p>The International Bar Association has found that, when it comes to criticism, Singapore is in no need.</p>
              <p><strong>A</strong> REPORT released last week, <em>Prosperity versus Individual Rights? Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law in Singapore</em>, published by the International Bar Association, provides a fair and balanced account of how Singapore's Government really operates.</p>
              <p>It lists 18 recommendations for Singapore to strengthen its rule of law and to better promote a civil society. They are all reasonable, as is the analysis on which they are based.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But of course the Singapore Government doesn't think so. Even though the IBA provided the Singapore Government with a draft of the report, allowed it to comment and then inserted the Government's views in the final report, the Government still managed to diss the report by the end of last week, just as it disses everything remotely critical.</span><strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore's Government is unique among governments around the world: it doesn't need advice.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The report chronicles how human rights are constrained by the Singapore Government and how freedom of speech is in the hands of the police.</p>
              <p>It lists the media restrictions that ensure the media does not monitor the Government but is more its mouthpiece.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It describes the restrictions on the right to assemble. One bizarre practice highlighted is the constitutional requirement for members of parliament to resign if expelled from their elective party, thereby ensuring that elected members do only what their party rather than their constituents or even their conscience tells them. Another aspect mentioned is the cowing of the Singapore Law Society so that even this channel for independent comment on laws and proposed laws has been neutered. Many questions about the independence of the judiciary are raised too.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Singapore's Ministry of Law described the report's observation that Singapore's judges seemed professional in commercial cases</strong> <strong>but exhibited bias in cases involving Government ministers as "absurd" and "unsubstantiated". I</strong>n actual fact, the 77-page report makes a very good case for bias. It is the ministry's rebuttal that lacks substantiation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The report chronicles how defamation actions brought against opposition figures by Government ministers have bankrupted them, thus rendering them ineligible to sit in Parliament.</span> That undischarged bankrupts should not sit in Parliament is not the issue. <span style="color: #ff6600;">The Australian constitution has a similar provision. What is problematic is how defamation actions seem to be used specifically to target opposition figures to bankrupt them to ensure they then cannot sit in Parliament.</span></p>
              <p>Of course, opposition figures in Singapore must be guarded in their public utterances as they well know the consequences of a slip-up. But the trouble is, when opposition figures give the ruling PAP (party) an inch in this regard, the PAP leaders gleefully grab a mile. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Ministers lack the generosity of spirit that government politicians exhibit in other modern countries in this regard. In local parlance, they have shown themselves to be "kiasu" (literally, afraid to lose).</strong></span></p>
              <p>Examples abound. Former attorney-general Francis Seow cites in his book <em>Beyond Suspicion? The Singapore Judiciary</em> (2006) Devan Nair, a former president of Singapore. Nair describes how Lee Kuan Yew fumed after opposition figure J.B. Jeyaratnam had been returned to Parliament in the 1981 elections. "I will make him crawl on his bended knees and beg for mercy," Lee is purported to have said.</p>
              <p>Race-based riots — 58 and 44 years ago — are used to justify many of the Government's controls, when in fact Singaporeans today have been gutted of passion. They have been supplanted by consumerism and materialism — safe refuges in the face of a Government intolerant of dissent. Today, the only thing likely to lead to anything approaching a riot is a half-price sale for Chanel handbags.</p>
              <p>The report says Singapore's economic development is impressive but not unique. Australia has six Singapores dotted around its coasts. Each of these cities has been built without the media and political restrictions that Singapore's Government feels are needed even though each Australian city has a population far more ethnically diverse than Singapore's.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Singapore's leaders like to describe their country as a small island with no resources. It magnifies their achievement.</strong></span> But Singapore's economic hinterland are Malaysia and Indonesia — it sits bang in the middle of a sea of resources.</p>
              <p>It draws on these resources just as Melbourne draws on the resources of the rest of Victoria.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the most important aspect of Singapore's development has been the virtual elimination of corruption. There are those who claim that corruption is integral to Asian culture and therefore unavoidable. Singapore shows such commentators and, more importantly, the rest of Asia, that being Asian is no excuse for corruption.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Time and time again, Singapore's leaders argue that those who want to comment on politics and even policy should form their own political party and stand for election. All others are required to shut up.</strong></span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Singapore's leaders cocoon themselves against challenge and seem affronted by scrutiny.</strong></span> It's as if they haven't done a good job in building Singapore. But they have, and that is the frustration. Why must they act as if they haven't?</p>
              <p>As you read through the measured paragraphs of the IBA report, you can almost feel the pleading; the advice to a friend: "you're wealthy, you're educated, you're like us now. Take that final step — join us — the community of civil, prosperous societies. Do it, before you embarrass yourself more." But this friend is too proud to listen.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would not put much store in what Michael Backman has to say. Go and read a few of his articles.  He praises Malaysia for the same things that he criticises Singapore for.  there was once an article about a corrupt Indonesian businessman and it came out like it was Singapore's fault that the businessman was corrupt!  I can't remember any of his articles but I remember he writes with venom about Singapore.  Each and every time.  Wonder if he ever thrown out of Singapore or visa denied or jilted by Singapore Girl or what?!!</div>

              <p>I REFER to Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew's suggestion in last Thursday's report that Singapore emulate Sweden's strategy in improving birth rates ('Taking a leaf from Sweden's book to boost birth rate').</p>
              <p>I am a Singaporean married to a Swede. However, within a year, we will leave Singapore to live in Sweden. My husband has persuaded me that Singapore is not the place to live and have a quality life, including having our first child. I am convinced even though I have good work opportunities here. The higher cost of living and stressful environment have taken a toll on us.</p>
              <p>The Government fails to help couples like us in many ways. First, as middle-class people, we have not been helped in any way to buy our first home, even though we are as good if not better taxpayers than younger couples. Couples like us cannot buy an HDB flat because our income exceeds the cap at our age. My husband is above 35 and I am well into my 30s. We are penalised for getting married in our 30s and cannot enjoy the grants given to young couples buying HDB flats. Resale flats are well beyond our means, with high valuation which means a bigger debt should we buy our first home in Singapore. Young couples can buy a five-room flat for $250,000, including grants, while we have to pay at least $400,000, without any grant.</p>
              <p>
              
              With such a debt, it is discouraging to have children as that will add a further burden, with childcare costs here topping $1,000 a month. We do not believe in hiring a maid to look after children. As a result, we now live in a rented apartment and will not have children until we move to Sweden.</p>
              <p>On top of that, my husband would like to spend time looking after our baby, but he is not entitled to paternity leave here. His employer, a Singapore company, does not promote it. With longer hours in this rat-race society, how can couples enjoy bedtime intimacy?</p>
              <p>In Sweden, the scenario is different. Employers are understanding and allow employees to take time off to collect their children from childcare. Flexi work hours are common and the government gives grants to encourage new families to procreate. Higher tax rates are offset by returns from the goverment, such as child allowances and free childcare.</p>
              <p>We have decided our first baby will have a Swedish passport, and not a Singapore one.</p>

              <p>Oppositions are not given equal opportunities as PAP.  On TV, LKY said no such thing as fair play for oppositions.  With this point, I don't understand why there are people who are so harsh and have unrealistic expectations of the oppositions.   </p>
