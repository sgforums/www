              <p>1st of all, the cpf was voluntary to those of very low income.
              That is why they are forcing them now. FT aside.</p>
              <p> Try tracing where GIC and Temasek got their loan to
              finances their investment. That will lead to our CPF. Try imagining
              what if both those company gone bankrupt? What happen to ur CPF?
              Then u might say that it wont happen. So are u saying that our cpf
              that our gov invested on is after all not risk free? if so, why dun
              we get a decent amount of return rather then the mini? I am not
              talking about high rish or low rish investment, for every
              investment, there is a risk. If the CPF investment by our gov is
              risk free, why wasn't any infor about what is being done to our CPF
              ever release? Just what was know or release as to where the CPF
              gone to? 2% return is way too low my friend. U get 4% to 5% for
              fixed deposit in bank FOR 40yrs? Unless u turn around and tell me
              bank FD is deem risky compare to the unknow acc of our so call
              CPF.</p>
              <p>Now u are telling me that I cant take care of my money, so i
              need to have my money taken away from me to save guard it. What is
              next? I cant take care of children and u take it away?</p>
              <p>Locking it away and only letting u use it after retirement age
              of 55yrs was the original plan. Now 72yrs? what is next? If CPF
              does work and is the right way to go, do u think it need to be make
              compulsory?</p>

              <p>Convincing and forcing are very different. What i read was convincing and somehow what you read was forcing. Go back to my posts and find that I'm suggesting that upon signing up, the employers should make mandatory contributions and employees should be given a choice. This will lead to more of such people signing up. It is better than them not being in the scheme at all. Get it ? I repeat, employers mandatory whilst employees voluntary as a package. Upon reaching a target income limit, both mandatory.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>GIC money is the country's reserves. Temasek's money came from part of the reserves. I suppose the CPF board invested our money in Government securities at the risk-free rate of 2.5-3.5%. Ok lets take the argument that the money is indeed in GIC but so what ? I cannot guarantee that both Temasek and GIC will never go bankrupt but in the event it does, nothing can save you and your investments unless of course it is denominated entirely foreign currency/assets. Money kept in your bank, invested in assets denominated by SGD, hidden under your pillow will go up in smoke. If that is your choice and belief then you are definitely better off in a country whose government you trust. To drive home the point again, the risk-free rate (as determined by Government securities: Treasury bills 2.5%) is your safest investment. Yes, it is safer than your fixed deposit in the bank.Country fails, everything fails. Once again, you are free to invest a portion your CPF funds in riskier assets which may bring higher returns, depending on your risk appetite.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On your last point. I can't say for certain that CPF will suffice for everybody's retirement but without CPF, I'm positive that many will be without any money during retirement age.</p>

              <p>Dear kramnave,</p>
              <p>Treasury bills are basically loans taken out by the government. It makes no sense for the government to put CPF reserves (which effectively is the government's money) in companies that turns around and buys bills, effectively putting the money back in the government and that the government again puts that money back in those companies and on and on to infinity.</p>
              <p>Because of that, using the interest rate of bills as a guide to setting CPF interest rate makes no sense.</p>

              <p>Yup, I agree more transparency is better than less.</p>
              <p>However, we (me and you at least) do not know what the government is doing with money generated from debt issue. Suppose the bulk of the money is (I hope not) invested in risky assets(which they claim are not) then there will be many problems. Suppose times are good and we get 10% in return for a period then followed by negative rates but govt guarantees 0% at least. Now what happens to the worker who comes in when returns are 0% ? By setting a reasonable rate (risk-free rate of 2.5 - 3.5%), Govt can offset bad years with good years, supposing our money is on relatively riskier assets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I never seriously thought the CPF would suffice for retirement and I would strive for more. More from personal savings/investments. In my view the 3.5% CPF is not there to fund my retirement but only as a minimum if you get what I mean.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Edit: Just want to add that if anybody feels that an investment in FD, Unit trust, insurance etc is more worth it then why not invest your CPF in it ?</p>

              <p>Hey, sorry for misreading ur
              post. So u propose to have the employer pay the CPF contribution and not the low
              income employee, hence not affecting their take home amount? Meaning a pay rise
              of 13% in term of CPF, which is the same as raising the lower income? If u are
              going to ask for a raise, why dun u ask for more and get a 33% raise? The take
              back income isnt affected and at the same time, CPF is assured? If pay raise is
              the actual solution, does it also mean bottom line, the low income earner are paid
              too little, till the extend that they couldn’t afford CPF contribution?</p>
              <p>Are widening of income gap to blame for lower income inability to benefic
              from CPF? I was paid $5/hr working as a waiter 15yrs back. Guess how much they
              are paying today? The same $5/hr. Shouldn’t gov be looking after those lower
              earners to ensure they get a mini wages to stay ahead of inflation?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">CPF started with 25% contribution on both the employee and
              employer. Due to some hard time, it was cut down to 13% for the employer, effectively
              giving the working class of the whole of sg a 12% pay cut.. We might not feel
              the pinch since the take home amount wasn’t affected, but because gov reluctant
              to revert to the original % coupling that with increasing HDB price, most ppl
              dun have enough CPF for retirement. Instead of increasing employer %, the gov
              make the retirement age older and CPF withdrawal later.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> To topper that already diminishing CPF, the gov set the CPF
              return at 2% which are barely enough to meet inflation.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> I dun mind having my money lock up either. But the intention
              must be for the benefic of me and not me been exploited.</p>

              <p>Thing is, whatever happens, Government tries to reduce the impact on business costs, thus workfare. Asking the employer for 13% (Actually 14.5%) is within reasonable grounds as that is the employer contribution rate in Singapore. Asking for 33% (or 34.5%) is pretty unrealistic and might price the employer out of business. Ultimately the money has to come from somewhere. A waiter 10 years ago may earn $5 and today maybe the same. The price of the alcohol that you drink and the food that you eat, if you factor out GST and increase in cost, has not increased much as well, if any. Rental rates I suspect would have gone up as well. I don't think the profit margin of the establishment would have gone up much, all things else being equal. Where is the waiter's pay rise going to come from ? Today if the government increase employer contribution rate to 20% who is going to bear the sudden increase in labour cost, what is this sudden decision going to tell business owners and potential investors?</p>
              <p>On the subject of CPF return, seriously 2.5-3.5% may not cover inflation and I don't think they will increase their burden and pay more than what they pay out on bonds/notes. If you feel that you can get a better return elsewhere, why not do it then ? You can invest your CPF in Unit trusts, Insurance, Shares, Fixed Deposits, Property, Gold traded funds, Government securities etc etc. They are placing the burden/liberty of getting better returns on your shoulders so you have a choice about it, whether or not you want to get a potentially better return by taking greater risks.</p>
              <p>Come to think about it, if CPF pays better or are on par with some of these instruments and at the same time, is risk-free because it is backed by government, who would want to invest their CPF funds ? It would be unrealistic and at the same time it would be denying many mass market financial consultants and banks a living.</p>

                              Thing is, whatever happens, Government tries to reduce the
              impact on business costs, thus workfare. Asking the employer for
              13% (Actually 14.5%) is within reasonable grounds as that is the
              employer contribution rate in Singapore. Asking for 33% (or 34.5%)
              is pretty unrealistic and might price the employer out of business.
              Ultimately the money has to come from somewhere. A waiter 10 years
              ago may earn $5 and today maybe the same. The price of the alcohol
              that you drink and the food that you eat, if you factor out GST and
              increase in cost, has not increased much as well, if any. Rental
              rates I suspect would have gone up as well. I don't think the
              profit margin of the establishment would have gone up much, all
              things else being equal. Where is the waiter's pay rise going to
              come from ? Today if the government increase employer contribution
              rate to 20% who is going to bear the sudden increase in labour
              cost, what is this sudden decision going to tell business owners
              and potential investors?</div>

              <p>On the subject of CPF return, seriously 2.5-3.5% may not cover

              more than what they pay out on bonds/notes. If you feel that you
              can get a better return elsewhere, why not do it then ? You can
              invest your CPF in Unit trusts, Insurance, Shares, Fixed Deposits,

It is ok that the poor earn $5 10 yrs back and now so long as it doesnt affect we the consumer or the rich? That is why the poor are always left behind and condem to provety till they cant make end needs.

It dun have to be local gov, can be any other gov. Say buying other sercurites with better return or bonds or asset back insurrance, etc. Why arent we doing that? Coz we arent given the choice, period. U can invest in ur cpf but the choice is limited and u cant withdraw it till at certain age.

              <p>Earl, it is a two-way relationship rather than <strong>"cater to the needs of the rich at the expense of the poor". </strong>If a business finds it viable to exist here, it will give you a job. Else, it wouldn't exist and you wouldn't have a job.</p>
              <p><strong>"It is ok that the poor earn $5 10 yrs back and

              <p>As a student, I worked as a waiter as well and after a year my remuneration went up to $6.50 from $5.50 not taking tips into consideration. I think I was a good worker myself and would be promoted along the years with pay increment to boot. However my ambitions lay elsewhere and I didnt stick to that line. If someone tells me that he earn $5.00 then and after 10 years that same person is earning the same amount then something is terribly wrong with him. Then again perhaps that person is unlucky or born with a deficiency and we cannot leave these people too far behind. Thus I think Workfare is a positive step. Else comcare or various charitable organisations.</p>

              not."</strong></p>
              <p>Why do you keep insisting that NTUC is forcing people when it is clearly stated that they are trying to convince ?</p>
              <p><strong>"so does that mean it is ok to park away ur money and
              only get it back after 40yrs for less than what is was worth?"</strong></p>
              <p>You are free to invest it, buy property with it. 100% on unit trusts, government securities, Insurance products and 35% on shares. 10% on gold traded funds.</p>
              <p><strong>"- i assume there is a error, u mean "who
              wouldn't want to invest their CPF funds?" rite?"</strong></p>
              <p>No error. If CPF gives returns that are comparable to riskier alternatives in the market, I would choose to keep my money in CPF and not invest it anywhere else.</p>
              <p><strong>"why dun u ask this instead? Why should we
              invest in CPF when ww can invest in something else that give better

              other gov."</strong></p>
              <p>That would be foreign govt securities ? The more the interest the higher the risk. Just check the ratings and history of Sovereign debt securities. Indonesia, Russia, Argentina, Brazil etc. Anyway I don't think the government is pretty much interested in the flight of capital from Singapore, especially when the amount is so huge.</p>
              <p><strong>"U can invest in ur cpf but the
              choice is limited and u cant withdraw it till at certain age. If

              <p>Because people don't like saving at all. Ultimately if one keeps thinking about CPF money and would wish to get it out then one has a use for it. Alright perhaps we can think that we will save it and keep it somewhere with better returns for equal risk (if that exists) but what about those that can't ? What if people spend the money before they retire ? Lose their money to conmen out of greed or finance their credit card debt ? What happens then ?</p>
