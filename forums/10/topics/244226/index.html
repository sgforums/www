Korea has a more advanced Transport system than Singapore, where the arrival times are downloadable with a PDA or phone, whereas Singapore is only playing catch up with their trial project Iris.<br><br>Being govt owned also means that Koreans enjoy cheaper public transport than Singaporeans despite the fact that Seoul on average has a higher cost of living than Singapore.<br><br><a href="http://english.tour2korea.com/03Sightseeing/TravelSpot/travelspot_read.asp?oid=1846&amp;kosm=m3_8" rel="nofollow"><br>Their MRT fare is integrated with the bus fare system<br></a><br><br>For example, it cost only 800 won ($1.30) to for the First 10 km, Regardless of how many times one changes from MRT to bus to another feeder bus<br></div>

Thus, they are encouraged to "recruit" more and more private patients (Class A) whom govt don't subsidise at all.  For this the doctors have headaches and so .  .   .</div>
