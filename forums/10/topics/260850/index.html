Its hard-nosed, hard-working, cynical population of 5 million are ruled with an iron fist by the corrupt, dictatorship government, which oppresses anyone who isn't on the board of a Fortune 500 company. Large corporations tend to be above the law, and use their financial clout to gain ever-increasing government benefits at the expense of the poor and unemployed.<br><br>There is no government in the normal sense of the word; however, a small group of community-minded, corrupt individuals devotes most of its attentions to Law &amp; Order, with areas such as Social Welfare and Religion &amp; Spirituality receiving almost no funds by comparison. Income tax is unheard of. A healthy private sector is led by the Arms Manufacturing industry, followed by Pizza Delivery and Retail.<br><br>Crime is a serious problem.

            <div class='col-md body'>UN Category: Democratic Socialists<br>Civil Rights: Good<br>Economy: Reasonable<br>Political Freedoms: Excellent<br><br>The Community of Colcannon is a tiny, safe nation, notable for its devotion to social welfare. Its compassionate, intelligent population of 6 million are fiercely patriotic and enjoy great social equality; they tend to view other, more capitalist countries as somewhat immoral and corrupt.<br><br>The government -- a sprawling, bureaucracy-choked morass -- is mainly concerned with Social Welfare, although Healthcare and Education are on the agenda. The average income tax rate is 38%, but much higher for the wealthy. A large private sector is led by the Arms Manufacturing, Retail, and Pizza Delivery industries.<br><br>Voting is voluntary. Crime is well under control. Colcannon's national animal is the beetle, which frolics freely in the nation's many lush forests, and its currency is the parsley.</div>
