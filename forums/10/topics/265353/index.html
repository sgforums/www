            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Will S'pore become Gridlock City?<br>Packed buses, elusive cabs, traffic jams on Saturday night. When population hits 6.5m, how?<br>By Sylvia Toh Paik Choo </strong><br><br>July 03, 2007<br><br>HOW are we going to deal with this when our population hits its targeted 6.5 million?<br><br>Just look at what happened on Saturday night.<br><br>The city went into a gridlock like I had not experienced before.<br><br>I started out from my Farrer Park home at quarter past 7 for Christina Aguilera's concert, which was to start at the Indoor Stadium at 8pm.<br><br>The cab driver's heart sank when he heard 'stadium'.<br><br>'Jam, everywhere jam,' he lamented.<br><br>Of course! The National Stadium's closing ceremony. (By night's end, it was also one of the NDP rehearsals, the last night for cheaper shopping - before the 2 percentage point GST hike - and the last cigarette puff in public places.)<br><br>Everybody went out with a vengeance and the city came close to traffic paralysis.<br><br>My cab fare to the stadium was $12, exactly double the normal.<br><br>Christina Aguilera was fantastic and worth every dollar ($98 to $348, but how scary are our ticket prices getting for pop shows?)<br><br>The concert began late, thank goodness, because most of us were scrambling out of kissing cars, racing across tarmac and turf and up the stairs.<br><br>When we poured out after her encore, we saw red.<br><br>There were fireworks from the National Stadium's final party, and rows and lines and curves of red tail lights, which, in a moment of fancy, made me think of the necklaces of pigeon blood red rubies from Van Cleef and Arpels.<br><br>Fancy immediately turned to frenzy when it struck us all - how do we get out of here?<br><br>You could not get a taxi booking - the cabs must all be stuck somewhere.<br><br>A short, nervous man spoke into an intercom, 'member, member' and from what I figured he had a fleet of limos hiding in the bushes (of course, I exaggerate here) ready to pick up, so I noticed, ang moh customers.<br><br>I was about to ask him if he could book... when an East European woman and child interrupted: 'We are first'. I told her to relax. The man quickly moved away.<br><br>I asked a man in neon vest directing the chock-a-block traffic for directions and he made the mistake of saying: 'I don't know.'<br><br>I pointed to his uniform and gave him a piece of my mind. He then showed presence of mind: 'If not, I ask my officer help you.'<br><br>And the whole thing went on - bumper-to-bumper traffic inching along, party and pop people running to and from two bus stops in search of a way out of the stadium grounds. Where is Bruce Willis when he is needed to sort out a disaster like this one?<br><br>If a city of four-million-plus can be paralysed by a hundred thousand going out to two events in the same area on the same day, how will we cope when the number is bumped up by another two million?<br><br>In cities like London, on a hot summer's day, I have seen fights break out right in the middle of crowded Piccadilly Circus, tempers fraying in the heat, the rush and the crush.<br><br>Did anyone stop to break the fisticuffs? Of course not - everyone was busy scurrying to whatever it was that was drawing them on. Leave it to the police.<br><br>Are we bidding to build ourselves up like Dubai? They can, they have vast deserts in their backyard to pile into.<br><br>But wait a minute - there is still land around the island. You become aware of it when you take a bus ride.<br><br>And that was how I arrived home, two hours after the concert - via Ang Mo Kio.<br><br>There were empty buses in the bay and a nice SBS chap said: 'Hello, how are you?'<br><br>I told him: 'Quite confused, donno how to get out.'<br><br>And he said: 'But at least you remember your name, Paik Choo.' And he showed me where to go.<br><br>The special services were designated for Ang Mo Kio, Orchard Road, Boon Lay. The Orchard buses looked like the ones you see in Indian movies, passengers holding the doors together.<br><br>I had a birthday party to go to, so I leapt into the Ang Mo Kio double-decker. On the highway, it said: Heavy traffic.<br><br>The party was in Telok Kurau. Never made it. Happy birthday, Michelle. The present would have been a Christina Aguilera impersonation.<br><br></div>
