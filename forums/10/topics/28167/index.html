            <div class='col-md body'>Sit back and watch MALAYsia disintegrate.<br><br>The current internal politics of MALAYsia is so divisive that it bears heavily on all administrative and economic decisions which will affect one community overwhelmingly, resulting in an overbearing burden on the other communities. This has been practised since the occurence of the racial riots in the 1960's.<br><br>Although the Chinese Malaysian community is not helped by any MALAYsian Government policies, and impeded by all handicaps given to the Malay-"Bumi" MALAYsians, they are supposedly the largest contributor to the national wealth of MALAYsia as a community.<br><br>The Indian Malaysian community is likewise not helped by any MALAYsian Government policies, and the MIC has lost its own voice with a leader that wears different Christian Dior suits to work for each day of the week, while his community ekes out a living working as cheap labor in the plantation estates.<br><br>The MALAYsian Government is now so desperate for funds to help to pay for all the grandiose government policies that they are unleashing the heavily MALAY dominated Government Agencies to unravel the well organised and balanced economic systems that have been observed since the last riots in the late 1960's.<br><br>House to house survey will be conducted to find out how many occupants are paying taxes and what assets are owned.<br><br>Much depends on the arbitrary written reports of the MALAYsian Government Civil Servant who conducts the survey.<br><br>Presently, there are many young accounting graduates - (largely Malay-Bumiputras, as this is one of the choice University Courses with a heavy quota given to the Bumi to allow them to break into the Chinese dominated business world) - who are mostly unemployed or unemployable (due to low standards of training).<br><br>Plans are afoot to unleash them onto the Chinese dominated business community to hunt for tax evaders.<br><br>Besides affecting the largely medium and small sized businesses and industries of Malaysian Chinese owned enterprises, it will also affect the bigger Corporations that are run by Chinese Executives but figure headed by Malay-"Bumis".<br><br>There will be a clash at all levels of board room politics, as well as more slush and hush funds to be moved from one pocket to another - with much disenchantment and grudges.<br><br>Singapore businesses and industries that are set up in Malaysia, will be advised to watch how their books are kept - one for the Government, one for the Bank, and one for themselves as believed to be practised by most Malaysian businesses.<br><br>Self-destruct already started in starts and stops, and an under current of resentment has been existing since the heavy handed policies favoring the Malay-"Bumis" were ramrod down the throats of the other communities.<br><br></div>
