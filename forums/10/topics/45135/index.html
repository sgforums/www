            <div class='col-md body'>hi. i dont think that we can really put aside our racial differences and live as a cohesive society.<br>firstly, the singapore govt wants us to put aside our racial differences, yet readily embrace our culture and not forget our roots. i feel that to maintain a balance between these two is virtually impossible. if it works, it could only work for a short time.<br>secondly, it is in human nature to be biased. it is also virtually impossible for us to be objective, or not judge a book by its cover even before you meet the person. first opinions are also not easily shed, and the only way to shed them is to really get to know the person. however, one canot know everyone else in singapore well. thus, we might be lft with some first opinions that may pave the way to racial biasness, however small its degree is.<br>thirdly, the govt is also using the wrong language in a way. they are telling us to tolerate the other races and our racial differences. i believe that the word used should be 'acceptance', because 'tolerate' gives the impression that 'hey, i really want to slap you be i shall tolerate...' yeah.<br>however, i still believe that singaporeans are really nice and, to a certain extent, accepting of the other races. i hope that you people out there would not think im criticizing the singaporeans, because that is really not my objective.<br>i also live with the hope of a near utopic, if not utopic, singapore.<br>thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>racial differences could be put aside if everyone's treated equally, as in full intergration of Malays in SAF and the choice of wearing anything each religion imposes eg. wearing tudung in school. frankly speaking the reason Sing Gov decides not to let them wear it in public schools is because of the questions other kids would ask on why they wear them. simple, the parents will teach the kid what to say if someone asks them why. I'snt that all too easy? as a kid i myself was a curious person and with proper explanation i would understand. About those the SAF problem i dont believe anybody would defect in a war between neighbours. maybe a few will but the 2 years we spent shiting ourselves training together as soldiers would make us think that we would be spitting ourselves if we defect. the question of loyalty should not even be questioned. why would someone join a side which belittled his achievements even though what he achieved is more than most people living in the side which belittle him. i still dont believe Malay soldiers in Singapore would spit on their comrades if war sets upon us. we lived here for so long and from a 3rd world country we propelled ourself into first world. why throw it all away?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well if you people Singaporeans want to start.... you gotta start by talking to people.... not shunning away from people who look different and are from different cultures... I worry about the Eurasian community in Singapore... they bear the greatest burden of all... being torn apart by their constituent bloods... like me....<br><br>Sure you've got the Malays... the Indians... the Chinese... you all are under 1 category... so its easier to assimilate... look at the national posters of every Singapore magazine.. from racial harmony to SAF to SYF.. you've mostly got the chinese guy.. the malay guy and the indian guy... no eurasian at all.... its sad.... sure we are an ultra minority... but still we should be seen... it is no wonder many 1st generation Eurasians prefer to side with their Western side and elope to the Western countries... well those Eurasians who look more caucasian anyway... not the malay looking ones...<br><br>But anyway... you people have to start assimilating... its like I get stares from people about why i am in a local JC and not in some white school. I am a part of you people, I am part Chinese, I speak the language, but I look totally outsiderish in your eyes. You people have to start this racial harmony thing by not looking at people the way you do... which as one guy nicely put... is hard cos of human nature... I mean it is natural for Malays/Indians/Chinese to all congregate at the Cafeteria tables together in schools... and Eurasians like us are always loner like in the local schools... which is why i believe most of the Eurasians go to international schools....where most of the students LOOK more western... I believe people here in SG are segregated by looks...<br><br>All i am saying is that if you want to make this racial harmony thing ework.... you people gotta start now... right down from the young people... you all gotta start.</div>
