              <p>PAP mass-recruiting Taiwanese PMETs by offering higher than market pay to lure them to work in Singapore</p>
              <p>In other countries, the governments will introduce measures to safeguard the livelihoods of locals by restricting the number of foreign migrant workers.</p>
              <p>It is the other way round in Singapore – the PAP opens the floodgates to allow the foreigners in to compete with Singaporeans directly for jobs which can otherwise be taken up by them. To add salt to the injury, it is playing an active role in “importing” foreigners while exhorting Singaporeans to be “cheaper, better and faster” at the same time.</p>
              <p>PAP leaders have been busy of late trying to defend its discriminatory immigration and labor policies against native Singaporeans. DPM Teo Chee Hean said on Monday at a NUS ministerial forum that the PAP has kept a “tight lid” on immigration.</p>
              <p>PAP MP and NTUC Deputy Secretary-General Madam Halimah Yacob claimed that according to her “counter-intuition”, it is not true that employers are hiring foreigners over Singaporeans:</p>
              <p><em>“Wise employers know they should look strictly at merit so that they get the best talent for the organisation.”</em></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: Straits Times, 7 April 2010]</strong></p>
              <p>The PAP is indeed a “wise” employer by spending Singapore taxpayers’ monies to go all the way to Taiwan to recruit their PMETs to replace Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The China Times reported today that a Singapore government organization – Contact Singapore is mass recruiting thousands of Taiwanese PMETs in various fields such as healthcare, engineering and social media to fill up “vacancies” in Singapore. (read article <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/04/08/%e9%86%ab%e8%ad%b7%e3%80%81%e7%a7%91%e6%8a%80%e3%80%81%e6%96%87%e5%8c%96%e5%89%b5%e6%84%8f%e7%82%ba%e5%a4%a7%e5%ae%97-%e6%98%9f%e5%9c%8b%e4%be%86%e5%8f%b0%e6%90%b6%e4%ba%ba-%e5%8d%83%e5%90%8d%e8%81%b7/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Its officials had arrived in Taiwan yesterday and will be launching the recruitment exercise soon.</p>
              <p>As expected, the sensational news was censored in all the major Singapore papers out of fear of creating a public backlash against the PAP.</p>
              <p><strong>Contact Singapore</strong> (è�”ç³»æ–°åŠ å�¡) is <strong>an agency of the Singapore (PAP) government</strong> whose primary function is to draw people from around the world to work, invest and live in Singapore, with the ultimate aim of boosting economic development. It is an alliance of Singapore’s Economic Development Board and Ministry of Manpower.</p>
              <p>Contact Singapore has offices in the Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America. It partners Singapore-based employers and industry players to organise career fairs and networking sessions in cities across the world, and provide updates on career opportunities and various industry developments to individuals.</p>
              <p><strong>[Source: Wikipedia]</strong></p>
              <p>In other words, Contact Singapore is funded ENTIRELY by Singapore taxpayers to recruit foreign PMETs to compete directly with Singapore PMETs for limited jobs.</p>
              <p>According to the China Times article, Singapore is offering the Taiwanese salaries which is more than three times the market rate in Taiwan to lure them over to Singapore.</p>
              <p>The starting pay ranges from NT55,000 ($2,431) to NT66,000 ($2,917). Those with three to five years of experience can expect a starting pay of more than NT100,000 ($4,420) <strong>(1 Taiwanese dollar = S$0.0442)</strong></p>
              <p>Besides PMETs, Singapore is also hiring creative designers in the cultural and arts realms who can command a starting salary of more than S$7,000.</p>
              <p>Why is the PAP bringing in so many Taiwanese PMETs into Singapore when these jobs can easily be taken up by Singaporeans? Are these jobs “shunned” by Singaporeans as proclaimed frequently by PAP leaders?</p>
              <p>Contact Singapore’s CEO Huang Xiujuan said there are about 50,000 to 60,000 Taiwanese in Singapore and they tend to integrate well into Singapore society due to similiarities in language and culture. The majority of Singapore Chinese are Hokkiens who spoke the same dialect as Taiwanese (Min-Nan).</p>
              <p><em>(And who is paying for Ms Huang’s airfare, lodging and meals in Taiwan when she goes about recruiting Taiwanese PMETs?)</em></p>
              <p>It is an open secret that the PAP has been trying desperately hard to lure Taiwanese and Hong Kongers to settle in Singapore.</p>
              <p>One Taiwanese reader wrote to us expressing his disbelief that upon applying to work in Canada, he was offered a Singapore PR immediately by the migration agency under the Landed PR scheme which gives Singapore PRs to foreigners who have never stepped foot on Singapore.</p>
              <p><em>“The agent kept selling Singapore to me and persuaded me to take up Singapore PR as the application for Canada work visa takes a long time. I refused. Singapore is not an attractive place at all. I rather stay put in Taiwan than to relocate to Singapore. At least it is a democracy here and we enjoy basic political freedoms. Who will be so stupid to bring up their children in a one-party dictatorship like Communist China? I know it is difficult to go to Canada, but I am willing to wait for 10, 20 and even 30 years to go there, otherwise I will just remain here,”</em> he quipped, obviously not having a favorable impression of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Prospective immigrants should observe how the PAP government treats its own citizens first before deciding whether to take up Singapore citizenship.</p>
              <p>Under the PAP’s repressive rule, Singaporeans have no civil or political rights at all. We cannot criticize its leaders who are wont to sue for defamation; we cannot protest against its policies and neither can we vote them out of office as the electoral process is engineered to keep them in power forever.</p>
              <p>To those Taiwanese who are reading this, is this the kind of country you want to bring up your children in? Will you trade your human rights for a few hundreds dollars?</p>
              <p>Remember: if the PAP can so blatantly hire you to work in Singapore to make life miserable for native Singaporeans, it will be your turn one day too.</p>

              <p>taiwanese will run back to taiwan as usual as they arent that dumb or stupid as spore gov already knows!</p>
              <p>but question is...why is gov doin this??/some Public relations act on taiwanese perhaps.....that spore is a bank??to show off to the taiwanese that they are willing to give $$$$$.</p>
              <p>but the taiwanese arent that stupid not to probe deeper for the money given as they will compare with the singaporeans .and as usual the gov will bring in sporeans who arent clever in the taiwanese midst to show that spore really needs taiwanese and will pay plenty for them.</p>
              <p>to make them feel like they are the chosen ones is most likely the strategy.but what about the taiwanese companies who are not gov linked in spore....they  have employed singaporeans in their midst and do know singaporeans are as varied as their own taiwanese.</p>
              <p>chances are that the taiwanese will earn enough n run off after 10 years after getting enough  $$$$</p>

              <p>i have no idea why govt has this perception that sporeans are not good enough compared to foreigners.  when they keep saying that they hire based on merit, how do they prove that indeed the foreigners they hire are indeed better ?</p>
              <p>people always think that pastures are greener on the other side.  dump so much money giving out scholarships to foreign students, employing foreigners when locals are unemployed.   it's sickening, really sickening</p>
