            <div class='col-md body'>Oil price will remain higher at around USD40-70 dollar range for a good foreseeable future (at least 2years down the road). No more the good old cheap oil days when oil was going for USD20 per barrel. US needs the high oil price to substain the economy, and to push through the drilling at the california &amp; alsaka as well. We can expect to see a different oil industries landscape in the coming 5 - 10 years. US could become the next oil giant after Saudi.<br><br>It is well noted that there are actually alot of marginal oil well in SE Asia waters, they are only commerically profitable when the oil price stays above USD40 per barrel. With the current oil price trend, you can expect the Sg marine / oil sector to be blusting with activities. Furthermore, the Russian Far East, China and Indian are opening up. But the downside is that our refinery business may come under pressure from India and China (in Nanking), as the 2 giants are building up their oil refineries. Further more, Thailand is hot on our heels as well.<br><br>Construction tends to be a good bet as the activities pick up in 2006. But only a handful of these local companies are in fundermental good shape to take the maximum benefits from the upturn ahead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO..<br><br>Stock inheritly there is a higher risk.  with 5k, it is pretty hard to diversify your portfolio.  So u end up with only that few stocks.  Unit trust diversify for you.<br><br>Timeline:  If you are looking for long term, then unit trust.  Most turn in a modest return in 2-5 yrs time frame.<br><br>Stocks if you are looking for shorter period.  But then it is gambling.<br><br>If u r asking for a few K return in a few months with 5k investment, tell me what it is... i will dump all my $$$ there.  Where got low risk, sky high return thing one?<br><br>Also your time.  Do you have time to monitor stocks?<br><br>Admin / transaction fees.  You need to factored this cost in as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Imo, even if you don't have very much savings, it's better to invest in stocks balanced with some relatively low-risk instruments such as reit or bonds. This is so especially if you're young. Consider investment as part of your learning experience. Take your time to read up on investment strategies (there are plenty of reading material in the public libraries) and learn from investment forums, eg. in shareinvestor.com which attracts a fee or CNA marketplace which if free.<br><br>Every Sporean should possess some investment skills and not just depend on their CPF and savings from salary income to last them thru their retirement years.</div>
