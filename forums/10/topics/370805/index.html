              <p>Thursday, 30 July 2009	
              
              
              <em></em></p>
              <p><em>Singapore Democrats</em></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/the-party/cec-20092.jpg" alt="" width="470" height="300"></p>
              <p>At a time of expansion and growing confidence, the Singapore
              Democrats have elected a 14-member Central Executive Committee to lead
              the party into the next general elections.</p>
              <p>At its biennial party conference held last week, cadre members came
              together to re-dedicate their efforts to work for the cause of reform
              and democracy in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The party's top four posts remain unchanged. Mr Gandhi Ambalam
              retained the chairmanship and Mr Francis Yong continues to serve as the
              Vice-Chairman.</p>
              <p> Dr Chee Soon Juan and Mr John Tan were re-elected as the Secretary-General and Assistant Secretary-General respectively.<br> <br> A change was made in the post of Treasurer which was taken up by Mr
              Gerald Sng, a Marketing Manager, who contested in the 2006 elections.
              Deputising him is Assistant Treasurer Mr Jeffrey George, an engineer in
              the oil-rig industry.<br> <br> After a keenly fought elections, the following six were elected into
              the executive body: Ms Chee Siok Chin, Ms Lilian Chia, Mr Johnny Ho, Mr
              Mohd Isa, Mr Jufrie Mahmood, and Mr Sylvester Lim.<br> <br> This year saw a couple of “new” faces added to the line-up: Messrs
              Jufrie Mahmood and Sylvester Lim. Mr Jufrie, a party stalwart who was
              once “loaned” to the Workers' Party when the late J B Jeyaretnam was
              the secretary-general, returned to the SDP's leadership.<br> <br> “I came back because I have confidence in the present leadership of the
              SDP,” the opposition veteran said, “and I think that the party is
              moving in the right direction. The growth in its ranks attests to this.”<br> <br> The other first-timer is Mr Sylvester Lim whose quiet demeanour belies
              a fierce commitment to the ideals of democracy and justice.<br> <br> “We are excited about what lies ahead and we are determined to work for
              change and for a government that genuinely cares for the people,” Mr
              Lim said.<br> <br> Anticipating the intense work ahead, the newly elected leadership
              intends to co-opt two more members into its fold. They are Mr Laurence
              Lai and Mr Warren Eswaran. Mr Lai served in the previous CEC. Mr
              Eswaran, 25, is a member of the Young Democrats and has been with the
              party since his National Service days.<br> <br> “Warren's inclusion in the CEC is a reflection of the increasing
              interest young Singaporeans are taking in us,” Chairman Ambalam noted.
              “We want to ensure that our Young Democrats are actively involved in
              the party's direction and development.”<br> <br> The Young Democrats, the SDP's youth wing, will also shortly elect its leaders.<br> <br> The new CEC has expressed its determination to continue expanding the
              party in numbers as well as capability to reach out to Singaporeans. It
              will rely on the Internet, as it has in the past, to call on
              Singaporeans to step forward and help spread the message of working
              towards a free, open and just Singapore. (Watch video of Dr Chee's
              address to party cadres here.)<br> <br> Photo:<br> (Standing L-R) <em>Sylvester Lim, Jufrie Mahmood, Chee Siok Chin, Lilian Chia, Johnny Ho, Gerald Sng</em><br> (Kneeling L-R) <em>Chee Soon Juan, Francis Yong, Jeffrey George, Gandhi Ambalam, John Tan, Mohd Isa</em><br> (Laurence Lai and Warren Eswaran are not in the photograph)</p>

              <p><strong> Why the SDP is expanding  </strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/2612-why-the-sdp-is-expanding">http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Why the Singapore Democratic Party deserves our support</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Written by Ng E-Jay<br> 30 July 2009</strong></p>
              <p>The first SDP event I attended was the gathering at Hong Lim Park on
              01 May 2007 welcoming Dr Chee Soon Juan and Ms Chee Siok Chin after
              they had completed a 2-day, 120km walk to mark Labour Day and to
              highlight the plight of Singaporean workers.</p>
              <p>Looking at the exhausted but determined faces of Dr Chee and Ms
              Chee, and hearing the short but edifying address Dr Chee made left me
              with the impression that perhaps, unlike the terrible vibes that the
              party constantly receives from the mainstream media, the SDP was a
              party of substance, that perhaps it was a party with a message worth
              listening to.</p>
              <p>I was not wrong.</p>
              <p>Over time, as I got to know the party, its members, its ideas and
              its political philosophy better, I found myself agreeing more and more
              with its vision and its values.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The SDP is an opposition party that has been on the receiving end of
              a concerted torrent of negative Government propaganda, fueled by a
              compliant mainstream media that would stoop as low as need be to
              vilify, demonize, and ridicule the party.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>I constantly wondered <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>why after having had their names dragged
              through the mud so many times, SDP’s leaders soldier on with their
              cause, never angry nor feeling victimized by the situation, but ever
              determined to get their message across to Singaporeans.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>I took a look at SDP’s performance at the previous two General
              Elections. It was not pretty, to say the least. <span style="color: #000000;">The SDP only managed to
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>obtain 20.36%</strong></span> of the valid votes cast in the constituencies they were
              contesting in during the 2001 General Elections. For the 2006 General
              Elections, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they obtained an overall 23.23%</strong></span> of the valid votes cast.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.sgpolitics.net/picsarchive09/sdp2001ge.gif" alt=""></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.sgpolitics.net/picsarchive09/sdp2006ge.gif" alt=""></p>
              <p>I wondered why, after having been trashed at the polls and after
              having been laughed at not only by PAP supporters, but even by
              supporters of other opposition parties, the SDP soldiers on, believing
              in what they are doing, trusting that they would be vindicated one day.</p>
              <p>After some time, I found the answer. <strong>It is about <a href="http://www.sgpolitics.net/?p=3422">unyielding leadership</a>,
              having conviction in their values and what they believe in, and having
              the stoic determination to press on with the good fight, out of an
              unbounded love for Singapore and for Singaporeans.</strong></p>
              <p>That is why the Singapore Democratic Party deserves our support. That is why I am a supporter.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.sgpolitics.net/picsarchive09/sdp01.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Many critics have speculated that the SDP is not interested in
              participating in elections because it is not wooing the electorate over
              with bread-and-butter issues, and because its participation in civil
              disobedience and its focus on democracy and human rights issues have
              alienated it from voters.</p>
              <p>This is despite the fact that the SDP has stated categorically on
              its website that it remains committed to participating in elections and
              winning the hearts and minds of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>With the mainstream media deliberately censoring news and comments
              from the SDP, it is no wonder that many people remain unaware of the
              activities the party is organizing and engaging in, and its stand on
              various issues.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The truth is, the SDP has always paid close attention to
              bread-and-butter issues like jobs for Singaporeans, our CPF, and the
              cost of living, and suggested workable alternatives to our disastrous
              Government policies.</p>
              <p><strong>But the SDP has also correctly recognized that to campaign
              effectively for bread-and-butter issues, we need democracy in
              Singapore, without which we would be merely going around in circles and
              championing those issues only on terms dictated by the PAP.</strong></p>
              <p>Without transparency and without a means of making the Government
              accountable to the people, we would only be able to obtain token
              concessions from time to time, but we would never be able to compel the
              Government to act in the people’s interest.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The SDP is displaying true leadership and moral courage by
              committing to participate in elections even though they know the PAP
              and the mainstream media will resort to all ways and means of fixing
              them and tarnishing their image in the eyes of voters.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I feel that the SDP is correct in remaining committed to elections,
              because elections are a good opportunity for the party to make its
              presence felt and a good chance for the party to build awareness and
              cultivate the ground.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The SDP must also show that it cannot, and will not be intimidated by the underhand, undemocratic tactics employed by the PAP.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Consistent participation in elections is also a way of showing the
              electorate that despite insurmountable odds, it is fit and ready to
              lead, <strong>that it is willing to do so not because it is easy, but because it is right</strong>.</p>
              <p>But beyond elections, I believe that the SDP also wants to build an
              enduring legacy for itself, a legacy of championing the principles of
              democracy, of social justice, of human rights, of transparency and
              accountability of a Government to its people.</p>
              <p>I believe that the goal of the SDP is not just to do well in the
              next 1, 2, 3 or even 5 elections, but to be at the forefront of the
              wave of democratic change that must inevitably hit Singapore’s shores
              one day, no matter how long it takes.</p>
              <p>The SDP is not afraid of being dissolved by the PAP because it knows
              that what binds its members, supporters and friends together is not the
              party vehicle, but its values, its shared beliefs, its convictions, and
              its commitment to championing a more free and just society.</p>
              <p>The PAP can and will most likely use more and more sophisticated
              methods to marginalize the SDP, to alienated them from voters, and to
              discourage others from working with them and collaborating with them to
              build a better Singapore.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But I also believe that eventually, the truth must prevail, because the causes championed by the SDP are just and right.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>There is little doubt in my mind that if the SDP continues the good
              work it is doing, it will leave behind an enduring legacy of being part
              of the democratization of Singapore, and that its work, its activities,
              its articles and writings will also form an enduring record for future
              generations of Singaporeans to reflect on.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bloggers, activists, friends and supporters of SDP should also try
              their best to be part of this legacy by openly supporting the party and
              penning their thoughts, feelings and ideas on the party and its role in
              the democratization of Singapore.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>History has already been achieved through this approach by the SDP to select their Executive Committee.</p>
              <p>The SDP has shown that even as Democracy may bring a competitive approach in their decision process, it has allowed the best team to surface to lead their Party.</p>
              <p>Compare this with the PAP way in which a select elite group will appoint individuals to be members of an exclusive Cadre Corp that is separate from the larger general party membership; and with members from this exclusive Cadre Corp given the right to "nominate and vote" on another select group of personalities - selected by the Party Elite and not taken from the Cadre Corp - to be "elected" to form the core of the Elite Party "Executive Committee".</p>
              <p>The entire process in the PAP is conducted in secrecy at every separate levels, and the process of party politics is not open to every PAP member.</p>
              <p>This is the manner in which the PAP has governed Singapore and the Singapore Reserves - through secret behind the scene manipulation of rules and legislations that have resulted in 57 years of hardship for Singaporeans, and the loss of US$100 Billion from our Reserves without any sense of accountability.</p>
