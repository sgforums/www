              <p><br>u better dun be too optimistic about it, wait till the end of the year or after the end of the year season greeting period before you make your move,...the economy did pick up because of the winter fall and christmas + new year season. Industries are getting orders and churning the products and everything seem to be moving.</p>

              <p><br>How do you expect Singapore to do that since it doesn't has natural resources? It relies on its people and their abilities to create a stronger economy to withstand inflation. Thus it is a must for every Singaporean to create their very own niche markets.

              <p>Unfortunately, that form only part of a larger picture which you did not address and that should have been a continuation from what you had already started.</p>

              <p>Can the people's ability to create a stronger economy alone make Singapore withstand inflation ?</p>
              <p>How can a stronger economy happen ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Inflation in Singapore is artificially created, and is manipulated by the Government in its careful act of balancing its revenue and keeping the Cost of Living in check - and in the process to determine - at its own pace - the acceptable Standard of Living for Singaporeans</p>
              <p>Do Singaporeans have any influence to the environment cause and effects that affect our economy, the Cost of Living, the Standard of Living or even the inflation levels ?</p>
              <p>The Government has at its disposal all the information, statistics, and the manpower to analyse the cause and effects in manipulating the various financial tools or policies that with every single percentage shift up or down - Singaporean lives are affected positively or negatively.</p>
              <p>The value of the Singapore Dollar exchange rate with a basket of currencies from the major trading partners is influenced largely by the Government willingness to exercise its muscle at different times to suit their own requirements.</p>
              <p>Has anyone kept track of the daily movements of the exchange rate and noticed that the Singapore Dollar always strengthen around the begining of the month, and then allowed to slide for the next 20 odd days ?</p>
              <p>The movement of the Singapore Dollar is within a small range but can affect the costs of the products that Singapore trade internally amongst ourselves, and externally with other countries; and which will have effect on the strength of our economy.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the Government is in some kind of urgency to refill its treasury with a slew of increases in fees charged directly and indirectly onto our daily activities.</p>
              <p>The government approved increase in charges can be seen across the board that have affected our cost of living - from fuel pump prices to utility charges, from public transport charges to COE prices, from public housing sales prices to URA reserve prices for land parcel sales, from increases in hospital health care charges to fees charged by public education institutions, and while Road Tax and PARF Tax have not been reduced there are more ERP gantries being installed within and around the city.</p>
              <p>The foregoing lists are direct government approved increases, while the indirect effects of government policies have also affected Singaporeans in unseen ways. </p>
              <p>The withdrawal of property tax rebates has affected the costs of rentals to businesses with expected costs to their customers that produce a snowball effect on the entire delivery chain to the Singapore consumer.</p>
              <p>Through its controll of the NTUC by having a PAP Minister without Portfolio acting as the Secretary-General - the Government insist on the implementation of a new term of employment for Singaporeans that result in uncertain future.</p>
              <p>The Short Term Employment Contract is a feature for all levels of employment in Singapore - when this was only for the very senior management who are highly paid workers.</p>
              <p>Now, even the low paid workers are subject to short term employment contract that do not guarantee any compensation for any sudden termination of contract. </p>
              <p>Due to the nature of the new short term contract - any compensation is for a fixed sum based on the most recent length of employment time completed (when previously the total length of time employed in the business was considered).</p>
              <p>Can a stronger economy exist under such circumstances ?</p>
              <p>In an environment where Singaporeans are not empowered with a political voice to change the present status quo, and when their elected representative to Parliament has no voice - can Singaporeans have any direct influence to determine their own future ?</p>

              <p>You must still be dreaming that the PAP which LKY continue to exist in - will accept your version of what is known as Social Welfare.</p>
              <p>There is a difference between day dreaming and dreams from deep slumber, and it looks like there is little difference coming from the brain of a fallen angel that fell hard onto earth from the heights of heaven.</p>
              <p>Before you talk so much and so loudly about democracy - you will do some good for yourself and for your readership to fill some substance before the echo from your hollow words become too painful for yourself.</p>
              <p>If you are so creative with your imagination, you should have found more use with the rod that the government gave to you, what are you doing in the Bar ?</p>

              <p>The NTUC had come a long way to help replace bangadeshi and indians in food court and HDB cleaners with older Singaporeans, if you see at food court which i dun go often, you see these people, i asked one aunty, she told me last time under their ruthless boss, they work under bangadeshi supervision, imagine, a senior singaporean working reporting to a beggar bangadeshi, there were no leave, medical leaves and all other benefits, when NTUC step in the confront the bosses, bangadeshi was kicked out and rutheess bosses was warned of not aligning their employment policies with the Employment Act. All Cleaners pay was increased and proper training was provided.</p>

              <p>Do you not get tired from being an inconsistent mouthpiece of the PAP ?</p>
              <p>Is it such a big deal that the NTUC has replaced the the Bangladeshi and Indians in the Food Court and HDB Cleaners with older Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Why has the NTUC failed in planning the older Singaporeans to have a peaceful period after slogging for the last 40 years and contributed to the Treasury of the NTUC ?</p>
              <p>Why has the NTUC spend over $80 Billion to build a new Glass Tower NTUC House with the prestigeous address of 1 Shenton Way - instead of using the $80 Billion to pay for some schemes that protect the Singapore Workers in their Old Age - considering that the amount was largely from members' money used to grow all the other NTUC Businesses that build the Glass Tower ?</p>

              <p>Who is the fallen angel attempting to con ?</p>
              <p>NTUC training "ten of thousand singaporeans" when the IR need no less then these numbers having already recruited most of the workers from those leaving the tertiary and vocational institutes ?</p>
              <p>It would have sounded better if you could have been more honest to say that the <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"govt pumping billions of funds to help"</span></em> at least one of the IR Project to get financial funding during the current financial crisis.</p>
              <p>The money was spent now and will be collected through direct and indirect taxes in the future, with the present principal sums loaned being collected with interests.</p>
              <p>Did any Singaporeans benefitted from all these public expenses ?</p>

              <p><br>It is good that you have identified that <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"redtape must be minimalized and technology must be allowed to evolved on its own without interference from religions and religious morality"</span></em>.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, that form only part of a larger picture which you did not address and that should have been a continuation from what you had already started.</p>
              <p>How did Singapore become the World Second Largest Refinery when there is no crude oil field ?</p>
              <p>Can the people's ability to create a stronger economy alone make Singapore withstand inflation ?</p>
              <p>How can a stronger economy happen ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Inflation in Singapore is artificially created, and is manipulated by the Government in its careful act of balancing its revenue and keeping the Cost of Living in check - and in the process to determine - at its own pace - the acceptable Standard of Living for Singaporeans</p>
              <p>Do Singaporeans have any influence to the environment cause and effects that affect our economy, the Cost of Living, the Standard of Living or even the inflation levels ?</p>
              <p>The Government has at its disposal all the information, statistics, and the manpower to analyse the cause and effects in manipulating the various financial tools or policies that with every single percentage shift up or down - Singaporean lives are affected positively or negatively.</p>
              <p>The value of the Singapore Dollar exchange rate with a basket of currencies from the major trading partners is influenced largely by the Government willingness to exercise its muscle at different times to suit their own requirements.</p>
              <p>Has anyone kept track of the daily movements of the exchange rate and noticed that the Singapore Dollar always strengthen around the begining of the month, and then allowed to slide for the next 20 odd days ?</p>
              <p>The movement of the Singapore Dollar is within a small range but can affect the costs of the products that Singapore trade internally amongst ourselves, and externally with other countries; and which will have effect on the strength of our economy.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the Government is in some kind of urgency to refill its treasury with a slew of increases in fees charged directly and indirectly onto our daily activities.</p>
              <p>The government approved increase in charges can be seen across the board that have affected our cost of living - from fuel pump prices to utility charges, from public transport charges to COE prices, from public housing sales prices to URA reserve prices for land parcel sales, from increases in hospital health care charges to fees charged by public education institutions, and while Road Tax and PARF Tax have not been reduced there are more ERP gantries being installed within and around the city.</p>
              <p>The foregoing lists are direct government approved increases, while the indirect effects of government policies have also affected Singaporeans in unseen ways. </p>
              <p>The withdrawal of property tax rebates has affected the costs of rentals to businesses with expected costs to their customers that produce a snowball effect on the entire delivery chain to the Singapore consumer.</p>
              <p>Through its controll of the NTUC by having a PAP Minister without Portfolio acting as the Secretary-General - the Government insist on the implementation of a new term of employment for Singaporeans that result in uncertain future.</p>
              <p>The Short Term Employment Contract is a feature for all levels of employment in Singapore - when this was only for the very senior management who are highly paid workers.</p>
              <p>Now, even the low paid workers are subject to short term employment contract that do not guarantee any compensation for any sudden termination of contract. </p>
              <p>Due to the nature of the new short term contract - any compensation is for a fixed sum based on the most recent length of employment time completed (when previously the total length of time employed in the business was considered).</p>
              <p>Can a stronger economy exist under such circumstances ?</p>
              <p>In an environment where Singaporeans are not empowered with a political voice to change the present status quo, and when their elected representative to Parliament has no voice - can Singaporeans have any direct influence to determine their own future ?</p>
