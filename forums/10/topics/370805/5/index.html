              <p>Say something shocking like Lee Kuan Yew is a peranakan, pretend to be chinese or that while Japanese were killing chinese in Singapore during WWII, Lee Kuan Yew collaborated with the Japanese.</p>
              <p>Go and tell them Lee Kuan Yew's hatred of dialect chinese and his lame excuses to suppress dialect to secure his power, tell them of rumours that Lee Kuan Yew rigged 1963 elections, or that 1956 riots were instigated by Lim Yew Hock to arrest Lim Chin Siong.</p>
              <p>Marxists conspiracy bullshit instigated by Lee Kuan Yew as a reaction to 1986 people's power revolution in philippines, tell them something, go and politicise them, go and agitate them go and spread propaganda, go and organise them, mobilise them.</p>
              <p>So many things to say.</p>

              <p>Look Uncle,</p>
              <p>Like it or not, LKY had already infused PAP doctorine into our senses since we are as young as PAP kindergarden, History books are mostly written in a way of his heroic leadership. Therefore, to move the youngs mind, i believe it will be an uphill task for opposition, you just imagine, that as a child, we have never been expose to opposition influences, we also dunno that they existed. And by far, we are still living in peace and harmony with the benefit of wealth from our hardworking Kong kongs. We are taught of other countries political violences, racism, jobless and social unrest problems in comparing to our peace and stable society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My frens would rather play computer games then reading old opposition stories. That is the true fact of me, unlike me, who is still trying very hard to know the opposition better, but me alone is nothing, no effect on anything. Everywhere you turns around is PAP, teachers, lectures, doctors, civil servants, principals, CC, towncouncil, etc etc..so, you cannot blame us for making opposition look like a fool, because from the bottom of my heart, i can tell your frankly that within our young minds, PAP is Singapore. Unless you can influence more of the teachers, lectureres, civil servants, CC or some top speakers, the likes of Sylvia Lim, poly lecturer,  opposition may see some sunshine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For without the youngs support, i believe half the votes is gone, the next half are the adults and old age ones, even if that form a merely 16.6%, with no doubts, PAP holds the next generation of Singapore.</p>

              <p>Like Ho Piao?</p>
              <p><img src="http://s-pores.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/HoPiao.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The arrest of Ho Piao’s cousin would have made <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>an impact on the
              youthful Ho Piao and propelled him into the reality of colonial rule in
              Singapore at the time.</strong></span></span> It was at this period that he began his initial
              association with the trade union movement, where his command of the
              English language became an asset to hard-pressed trade unions who were
              already short-handed after the arrests.</p>
              <p>Accordingly,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> in 1957, he cut
              classes for his science course in the university to attend to the
              pressing demands of trade union work, to such an extent that he
              eventually withdrew from his university education altogether. </strong></span></span>He went
              on to work full-time in the trade union movement. In subsequent years,
              <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ho Piao never regretted this decision, and always believed that it was
              a choice he had to make under the circumstances. In the context of the
              anti-colonial struggle, it was the only choice...</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Not long after his return to Singapore, Ho Piao joined as a paid
              secretary of the Singapore National Seamen’s Union. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He would later
              recall that his involvement with the seamen’s union represented the
              happiest and most meaningful part of his life, of which he had
              particularly fond memories. He interacted well with the seamen on board
              the ships and they in turn took to him with warmth and affection.</strong></span></span> Ho
              Piao had a particular way and manner in dealing with ordinary folks, to
              whom he never felt any distance. In fact, if anything, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>his defences
              always went up when he was confronted or faced with bureaucracy or with

              <p>The arrest of Ho Piao’s cousin would have made <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>an impact on the youthful Ho Piao and propelled him into the reality of colonial rule in Singapore at the time.</strong></span></span> It was at this period that he began his initial association with the trade union movement, where his command of the English language became an asset to hard-pressed trade unions who were already short-handed after the arrests.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>in 1957, he cut classes for his science course in the university to attend to the pressing demands of trade union work, to such an extent that he eventually withdrew from his university education altogether.</strong></span></span> He went on to work full-time in the trade union movement. In subsequent years, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ho Piao never regretted this decision, and always believed that it was a choice he had to make under the circumstances. In the context of the anti-colonial struggle, it was the only choice...</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Not long after his return to Singapore, Ho Piao joined as a paid secretary of the Singapore National Seamen’s Union. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He would later recall that his involvement with the seamen’s union represented the happiest and most meaningful part of his life, of which he had particularly fond memories. He interacted well with the seamen on board the ships and they in turn took to him with warmth and affection.</strong></span></span> Ho Piao had a particular way and manner in dealing with ordinary folks, to whom he never felt any distance. In fact, if anything, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>his defences always went up when he was confronted or faced with bureaucracy or with people in authority, to whom he would be polite but always firm and obstinate</strong></span></span> from the viewpoint of his adversaries...</p>

              <p>Could Ho Piao have killed off the English Language ?</p>
              <p>How did this thought strike your mind ?</p>
              <p>Do you know Ho Piao's background that moved you to make such a damning statement of this person who played a role in Singapore's early political history ?</p>
              <p>Did his traditional Chinese sounding name draw a knee jerk stereotyped image of a fervent Chinese educated political activist from the 1957 genre that is typified to be Communists or Communist Activists - as painted by LKY and his PAP ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This clearly shows the pervasive depth of 52 years of PAP propaganda that has infiltrated the minds of Singaporeans, all fed well by LKY to dull the minds to the point that there will be no interest to dig out the truth of what has transpired</p>
              <p>A lay person's ignorance of clear facts maybe lamentable, but for one who is supposed to be educated and voluntarily participate in a public political forum - should there not be some appropriate care taken to ascertain the facts before shooting from the hips ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who is Ho Piao ?</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/7576216/Ho-Piao-A-Personal-Recollection-and-Appreciation">”…Ho Piao finished his school certificate examination, his results were outstanding enough for him to obtain admission into the pre-medical higher school examination certificate class in Raffles Institution. At the end of 1956, he sat for the matriculation examination for entry into the University of Malaya, and obtained admission into the Science Faculty in 1957.” </a></p>
              <p>He is shown to be academically as superior as LKY in their youth, and his excellence in the English Language has even led him to the highest medical instituion of his time - could such a person have killed the English Language ?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I think we must get it clear that in politics is all abt surivial...if u cannot make it then u r out....no one owes another a living...Likewise, PAP is strong enough to weather 44 years as we celebrate the nation birthday tomorrow.  In every country or organisation, they are always those who are strong &amp; weak..is always the strong who stays.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I know that there are also many remarkable politicans that many forumers are kind enough to have pointed out that can battle PAP in the past...unfortunately, they are not strong enough to weather the times.  We can only rescind of them in our memories now.</span></p>
