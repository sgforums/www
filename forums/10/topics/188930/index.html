            <div class='col-md body'>Means testing for health services discriminatory<br><br>MEANS testing for government health services is discriminatory and will lead to the creation of two classes of Singapore citizens: a class that is entitled to subsidised government services, and another class which has to pay more for the same services.<br>with Crime Library<br><br>Citizens pay income taxes which are already based on a person's income level. Wealthier citizens pay more taxes and the taxes collected are used to fund all gov- ernment operations and services.<br><br>With means testing and differentiated services, middle-income citizens would, in fact, be penalised twice. The Government must treat all citizens equally and not discriminate against any particular group when offering its services.<br><br>Would means testing stop at health services? Will it be implemented for other government services, like education?<br><br>If this is the case, then middle- and upper-income citizens of Singapore who contribute the bulk of the income taxes would have become second-class citi- zens.<br><br>Higher-income earners would normally seek private health care or A-class wards in government hospitals.<br><br>However, it must be a personal choice and not because of government-imposed means testing.<br><br>All citizens must be given a choice of medical services and pay the same fees for whichever ward they choose.

            <div class='col-md body'>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan says means-testing will not be implemented in the next two years as originally planned.<br><br>He was responding on Wednesday to a Workers' Party's concern over the criteria to be used for means-testing.<br><br>Mr Khaw said: "The criteria? I don't know. I honestly don't know. I don't tell lies like some people. You don't want to implement a scheme that is so complicated, that it costs so much to do thorough means-testing. Then whatever you save, you have to now pay more for administrative costs. Now, that additional cost, someone has to bear it."<br><br>Visiting residents in Admiralty on Wednesday, Mr Khaw said means-testing will only happen once a fair, cost-effective, thorough, yet simple system is in place.<br><br>Means testing refers to a method to calculate healthcare subsidies patients can receive, based on what they can afford.<br><br>It aims to reach out to those who need subsidies the most. - CNA/ch<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Discriminatory??? I think not... Personally I am of higher income... and I think the subsidy should be giving pioritised to the lower income dispite it is unfair to me.<br><br>Simply because there are people who couldn't afford the medical. And we should never exclude these people. For people who can afford. A subsidy is secondary. So what's the problem with the mean testing for subsidy? Discriminating? I don't mind the government would spend more money on else where than the medical for the rich. The rich can afford it. Whereas to the poor it is neccessity.<br><br>How about spending some money on the economy it will help the rich richer. Sorry don't agree on this stand by the WP.</div>
