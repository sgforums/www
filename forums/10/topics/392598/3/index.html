              <p>well, depends on how you look at it. It you think I'm condescending, so be it. I believe that criticism can bring out the better side anything. Even tiger beer is disputable because it was started when we all were still Malaya. If you go malaysia, the malaysians will claim it's theirs. Likewise for sg. Ok, fair enough, SIA is one. Tiger beer is arguably another one.</p>

              <p>I dunch wanna bash MAS... But seriously their branding CMI... Must sack their advertising director already. You know why?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They won 5star Skytrax, then go on publicity blitz, say what this and that 5star...<br>Then stupid mad "scholar" came out with the Malaysian thingy, using their IATA code(MH)... And calling it, "Not just a code, this stands for Malaysian Hospitality".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The moment I saw that it was epic advertising phail... I mean, of all things, you choose to advertise on something that is not a product?! Advertising on intangible goods only gives a slim chance of breaking it into people's minds(SQ does it well, marketing both hardware and soft service), and needless to say, it was a complete fail.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then the bosses up there decided to give economy class for shorthaul routes a makeover. And just around that time, they were bleeding $$$ like mad. So cost-cutting went into overdrive, and then they started giving lunchbox(LCC style) to pax! WTF!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then they came out wif a survey that showed that most pax in econ(IIRC it was 93%) said that the foodboxes were great. Of coz it was great. You have a damn nice packaged box(really beautiful), but the food inside was like shyt... Of coz at first look it would be great rite?! MAS management is damn sly~...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They can go on claiming that they got world's first this that etc., but we all know that these are just empty words...</p>

              <p>I dunch wanna bash MAS... But seriously their branding CMI...
              Must sack their advertising director already. You know why?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They won 5star Skytrax, then go on publicity blitz, say what
              this and that 5star...<br> Then stupid mad "scholar" came out with the Malaysian thingy, using
              their IATA code(MH)... And calling it, "Not just a code, this
              stands for Malaysian Hospitality".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The moment I saw that it was epic advertising phail... I mean,
              of all things, you choose to advertise on something that is not a
              product?! Advertising on intangible goods only gives a slim chance
              of breaking it into people's minds(SQ does it well, marketing both
              hardware and soft service), and needless to say, it was a complete
              fail.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then the bosses up there decided to give economy class for
              shorthaul routes a makeover. And just around that time, they were
              bleeding $$$ like mad. So cost-cutting went into overdrive, and
              then they started giving lunchbox(LCC style) to pax! WTF!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then they came out wif a survey that showed that most pax in
              econ(IIRC it was 93%) said that the foodboxes were great. Of coz it
              was great. You have a damn nice packaged box(really beautiful), but
              the food inside was like shyt... Of coz at first look it would be
              great rite?! MAS management is damn sly~...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They can go on claiming that they got world's first this that
              etc., but we all know that these are just empty words...</p>

              <p>well, i know internally they still have some problems from the good old days but ever since idris jala took over, it has improved and gone into the black.</p>
              <p>their safety record also speaks for itself: pilots are disciplined and well trained. They can hold a candle to SIA pilots.</p>
