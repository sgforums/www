                  get the people to vote more righteous and

              <p>(Myhope for LKY)</p>
              <p>LKY is the single obstacle to our ongoing progress. We could have
                  arrived at being a greater country if we had put our resources to work
                  smartly for the past 20 years without his top-down selfish alienation
                  of the people dividing them into elites and non-elites rich and poor.
                  He is attempting to convert the whole of middle class and lower middle
                  class citizens into more useless goons by his type of policies. That is
                  the reason now many citizens can no longer start a small business
                  ending up as useless goons waiting to drive a taxi or clean the table.<br> <br> By his constant housing tax on low-cost housing and double- and triple-
                  vehicle tax alone without solutions to problems he has been driving up
                  the costs of doing business by taxing and hoarding and profiteering way
                  of running this country that no one or very few can start a small
                  business to keep the economy running or competitive.<br> <br> By pushing up the costs of doing business, we are now a down-grade
                  moribund economy drifting to find a small window of survival and easily
                  driven into recessions in the slightest world downturn.<br> <br> What can we do to make the economy competitive or stay in business?<br> <br> Two solutions: (1) For big businesses like GLCs - increase fees and charges with excuse like "no free lunch <br> <br> (2) Ministers stop all the LKY-style of taxing and hoarding monies in running the country.<br> Ministers are appointed from people with experiences in running the
                  whole business structuring and revamping total business strategies of
                  calibre like Dr. Winsemius Goh Keng Swee or Ooi Hong Leong or Stanley
                  Shih not those who only carry balls or bags or favors to charge higher
                  costs like maboro tan.<br> <br> Find a more capable group of ministers who have the overall knowledge
                  and command and ability and get them to be working furiously on
                  restructuring the economy to a value-adding economy as Goh Keng Swee
                  has done. Targets: created the latest IT inventions to tap into the
                  global super-personal-communications business, mastering the micro-chip
                  or wafer fab new technology applications and converting the entire

                  and the powerful elites.<br> <br> Get real and start to work the economy based on motivating all citizens and not just the rich and the elites.<br> <br> This is my hope for LKY if he is still a good leader and not trying to cover up his mistakes with more suing of people.</p>
