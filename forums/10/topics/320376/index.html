              <h1 class="clr">Singaporean youth world—class experts or super brats?</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Has fiercely—pragmatic Singapore turned into a nation of idealists and dreamers?</p>
              <p>Going by our youth’s lofty ambitions — a space cadet, a rock drummer
              and even a journalist in the mould of Woodward and Bernstein of
              Watergate fame — articulated at the recent Pre—University Seminar, it
              may seem so.</p>
              <p>Such idealism mostly surfaces on the personal front,
              however. When it comes to the collective, our youth are still finding
              it difficult to escape the streak of pragmatism that runs deep in
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, this is most clearly seen from their sentiments toward the Association of South—east Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>
              <p>Singapore
              undergraduates are among the most ambivalent about calling themselves
              ASEAN citizens, according to a recent survey commissioned by the ASEAN
              Foundation.</p>
              <p>At a time when Singapore is chair of the 10—member grouping, this finding is striking.</p>
              <p>Despite
              our leaders’ commitment to the region — going by their efforts to have
              the landmark Asean Charter ratified — our young elite and future
              leaders seem less so.</p>
              <p>In the eyes of Senior Parliamentary
              Secretary (Community Development, Youth and Sports) Teo Ser Luck, our
              youth want to see “value and benefits” in their endeavours.</p>
              <p>Along
              the same lines, National University of Singapore political scientist
              Reuben Wong told TODAY: “If ASEAN were richer, with more resources, if
              being a member means you get benefits, I’m sure Singaporeans would be
              proud to be a member.”</p>
              <p>What to make of this “what’s in it for me” mindset?</p>
              <p>To
              be fair, it is not confined to Singaporeans alone. On the flip side,
              the survey suggests that this attitude manifests in the enthusiasm
              toward ASEAN among the grouping’s least—developed nations — Laos,
              Cambodia and Vietnam.</p>
              <p>Calling their enthusiasm “not surprising”,
              survey researchers Dr Eric C Thompson from NUS and Dr Chulanee
              Thianthai of Thailand’s Chulalongkorn University said in their summary
              of findings: “From a purely rational—choice perspective, they would
              logically have the most to gain from membership in the Association.”</p>
              <p>Even
              the European Union — a regional grouping with a much longer history —
              shares this experience, pointed outDr Wong. Newer EU member states such
              as Estonia see membership through a “value—laden” lens, he said.</p>
              <p>However,
              given that Singapore is in a position to make a difference in the
              region, should the idealists among us lament the pervasiveness of a
              “self—above—others” outlook amongst our budding adults?</p>
              <p>Should we worry that we will go from producing world—class computer chips to manufacturing world—class selfish brats?</p>
              <p>The
              idealist in me would like to think not, heartened by the fact that our
              young also dare to dream to “change the world” for the better.</p>
              <p>For
              example, despite a seeming ambivalence about ASEAN, Singapore youth in
              the polytechnics displayed a lot of heart to raise funds for the
              victims of Myanmar’s Cyclone Nargis, even as companies preferred to
              donate to China’s Sichuan earthquake victims, as TODAY had reported.</p>
              <p>Closer
              to home, how do we ensure that personal ideals are also rooted in
              collective ideals, in a Singapore where economic pragmatism has been
              the calling card that helped transform it from a resource—poor
              island—state into the New York of South—east Asia?</p>
              <p>For, without
              collective ideals, what is to stop a new breed of educated, mobile
              young Singaporeans from taking a mercenary approach on where they call
              home, or whether to use Singapore as a “launch pad” to chase their
              dreams as Community Development, Youth and Sports Minister Vivian
              Balakrishnan has urged them.</p>
              <p>It may be time to ask what effect an
              emphasis on economic pragmatism would have on our collective ideals.
              Otherwise, the all—important question our youths will fire is: What is
              in it for me?</p>
              <p>If we want to stand a better chance of keeping them here, Singapore as we know it must evolve quickly.</p>
              <p>Perhaps,
              a good start is to engage our idealistic youths on our old ways of
              thinking, even taboo subjects, such as the relevance of ethnic
              self—help groups today or media regulations. — TODAY/ra</p>
