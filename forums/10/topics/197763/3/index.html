            <div class='col-md body'>i dun find it surprised that Mah rejected Chiam request.<br>given if Chiam is the ruling party here, i don't think he would release 80m to others too.<br>everyone is the same. The opp. will say such good things here and then, but when it comes to ruling with power, i don't think they would stay so "upright" as they say during their rallies. power corrupts, this is true.<br><br>managing a country is not so simple as talking in rally, making promises.<br>if so, most forumers here can go be ministers also, since so good at talking..<br>then i tink we'll have 80% ministers, 20% civilians, good?<br><br>i tink alot ppl need to understand that pure bravery against the pap is of no use, they need brains/plans.<br>and given the way that i see, i tink it just take guts to become a opp. no brain nvm, have guts can liao..<br><br>me not a strong supporter of both parties, but at least from the points i see now, pap did more things/merits that what the opp. had did.  the pap may have their bad points too, can anyone promise with their life that opp. would not commit any "error"? i dare to say opp. would eventually commits "errors" too, if they are ruling.<br><br>and please do not say when will sg ppl wake up their ideas to support the opp..<br>there is no gurantee tat under the opp. we will be better, we mite be worst than now, it's all a gamble afterall.<br></div>

Any party may choose to do so as it may deem fit but however in the event, should the political party cannot or failed to deliver on its promises after a win then the party is moving towards self-destruction for taking her citizens for a ride.<br><br>On instances, if the audience was clearly not interested in the 'Goodies' offered by party A and hence rejected the offer put up, then there is no obligation for party A to fullfill. It cannot be called 'vote buying' on two factors.<br><br>1. The offer-acceptance/rejection tactic is free for all<br>2. Party A failed to achieve an agreement by a rejection on offer.<br><br>Henceforth, any subsquently aid/help by party A to B should be view as a good-will gesture and not an obligation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Coincident or not, I am just so glad that the government chose Labour Day to reward the contributors of nation's economy by a holiday and sending out the progress package on that day. That is double happiness for me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
