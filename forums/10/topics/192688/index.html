I know people involved in processing applications for various subsidies and there are families that have 4 or more kids even though both parents make a combined less than 1k per month. And some of these idiots, after getting their subsidies, actually have more babies a year later! (their re-application forms will have 1 extra birth cert). WTF are they thinking? Quite frankly a lot of them should not even have 1 kid, or even get married.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
