We need to a conduct bigger study before we can generalise that this is the sentiment of the current women in Singapore," said Dr Tan Thiam Chye, Principal Investigator, Obstetrical &amp; Gynaecological Society.<br><br>"We might even consider advising the ministry to conduct a larger scale survey to look into the specific reasons of why women are not contemplating having children," continued Dr Tan.<br><br>One reason for this may be that they feel more financially-able to support a family as compared to those who have secondary education or lower.<br><br>Dr Tan adds that the survey also showed, while most women were well informed on pregnancy and nutritional supplements in pregnancy, only half of them planned their pregnancies.<br><br>The survey also looked at whether women suffered from depression during pregnancy - one in five reported having such symptoms.<br><br>Such findings are significant in the light of recent reports that the fertility rate in Singapore has dropped below the required 2.1 replacement level.<br><br>The SouthWest Community Development Council (CDC) says it plans to continue working with the Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society of Singapore to conduct programmes to address issues of pregnancy among women, as well as encourage more women to have children.<br><br>Mayor of the SouthWest CDC, Dr Amy Khor says, "Also to raise awareness about issues or problems that you can face in late pregnancy or pregnancy at a later age and also of course pregnancy-related issues, which are also some concerns that the women express. So today for instance, at the "Shape Up and Feel Great", we have already started free medical consultation for women with the OGSS.<br><br>"If they want to consult the OGSS regarding health issues and pregnancy related issues and so on, we hope that we'll also do talks on starting a family, about various risks that you may also face if you actually start a family late and also try and allay some of their concerns and fears about having a child, about parenting and so on."<br><br>Also unveiled at the SouthWest CDC event was the first book on women in grassroots.<br><br>The book, entitled "Women Empowering Community - 40 years of Singapore Women in Grassroots" traces the development and achievements of the Women Executive Committee (WEC) members.<br><br>"I think what is important is we hope that this book will raise awareness of the WEC and the public in general about the contributions that women have made in the heartlands. In terms of mobilising, galvanising the women, creating opportunities for them to take part in meaningful activities and helping them to socialise. We also hope that it will spur more women to join us in playing a role in the heartland, play a useful role in the heartlands and helping to motivate more women," says Dr Khor.<br><br>Over the years, the WEC has seen changes in its programmes along with the evolving role of women.<br><br>While it started out creating opportunities for home makers to learn useful skills, it now conducts activities that cater to the more affluent women, such as conducting Yoga classes, spa therapy and even career talks. - CNA/yy<br></div>
