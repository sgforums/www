            <div class='col-md body'>From today's Strait Times<br><br><blockquote><strong>Why train our overseas competitors? </strong>I REFER to the article, 'Singapore Poly to take in full-fee foreign students' (The Sunday Times, Oct 3). It is indeed a good move to attract full-paying foreign students to study in our polytechnics. However, I question the move by the polytechnics to set up similar training centres overseas.<br><br>This is akin to training our competitors en masse. The short-term gain may be an increase in revenue but in the long term we may actually be shooting ourselves in the foot.<br><br>One of the reasons multinational companies invest in Singapore is our highly trained workers, most of them the products of our universities, polytechnics and institutes of technical education.<br><br>If we set up training centres overseas, we will be training our low-cost competitors and paving the way for the future 'outsourcing' of jobs from Singapore.<br><br>It might be better to improve the calibre and reputation of our polytechnics and universities so that overseas students will pay to study here. If we are selling products like frozen prata, we need to distribute them regionally. However, where training services are concerned, going regional can also mean attracting those from the region to come to us instead.<br><br>Not only will it boost revenue for our education sector, but it will also boost our retail and rental-property sectors.<br><br>Besides this, some of the overseas students may put down roots in Singapore, thus increasing our local talent pool.<br><br>DR ANNE CHONG SU YAN </blockquote>What do u all think? Wise move by SP?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

What people should be worried about is foreign preferences carried to the extreme by over-liberal openness thereby encouraging abuses by local employers and foreign half-baked talents.<br><br>Many presumably IT talents cannot communicate well in English. Ask some of the IT fellow Singaporeans, many presumably foreign talents are actually half-baked ones but are employed by boses to enjoy for some minor savings.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discovery of talents</span><br><br>By offering education opportunities to people from other countries, we are opening our country to more people, from which talents in various fields may be spotted, and groomed.<br><br>Singapore is a small country, and depending on our small pool of professionals is insufficient to keep our country's economy going. Unless we see an influx of trained workers, this is a pretty good system to attract potential talents to our country, and to spot and put these people to good use in Singapore.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exposure to Singapore</span><br><br>Singapore offers a different experience as compared to other countries. Certain people might like staying here after their studies and decide to migrate here. Given our abysmal birth rates, we might need the boost in the future.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Education hub</span><br><br>As part of our focus on education as a major locomotive for our economy, these foreign students would be a resounding endorsement for the Singapore Education Experience, and establish us as an education hub.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Disadvantages</span><br><br>The current focus on foreign students will lead to a de-emphasis on locals - something which these institutions were established for. Essentially, this means they have lost sight of their original focus. There are many people failing to gain entry into the local universities and polytechnics. Rather than dismiss them out right, it would be a service to the future generation that the government studies why these people fall out of the local system, and implement remedies to improve the situation.<br><br>The focus on foreign students do not guarantee that they would commit themselves to Singapore. Many eventually return to their home countries, bringing with them valuable information and experience gained in Singapore. Besides putting their home countries in good stead, they also compete with Singapore, using <span style="font-style: italic;">the very</span> resources that we have provided them with. Not a comforting thought.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Bottom line</span><br><br>Training foreign students should only be an endeavour undertaken as a charity towards poorer countries, and should not be depended upon as a source as a sustained pool of foreign talents. Such trained foreigners often have their allegiances with their home countries, and are probably not worth the effort and public tax money.</div>
