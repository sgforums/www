In fact they're probably the only country I know who is so loud-mouthed about their wants. Pity all too often what they get is nowhere near what they want<br><br>This attitude has obviously rubbed off on you. Malaysia has said it was interested in armed helicopters before singapore confirmed its interest. The first batch of RSAF Apaches have been signed sealed and delivered, meanwhile you're threatening to kick our asses with Rooivalks...gee I wonder why I'm so scared  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Examples of your boastfulness:<br>Wanted to get Tornadoes and Hawks, ended up with significantly downsized Hawk order.<br>Talked about wanted 30+ aircraft, ended up with 18 MiGs and 8 Hornets.<br>Wanted submarines since the 1980s, finally ordered in 2002<br>Attack helos (see above)<br><br>I hate to tell you this, but with track record like this, you guys make yourselves the laughing stock of the world.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh no... you're not gonna try to pull off a "My Lai" massacre again! shit... the P.R fallout was horrible after that!<br><br>At least have the good sense to try to keep it quiet... besides, i don't like the idea of killing civillians. Not because its cruel or anything... but such acts clearly shows that the armies perpetrating the atrocities have no idea how to conduct the war any longer and are performing random acts of terror to hope to pressure the opposite side to end the war... thats leaving things too much to chance.<br><br>Case in Point: Nanking Massacre... the japs didn't go on a rampage for fun... it was co-ordinated at the highest level with the clear intention of its consequences and intended effect. It didn't work.<br><br>"My Lai" didn't work either... I'll rather pump 5.56 into where it matters.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by EXCO:</div><div class="quote_body">Did you know that after the Americans had enough of backstabbing by the villagers, they killed every single villager they saw and wherever they went, they did the same? America did not lose the vietnam war. VC didn't win either.  What is it about repeating history? we will very gladly kill every single villager we see and flatten the whole of KL.
