The captain got on the command net. Reception was so bad inside the carrier that he could barely hear a respond, but he broadcast his alarm in disjointed phrase: -We got left back on National...The Paki vehicle were gonna follow us home, the foot soldier...but we loaded up..but we had probably fifteen or twenty still had to walk. They took off and left us. We need somebody to get down there and pick them up.<br>-Roger, i understand, Harrell had answered. I thought everybody was loaded.I got about three calls. They were telling me they were loaded. Where are they pn National?<br>-Romeo, this is Juliet. Im sending this blind.I need those soldier picked up on National ASAP!<br>In fact, Perino and the others had been picked up, but not without some trouble. The lieutenent and about six other men, Rangers and some D-boys, were the last ones on the street when what looked like the last vehicles approached. The exhausted soldiers shouted and waved but the MALAYSIAN driver paid him them no mind until one of the D-boys stepped out and leveled a CAR-15 at him. He stopped. They just piled in on top of the other men already jammed inside.<br><br>u call this involvement in real war??<br>acting blur when u suppose to rescue soldier??<br>hai...tsk tsk tsk pathtic gutless piece of shit..<br>Brudder dun malu urself lah..wahahahaha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
