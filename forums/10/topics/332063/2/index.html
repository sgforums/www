              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Recently a friend of mine (we’ll call her ‘Esther’) was admitted to the Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) department of the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">General</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hospital</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (SGH). </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Esther had earlier seen her GP who recommended that she consulted doctors at SGH to determine the cause of her illness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Day One</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Registration – </span></em></strong><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">8.40pm</span></em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The registration at the triage section of the A&amp;E’s Isolation Ward (IW) was smooth and swift and went without a hitch. The triage nurse was courteous, friendly and apparently highly efficient. We thanked her and took our seats at the waiting area for Esther’s number to be called by the doctor on duty that night.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">It was about </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">8.40pm</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The consultation with the doctor eventually took place at around </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">10pm</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> – after some 1 hour 20 mins later. Esther was told that she had to be admitted for overnight observation so that more tests could be done to ascertain the cause of her illness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">So, we returned to the waiting area and waited for Esther to be assigned a ward and a bed. In the meantime, a nurse told us that they would find a bed in the IW for Esther to rest temporarily, instead of sitting on the chairs in the waiting area, which was an exercise in endurance for someone who is ill.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">It turned out to be a frustrating, excruciating and a very long wait indeed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">At </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12.20am</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, some 3 hours and 40 mins after Esther had registered at the A&amp;E, I approached the triage nurse and asked if they were aware that Esther was waiting for a bed in the IW. (In all those 3 hours 40 mins, we were not informed or updated about when a bed might be available.) </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The nurse was very understanding and explained that there were no beds available and that there was nothing they could do. And so the wait continued.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12.50am</span></em></strong><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> – 4 hours 10 mins</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">At </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12.50am</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> – 4 hours and 10mins after registration – we were finally informed that a bed was available in the IW’s Fever Zone. The relief – and exhaustion - on Esther’s face was evident. She would be able to rest her tired self finally.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The “Fever Zone”, where the temporary beds were, is a small section within the Isolation Ward. It has two rooms – one for male patients and one for female patients. Each room could hold about 6 to 7 beds. The Fever Zone is the place where patients who have to be warded are temporarily placed while waiting to be admitted to the wards of their choice. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Esther had opted for a B2-plus ward (5 patients in an air-conditioned room).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">We were hopeful that we wouldn’t have to wait just as long for Esther to be assigned a bed in the B2-plus ward. The IW ward has its television and lights on 24-hours and patients are wheeled out to the wards and new ones wheeled in, a situation which doesn’t really allow one to rest properly amidst the noise and the comings and goings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Our hope was misplaced.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The long wait was to last till the next day. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Day Two</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">9pm</span></em></strong><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> – 24 hours 20 mins</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">At about </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">9pm</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> on Day Two – 24 hours 20 minutes after registration - Esther was informed that a B2 bed was available and the nurse asked if she wanted it. As a B2 ward is non-air conditioned, as opposed to a B2-plus ward, Esther declined. (See <a href="http://www.sgh.com.sg/ForPatientsnVisitors/HospitalCharges/InpatientCharges/"><span style="color: #990000;">here</span></a>)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The reason why she declined is because we suspected that Esther might have to stay quite a while in the hospital (as she already had 2 previous unsuccessful blood tests, one at a private hospital and the other with her GP) and because of her constitutional sensitivity to warm temperatures we decided to wait for a B2-plus bed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Thus, we waited a further 3 hours.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12.50am</span></em></strong><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> – 28 hours 10 mins</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">At about </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12 midnight</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, a nurse informed us that a B2-plus bed was available. Preparation was then made to transfer us to the ward. Esther was put on a wheelchair and wheeled to the corridor of the IW. We were so tired from all the hours of waiting. It was only 15 minutes later that we heard the nurse informing the ward, through a phone call, that Esther was ready to be transferred. A further 12 minutes later, a male nurse arrived to wheel Esther to the B2-plus area of the hospital. Esther had waited for about 30 minutes in the corridor. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">It was </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12.50am</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> on Day Two before Esther finally managed to put her head down on a bed in a B2-plus ward.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">All in all, from registration to being admitted to a B2-plus ward, it took <strong><em>28 hours and 10 minutes. </em></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Nurses were patient, courteous and professional</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Now, before you think that my frustration is directed at the nurses on duty that night, let me say that they were very patient, courteous and professional in their duties. Although they could have done better in some areas – such as keeping us informed of the situation with the availability of the bed – it is understandable as the A&amp;E is a very busy place to work in. The nurses also had to tend to many patients.<br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I would like to mention, particularly, the nurses at the IW’s Fever Zone. They were compassionate and understanding. This is especially commendable when one considers that most of the patients in the IW that night were elderly and weak. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">One of the nurses explained to Esther that the situation has been such since the Chinese New Year. She also said that the wards in </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Tan</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Tock</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Seng</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hospital</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> were fully occupied and patients were being directed to SGH. Hence the shortfall of beds there.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">A serious problem</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Esther was not the only one who had to wait so many hours for a bed. But perhaps she is luckier than others who had had to wait in wheelchairs in the waiting area for hours and hours on end that night we were there – for even the number of beds in the IW is limited.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">While MM Lee may be right that “within one-and-a-half to two hours flat, you’d know what went wrong” (even though in Esher’s case the cause of her illness is still unknown 5 days after admission to SGH), the other important thing is the availability, or the squeeze, on the number of hospital beds.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">According to the nurses there, this is not a sudden or a temporary hiccup. It has been like this since the Chinese New Year, as earlier mentioned.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">While we trumpet the excellence of our clinical healthcare service (and I don’t disagree with this), it is what happens on the ground to each patient that needs to be looked at.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Waiting for more than 28 hours for a bed is simply unacceptable.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I hope that the Minister for Health, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, will put some effort into solving this problem – especially now that he has been called “the best Health Minister Singapore has ever had” by none other than SM Goh himself. (<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_222196.html"><span style="color: #990000;">Straits Times</span></a>)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">When you are sick and weak, you shouldn’t be made to endure a frustrating and excruciating 28 hours just for a bed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">And I am sure that Esther is not the only one who has had this experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Perhaps the new <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/276541/1/.html"><span style="color: #990000;">Khoo Teck Puat</span></a> hospital in Yishun, scheduled to open in 2010, will help to alleviate the situation. But that is left to be seen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">One can only hope that </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">’s healthcare system will not become what MM Lee said of the system in the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">UK</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, where he experienced “restlessness and unhappiness” when waiting for 45 minutes for an ambulance:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“There’s no connection between those in the system and the patients..” </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span>-<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">MM Lee,<strong> </strong>(<a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw03/031103to.htm"><span style="color: #990000;">TODAY</span></a>)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">From Esther’s experience, one could say the same for </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">’s system as well.</span></p>

              little daughter Anastasia.</strong></p>
              <p>But with a <span style="color: #ff0000;">90-minute drive</span> in grinding traffic from the city to the family home in Sydney's
              northwest, the 39-year-old rarely steps through the front door before
              7pm.</p>
              <p>"I sit on the car park - or the M2 as some people call it - most
              days," he said. "It's annoying, it's frustrating, and it's costing my
              family a lot of money."</p>
              <p>Mr Radovancevic works in Mascot for a company that distributes
              office supplies. He lives at Kellyville Ridge with his wife Lidija, a
              schoolteacher, and their three children.</p>
              <p>Commuting to work is a daily drama for the family man. The drive costs about $150 a week in petrol and $20 a day in tolls.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, he can catch a bus from Rouse Hill to the CBD, then a
              train to Mascot - a trip he says takes even longer than the<span style="color: #ff0000;"> three hours</span> he spends in the car each day.</p>
              <p>"To beat the traffic I sometimes leave home at<span style="color: #ff0000;"> 5.30am _</span> the later you leave it in the morning the longer it takes," he said.</p>
              <p>And in the evening, his wife and children are forced to wait at home for dad to return from work.................</p>

              <p>The growing use of oxycodone in the injecting room - triggered by
              the heroin drought - was an accurate sample of drug trends in the wider
              community, experts said last night. Tablets were almost certainly
              obtained through doctor shopping, the practice of attending numerous
              doctors with fake symptoms to access the drug for personal use or
              dealing.</p>
              <p>Doctor's prescriptions for oxycodone have exploded in recent years,
              with an undetermined amount of it now finding its way on to the black
              market, as has occurred in the US. It is dubbed "hillbilly heroin"
              because it is widely used by poorer residents in parts of the US.</p>
              <p>The figures on use in the injecting room were contained in the June
              quarterly report for the facility, released under Freedom of
              Information laws.</p>
              <p>There is now so much oxycodone in the injecting room that staff hand
              out filters to users to screen talc and other binding agents as addicts
              prepare the oral tablet for injection.</p>
              <p>Oxycodone is the generic name for the drug available under a number
              of names, usually OxyContin, OxyNorm or Endone or even in suppository
              form branded Proladone.</p>
              <p>Tablets that cost $1.50 over the counter sell for more than $50 on
              the black market and drug squad commander Superintendent Greig Newbury
              said its illegal use was an unprecedented problem.</p>
              <p>James Pitts, chief executive officer of the rehabilitation
              organisation Odyssey House, said there had been a significant increase
              in the numbers of people seeking help for addiction to oxycodone.</p>
              <p>He put the reason down to a heroin drought and because the drug was available from doctors.</p>
              <p>"It is a slow-release morphine derivative and people probably have
              their own particular doctors who prescribe it or they shop around at
              different doctors," Mr Pitts said. "It is not uncommon to forge
              prescriptions. People will steal prescription pads."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Agence France Presse<br>July 22, 2005<br>SINGAPORE <br><br><br></span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A</span>FTER spending S$400,000 (US$240,964) to come up with a suitable new name for the revamped downtown Marina Bay, Singapore has decided to stick to, well, Marina Bay, media reports said Friday, July 22.</p>
              <p>The city-state's urban development authorities and global branding company Interbrand spent months deliberating over 400 potential names before settling on the original moniker, according to the <em>Today </em>newspaper.</p>
              <p>The $400,000 financed a massive branding exercise that involved market tests, focus group discussions and consultations with developers and the general public, <em>Today </em>said.</p>
              <p>Finding the right name for the city-state's revised downtown, which will include the much-debated resort casino, a new business district and swanky retail outlets, was a process akin to parents deciding on a name for their child, National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan.</p>
              <p>"We started off with (the name) Marina Bay and after looking at everything, the name that really tugged at the heartstrings was in front of us," Mah said. "The name itself is not new, but what has been used informally so far has endeared itself to all parties."</p>
              <p>Not suprisingly, many Singaporeans were quick to lambast the government's latest publicity efforts as an utter waste of public funds.</p>
              <p>"<em>Waaah</em>, you so clever... (you) think and think and think and come up (with) this new old name," Rockson Takumi Tan wrote on his popular blog, http://rockson.blogspot.com.</p>

              <p>In the last six months, Madam Mala Swamy has cut down on weekend outings with her two children. She saves on transport costs by taking them to parks or malls that are within walking distance.</p>
              <p>Since December, her boss has stopped paying her $50 every month in Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions, claiming it is not in her contract. The 39-year- old, who has only three O-level passes, earns $750 a month as a carpark attendant in a commercial building in Bukit Merah. She works an eight-hour day from Mondays to Fridays and half-days on Saturdays.</p>
              <p>By day, she badgers her boss for the CPF money, such that he has taken to avoiding her. At night, she lies awake, worrying how she will meet the payments for the four-room HDB flat she lives in with her odd-job worker husband.
              
              </p>
              <p>But she does not dare to complain officially, for fear of losing her hard-won job. She secured it only after over 60 job applications and after 10 years as a housewife. At countless interviews, she was told that her previous work experience as an administrative assistant was 'not relevant'.</p>
              <p>Hers is the typical plight of the underpaid - and often unfairly treated - contract worker in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Each month, the Unit for Contract and Casual Workers (UCCW), set up by the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) in May last year, handles about 10 cases, mostly complaints about withheld wages, CPF payments, medical benefits and annual leave.</p>
              <p>The complainants may be a disgruntled individual, or as many as 50 workers contracted to a single company.</p>
              <p>Mr Mah Cheong Fatt, head of UCCW, said a survey conducted between January and March this year of 2,000 contract workers, mainly school cleaners, reflected similar alleged mistreatment. But many, he noted, often do not complain officially, for fear of losing their jobs.</p>
              <p>'Contract workers' typically refer to those who work on fixed-term employment contracts, usually lasting a year, or until their service contract with a company ends, whichever is sooner. They usually work as cleaners, landscape workers, dispatch riders, carpark attendants, security guards or valets here.</p>
              <p>Their numbers are rising, according to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), which defines contract workers as those who work part-time, full-time and on ad-hoc projects that last a few months.</p>
              <p>From 80,000 workers, forming 4 per cent of the workforce in 2002, their numbers rose to 172,000, or 12 per cent of the workforce in 2006. Last year, this group inched up to 183,600.</p>
              <p>Of these, UCCW's statistics show that 20 per cent are cleaners and labourers, 19 per cent in professional and administrative services, 15 per cent technicians, 15 per cent in sales, 15 per cent clerks and 16 per cent machine operators, craftsmen and others.</p>
              <p>Most contract workers tend to be aged 40 and above, and are primary or lower secondary school dropouts. Most get into casual work as a last resort - after difficulty in landing full-time employment, prolonged illness or time away from the workforce - thinking it is a temporary measure to make ends meet, but they end up as serial contract workers, often for life.</p>
              <p><strong>AT THE MERCY OF EMPLOYERS</strong></p>
              <p>Out of eight contract workers - two cleaners, two gardeners, two airport trolley handlers and two carpark attendants - interviewed by The Sunday Times, the lowest monthly wage earned was $550 and the highest, $1,200.</p>
              <p>All said that upgrading their skills to remain relevant, as the Government constantly exhorts, was near impossible as they work shifts, have irregular days off, or pull 12- to 18-hour workdays, holding two jobs to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>Six work at least six days a week. Six receive no CPF. Five have no medical benefits. Four had their salaries docked when on medical leave. In one case, a cleaner who declined to be named even had $50 deducted from her salary when her supervisor found water droplets on the toilet floor.</p>
              <p>Most said they have seen their pay packets shrink progressively through the years. Whenever their contracting company loses out during the tender process to a cheaper bid, they are either shed with little notice or absorbed into a 'new company'.</p>
              <p>But the 'new company' was often new in name only: The workers remained in exactly the same job, cleaning or guarding the same premises, but at reduced rates.</p>
              <p>NTUC's deputy secretary-general Halimah Yacob, who has raised the plight of contract workers in Parliament, has noted that contractors often offer 'cut-throat prices' to secure contracts, then 'cut corners with workers'.</p>
              <p>A 66-year-old cleaner, who lives in a one-room flat in Ang Mo Kio, told The Sunday Times he was paid less each time he 'changed uniform'. He has had three such changes in the last six years. He now earns $650, down from $700 in 2001.</p>
              <p>This corresponds with the latest Report on Wages in Singapore 2006, which showed that low- wage earners' salaries had fallen by 30 per cent. For example, cleaners and labourers who earned $860 in 1996 took home just $600 monthly 10 years later in 2006.</p>
              <p>National University of Singapore sociology lecturer Vedi Hadiz, who researches labour issues, said: 'This is because of the spillover effect on the local labour market with the existing reliance on foreign workers - wages get depressed and local workers can be displaced.</p>
              <p>'Serial contract workers are a trend worldwide. But the difference between Singapore and other countries is the level of protection that the workers enjoy under the law.'</p>
              <p>In Singapore, the Employment Act does not stipulate, for example, minimum wages or if there should be a written employment contract.</p>
              <p><strong>SEEKING FAIR TREATMENT FOR ALL</strong></p>
              <p>But there are other official channels to seek redress here. The MOM has received around 800 complaints in the past two years from contract and casual workers. The bulk of these involved non-payment of wages. Seven in 10 cases were successfully mediated. To date, all of UCCW's complaint cases have been resolved without the ministry having to step in.</p>
              <p>Parliamentarians have also been calling for a better deal for the growing pool of contract workers here. Acting Manpower Minister Gan Kim Yong, in March this year, and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in last month's May Day address, also voiced their concerns for contract workers.</p>
              <p>The Tripartite Committee on CPF and Work-related Benefits for Low-wage Workers issued six guidelines earlier this year for companies that outsource services. These include awarding bids to contractors that comply with employment laws and ensuring that contract workers have written employment contracts which clearly state working hours, pay and benefits.</p>
              <p>In March, the MOM issued an advisory to all companies and contractors on responsible outsourcing practices. It put on its website a sample employment contract spelling out terms such as basic salaries, allowances, CPF contributions, overtime rates and leave that contract workers should be entitled to. It also published an employee booklet in four languages to educate contract workers on their entitlements.</p>
              <p>The UCCW has also held workshops for about 100 companies and contractors. UCCW's director, MP Zainudin Nordin, is working towards inculcating 'best sourcing' practices. That means companies should assess contract bids not on price alone, but also on contract workers' benefits, salaries and leave.</p>
              <p>'It is a moral responsibility on their part. They cannot just not see when the cleaner in their office is not well treated,' he said.</p>
              <p>The UCCW is also encouraging companies to include outsourcing practices as part of their corporate social responsibility ethos, said Mr Mah.</p>
              <p>'Corporate social responsibility is about treating all workers - including workers in the contracted company's payroll - with decent salaries and benefits,' he said.</p>
              <p>But the trouble is companies outsource services like cleaning that require a lot of manpower, precisely because they want to take it off their payroll, to concentrate on their core business. By extension, they see it as the contracting company's responsibility, not theirs, to look into workers' welfare.</p>
              <p>Organisations like SingHealth and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore which outsource services such as cleaning, pest control, housekeeping and landscaping, said in replies to The Sunday Times that they 'leave' management of contracted staff to the contractor.</p>
              <p>Businesses, being businesses, also face constant bottom-line pressures to pick the lowest bid when choosing contractors, partly because it is the most logical and easiest to justify to management.</p>
              <p>A purchasing officer with a company that outsources its cleaning, lift maintenance and landscaping services said frankly: 'Most companies here don't have an attitude of paying for services. We want it cheap and good.'</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, some companies are conscientiously bucking the trend by weighing in the welfare of contract workers. One local hospital, which declined to be named, does a detailed assessment of the deal the contracting company offers its workers. It looks closely at their salaries, benefits and leave terms.</p>
              <p>Some contracting companies, such as Danish-owned ISS Facilities Services, also refuse to play the 'bargain basement' bidding game.</p>
              <p>The 13-year-old Singapore- based company which provides cleaning, waste disposal and landscaping services and hires over 3,000 Singaporean employees, makes it a point to bow out of bidding for a contract if its homework shows that the company awarding the tender is focused on the lowest price.</p>
              <p>Its chief executive officer, Mr Woon Hiap Chuan, said: 'I am happy too as I cannot bring myself to bid lower and then bully the 'little people' by cutting their salaries or benefits.</p>
              <p>'Cheap and good cannot always work. We need to think of workers' livelihoods.'</p>

Those are the individuals who have contacts with the trafficking agents. ICA is not being honest about this case. <br><br>ICA said that Ms. Wongsa applied to solicit legally in singapore through AVB. AVB rejected her application and recommend to ICA to ban her from entering singapore in the future. Ms. Wongsa was directed to go to Anti Vice and apply, through prior arrangement. Why she was rejected is unknown at this time, but Anti Vice is certainly aware of the particulars.<br><br>At the time that Ms. Wongsa entered Singapore, she could not speak Thai, or any other language but Akha, could not read or write. Certainly the arrangements have been made between Hatyai and Anti Vice.<br><br>We are concerned that the government of Singapore does not recognize the issue of trafficking and that Akha women are trafficked into their country for brothels. The Singapore Immigration people (ICA) have repeatedly told us that they are "checking into the case" but then never reply to our email. <br><br>We are informed that there numerous Akha women in Changi prison, possibly also victims of trafficking into Singapore. Does Singapore arrest victims of trafficking? We find it disgusting that Singapore allows women to be trafficked into the country for what ever reasons. We find it more disgusting that they put the victims in prison.<br><br>Ms. Wongsa was sentenced to one year in Changi Prison this last week.<br>She entered Singapore on documents supplied by her Employment Agent from Thailand but was refused a work permit and sent out of the country in 2004. Now on her own documents, Thai ID card and Passport, she has entered Singapore with her fiance. When she applied for an extension of visa as she and her fiance were to marry, the Singapore authorities told her that she had previously traveled under a different name and passport supplied by her employer, so was now to be arrested. <br><br>Upon her previous trip and return to Thailand, her employer told her that the Singapore police demanded 100,000 baht and she was made to repay this money working in Hatyai.<br><br>When Akha children are born, Thai authorities often give them a Thai name on their travel documents and any made up birth date. Employers often supply the Akha with documents for travel, as they may not even have an ID card of their own. These are the agreements they have to live with as contract labor. In some cases, contract labor may be more like trafficking or debt bondage. While it appears that Ms. Wongsa's employer was familiar to the Singapore police, Ms. Wongsa is being made to pay the price for what is often standard practice for people being shipped from Thailand to foreign countries.<br><br>There is little to no protection for ethnic women who find themselves in this situation in Thailand.<br><br>We have contacted the Singapore Embassy and Ambassador in the US, the ICA in Singapore, an MP in Singapore, Amnesty International and a number of individuals and agencies regarding this case. We are asking that her case be reviewed and that Akha women are not made to pay the price for either trafficking or unethical Agents who put them in these situations. We are asking that she be released and NOT deported from Singapore.<br><br>Please contact the Singapore Embassy regarding this case.</p>

              <h1>The Burma-Singapore Axis:</h1>
              <h2>Globalizing the Heroin Trade</h2>
              <h3>by Leslie Kean and Dennis Bernstein</h3>
              <h4>Covert Action Quarterly, Spring 1998</h4>
              <p><img src="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/PageMill_Images/redblueline.gif" alt="" width="301" height="11" align="bottom"></p>
              <h4> </h4>
              <h4>Singapore's economic linkage with Burma is one of the most vital factors for the survival of Burma's military regime," says Professor Mya Maung, a Burmese economist based in Boston. This link, he continues, is also central to "the expansion of the heroin trade.") Singapore has achieved the distinction of being the Burmese junta's number one business partner -both largest trading partner and largest foreign investor.</h4>
              <h4>More than half these investments, totaling upwards of $1.3 billion, are in partnership with Burma's infamous heroin kingpin Lo Hsing Han, who now controls a substantial portion of the world's opium trade. The close political, economic, and military relationship between the two countries facilitates the weaving of millions of narco-dollars into the legitimate world economy</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Singapore has also become a major player in Asian commerce.</h4>
              <h4>According to Steven Green, llS Ambassador to Singapore, that city-states free market policies have "allowed this small country to develop one of the world's most successful trading and investment economies." Singapore also has a strong role in the powerful 132-member country World Trade Organization.</h4>
              <h4>Indeed, the tiny China Sea island of three and a half million people is known far and wide as the blue chip of the region-a financial trading base and a route for the vast sums of money that flow in and out of Asia.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>If the brutal Burmese dictatorship's international pariah status is of any concern to its more powerful partner, Singapore shows no sign of it.</h4>
              <h4>Following the March 24 visit of Singapore's Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong to Rangoon, a Singapore spokesperson proclaimed, "Singapore and Myanmar should continue to explore areas where they can complement each other." As both countries continue to celebrate their "complementary" relationship, the international community must take note of the powerful support this relationship provides both to Burma's illegitimate regime and to its booming billion dollar drug trade.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Drugs 'R' Us</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>The Burmese military dictatorship- known by the acronym SLORC for State Law and Order Restoration Council until it changed its name to the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) last November-depends on the resources of Burma's drug barons for its financial survival. Since it seized power in 1988, opium production has doubled, equaling all legal exports and making the country the world's biggest heroin supplier.</h4>
              <h4>Burma now supplies the US with 60 percent of its heroin imports and has recently become a major regional producer of methamphetamines. With 50 percent of the economy unaccounted for, drug traffickers, businessmen and government officials are able to integrate spectacular profits throughout Burma's permanent economy.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Both the Burmese generals and drug lords have been able to take advantage of Singapore's liberal banking laws and money laundering opportunities. In 1991, for example, the SLORC laundered $400 million through a Singapore bank which it used as a down payment for Chinese arms. Despite the large sum, Burma's foreign exchange reserves registered no change either before or after the sale.</h4>
              <h4>With no laws to prevent money laundering, Singapore is widely reported to be a financial haven for Burma's elite, including its two most notorious traffickers, Lo Hsing Han and Khun Sa (also known by his Chinese name Chang Qifu).</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>SLORC cut a deal with Khun Sa for his "surrender" in early 1996, allowing him protection and business opportunities in exchange for retirement from the drug trade. Khun Sa now bills himself as "a commercial real estate agent who also has a foot in the Burmese construction industry.</h4>
              <h4>Already in control of a bus route into the northern poppy growing region where the military is actively involved in the drug business, he is now investing $250 million in a new highway between Rangoon and Mandalay, an SPDC cabinet member confirmed. "The Burmese government says one thing but does another," according to Banphot Piamdi, director of Thailand's Northern Region's Narcotics Suppression Center. "It claims to have subdued Khun Sa's group.</h4>
              <h4>...</h4>
              <h4>However the fact is that the group under the supervision of...Khun Sa's son has received permission from Rangoon to produce narcotics in the areas along the Thai-Burmese border.</h4>

              <h4>Khun Sa's son is not the only trafficker reaping benefits in the Shan State area which borders Thailand and China and serves as Burma's primary poppy growing area. Field intelligence and ethnic militia sources consistently report a pattern of Singapore's investments in Burma are opening doors for the drug traffickers, giving them access to banks and financial systems."</h4>
              <h4>Burmese military involvement with drug production in these remote areas. Government troops offer protection to the heroin and amphetamine refineries in the area in exchange for payoffs and gifts, such as Toyota sedans, pistols and army uniforms.</h4>
              <h4>The only access to the refineries is through permits issued by Burmese military intelligence - without this, the heavily guarded areas surrounding the refineries are too dangerous to approach. The military is also involved in protecting the transport of narcotics throughout the region, which the authorities have sealed off from the outside world.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>"There are persistent and reliable reports that officials, particularly army personnel posted in outlying areas, are involved in the drug business," confirms the March 1998 US government narcotics report. "Army personnel wield considerable political clout locally, and their involvement in trafficking is a significant problem."</h4>
              <h4>Intelligence sources, working for ethnic leaders combating both the drug trade and the military dictatorship, report that the pattern of government involvement extends all the way to the top. The central government in Rangoon demands funds on a regular basis from regional commanders who, in turn, expect payoffs from the rank and file.</h4>
              <h4>The soldiers get the money any way they can-through smuggling, gambling or selling jade-with drugs being the most accessible source of revenue in Shan State. The officers in the field also "tax" refineries, drug transporters, and opium farmers.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>At great risk, the intelligence sources- who go undercover to infiltrate troops in the field-collect painstakingly detailed data including names, dates and places, such as these delivered in March 1998 from Shan State: "On 10th Jan. 98, SPDC army no. 65 stationed at Mong Ton sent 40 troops to Nam Hkek village. Pon Pa Khem village tract, collected 0.16 kilo of opium per household or [collected payment of] Baht 600.</h4>
              <h4>Then the troops sold the collected opium to the drug business men at the rate of Baht 6000 for 1.6 kilos." Another report states: "Troops from SPDC Battalion nos. 277 &amp; 65 stationed at Mong Ton are still protecting heroin refineries situated at Hkai ion, Pay lon &amp; Ho Ya areas, Mong Ton township. Those who can pay B.200,00 per month are allowed to run the heroin refineries." And: "On 3rd of Jan. 98, Burma Army no.99 collected opium tax in Lashio township.</h4>
              <h4>They charged 0.32 kilo per household. They arrested and beat seriously those who failed to give.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>These sources also report that Ko Tat, Pnvate 90900 from SPDC battalion no.525 stationed in Lin Kay, recently defected from the Burmese army and said that his company had been giving protection to the opium fields around Ho Mong. While the lower ranked officers struggle to meet their quotas in the field, the highest levels of the government in the capital city strike deals with Burma's two top traffickers, one of whom is the prosperous partner of Singapore.</h4>

              <h4>Lo Hsing Han: At Home in Singapore</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>With massive financial ties to Singapore, Lo Hsing Han is now one of Burma's top investors. He, along with Khun Sa, the former "king of opium," is a major player in the Burmese economy.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>In the early l990s, Lo Hsing Han controlled the most heavily armed drug trafficking organization in Southeast Asia. He was arrested in 1973 and sentenced to death, but was freed under a general amnesty in 1980.</h4>
              <h4>Now, like Khun Sa, he wears the public persona of a successful businessman in Rangoon-where no one does business without close government cooperation. Although he still oversees rural drug operations with the status of a godfather, according to US narcotics officials, the notorious Lo currently serves as an adviser on ethnic affairs to Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the military intelligence chief and the junta's powerful "Secretary 1.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Lo Hsing Han is the chair of Burma's biggest conglomerate, Asia World, founded in 1992. His son, Steven Law, is managing director and also runs three companies in Singapore which are "overseas branches" of Asia World.</h4>
              <h4>Although Singapore is proud of its mandatory death penalty for smalltime narcotics smugglers and heroin addicts, both father and son travel freely in and out of the friendly island-nation. "The family money is offshore," said a high-level US narcotics official. "The old man is a convicted drug trafficker, so his kid is handling the financial activities."</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>In 1996, when Law married his Singaporean business partner in a lavish, well-publicized Rangoon wedding, guests from Singapore were flown in on two chartered planes. According to a high-level US government official familiar with the situation, Law's wife Cecilia Ng operates an underground banking system, and "is a contact for people in Burma to get their drug money into Singapore, because she has a connection to the government."</h4>
              <h4>According to the official, Ng spends half her time in Rangoon, half in Singapore; when in Rangoon, she is headquartered at Asia Lite, a subsidiary of Asia World. The husband-wife team are also the sole officers and shareholders of Asia World subsidiary, Kokang Singapore Pte Ltd. Founded in Singapore in 1993 with $4.6 million, the company "engages in general trading activities in goods/products of all kinds/descriptions. "</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Singapore's ventures with Asia World include both government and private investments. Kuok Singapore Ltd., a partner with Asia World in many ventures, was Burma's largest single real estate investor as of late 1996, with over $650 million invested 20 Other Singaporean companies are mentioned in Asia Worlds company reports.</h4>
              <h4>Sinmardev, another major Singaporean project linked to Lo's company, is a $207 million industrial park and port on the outskirts of Rangoon, which broke ground in 1997. Singaporean entrepreneur Albert Hong, head of Sinmardev, described the project as the largest foreign investment in Burma outside the energy field.</h4>
              <h4>The Singaporean consortium leads the joint venture along with the Burmese junta, Lo's Asia World, and a slew of international shareholders</h4>
              <h4>Kuok Singapore Ltd., Lo Hsing Han's Asia World, and the Burmese junta are also partners in the luxury Traders Hotel.</h4>
              <h4>The hotel's November 1996 opening ceremony was attended by the Singapore ambassador, the president of Kuok Singapore, and briefly by Lo Hsing Han himself. The presiding Burmese minister publicly thanked Steven Law and the government of Singapore "without whose support and encouragement there would be very few Singaporean businessmen in our country."</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>While government and business connections in Burma and Singapore have boosted Asia World's prospects, other factors have contributed to the company's extraordinary growth. In the last six years, Asia World has expanded from a modest trading company to become Burma's largest and fastest-growing private sector enterprise with interests in trading, manufacturing, property, industrial investment, development, construction, transportation, import and distribution, and infrastructure.</h4>
              <h4>"How is it that a company that has a humble beginning trading beans and pulses is suddenly involved in $200 million projects?" said a US government official, requesting anonymity "Where did all that start-up capital come from?"</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>The US government ventured a guess in 1996: It denied Asia World's CEO Steven Law a visa to the US "on suspicion of drug trafficking." Asia Worlds operations now include a deep-water port in Rangoon, the Leo Express bus line into Northern Burma, and a $33 million toll highway from the heart of Burma's poppy-growing region to the China border 24 On December 20, the conglomerate opened a wharf with freight handling, storage, and a customs yard for ships carrying up to 15,000 tons 25 "If you're in the dope business, these are the types of things that you've got to have to be able to move your product," said a high-level US narcotics official. "They have set up institutions to facilitate the movement of drugs. And in all probability, they are using laundered drug proceeds, or funds generated from investments of drug trafficking proceeds, to build this infrastructure," he added.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>The activities of Lo's company Asia World have triggered an international narcotics investigation led by Washington. US investigators allege that Asia World's relationship to Singapore paves the way for the narcotics trade to be woven into all legitimate investments between the two countries.</h4>
              <h4>"Singapore's investments in Burma are opening doors for the drug traffickers, giving them access to banks and financial systems," said one government official familiar with the situation.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>One Stop Shopping: Intelligence to Repression</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>The Burmese junta's control of its impoverished population through crude methods such as torture, forced labor, and mass killings leaves it open to international condemnation. In contrast, Singapore takes a more sophisticated approach to repression, both at home and abroad.</h4>
              <h4>While the island-nations citizens have material benefits and the appearance of rule of law, they live in fear of an Orwellian government that closely monitors every aspect of their lives. The ruling party often sues those who dare to oppose it on trumped up defamation charges, forcing many into bankruptcy or exile.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>The FBI is investigating complaints by US citizens of harassment by Singapore's Internal Security Department (ISD). One California academic, a widely respected specialist on Southeast Asian affairs who asked not to be identified, said ISD agents broke into his home because he was working to bring leading Singaporean opposition figure Tang Liang Hong to an American university The operatives tore out his door handle to get in, then searched his computer and desk.</h4>
              <h4>A week later, an Asian man, waiting in a tree, photographed and videotaped the academic while he walked in the park. After temporarily blinding the academic with his bright flash, the man jumped from the tree and made a getaway in his car. Tang -who is facing a $4.5 million defamation lawsuit by Singaporean senior ministers-was not surprised by the burglary. "I've been followed everywhere, whether I was in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Australia or in London," he said in a phone interview from Australia.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Singapore has been more than willing to share its expertise in intelligence with its Burmese counterparts. The Singapore-Myanmar Ministerial-Level Work Committee was set up in 1993 in Rangoon to "forge mutual benefits in investment, trade and economic sectors." The committee includes intelligence chief Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, other top Burmese ministers, and high level Singapore an officials. At the December 23 meeting, Khin Nyunt urged his ministers to give priority to projects arranged by the Singaporean government. "Pilot projects are being implemented to transfer know-how to Myanmar," said Khin Nyunt in his address.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>One such project is a state-of-the-art cyber-war center in Rangoon. Burma's military leaders can now intercept a range of incoming communications-including telephone calls, faxes, e-mails and computer data transmissions-from 20 other countries.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>The high-tech cyber-war center was built by Singapore Technologies, the city-state's largest industrial and technology conglomerate, comprising more than 100 companies. This government-owned company also provides on-site training at Burma's Defense Ministry complex, and reportedly passes on its "sophisticated capability" to hundreds of Burmese "secret police" at an institution inside Singapore.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Burma has no external enemies, but the ruling junta goes to extremes to terrorize the population through its elaborate intelligence network. Intelligence officials have already used their newly-acquired talents from the cyber-war center to arrest pro-democracy activists, and it is well known that Burma's feared military intelligence often tortures its victims during lengthy interrogations.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Singaporean companies have also helped suppress dissent in Burma by supplying the military with arms to use against its own I people. The first shipment of guns | and ammunition was delivered on October 6, 1988.35 Throughout that month, hundreds of boxes of mortars, ammunition, and other supplies marked "Allied Ordnance, Singapore" were unloaded from vessels in Rangoon.</h4>
              <h4>Allied I Ordnance is a subsidiary of Chartered Industries of Singapore, the arms branch of Singapore Technologies-the same govemment-owned company which built the cyber-war center. The shipments also included rockets made by Chartered Industries of Singapore under license from a Swedish company and sold in violation of an agreement with Sweden require authorization for re-exports.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>These shipments from Singapore arrived only weeks after the September 1988 military takeover in Rangoon, in which the new leaders of the SLORC massacred hundreds of peaceful, pro-democracy demonstrators in the streets. These killings followed another wave of government massacres earlier that summer, when longtime dictator Ne Win struggled to keep power in the face of nationwide strikes and demonstrations for democracy He eventually stepped down but, operating behind the scenes, installed the puppet SLORC. As the killings continued, thousands of civilians fled the country fearing for their lives.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>When numerous countries responded by suspending aid and Burma's traditional suppliers cut shipments, the SLORC became desperate. Singapore was the first country to come to its rescue.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Singapore companies have continued to supply Burma's military, sometimes acting as middlemen for arms from other countries. In 1989, Israel and Belgium delivered grenade launchers and anti-tank guns via Singapore. In 1992, Singapore violated the European Commission arms embargo against the Burmese regime by acting as a broker and arranging for a $1.5 million shipment of mortars from Portugal.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>"It is highly unlikely that any of these shipments to Burma could have been made without the knowledge and support of the Singapore Government," wrote William Ashton in Jane's Intelligence Review. "By assisting with weapons sales, defense technology transfers, military training and intelligence cooperation, Singapore has been able to win a sympathetic hearing at the very heart of Burma's official councils."</h4>
              <h4>Singapore's Stakes</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Last November, Singapore deployed its diplomatic arsenal to defend Rangoon at the UN. Singaporean UN representatives made an effort to water down the General Assembly resolution which castigated the Burmese government for its harsh treatment of pro-democracy activists, widespread human rights violations, and nullification of free and fair elections that had voted it out of power.</h4>
              <h4> In an "urgent" letter to the Swedish mission, which was drafting the resolution, Singapore representative Bilahan Kausikan cited "progress" in Burma and said that "the majority of your co-sponsors have little or no substantive interests in Myanmar.... Our position is different. We have concrete and immediate stakes."</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Objecting to parts of the resolution and attempting to soften the language, Singapore's representative circulated the letter to key members of the UN's Third Committee on Human Rights. "The driving force was definitely business connections," according to Dr. Thaung Htun, Representative for UN Affairs of Burma's government-in-exile. "Singapore is defending its investments at the diplomatic level, using its efforts at the UN level to promote its business interests."</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>The protection of Singapore's "concrete and immediate stakes" is essential to the ruling party s success in maintaining power and the basis of its support for Burma, said Case Western Reserve University economist Christopher Lingle. "Singapore depends heavily upon its symbiotic relationship with crony capitalists and upon accommodating a high enough rate of return to keep the citizenry in line.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Therefore its very survival is tied up with business and government investments., William Ashton, writing in Jane's Intelligence Review, suggested an additional incentive for Singapore's alliance with Burma. As Rangoon's major regional backer and strategic ally, China has provided much of the weaponry, training, and financial assistance for the junta. China's expanding commercial and strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region, coupled with its alliance with neighboring Burma, is a source of great concern in Singapore. The desire to keep Burma from becoming Beijing's stalking horse in the region may provide another motivation for Singapore's wooing of Rangoon.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Turning a Blind Eye</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>The Singapore government has consistently disregarded the gross human rights violations perpetrated by its allies in Burma. The UN Special Rapporteur, appointed to report to the United Nations on the situation in Burma, has been barred entry into Burma since 1995.44 The new US State Department Country Report on Burma for 1997 states that its "longstanding severe repression of human rights continued during the year.</h4>
              <h4>Citizens continued to live subject at any time and without appeal to the arbitrary and sometimes brutal dictates of the military dictatorship." Amnesty International reports that there are well over 1,200 political prisoners languishing in Burmese dungeons, where torture is commonplace.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Singapore has issued no urgent letters about a recent report by Danish Doctors for Human Rights which noted that "sixty-six percent of the over 120,000] refugees from Burma now living in Thailand have been tortured" and subjected to "forced labor, deportation, pillaging, destruction of villages, and various forms of torture and rape." The doctors reported that refugees witnessed the junta's military forces murder members of their families.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Singaporean leaders also seem unconcerned about the fact that the Burmese government shut down almost all of Burma's colleges and universities following student protests in December 1996 and imprisoned hundreds of students. At a February ceremony of the Singapore Association in Myanmar, the Ambassador to Singapore presented a large check to Gen. Khin Nyunt-who is also Chairman of the government Education Committee-for the "Myanmar education development fund." While depriving young Burmese of higher education, the junta's "Secretary 1" Khin Nyunt responded that "Uplifting the educational standards of our people is one of the social objectives of our Government." He then went on at length to extol the "firm foundation of growing economic and trade ties" between Singapore and Burma.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>The Burmese government has also kept computers and communication technology away from students and others in opposition to the regime. All computers, software, e-mail services and other telecommunication devices-which hardly anyone can afford anyway-must be licensed, but licenses are almost impossible to obtain. Yet Singapore has made the best computer technology available to the ruling elite and their business partners.</h4>
              <h4>Singapore Telecom, the largest company in Asia outside of Japan, was the first to provide Burmese businesses and government offices with the ability to set up inter- and intra-corporate communications in more than 90 countries.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Complementary Relations Singapore's concerns are dramatically different from those of countries sharing a border with Burma. Thailand has to deal with the deadly narcotics trade and an overwhelming number of refugees arriving on a daily basis. Banphot Piamdi, the Thai counter-narcotics official, believes Thailand made a big mistake when it voted for Burma's entry into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), given Burma's lack of cooperation in fighting drugs. Not surprisingly, the Singapore government lobbied hard for Burma's 1997 acceptance into the powerful regional trade alliance.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Ironically, Burma's inclusion in ASEAN may force member nations, including Singapore, to address the havoc that their newest ally is imposing on the region- especially since Burma provides approximately 90 percent of the total production of Southeast Asian opium. China and India, Burma's other neighbors, now face severe AIDS epidemics related to increased heroin use in their bordering provinces. Most of the heroin exported from Burma to the West passes through China's Yunnan province, which now has more than half a million addicts. And even Singapore-whose heroin supply comes mostly from Burma-had a 41 percent rise in HIV cases in 1997.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>As we head into the "Asian century," Singapore has become Washington's forward partner in the unfolding era of East-West trade. Ambassador Green called the country "a major entry port and a natural gateway to Asia for American firms." US companies exported $16 billion worth of goods to Singapore in 1996 and more than 1,300 US firms now operate in the country Singapore's strategic and economic importance to the US cannot be overstated. The two nations just reached an agreement allowing the US Navy to use a Singapore base even though the deal violates ASEAN's 1997 nuclear weapons-free zone agreement.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>The US has condemned the Burmese junta's record of human rights abuses and support for the drug trade, but has turned a blind eye when it comes to Singapore's dealings with the regime. Although President Clinton imposed economic sanctions on Burma partly for its role in providing pure and cheap heroin to America's youth, he has not commented on Singapore's willingness to play ball with the world's biggest heroin traffickers.</h4>
              <h4>Ambassador Green told Congress last year that the US "has an important role in working with the Singapore government to deal with illegal drug and weapons proliferation issues," but most US officials have remained silent about Singapore's investments with Lo Hsing Han and Burma's narco-dictatorship. It's unlikely Clinton made any mention of this issue last fall while golfing with Singapore an Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong during the APEC summit in Vancouver.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Unless the financial crisis in Asia limits profits, Singapore will probably continue to expand its investments in Burma. "Our two economies are complementary and although we can derive satisfaction from the progress made, I believe that there still remains a great potential that is yet to be exploited," said the junta's Gen. Khin Nyunt last February, Aided by Singapore's support, Burma's thriving heroin trade has plagued the majority of countries around the globe. While these countries blithely pour money into drug-connected companies based in Burma and thereby help them to expand into foreign markets, an abundance of the world's finest heroin continues to plague their citizens. At the same time, the line between legitimate and illegitimate investments grows dimmer in the global economy.</h4>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><em>Population</em><br>The exodus continues<br>Foreigners more than make up for increasing local outflow; unfortunately it doesn’t help consolidate nationhood. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Feb 24, 2008</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">YEARS of strong economic growth have failed to stem Singapore’s skilled youths from leaving for a better life abroad, with the number topping 1,000 a year. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This works out to 4%-5%, or three in 10, of the highly educated population, a severe brain drain for a small, young nation, according to Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Such high-end emigration is usually associated with less better-off countries where living conditions are poor. Here the opposite is the case. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Last year the economy created almost 200,000 jobs, far in excess of the 38,000 births recorded. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The future doesn’t look better, either, despite Lee holding out promises of “a golden period” in the next five to 10 years. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lee believes the exodus, which has been worrying him for two decades, could only grow because “every year, there are more people going abroad for their first or second degree.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The emigration rate, one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis, is a blow to the government, particularly to Lee, who takes pride in building up this once poor squatter colony into a glittering global city. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">They are people who abandoned their citizenship for a foreign one, mostly in Australia, the United States and Canada. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It is particularly serious for two reasons. First, Singapore is a young nation that is working hard to consolidate its nationhood and its people, and second, its defence lies in a reservist army. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This is made up of young men who have served two years of compulsory military training when they reach the age of 18. Any big outflow will badly affect security, not to mention the economy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Adding to a declining birth rate, the problem of emigration, which appears to have worsened during the past few decades as people became better educated, will further reduce the base of this well-trained people’s army. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Hundreds of thousands of foreigners and permanent residents who have come to Singapore help make up the numbers, but they do not have to serve national service. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The emigrants, mostly professionals, don’t leave Singapore out of poverty but to seek a better, less pressurised life. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lee recently said the brain drain is touching close to this family. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lee’s grandson, the elder son of Prime Minister Hsien Loong, who is studying in the United States, has indicated that he may not return. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Over the years, the children of several Cabinet ministers have also made Britain or the US their home. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lee, aged 84, has often spoken on the issue with emotions, once tearing when referring to the losses. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">However, he has offered no reasons for the exodus beyond economic opportunities, although the government more or less knows what they are. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Singaporeans who have or are planning to emigrate are given a host of 10 questions and asked to tick the three most important ones. They include the following: - </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&gt; High costs of living </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&gt; Singapore is too regulated and stifling </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&gt; Better career and prospects overseas </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&gt; Prefer a more relaxed lifestyle </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&gt; Uncertain future of Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Some liberal Singaporeans believe Lee himself, with his authoritarian leadership and unpopular policies, is largely to blame. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Singapore’s best-known writer Catherine Lim calls it a climate of fear that stops citizens from speaking out against the government, saying it could eventually lead to the decline of the state. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">She praised the government for its economic achievements but added: “A compliant, fearful population that has never learnt to be politically savvy could spell the doom of Singapore.” Globalisation, which offers opportunities in many countries like never before, is a big reason for the outflow. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Many countries, including populous China, are making a special effort to attract foreign talent. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Others who leave were worried about the future of their children living in a small island, and look for security and comfort of a larger country. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The exodus is more than made up – at least in numbers – by a larger intake of professionals from China and India. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“The trouble is many of the Chinese then use us as a stepping stone to go to America, where the grass is greener, Lee said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“But even if we only keep 30%-40% and lose 60%-70%, we’re a net gainer,” he added. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">He believed, however, that the Chinese would cease to come in 20 to 30 years’ time, when China’s living standards rise to match Singapore’s. </span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Brain Drain</span></strong></p>
              <p>by Kenneth Lyen</p>
              <p>In the past few years, a number of my friends have emigrated from Singapore. Many of them are young gifted individuals on the upward swing of their careers. They have difficulties getting attractive jobs here, and they are aware of the exodus of manufacturing and consultation jobs out of Singapore. In addition my friends had become increasingly uncomfortable with the stifling nature of our bureaucracy, which prompted them to seek greener pastures overseas.</p>
              <p>Ngiam Tong Dow wrote in the Straits Times of 14 August 2004 that SingaporeÂ’s future economic survival depends on the number of talented and creative individuals that we can cultivate and retain. Competition is now global, and we need to create new products and innovate old ones regularly. We are competing with the brightest and most creative brains in the world.</p>
              <p>Each year we send large numbers of students overseas for study and research. Not all will return to Singapore, and we are suffering from a small but significant brain drain. Those who do return, will only remain for a while, and ultimately they will emigrate.</p>
              <p>Top companies worldwide recognise the importance of talent, and they scour the world in search of gifted people, whom they will grab. How do we reduce the number of our brightest individuals being drawn overseas?</p>
              <p>Ngiam suggested that one of the reasons why our talent leave is that they do not have enough creative space. Expanding this space can be achieved by giving greater freedom of expression, developing greater tolerance of divergent views and pushing out-of-bound markers. He also suggested that we make an emotional appeal to these people to return to Singapore, although he does not say how.</p>
              <p>However he misses out on a couple of important points. Why do our young talent forsake Singapore? Yes, some find our academic and intellectual climate and our excessive government regulation, quite suffocating. Yes, we do not treat our own citizens as well as we treat our overseas visitors, and indeed we tend to look down on our own and do not accord them the recognition they deserve.</p>
              <p>But there are a few other important factors that push our people away. First is the difficulty in getting financing for new businesses. Our financiers and venture capitalists tend to be very conservative, and do not like to take risks. They tend to underfund projects, so that there is no chance for them to succeed. Indeed, it is relatively easier to find funding overseas.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the high cost of living in Singapore has become a handicap in doing business. We are the 46th most expensive city to live in, according to Mercer Human Resource ConsultingÂ’s report for 2004. Our businesses are no longer competitive.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, we have a highly rigid atherosclerotic educational system. A significant number of emigrants cite this as the main reason why they are leaving. Their children are not coping with the excessively competitive and uncreative educational system. We may win international competitions that test convergent thinking, but we would most surely lose out on divergent thinking competitions if they were to exist.</p>
              <p>And the last straw that pushes our creative people away is that we have a quiet, skeletal arts scene that has inadequate government and public support.</p>
              <p>They have noted that Singapore agencies likes to "throw" money at overseas companies. For example, the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board is giving $10 million to lure overseas film companies to make part of their film in Singapore. The Singapore Film Commission gives 50% of film production costs to overseas companies on joint ventures, which in reality fail to afford any real benefits to Singapore filmmakers. Such behaviour sends the wrong message to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Unless we redress these and other complaints, and take effective remedial action, we will continue to lose our best and brightest minds.</p>
              <p>The former prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, accused such people as being "quitters". Well, instead of regarding this as a shameful label, the emigrants pride themselves in being "quitters". They send me photographs of their children enjoying the benefits of a more imaginative educational system overseas, and they tell me about the more self-fulfilling lifestyle they live.</p>

              <p>CUT the length of scholarship bonds to three years and grant tax rebates for the overseas university fees paid by parents whose children return to Singapore after studying abroad.</p>
              <p>These measures were suggested by Nominated MP Loo Choon Yong to help tackle Singapore's brain drain.</p>
              <p>He noted that many talented young Singaporeans are leaving the country annually to study overseas and feared they 'may be lost to Singapore permanently' if they settle overseas after studying there.</p>
              <p>
              
              'We are losing some 1,000 bright people annually to other countries,' he said. Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew provided the same statistic in an interview with United Press International earlier this month.</p>
              <p>Dr Loo said he supported the notion that scholarship students must return to serve Singapore after they study overseas. But he urged the Government to cut bond periods to three years and allow them the option of serving also in the private sector, not just with the Government.</p>
              <p>In this way, scholars who choose to work in the civil service would do so willingly. They would be attracted by the excellent compensation and improved work environment in government agencies, as well as the pride of serving Singapore, he said.</p>
              <p>The scholarships must 'not be an instrument for converting free Singaporeans to indentured serfs,' he said.</p>
              <p>In the light of the current shortage of places at local universities, Dr Loo also urged the finance minister to consider giving tax rebates to parents whose children study at approved overseas universities and return here to work.</p>
              <p>These tax rebates can be the same size as the subsidy given for the child if he had attended a local university.</p>
              <p>This can help to grow the pool of graduates in Singapore and give more Singaporeans a chance at tertiary education, said Dr Loo.</p>
              <p>'If we lose our young, we will have nothing,' he said.</p>
