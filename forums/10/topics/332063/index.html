              <p>The Singapore I live in now is so different from the Singapore I
              grew up in. I received my primary education at a neighborhood school in
              Toa Payoh, right in the middle of the HDB heartland.</p>
              <p>I had fond memories of the time I spent playing hip-hop, “tor ka”
              (one-legged catch up), “gor li” (marble), ti-kam and catching frogs and
              spiders with my friends from all races. There were few foreigners then
              and life is so much simpler.</p>
              <p>Now, I see mainland Chinese and Indians almost everywhere speaking
              in their native tongues with an unmistakable foreign accent. My company
              just employed two Chinese IT engineers. My boss likes them - they are
              “cheap”, good, doesn’t complain as much as Singaporeans and more
              importantly, they do not need to serve reservist !</p>
              <p>I can understand the need for us to import more foreigners in to
              keep Singapore competitive, but not at the expense of citizens who are
              born and bred here. It is true that we are a land of immigrants.
              However, we are the descendents of immigrants who have made Singapore
              our home compared to those foreigners who just come here and make a
              living.</p>
              <p>During the last economic downturn, a few of my seniors were
              retrenched with little or no compensation. Their places were replaced
              by foreigners. I shudder at the thought whether I will end up like them
              in the future. Why not ? After all, it does make economic sense for the
              company to recruit a foreign Masters graduate with less pay than a
              local one. How am I going to start afresh at the age of 40 ? Who is
              going to employ me ? Can I support my family ?</p>
              <p>There is a new security guard in my office building in his mid-50s.
              He used to be a Warrant Officer in the SAF. Asked why he has taken up
              this job, he readily admits given a choice, he rather retire and look
              after his grandchildren, but at his age, he still have to earn a living
              to support himself as his children are all tied up with their own
              families.</p>
              <p>“The government wants us to work till the age of 85 and now wants us
              to buy what ‘death insurance’ (annuity) ! Who will know when we will
              kick the bucket !” he laments. When will I ever see my CPF monies ? Do
              I have to wait till I am 85,  frail, sick and dying before I can
              “enjoy” the fruits of my years of hard labor?</p>
              <p>My eldest boy is 3 years old currently under the care of my parents.
              I am still pondering whether to send him to a special school for
              pre-schoolers where they are given “special” education to give them a
              headstart to life.</p>
              <p> My neighbour’s child is in such a school. During the weekend, she
              has to attend “special” arithmetic, piano and ballet classes. A few
              weeks ago, there is a furore in the papers over the number of
              Singaporeans who have to pursue their tertiary education overseas
              because they are not “good” enough for local universities. At a
              cousin’s convocation at NTU 2 months ago, almost half the cohort of
              graduates are foreigners.</p>
              <p>Do I really want to send my children to a tough, rigorous and in a
              way merciless education system where they will be under tremendous
              stress to perform and excel ? What if they are unable to pursue their
              interests in life here or their grades are not good enough to qualify
              for a local university ? Do I have the means to send them overseas for
              their tertiary education ?</p>
              <p>My wife has been persuading me to emigrate to Australia. Her parents
              are living in Melbourne and apparently according to her, are enjoying
              the best years of their lives there. “They don’t have to work at all,
              healthcare is free and the state government even pays them a monthly
              stipend ! Now every weekend, they just travel around in the
              countryside, you know Australia is so huge !”, she will whisper
              repeatedly like a tape recorder into my ears every night before we
              sleep. “But the aussie taxes are high too !” I retort. “Yeah, but that
              is the price to pay for security, my dear, security for the future. And
              the kids, their education is completely free too, we do not have to
              worry about anything !”</p>
              <p>Is the grass really greener on the other side ? I keep asking
              myself. Life is not too bad for me now. To the Malaysians, Singapore is
              like a paradise. Why should I forsake my land of birth which has
              nurtured me all these years ?</p>
              <p>Though I have occasional grouses against the government, I must
              admit that the PAP is a good government which truly take care of its
              people and have the foresight to plan far ahead into the future when
              politicians in a neighboring country are still squabbling over who to
              become the Prime Minister. We Singaporeans do not realize how fortunate
              we are to have everything running so smoothly in the country.</p>
              <p>While I do not doubt the capability of the government, I have little
              affliation or feelings for them. I cannot claim I support or love them.
              The only time I hear about our leaders is from the media when they will
              exhort Singaporeans to do this or that.  </p>
              <p>I have never voted in my entire life. I do not know which
              constituency I am in. I can’t even recognize my MPs if I were to meet
              them down the street. Yet I was told again and again during every
              election that I gave them the “mandate” to govern my life when I was
              never given a choice to choose ! Can anybody tell me what is being
              debated now in Parliament ? Does it matter at all ? Are my opinions
              ever sought out by the lawmakers ?</p>
              <p>There was a <a href="http://www.littlespeck.com/content/people/CTrendsPeople-080906.htm">report</a> lately that Singapore has the 2nd highest migration rate (26 per
              1,000) in the world after Timor Leste (51 per 1,000). The government
              doesn’t seem to understand why Singaporeans are leaving in droves. From
              their speeches, it is obvious they have lost touch completely with the
              ordinary people on the ground.</p>
              <p>When they keep urging Singaporeans to continue working for as long
              as they can, they fail to realize that a majority of us just want to
              retire and enjoy life in our golden years. They harp on how far
              Singapore has progressed in terms of facts and figures to convince us
              that Singapore is the place to be - we have the 2nd highest GDP in Asia
              after Japan, the most business-friendly country, the best judiciary
              after Hong Kong etc, but these mean little to me and far less to those
              old folks you encounter picking card boards and cans from the rubbish
              heap for a living.</p>
              <p>The government cannot blame Singaporeans for being self-centred,
              unpatriotic and selfish. Human nature is such that we always want the
              best for ourselves and our familes. Though we live for the 5Cs, we are
              in fact suckers for 3 simple Ss - serenity, stability and security. A
              future with little security is a major push factor for many
              Singaporeans. To those ministers, MPs and top civil servants who are
              earning an astronomical five to six-figure monthly salary and
              guaranteed a pension for life upon retirement, it may be too much to
              ask of them to understand what “security” means for a Singaporean
              bringing home only a few thousand dollars at the end of the month.</p>
              <p>During my NS days, I was a guards officer. I still feel proud of my
              guards tag on my No 4 when I go for my reservist training. However, I
              do not feel my contributions to the nation all these years are
              recognized at the place where I work. My boss treasures the PRC
              engineers more because in a way, they are “better qualified” than the
              locals. After all, Singapore is a meritocracy, it doesn’t matter
              whether you are a citizen or not, the system rewards those who perform
              best though these high-flyers may only be making use of Singapore as a
              transit point to greener pastures.</p>
              <p>A PRC colleague of mine has got a job in Perth. He just received
              Singaporean his citizenship last year and now he is making preparations
              to relocate his entire family to Australia. We got along together quite
              well. Unlike other foreigners who keep to their own cliques, he mingles
              around with the locals and appears to be well integrated into our
              society. Why does he want to leave Singapore after barely settling down
              here ? “Well, the truth is, Singapore is only a spring board for me. I
              never want to live here. It’s not too bad a place, but it is too small
              for me.” he volunteers readily when asked. “Why not you come over to
              Australia too ? The grass is definitely greener over there.”</p>
              <p>Tell me, is this really true ?</p>

              <p>Whether the grass is greener or browner on the other side is very subjective, it's up for the individual to decide based on the merits of both countries, I seriously anyone could provide an unbias judgement.

              <p>What the PAP cadres are trying to do here is damage control, trying to dissuade potential emigrants from making the move. If you truly want a fair representation, then maybe they should release statistics for those who immigrated and those who returned because they thought they made a mistake about the pastures over on the other side, like out of the 100% that emigrated, how many actually returned back to be Singaporeans. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>What makes the grass greener on the other side ?</p>
              <p>How does one measure this ?</p>
              <p>Should we determine the "Value for money" aspect - as a form of measure ?</p>
              <p>How much can you stretch the money that you earn each month to fulfill "all that you hoped or dream for" ?</p>
              <p>There will always be a list of issues that irks the individuals, some are irritating, while some can be more troublesome, and others even burning.</p>
              <p>Why not create a list of issues and find out how many issues are in each categorized weighted list of "burning", "troublesome" and "irritating" ?</p>
              <p>As far as I can see, with the changes in the social contract that this PAP Government has created following the 2002 Economic Downturn, where Singaporeans are now encouraged to accept "Short Term Employment Contract" - that provide employers to hire and fire at time of economic recessions - Singaporeans are no longer in any position to plan long term.</p>
              <p>Housing will become the most burning issue in this new socio-economic arrangement that the PAP Government has created.</p>
              <p>Can home ownership continue in the old ways, where 20 + 20 per cent of a worker's wage is locked up in the CPF ? </p>
              <p>During economic downturn - with no social welfare and the CPF locked - the worker is expected to survive on his own ingenuity even as the short-term renewable contract give the employer the trump card in some fixed retrenchment pay-out.</p>
              <p>Under such new arrangement, long term planning to fund the home-ownership, the continuing education of one-self and the children becomes a more challenging task, and add new stress to one's life.</p>
              <p>Added to these problems will be the Cost-of-Living issues - in which the growth rate of our wages are fixed by the NWC and not by "free market" mechanism, while the necessities that we need are subject to the whims of "supply and demand" influences that no mechanism can control.</p>
              <p>The list can continue in any way according to our individual priorities, and compare with our individual perception of what has been researched from the other side of the Fence, it is left to our own value judgment to determine if the otherside is greener.</p>
              <p>If the "Political Issues" on both sides of the Fence are pushed aside, and our vision focused on the immediate issues of the three listed above, one can see that the Grass can be greener on the other side.</p>
              <p>Having established this fact, one has to look at other issues that include "Security - public and personal", "Opportunities for oneself or one's family" to progress or to regress, and of course the very subjective "Quality of Life" compare to the present experience.</p>
              <p>The "Quality of Life" is based on a very subjective value system tied to one's preferences and idiosyncracies that no one can describe or even criticise.</p>
              <p>Amongst individuals, there maybe some points that will co-incide in appearing on the same list, but will probably hold different prioritised positions in the list.</p>
              <p>All in all, when push come to shove, and there are no longer familiar ties to hold one down, and the magnetic pull is stronger from the other side - when one has to go, one will go.</p>

              <p>Lions being a fast breeder will surely pose a danger to all existing warm blooded animals, and obviously had to be prevented by all means from being accepted into Ozland.</p>
              <p>Can the kangaroo exist to compete with the Lions ?</p>
              <p>One has to go, and since Ozland has never been a natural habitat for lions, it is easy to bar it from entering - as it pose a danger not only to all warm blooded animals but to Humans living and trekking freely in the open range.</p>

              <p>Yes.</p>
              <p>They pay you 2.5% to 4% (medisave which you can never withdraw and they always increase the medical cost), after they get total shareholder returns of 20% from Temasek.</p>
              <p>Why not pay CPF members what Temasek is earning? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The profits from Temasek comes from overcharging, like Singapore Power, the Telcos, "Public" Transport and Cable TV. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Have they considered the feeling of non--Christian?</p>
              <p>What do they write in the Oz Constitution?</p>

              <p>But the Greens <span style="color: #ff0000;">want the prayer replaced with a period of reflection and a conscience vote in both houses on the issue.</span></p>
              <p>Speaker of the House of Representatives, Harry Jenkins, has called
              for a public debate about whether the daily prayer should be rewritten
              or replaced.</p>
              <p>He said the prayer was the most controversial aspect of
              parliamentary procedure and had been raised with him by MPs and members
              of the public.</p>
              <p>His call has been met with protests from the Australian Christian
              Lobby and expressions of support for the prayer from Prime Minister
              Kevin Rudd and Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull.</p>
              <p>A spokeswoman for Mr Rudd said the Prime minister viewed the prayer as an important tradition that should not be broken.</p>
              <p>"The Lord's Prayer is a long-standing tradition of the Australian
              Parliament and the Prime Minister believes it should continue," she
              said.</p>
              <p>Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull and Nationals leader Warren Truss
              issued a joint statement, saying th<span style="color: #ff0000;">e removal of the prayer would be
              unacceptable.</span></p>

              <p>Who are you to make apologies for the SG Government, who had created the crisis situation that Singaporeans are experiencing today ?</p>
              <p>SG Government poor ?</p>
              <p>Surely you must be stupid to attempt to rub salt into the sores created by the "Million Dollar" Ministers - who will ensure that Singapore Wages is controlled even as the Cost of Living has exceeded the wage increases by 1.5 times ?</p>
              <p>Either you are dumb to believe that the benefits paid annually into our CPF is a sign of generosity, or you are blind to the fact that the PAP Government is embarrassed by the huge Annual Budget SURPLUS that they have collected through the various tax and revenue collecting mechanism - so much so that they have to pacify the struggling population by returning it to our CPF, which is used again by the Government as cheap loan, or sucked back by the high medical charges.</p>
              <p>It is too embarrassing for the PAP Government to cut off the electrical and water supply to the poor, who can hardly keep up to pay rent for their one-room HDB slum, and the MILLION DOLLAR Ministers will pat each others back for the many new ways to design obscure schemes to help the poor that will require the poor to know where to get the help and also to respond to get the help needed.</p>
              <p>With the poor out of social circulation and not able to afford a newspaper, can they be expected to know of such help ?</p>
              <p>Financial help left un-used will only benefit the Sg Gov, who will boast of even bigger surplusses that justify their higher wage increases.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, more schemes are designed to suck more money from Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Has your lioness stop hunting the food that you need, or has she also gone on strike due to your stupidity in not directing your noise in the right direction ?</p>
              <p>Be a man, and stop being a pet Lion that makes noise whether you need food or not - are you depending on the scraps from the table only ?</p>
