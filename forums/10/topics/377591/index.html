              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Below has one but not the 8K. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>If you read the following messages you would feel that HDB actually does not care about the income ceiling!</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>It is very ridiculous!</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>It looks like there will be no punishments  for those who did not report the actual income even those pple's companies have contributing CPF for that staff!</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>If HDB wishes to investigate then it can just ask them to show the CPF statements. But it looks like nothing happened.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Cite this example to enquiry if you need to appeal against the income ceiling. </strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dear Sir/Madam,</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">My friend recommended Mdm Seah Lye Poh (NRIC No:S069xxxxH) to me for paring up to rent HDB 1 Room flat. Mdm Seah said she can't get along with her currently flatmate so she is requiring HDB to let her change co-tenant at Blk 9, North Bridge Road #12-4166 S(190009).</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mdm Seah has been working in Swissotel The Stamford Singapore (morning shift since 21 years ago) and Swissotel Merchant Court Singapore(Night shift since 10 years ago) as a House Attendent, therefore her income is more than $2,000/- per month and both of the companies are contributing CPF for her.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">She also said that she was actually not qualify to rent the above unit during Nov 2005, because her income exceeded the limit set by HDB(HDB only set the limited to $1,500/- per month at that time) , but the HDB HQ staff told her don't show CPF statement even she was working and her company was contributing CPF for her because she was above 55 years old, therefore she reported that she was unemployed when she was applying to rent the above unit.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">When she was renewing the tenancy for the above unit at Nov 2007, her income was still more than $2,000/- per month, but the staff of the HDB Sims Branch suggested her to report that she and her currently flatmate total income only $800/- per month, so she did it and then continue to enjoy the heavily subsidised(the lowest rent $33/month, rebate from SP bill and Town Council) from government for more than 3 years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">May I know whether those above 55 years old citizens have to report their incomes when they are applying to rent flats or renewing tenancies? Especially those applicants who have high incomes at every month for many years until now and the company has contributed CPF for him/her!</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If the answer is Yes then why your staff told Mdm Seah to do like that?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Is below 55 years old co-tenant has to report their income when renewing tenancy?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If yes then why your branch staff suggested Mdm Seah to report that household gross income only $800/- per month even Mdm Seah's flatmate was working (income was more than $1,000/month) with CPF contribution and below 55 years old when renewing tenancy at Nov 2007.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Can you let me know the answer as soon as posible because I am worrying that if I paring up with Mdm Seah to rent the above unit but finally the board take action to against her then I would be affected!</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If your answer is NO then I would not understand why the government subsidised for this kind of high income tenant to enjoy but left those low income citizens waiting in the long queue for renting smallest flat?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thank you!</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">regards<br>Chan Sxxx pxxx</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Dear HDB,</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Your staff really suggested the tenant of the above unit to do so? Do you know about this case?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">And what will be the punishments for the staff and tenant?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">If this is a real case then I think it is very unfair to other honest applicants, if your staff really did that then I think it may be not the only case, please be fair to all of the applicants, don't wait until people complain then take action because it will make those poor people waiting for long time to rent a unit from your board.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">I look forward to your reply.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Thank you.<br></span></p>
