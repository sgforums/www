It's like as if their soldiers are expendable and he doesn't care less.... I felt that it's a very irresponsible response to the public (although I would care less) and very disregarding to safety in the army........some more say they are like kids...the soldier 24 liao leh......<br><br>Although he's a MAF troop, I still feel sorry for that chap (and any other soldier around the world) who died in vain.......tsk tsk tsk........dun MAF have TSR regulations on arms handling?<br><br>I think the commander IC in hot soup liao.........<br><br>also reminds me of a grenade range accident few years back involving a officer with stupidity factor (as a result, lost his arm)<br><br>any comments?</div>
