Fare increases and nobody fighting for Human Rights are two different things.... Price increases are business it hapens with anything you buy, inflasion will always raise the prices of goods, and services even in a country like UK which has human rights activists everywhere still has price increase, so stop right there trying to blame human rights for you 3cents fair increases.<br><br><strong> </strong><blockquote><strong>Even when HDB evicts out the wong family..who helps them??<br><br>I don't understand why organisations indirectly/directly related to the government have to make $$ from the people.<br><br>Government and the people are like how parents are to children...<br><br>Government making $$ from the people is like parents asking $$ from children..<br><br>Anyone agree?</strong></blockquote>Again Stop, its simple economics if the govenment or any buinsess does not make money then there will be major problems... If government doesnt get money country cannot spend to protect its people, build buildings maintain roads, transport etc etc.  If company doesnt earn money then it cant afford to pay workers leading to mass unemployment then leading to poverty<br><br>Your post seems to have nothing to do with human rights, rather you having to spend money.  Its simple, if the government has no money then who will fund the Army ?  The answer is nobody, your country is then defense less, if your Government has no money who maintains public transport, roads, subsidises businesses??????</div>
