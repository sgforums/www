Blogs will soon be banned for any political discussions or views in the name of so-called Election Advertising Act which has been infringed all the time by the MPs who advertised themselves outside election time at many traffic junctions.<br><br>So who are infringing election laws or who are entering the counting station and who are electioneering outside election time. Have they been charged for infringements of election advertising law if such a law can be fair in the first place.<br><br>Will leaders comply with the same laws themselves before they want to pass more laws or enforce some electioneering laws. Are they willing to uphold laws so that all citizens will abide by the Rule of Law exhortation made by ministers.<br><br>Leaders will have to show that they can and will abide the same set of laws before they can talk about closing of blogs or internet presumably for electioneering.</div>
