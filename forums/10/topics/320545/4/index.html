              <p>How accurate is the figure on STs, I really doubt.    Time and again I hear people around me saying if possible they want to migrate.   There are people with children residing overseas and are getting their parents to join them.    Some are on scholarship overseas and plan to work and stay permanently there.   Few I know of are preparing to study overseas and plan not to return to Singapore after their study.   Sad to see more leaving.  </p>
              <p>I just spoke to a PR cleaner and she says she is planning to apply for PR and  does not mind becoming a Singapore citizen and she does not know very well how the gahmen in Singapore works.    I told her about our ruling party and after that she says she rather earn $$$ and return to China and going to stay on already.    I have met many from China who told me they are not interested to make Singapore their country but just want to earn big bucks here and get lost.</p>

              <p>What I am sure of is that unlike Malaysia, if this forum and other local forums were really run by SDP, our government will have no problems finding out about it and then making the move on them as they have done before. They have the means to do so, and simply can't wait to do so if they was the case. The PAP would not need to organize a "counter-insurgency" if they were all simply SDP astroturfers, they could simply move in and charge them for slander or what have you not as they have done so many times before.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately if the users here are ordinary citizens who are speaking out not from any agenda of any organization, then it's much harder to "handle" them.</p>
              <p>Anyway the biggest PAP turnoff factor for me, and I suspect a lot of others, is not rabid anti-PAP sentiment which the more level headed can easily see through, but rather the way some PAP supporters react and respond to real issues.</p>
              <p>Now that is the real turnoff, many can ignore Dr Chee as a fringe radical, but most will not be able to take Mrs. Goh's dismissive "peanuts" comment on the NKF saga.</p>
