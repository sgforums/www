              <p>Hello hunger strikes do allow glucose water so that people don't die. It's standard and yet LKY mocks him for doing it.</p>
              <p>I mean, hunger strikes are meant to show that you are willing to experience a certain amount of pain to get something, but not to the extent that you die or experience any sort of long-lasting ill-effects to one's health.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately it is not very likely this forum is under the control of the opposition, it's more likely an indication of how much more work our government to do in engaging those who are politically aware.</p>

              <p>You have to tell that to the <strong>pro-government supporters too</strong>, not just anti-government supporters. <strong>One quoted/overestimated/overinflated the statistics all wrong to support PAP - his statistics differed TOO MUCH from MOH's official statistics. </strong>Then he goes on an insult rampage when I pointed out his mistakes.</p>
              <p>Lies against the government? Doubt that most people are lying - they are just expressing an opinion here. An opinion is neither right or wrong since it is based on their experience/perspective  unless they delve into something set , like statistics. <strong>If the government wishes to dispel all speculations, maybe they should consider more transparency and openess.</strong> That would help their case more than people assuming or guessing.</p>
              <p>Let your fellow Singaporeans have some outlet to vent their feelings/thoughts without fear of persecution .May not be right all the time but opinion is still theirs and I wouldn't call them lies.</p>
