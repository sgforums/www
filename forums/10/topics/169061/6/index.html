Hu expects it to go higher.<br><br>"China has not only become a world major export country, but also an important import market ever since it adopted the reform and opening-up policies in 1978," said Hu.<br><br>In 1978, China's imports stood at US$10.9 billion. The figure rose to US$148.47 billion in 2004, making China the world's third-largest importer after the US and Germany.<br><br>The country's imports have kept growing by a yearly 16 percent since 1978.<br><br>Hu noted that fast-expanding foreign trade is beneficial not only to China itself, but also to its trading partners.<br><br>For example, he pointed out that 70 percent of Chinese products exported to the US, Japan and the EU are labor-intensive products. Eighty percent of the products imported by China from the US, Japan and the EU are capital-, technology- and knowledge-intensive products, Hu said.<br><br>"In fact," the economist said, "nearly 300 million US consumers have benefited from the unbalanced China-US trade."<br><br>"Over the past decade, China-made products have saved US consumers hundreds of billions of US dollars," he said.<br><br>Hu said China should take measures to promote not only export growth, but also import growth in the next five years.<br><br>"A rising China will not only benefit the 1.3 billion Chinese, but also the 6.5 billion people in the world," said Hu.</div>

Bush through Congress and the Senate, there have been repeated calls for the Chinese to devalue the yuan in order to ease the current imbalance in Sino-US trade. It seems that China's undervalued currency is the sole culprit responsible for the US' gargantuan trade deficit.<br><br>The US trade deficit with China hit a record high of US$162 billion last year, a figure that constituted one-fourth of the US' total deficit for that year. It is expected to widen to US$200 billion this year.<br><br>However, export figures from China's customs authorities amount to only one-half of those of their US counterparts, which is a result of differences in how the two countries' customs authorities perceive Hong Kong. At the same time, the US$162 billion figure only includes goods, but not services and trade. The US actually has a trade surplus with China when it comes to intellectual property and other services.<br><br>Furthermore, the four Asian tigers have significantly reduced their historically huge trade surpluses with the US by switching the export of their goods to China. This has led to Hong Kong actually having a trade deficit with the US.<br><br>In other words, the US$162 billion figure represents the Greater China economic region's overall surplus with the US to a certain extent. As a result, the actual Sino-US trade gap has been exaggerated. Even if these figures were correct, balancing the US-China trade deficit would only take care of a quarter of the total, leaving it with a large chunk of the overall deficit untouched.<br><br>An even more important question is whether an appreciation of the yuan against the US dollar would really eliminate the US' trade deficit with China.<br><br><span style="color: red;">In the 1980s, prior to the rise of China, Japan was the main source of the US' trade deficit, totaling somewhere around US$40 billion.</span> Back then, Japan brought the US to its knees in the automobile, semiconductor and home appliance sectors and the slogan "Japan First" could be heard everywhere.<br><br><span style="color: red;">On Sept. 22, 1985 the US and the European Community forced Japan to sign the Plaza Accord, which held that the Japanese yen was undervalued and that this was the main cause of the US' trade deficit. Japan therefore had to remove its dollar peg and let the yen appreciate against the US dollar.</span> The language used in the accord was frighteningly similar to that now being used to force China into taking action over the yuan.<br><br>The difference is that <span style="color: red;">back then, Japan was militarily and diplomatically dependent on the US, and did not have the power to say "No."</span> After signing the Plaza Accord, the yen appreciated from ?250 to the US dollar to its current level of around ?100 to the dollar.<br><br><span style="color: red;">So how much did the US' trade deficit with Japan fall as a result of this 150 percent appreciation? The answer is that it has slowly increased to US$75 billion. Compared to 1985, the appreciation of the yen has increased the deficit by an additional 50 percent, even though the Japanese economy has been stagnant for over a decade. Still, we don't hear any one chanting the slogan "Japan First" today.</span><br><br>For the US, although its deficit problem remained unresolved, it at least accomplished its goal of eliminating the threat of Japanese economic hegemony.<br><br>Given this example, <span style="color: red;">it is not surprising that China is not willing to listen to the US. The US' purpose in pushing for an appreciation of the yuan has nothing to do with resolving its trade deficit with China, since a devaluation will not resolve the issue. What the US probably wants to resolve is the threat posed by China's rising international status.</span><br><br>There are three main reasons why China will continue to resist US pressure for another two to three years and only then accept a token appreciation.<br><br>First, China currently has more than 60 million workers in its state-owned enterprises (SOE) and more than 300 million farmers and agricultural workers. By comparison, the 100 million-strong US work force only includes about 1 million farmers. The redundant personnel in China's SOEs and the excessive number of farmers that have to be given new employment number in the hundreds of millions, and this would be a hard task for any government.<br><br>China needs rapid economic growth and expanding export markets to create employment opportunities. <span style="color: red;">If the Chinese yuan is allowed to appreciate too much, it could cause economic and export growth to slow. The enormous numbers of unemployed that would result would plant the seeds of social unrest</span> and could possibly destabilize the government.<br><br>Second, the Chinese high-tech industry is still lagging behind multinational companies in terms of quality, but its prices are very competitive. <span style="color: red;">Devaluing the yuan would harm the price advantage that China's high-tech industry currently enjoys, and this would probably kill off any hopes China has of competing internationally.</span><br><br>Third, <span style="color: red;">if the Chinese yuan were allowed to float freely, China's weak financial system would become a target for international vultures.</span> Besides, China is speeding up its financial reforms and the four biggest state-owned banks have already been listed on stock markets outside of China, which has attracted investments from international banks. They have also opened up management and board positions in order to become stronger and to help adapt to international demands.<br><br>Compare this to Taiwan's financial reform where domestic companies simply merge with one another and are unable to gain any international influence.<br><br><span style="color: red;">It is understandable that China will not allow its currency to fluctuate too much before carrying out its financial reforms so it can avoid attracting the speculators.</span> Maybe China will allow the yuan to float by 2008 if it is able to complete its financial reforms in time.<br><br><span style="color: red;">China needs time, but that is something the US is not prepared to give. If the US really wants to resolve its trade deficit with China, two good approaches would be to abolish the Wassenaar Arrangement and remove restrictions on high tech exports to China</span>, but that would speed up China's technology development.<br><br>It is obvious that this is a win-win solution to the problem. So <span style="color: red;">it is difficult to understand why the US persists in pushing for the revaluation of the yuan when that will harm China while bringing no benefit whatsoever to the US itself.</span><br><br>Lo Chu-ping is an assistant professor of economics at National Cheng-Kung University.</div></blockquote></div>

TheyÂ’ve been moving aggressively in terms of building up the necessary financial infrastructure,Â” Frank Gong, chief economist with JPMorgan Chase in Hong Kong, said of the PeopleÂ’s Bank of China.<br><br>The yuan has risen by less than 0.5% against the dollar since the revaluation, and was quoted at 8.0705 per dollar at 0430 GMT on Friday. Â“I personally think the best option would have been a larger one-off revaluation and quicker appreciation since then,Â” said Song Guoqing, chief economist at the China Stock Exchange Executive Council, a think-tank in Beijing.<br><br>Since the revaluation, the central bank has steadily introduced such forex derivatives as forwards and swaps, giving institutions and firms tools to hedge against currency fluctuations. It has also launched a liquidity-promoting trading method known as market-making, set to take effect in early 2006.<br><br>Gong played down concerns that the yuan has not risen quickly enough, noting that it had appreciated by more than 6 percent against the trade-weighted basket over the year.Â“That the yuan did not weaken, but actually strengthened, in a strong dollar environment is a very good sign that once the weaker dollar environment resumes, you will see more significant appreciation of the yuan against the dollar,Â” he said.<br><br>Next year should see even more aggressive development of market infrastructure, meaning more products, more flexibility, more competition, and less interference by the central bank, said Minggao Shen, China economist with Citigroup in Beijing.<br><br>Â—Reuters</div>

Thats the point.</div></blockquote><a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/articles.php?article_id=5155" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanthinker.com/articles.php?article_id=5155</a><br><br>China's Alan Greenspan, Mr. Zhou<br>January 14th, 2006<br><br>Brian Schwarz publishes the website China Challenges, and is based in Shanghai.<br><br>In February, after 18 years as AmericaÂ’s top banker, Dr. Allan Greenspan will step down as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. While many economic observers are very interested in the views of incoming Chairman Ben Bernanke, they often overlook another central banker - in Beijing Â– who will have a major impact on the global economy in the years ahead.<br><br>Few in the West will recognize the name Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the PeopleÂ’s Bank of China, but he has the twin tasks of managing the Middle KingdomÂ’s fast growing economy while at the same time satisfy international critics, who are demanding further appreciation of the Chinese yuan.<br><br>Mr. Zhou is under enormous international pressure to orchestrate a steady appreciation of the yuan versus the dollar, while at the same time managing an underdeveloped financial system in an economy plagued by overcapacity and falling prices With growing signs that ChinaÂ’s real estate boom (especially around Shanghai) is coming to end, he must also continue reforms to keep bad loans from ballooning at the state-run banks.<br><br>If Mr. ZhouÂ’s reforms fail in any of these areas, he could lose the confidence of President Hu Jintao, and strengthen the hand of Marxist reactionaries.<br><br>As did the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, a meltdown of ChinaÂ’s financial system would be likely to send shock waves radiating throughout the global economy. As with Mr. Greenspan, currency traders hang on ZhouÂ’s every word, given the $769 billion pile of foreign currency reserves over which he watches.<br><br>Mr. Zhou has responsibility for a financial system that is riddled with numerous structural problems and inconsistencies.  China has $400 billion, give or take 50%, in bad loans on the books of its banks. The countryÂ’s bad loans, whatever their precise sum, are equivalent to a good chunk of the countryÂ’s foreign reserves. Even Mr. Zhou probably no idea what the true number is.<br><br>By keeping the Chinese currency non-convertible and fixed in value around eight yuan for every greenback for the past decade, Beijing has basically Â“outsourcedÂ” its monetary policy to Mr. Greenspan, by piling up massive surpluses and investing them mostly in federal debt.  In effect, Washington runs the Chinese money supply.<br><br>China has committed to the World Trade Organization to open the banking system to foreign competition in December.  This will erode the state-owned banksÂ’ monopoly on deposits in the country, which has allowed them to take advantage of the high savings rate, accumulating a massive pool of capital. The state banks then lent this capital to state-owned enterprises (SOEs).<br><br>This lending served two purposes. It kept the money in the family, assisteing Beijing in maintaining control of the broader economic and political system. Because loans were disbursed frequently and at subsidized rates Â— and banks did not insist upon strict repayment Â— the state was able to guarantee ongoing employment to the Chinese masses working at the often-bloated SOEs.<br><br>This last point was Â— and remains Â— of critical importance to the Chinese Politburo: they know what can happen when the proletariat rises in anger. That is, after all, how they became the Politburo in the first place.<br><br>Strategic Partner or Strategic Competitor<br><br>Instead of supporting Mr. Zhou, some in Congress are making his job more difficult.  On November 29, Senators Schumer and Graham reintroduced an ill-conceived bill that would impose a massive 27% tariff on all Chinese-made goods that move across the Pacific.<br><br>Last Spring, even President Bush fell into the protectionist trap and imposed import quotas on some kinds of Chinese-made clothing.  Many Washington observers rightfully viewed this move as a shameless attempt to win support from labor unions and encourage the Chinese to speed up currency reforms.<br><br>With the Communist need to stand up to the West, foreign pressure is more likely to hinder Mr. ZhouÂ’s reform efforts and give the Marxist reactionaries a great reason to drag their feet even more.<br><br>After pondering the wider implications for the global economy is it really wise for Westerners to pressure China, given all its internal weaknesses , to push up the value of the yuan at this time?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Count Your Blessings<br><br>With the American economy showing impressive GDP growth and consumer confidence rebounding during the Christmas shopping season, Washington should just sit back and count its blessings.  Many in Washington should be careful what they wish for.  Let us assume for a moment that Mr. Zhou gives Senators Schumer and Graham a holiday gift and announces an increase the value of the yuan by 20%.<br><br>Will the huge bilateral trade deficit that America has built up in recent years suddenly disappear?  Hardly.<br><br>Will textile factories in South Carolina start announcing re-openings? Never. The most likely scenario of such a yuan appreciation is further damage to the overheated property market in China, already showing signs of stress. Portions of the billions of yuan that foreigners (led by the Taiwanese and residents of Hong Kong) have invested in the real estate in recent years will be withdrawn, as owners enjoy their instant 20% currency windfall.<br><br>If there is a Â“hard landingÂ” in some critical manufacturing industries, then a slowdown in China may be imminent. How painful is anybodyÂ’s guess, but some experts say the figure could dip as low as 5 percent next year and 3 percent in 2007.<br><br>As for Mr. Zhou, the billions of dollars in Treasury bonds that he watches over suddenly become worth fewer yuan.  With an aging population and a crumbling health care system, Beijing needs every last yuan in the years ahead to satisfy the masses and maintain social stability.<br><br>Will ChinaÂ’s Savings save Us?<br><br>Many American conservatives have rightfully complained about the GOPÂ’s reckless spending habits.  With its high savings rate and export earnings, China is helping finance reckless fiscal policy in the West.  But can central bankers in Asia save us from fiscal doom?<br><br>If it can maintain reasonable economic growth and social stability (which is a big if, as the recent violence between government security forces and farmers in the southern village of Dongzhou illustrated), new research seems to indicate China can continue for generations to come to supply us the capital we need.<br><br>In late October, BusinessWeek noted a study entitled Will China Eat Our Lunch or Take Us Out to Dinner by two German researchers, Hans Fehr and Sabine Jokisch, that concluded a flood of Chinese savings over the next forty years could turn the anticipated capital shortages into capital gluts insteadÂ—not just in America, but in Europe and Japan as well.<br><br>Assuming the American dollar remains relatively strong, this savings glut could finance the massive social security entitlement promise made to the baby boom generation. BusinessWeek concludes:<br><br>According to their calculations, the potential impact of China is so large that global interest rates could drop by as much as a third by 2050, even with all the expected government borrowing. Those lower rates, in turn, could finance more business investment, boost productivity, and raise national incomes across the developed world.<br><br>Some American economists have claimed the methodology that Washington uses to calculate the national savings rate, which does not take into account many types of capital gains, underestimates the nest eggs of millions baby boomers.<br><br>But we are really taking a gamble if we think we can depend on Mr. Zhou and the other Beijing autocrats.<br><br>Nervousness Leads to Saving<br><br>While Chinese exports to the West generate billions of dollars in earnings, ChinaÂ’s high household savings rate is a sign of weakness, not strength.  A new report from McKinsey Quarterly says just 37 percent of those surveyed agreed or strongly agreed with the statement Â“I feel confident about my financial future.Â”<br><br>While respondents confirmed that they saved a quarter of their family income, the survey results support the view that ChinaÂ’s savings rate is high because the countryÂ’s social safety net is thin and most Chinese must pay for health care and pensions out of their own pockets.<br><br>With the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges plagued by corruption and poor oversight, the average Chinese family has thousands of yuan stashed away in the state-run banking system earning little, if any, interest.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>Despite the rhetoric coming from Senators Schumer and Graham, President Bush seems to have rediscovered his free trade principles.  Just as everyone was preparing to ring in 2006, he quietly rejected a request to place quotas on steel pipe imported from China, saying the cost to American consumers would outweigh the benefit to domestic producers.<br><br>While it may win a few more labor union votes, Washington should stop bashing BeijingÂ’s economic policies.  In many cases, it does more harm than good.  AmericaÂ’s prosperity does not rest on a foundation of othersÂ’ poverty and backwardness. Our flexibility, creativity, and responsiveness to market signals, along with our traditions of hard work and the rule of law will keep us ahead.<br><br>Compared with some of the other hardliners that have claimed power and influence in the Middle Kingdom, America should be grateful that it has an ally in Mr. Zhou and do everything we can to keep China on the path toward greater economic prosperity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally disagree with the assessment of this author.<br><br>First of all, nobody is demanding an immediate revaluation by 20%.<br><br>Secondly, this argument about the selling of US treasury bonds is absolute nonsence. I have been hearing this talk about the collapse of US due to high debts since the 80s and I understand that it goes way back to the 70s as well.
