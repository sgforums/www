            <div class='col-md body'>China is the mkt in this era that is fuel many jobs in singapore and the region.  US and europe is more or less stagnant or worse not to mention japan.<br><br>If its not china, it will be india or russia.  Many companies here depends on china for business, from ST group, creative, apple, motorola, maxtor, seagate, education companies, food, shipping, OSim, logistics, machinery, transports and on their dependant subcons.   They all invest in china in one way and staff benefit from it for as long as they can.  Many singapore GOV link companies are also there from construction to banking.  Its dead end if many singapore companies want to grow organic here.  These companies will probably need only 10% of the staff if they were to stay here in singapore mkt.<br><br>If china growth machinery die, the world will be in for a major recession.  And singapore will be hit real hard.  Infact many logistic companies here are employing more because of growth in china.  If not, Where is the mkt.<br><br>for every company that is there, they have a similar operation here to keep staff employ to produce and support the operation there.<br><br>Vietnam, combodia, india, are the subcons, that are supporting all in terms of much lower tier cost of manufacturing.<br><br>The worst if there are economic boom in this region and singapore is being left out by thinking inward and many who stay will be hit by economic starvations.</div>
