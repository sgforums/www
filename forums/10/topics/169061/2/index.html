Jobs here will still be loss due to geographic changes and restructuring.    you can see mnay jobs loss here are due to restructurely and moving closer to mkt place.

Pix: Anuar Isman<br><br>By Alan Ting<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 12 (Bernama) -- China will consider its neighbours' economic and financial situation before making any changes to its economic policy so as to maintain stability in the region.<br><br>Its Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said that as China continued to pursue economic growth and reform its currency regime it would continue to ensure that any changes would not affect its neighbours' financial and economic stability.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Citing the 1997 Asian financial crisis as an example, Jiabao said that China has continued to resist pressure to devalue the yuan and the effort brought some stability to its neighbours' economies.</span><br><br>Last July, China abandoned its US dollar peg in favour of a basket of currencies.<br><br>"We have taken into consideration its full impact on China's economy and the impact on our neighbours.

If they interfere too much companies may lose confidence and pack up everything and move out, jobs are lost, investments are lost, economy takes a nosedive.<br><br>But if the government proactively encourage companies under the guise to "expand" overseas to take advantage of low cost opportunities, companies may instead only relocate manufacturing activities but keep the "base" here. In this way some jobs are lost but all is not lost, investments are still here, economy may still improve because companies registered in singapore although have manufacturing activities overseas may enjoy better profits and higher growth operating in bigger or newer markets.<br><br>The way out for us is we have to fix the problem here in singapore, move away from low/mid end product manufacturing, move away from the image that we only know how to do quality things for people and reverse that position to be other people do quality things for us instead, and that way is to build more products with strong brand names or buy over companies that have these brands if we cannot build.</div>

Presidents can come and go; Congress can be led by either the Democrats or the Republicans; but China has always been viewed with a special eye by Americans.<br>The United States, the bastion of anti-communism during the Cold War, considered the Russians to be wicked and dangerous. The Chinese, somehow, were seen as more benign and misguided. In other words, the Russians were bad communists while the Chinese were good communists.<br><br>US attitudes toward China swing between love and skepticism but the Soviet Union was always considered the bad guy. What's more, the Soviet Union didn't have Fortune 500 acting as its lobbyists like China does.<br><br>Even George W Bush, the most revolutionary US president since Ronald Reagan, does not seem totally immune to this romanticism about China.<br><br>I happen to be a strong supporter of Bush. I admire his courage and insight in trying to bring democracy and liberty to many parts of the world. This, Bush argues and I agree, is the best way to fight terrorism. In a nutshell, I like the Bush doctrine.<br><br>But it seems to be applicable to anywhere else but China. Ellen Bork, acting executive director at the Project for the New American Century, made a compelling case at a panel discussion hosted by the American Enterprise Institute last Wednesday in Washington.<br><br>Bork simplified the Bush doctrine down to three key points.<br><br>First, the United States would show active leadership.<br><br>Second, it would promote liberal democracy.<br><br>Third, it would oppose dictatorships, and one strategy is regime change.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Washington apparently is not pursuing these policies towards Beijing.<br><br>"The US has not made the establishment of liberal democracy a top priority for China," Bork said. Instead, Washington still believes in "economy first, politics later."</span><br><br>Bush's speech in Kyoto last month cited Taiwan and South Korea as examples of political liberalization through economic development. He claimed Taiwan "has moved from repression to democracy as it liberalized its economy.<br><br>"And like South Korea, the opening to world markets transformed the island into one of the world's most important trading partners. And like South Korea, economic liberalization in Taiwan helped fuel its desire for individual political freedom - because men and women who are allowed to control their own wealth will eventually insist on controlling their own lives and their own future."<br><br>But it's much more complex than that, Bork said. In the 1980s, the United States started to withdraw support from dictatorships in Asia, from South Korea, the Philippines to Taiwan.<br><br>"Democracy is not inevitable from economic development," Bork said.<br><br>While development can provide a basis for real change, getting people rich alone won't do it. Constant pressure and vigilance, as well as the economic card, are a must for meaningful change.<br><br>The United States still has leverage over China. Think of why the European Union did a U-turn on lifting the arms embargo on China earlier this year.<br><br>And Bork said: "The fear of losing the most-favored nation status led to the release of [political] prisoners."<br><br>To apply the Bush doctrine to China, Bork thought, the United States should spend some yet-to-be-spent capital.<br><br>"Washington shouldn't look to the Chinese Communist Party for reforms and should stand with Chinese dissidents like we did with the Soviet dissidents before," she suggested.<br><br>Fellow panelist Pei Minxin, senior associate and director of the China program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, disagreed.<br><br>He said: "Bush can't just stop by [former secretary to late party general secretary Zhao Ziyang] Bao Tong's house for coffee" as it's impossible for protocol reasons.<br><br>Another panelist Lorne Craner - formerly assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor and currently president of the International Republican Institute - rejoined: "That could take place at the US ambassador's residency."<br><br>And Ying Ma from the AEI suggested US officials could meet Chinese dissidents in the United States more often.<br><br>Bush didn't receive any dissidents of course, during his trip to China. He worshipped in a state-sanctioned church instead, a move that might end up sending the wrong signal.<br><br>While Bush was critical of China in his Kyoto speech, he was more restrained when he went to China. He is someone who carries deep convictions, risking his presidency in trying to implement democracy in Iraq.<br><br>But when the president pays Beijing much more courtesy than he would other dictatorships, then I know the China Exception is here to stay.<br><br><a href="http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=15&amp;art_id=8269&amp;sid=5968658&amp;con_type=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=15&amp;art_id=8269&amp;sid=5968658&amp;con_type=1</a></div>
