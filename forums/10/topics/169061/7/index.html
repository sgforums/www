It will move to the next low labour cost country likely Vietnam. Our govt has infact lay basic foundation there.<br><br>China has also a huge comsumer market potential. Wealth disparity are present now because of splurging growth, but in time, wealth distribution will be somewhat marginalise. Some manufacturing will remain to cater to that, it just that they will move more in land where cost are still low, and China's logistics infrastructure also be along that line.
