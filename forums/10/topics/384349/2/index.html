              <p>Personally i still admire his farsight and i can agree with much of what he says on world events and future trends. After all, he does have access to a whole lot of information and unique perspectives by virtue of his vantage point in society.</p>
              <p>Despite all that he had said and have done i am still glad we had him at independence out of the many other unknown possibilities. </p>
              <p>However, the rather effective Rule of Law he had created can only worked when exceptions do not exist which he is one.  Where once before he is the driving force of Singapore, he has now become the primary obstruction for us to continue changing and improving. Evolution looks down very dimly on stagnation.</p>
              <p>God knows the implications of him giving power to his son. Regardless of LHL's ability, LKY has set an extremely dangerous precedent that would plague Singapore for future generations by allowing this, even China has moved away from this trend. </p>
              <p>I desire freedom and democracy like any educated individual, perhaps even more. But I also understand it to be like every other choice we have to make in life - if we want something we have to sacrifice something.</p>
              <p>We have to understand that obtaining a multi party system, a free press and a functional democracy is not going to promise us anything at all. The West have conveniently forgotten their history of wars, plunder, exploitation and tyranny (even against their own people) that led them to their current "prosperity". Both World Wars were fought between countries with democratic institutions and the atomic bomb were used by a democracy against another democracy.</p>
              <p>Singapore cannot afford to learn this lesson the hard way as they do, we would not recover from it.</p>

              <p>The more Lee Kuan Yew opens his mouth the more he reveals his ignorance.</p>
              <p>It is very dangerous and harmful to state interests to let a deluded person like Lee Kuan Yew to hold power.</p>
              <p>He has to be voted out in 2010, otherwise he might destroy Singapore.</p>
              <p>I read a study the other day that revealed how shallow his intellectual capacity is.</p>
              <p>Really shocked by the rubbish views that he holds.</p>
              <p>He is an imbecile.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here is the study:</p>
              <p><strong>Lee Kuan Yew: Race, Culture and Genes</strong></p>
              <p>...This article has described in detail the character of Lee Kuan Yew's racial views<br>substantially using his own words as evidence.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After a lifetime of being circumspect on the question of race, Lee has finally spoken openly, revealing himself as doctrinaire racist.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Yet it would be a mistake to condemn Lee as a hard line racist in every sense of the word. Such a characterisation of his views would be a distortion of both his logic and his natural disposition.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There can be no doubt that Lee is a racist in the sense that he believes that some races and some ethnically-based cultures are inherently superior to others. His own words leave no doubt about this assertion, though it should be recognised that this in itself hardly makes him remarkable in Asia.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He is also a racist in the sense that he has integrated his racial views into his political agenda and he has created a regime which accentuates racial categorisation. </strong></span></p>
              <p>This assertion, too, is beyond dispute, yet it should be acknowledged that affirmative action programmes in the United States and Australia are based upon racial classifications and are widely accepted as part of modem liberal orthodoxy.</p>
              <p>Of equal significance to our study of his political thought are the aspects of political and personal racism that Lee has avoided by his eclectic approach. Lee's idiosyncratic rationalisation of his racial views, for instance, has undermined the tendency to dismiss any race as being irredeemably inferior, or unchangeably superior.</p>
              <p>He has not conceived of any race as being supreme, even though some are more intelligent and hardier than others. Unlike Social Darwinian racists, he does not base his views on the assumption that any race is a lower or higher evolutionary form of humanity.</p>
              <p>He sees no unbridgeable divide between races. Although his environmental determinism, Lamarckian view of evolution and cultural eugenicism may explain the higher intelligence and better glands of those who hail from a "hard" society, they also create a firm line of continuity between the different races, and give each race the capacity to change for the better or the worse: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>hence Lee's efforts to "improve" racial communities by "tinkering" with their cultures.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The result has been that despite instances of overt racial discrimination by Lee's government, and more common occasions of discrimination in Singaporean society, Lee has created a society which has a relatively low level of racial tension, despite having a high level of racial consciousness.</p>
              <p>Considering his own racial views and the nature of the society he inherited, this is a remarkable achievement which, despite its shortcomings, should be acknowledged.</p>
              <p>Our understanding of the nature of Lee's views on cultural and racial evolution<br>now enables us to perceive a new depth in Lee's public policies and in the<br>development of his political thought.</p>
              <p>More significantly, it gives us a fresh insight into the deep fears which have driven Lee throughout his public life, and especially since his sinicisation in the late 1970s Lee has married pessimism, progressivism and geneticism to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>produce a vision of a horrible world where every step on the road to progress creates new problems which will drag civilisation down to the depths again  unless the elite takes charge and applies itself creatively and scientifically to overcoming these challenges. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Such an attitude is, of course, the height of hubris, but this does not concern Lee.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>By the late 1970s Lee was very comfortable with hubris. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He had been almost single-handedly transforming and re-transforming the physical, political, linguistic and cultural landscape of Singapore for nearly two decades. He had been making and breaking careers and industries, politicians and ideologies, and setting patterns of work, procreation and education for about two million people.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He had assumed more control of his countrymen's lives than the Pope claims over the lives of Catholics.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Furthermore, by the early 1980s ill health and old age amongst his colleagues meant that he could now foresee the day when he would be the last of the "old guard" left in Cabinet a paramount leader without rivals, rather than a primus inter pares. Lee himself spoke of the difference this set of retirements has made to Cabinet.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The old guard leaders were never compliant and were forthright in their opposition to many of Lee's policies.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>After their retirement, however, he did not "waste time taking opinions all<br>around" the Cabinet, but simply told his colleagues what he wanted and it was up to them to disagree. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>One does not have to be a Western liberal to see that this near-omnipotence and unrivalled pre-eminence is not healthy for either the nation or the leader. </strong></span></span>Lee's new freedom, combined with his perception that cultural and dysgenic disaster were imminent seem to have been at the heart of Lee's quixotic approach to politics in the 1980s.</p>
              <p>His eugenics policies and the sinicization programme converged as the complementary answers to the challenge of the West, degenerating genes and the search for talent.</p>

              <p>I seriously think that Lee Kuan Yew's intellect is below average person.</p>
              <p>I think the average man in the street has a more sound mind than Lee Kuan Yew.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>By Sue-Ann Chia and Kor Kian Beng from Straits Times</strong></p>
              <p>AS SHE waited for her husband to finish his Meet-the-People session, Mrs Lina Chiam sat on a stone bench, flipping through old photographs.</p>
              <p>They had yellowed with age, but time did not dim her memories as she recalled her cherished moments.</p>
              <p>Most of the faces were not familiar, except for the bespectacled man with an earnest smile who has stood the test of time as Singapore’s longest-serving opposition MP.</p>
              <p>The focus was on Mr Chiam See Tong, decked with garlands on the campaign trail, or standing at the back of a lorry with a loudhailer in hand during his victory parade.</p>
              <p>There were also pictures after the hustings, showing him attending a wedding of a Potong Pasir resident, meeting reporters at a coffee shop, and having drinks with supporters.</p>
              <p>The photographs date back to 1984, the year he won his first election in Potong Pasir. Since then, he has proven his staying power, retaining the seat in the five polls that followed.</p>
              <p>Tonight, some of these shots selected by his wife will be screened at a dinner to celebrate Mr Chiam’s 25th year as MP for Potong Pasir.</p>
              <p>It is a silver jubilee that testifies to his tremendous contribution to Singapore’s democratic system, say political observers.</p>
              <p>‘Mr Chiam’s rightful place in Singapore’s political history lies in his unbending belief that there should be a constitutional role for the opposition and that he had kept this idealism and hope alive,’ says Dr Ho Khai Leong from Nanyang Technological University.</p>
              <p>But the avuncular politician, known as Ah Chiam or Uncle Chiam, is not ready to call it quits.</p>
              <p>His hair has whitened, his gait is more stooped after he suffered a stroke last year, but nothing seems to stop the 74-year-old opposition warhorse from charging on.</p>
              <p>He has already thrown his hat into the next electoral ring, signalling his intention to contest a group representation constituency (GRC) for the first time – a move viewed as his last hurrah.</p>
              <p>But is the veteran MP, who was at one point the unofficial opposition leader in Parliament, still a formidable force to be reckoned with?</p>
              <p><strong>Political contest</strong></p>
              <p>MR CHIAM contested his first general election (GE) as a lone crusader with the sole mission of breaking the People’s Action Party’s one-party rule.</p>
              <p>Taking on PAP stalwart Lim Kim San in the minister’s Cairnhill turf, the teacher-turned-lawyer declared: ‘We can uphold democracy only if there are at least two parties – one in power and the other, an opposition who will serve as a check against the excesses and improper use of powers by the ruling party.’</p>
              <p>He did not win. But neither did people forget the independent candidate who campaigned with his maroon Volkswagen Beetle and his political mantra – both of which he still holds on to today.</p>
              <p>Encouraged by public support, the Anglo-Chinese School alumnus and former school swimmer took another dive into politics, in the 1979 by-election, and again in the 1980 GE as a candidate of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) which he had founded a few months earlier.</p>
              <p>Both times, he faced PAP heavyweight Howe Yoon Chong in Potong Pasir, and lost. But with each round, his score improved.</p>
              <p>Victory came in Round 4 when he defeated PAP rookie Mah Bow Tan, who is now the National Development Minister, in the 1984 polls.</p>
              <p>He won with a comfortable 60.3 per cent share of the votes in Potong Pasir, reflecting a surge of support some believe could be due to remarks made by then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee had contrasted Mr Mah’s and Mr Chiam’s O-level results, insinuating that the latter was not as smart as his PAP opponent – a comment that could have driven more people to root for the underdog.</p>
              <p>Since then, the political tide has continued to flow in Mr Chiam’s favour in the five elections that followed, peaking in 1991 when his vote share hit almost 70 per cent.</p>
              <p>Yet, for all his efforts, some believe he could have achieved more.</p>
              <p>‘Mr Chiam has been very dogged in his determination to present an opposition voice in Parliament and to optimise the use of his resources on the ground in serving people in Potong Pasir,’ notes Dr Gillian Koh, a senior research fellow with the Institute of Policy Studies.</p>
              <p>‘He would have a richer legacy if he had achieved as much in building up a strong political party and one around a positive and clear set of ideals people can identify with… This would be critical for him to secure a larger footprint in the political scene than the one he has today.’</p>
              <p><strong>The good guy</strong></p>
              <p>MR CHIAM would probably concede that he is not ambitious, as evident in his remarks over the years.</p>
              <p>In an interview after the 1991 polls, at the height of his political career, he said almost apologetically: ‘You see, I have really no great ambitions of my own. I’m being caught in a tide which I cannot stop. It’s just pushing me on.’</p>
              <p>In another interview, in 2004, when asked about his achievements in 20 years as an MP, he replied: ‘To keep the idea and presence of the opposition in the minds of Singaporeans is already a big success in Singapore’s context.</p>
              <p>‘I’ve no grandeur dreams…trying to be the ruler.’</p>
              <p>He declined to be interviewed for this feature, but his humility is clear.</p>
              <p>For the modest man who dared to challenge the PAP and win, his virtue of service before self has endeared him to voters who value his dedication to the care of his constituency. Most continue to support him and the larger opposition cause he represents, spurning the PAP’s overtures such as estate upgrading.</p>
              <p>Engineer Robyn Yeo, 33, who has lived in Potong Pasir since 1984, recounts how seriously Mr Chiam took his work. He had called the Town Council to complain about cleaners who refused to remove big-item rubbish. Later that night, Mr Chiam called and spoke to his mother.</p>
              <p>‘My mother told Mr Chiam that she was very surprised that he bothered to call us. Mr Chiam then told her, ‘You’re my resident. I have to understand your concerns’,’ he says. ‘That phone call still lingers in my mind and reaffirms my support for Mr Chiam.’</p>
              <p>Praise also came from the PAP camp.</p>
              <p>In an earlier interview, Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, his fiercest PAP rival who shaved Mr Chiam’s win to 52.4 per cent in the 2001 election, related an exchange he had with the MP.</p>
              <p>At last year’s National Day Rally, he chatted briefly with Mr Chiam who was still recovering from his stroke.</p>
              <p>‘I told him to look after himself and get well soon,’ said Mr Sitoh, who stood against Mr Chiam in the last two polls.</p>
              <p>‘He said, ‘Don’t worry, when I get well, I will come and beat you again’.’</p>
              <p>Recalling the friendly repartee, he added: ‘I must say, Chiam’s a good guy.’</p>
              <p><strong>The man and his critics</strong></p>
              <p>DESPITE his winning ways, Mr Chiam is not without his detractors.</p>
              <p>Even criticisms come from within his own Singapore People’s Party (SPP), which he joined after leaving SDP.</p>
              <p>‘His work has been satisfactory,’ says SPP chairman Sin Kek Tong, who has had public spats with Mr Chiam over his leadership style. Both maintain cordial ties.</p>
              <p>‘The outstanding part is that he has been able to gain support from residents over the years. But he didn’t do it alone. Without the help of the party and supporters, it is questionable whether he would have been able to pull it off.’</p>
              <p>Others point to Mr Chiam’s patchy parliamentary performance, his inability to grow the opposition ranks in Parliament, and his lack of a political successor.</p>
              <p>The first can be blamed on his childhood. The other two, on his political experiences that caused him to be once bitten, twice shy.</p>
              <p>In an interview with Asiaweek magazine in 1986, Mr Chiam confessed that nobody squabbled within his family, which he believes explains his lack of oratorical skills during parliamentary debates.</p>
              <p>‘I was taught to behave well and not to quarrel with people,’ said the politician who avoids the adversarial approach of opposing for the sake of opposing.</p>
              <p>Despite his shortcomings, he has made inroads over the years as a long-time champion of compulsory education.</p>
              <p>He has also had his moments in Parliament – his objection to a PAP MP’s racist comment that Serangoon Road was ‘pitch dark’, and he has debated many national policies, from the cost of public housing to building more community libraries.</p>
              <p>A robust session in which Mr Chiam pressed for more transparency in property perks enjoyed by politicians led then-Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew to remark in 1996:</p>
              <p>‘I hope he wins the next election. I think he has done on the whole good for the House. I was wrong when I thought he was not going to do much good, but in his somewhat honest, bumbling way, he has been a voice of sanity.’</p>
              <p>While he is not an eloquent speaker, observers say he is a skilled strategist who has been able to adapt nimbly to the PAP-dominant political system.</p>
              <p>He is credited as the architect of the by-election strategy – that is, contesting fewer than half the seats and returning the PAP to power on Nomination Day so that people would be more inclined to vote for the opposition. It was first used to great effect in the 1991 GE.</p>
              <p>It resulted in four opposition candidates – including Mr Chiam – getting into Parliament. Two others were from the SDP, while the fourth was the Workers’ Party’s Low Thia Khiang.</p>
              <p>With three prized seats, the SDP was hailed as the most promising opposition party and Mr Chiam became the unofficial leader of the opposition.</p>
              <p>Yet, for all his political wisdom, he failed to stop the seeds of discord from growing within the SDP. The split culminated in a fight over a hunger strike by Mr Chiam’s protege, Dr Chee Soon Juan, in 1993. Dr Chee was protesting against his dismissal from the National University of Singapore as a neuropsychology lecturer for misusing research funds.</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam lost in the ensuing battle and eventually resigned from his party post in 1993. A year and a half later, Dr Chee became the party boss.</p>
              <p>Political observers say that experience could have discouraged Mr Chiam from grooming other aspiring politicians who might have made his party a bigger player on the political scene.</p>
              <p>‘There is no clear heir-apparent to Mr Chiam at the moment. He may well have been stung by his own experience in SDP when he lost control of the party to Dr Chee,’ notes Mr Eugene Tan from the Singapore Management University (SMU).</p>
              <p>But could it be water under the bridge now, as Dr Chee is attending the celebration tonight as a guest?</p>
              <p>Congratulating Mr Chiam, the SDP’s secretary-general says: ‘It is a significant milestone in the history of opposition politics in Singapore. We wish Mr Chiam all the very best and may he continue to hold this office for many more years.’</p>
              <p><strong>The future of the opposition</strong></p>
              <p>IT IS a wish that Mr Chiam intends to fulfil, to keep the opposition flame burning bright.</p>
              <p>He is reported to be seeking an alliance with the Reform Party, headed by Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam, to form a credible team to take on a GRC.</p>
              <p>His push for such a tie-up could spring from his desire for opposition unity. He was instrumental in forming the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA), an umbrella group for three opposition parties.</p>
              <p>Law lecturer Eugene Tan says: ‘The SDA has been important in helping to avoid three-cornered fights and to demonstrate that a united front against the PAP is strategically useful for the opposition. It’s a pooling of resources, especially candidates, and that helps give the impression of some degree of cohesiveness within the opposition ranks.’</p>
              <p>Confirming talk of a possible tie-up, Mr Jeyaretnam says: ‘The Reform Party got a lot of feedback from people about what they thought of Mr Chiam before entering into discussions with him about a potential alliance…we found that people had good things to say about him.</p>
              <p>‘I would hope that he continues to provide inspiration to the next generation of opposition politicians.’</p>
              <p>Why is Mr Chiam contemplating the audacious idea of leading a GRC team as his last hurrah in the next polls? To observers, it is all about breaking a ‘political-psychological barrier’ as the PAP has won every contested GRC since the scheme started in 1988.</p>
              <p>As SMU’s Eugene Tan notes: ‘It may well serve his intent to leave a lasting legacy politically and to rally people to step forward and join the opposition parties.’</p>
              <p>But not all think it is a good idea, as his age and health could work against him on the arduous campaign trail.</p>
              <p>And what about his diehard loyal constituents? Would they not feel abandoned? As Potong Pasir resident Mohd Fahmi Ahmad Abu Bakar, 30, an assistant administrative officer, says: ‘Residents would want him to end on a high by staying in Potong Pasir.’</p>
              <p>Whichever direction he takes, Mr Chiam wants to show that he is not a spent force and that he is still the man to watch in opposition politics. – Straits Times</p>

              <span style="font-style: italic;">Truth Hurts!<br><br>If you have not visited http://www.insanepoly.com/ it's time you do.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What written below by insanepoly is so nakedly honest that no true blue Singaporean should miss.</span> <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">It's so good that I have copied wholesale from his blog [</span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.insanepoly.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #bb3300;">link</span></span></a><span style="font-style: italic;">] and paste it below. </span><br><br>

              <p style="color: #000099;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">National Day came and went with barely a blip on my radar.</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">I don’t celebrate National Day.</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">I don’t put up flags, I don’t watch the parade and I don’t listen to any of that manufactured bullshit songs like Count On Me Singapore, Stand Up for Singapore nonsense. The only thing I celebrate is that I don’t have to turn up for work that day. In fact, that morning when I went to the gym for my workout, I seemed to be the only one attired in full black workout gear while everybody else seemingly wore red or white. Not that I had intentionally wore black, just that when I looked around, I realized I was the only one in black in a sea of red and white. Freudian slip perhaps.</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">Honestly I see no reason to celebrate.</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">Celebrate what?</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">Celebrate that one political party has hijacked my country, its institutions and everything it stands for? Celebrate that Singapore the nation has become PAP the political party which in turn has become the government which in turn has become the civil service. The lines are so blurred that I don’t even know where one starts and the other ends.</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">Singapore, PAP, NTUC, People’s Association, HDB, SAF, SIA, ST GIC, CPF and everything in between seems to be nothing more than extensions of one monolithic entity that seeks to control every aspect of our lives and wants nothing more than to make living batteries out of us and turn this country into a mega corporation.</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">Celebrate that? Seriously?</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">Everywhere I turn my head there are posters and banners with all sort of feel good sound good exhortations to celebrate National Day. Ministers and MPs smiling down benevolently at us while pictures of citizens are conveniently Photoshopped beside them as if to say we are all one people, one nation.</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">National Day, PAP Day- what difference does it make? Those posters and banners put up by the town councils and grassroots organizations seems identical to those election banners and posters put up by the PAP during election. Who the fuck really knows the difference?</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">The only thing I know is that between the political leaders and us- its one Corporation, two people. They make millions while we try to eke out a living. We stay together while they move ahead indeed. One people one nation is for suckers who still buy that bullshit. Its very telling that among that challenges spelled out by Goh Chok Tong, narrowing the worst income gap among all developed nations is not one of them.</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">Count on me Singapore?</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">If Singapore counts on me than can I count of Singapore in return? Can I count on Singapore to bail me out when I am poor and jobless? Can I count on Singapore to treat me when I am sick and penniless? Can I count on Singapore to provide me with a social safety net? Can I count on Singapore when I am old and alone? Can I count on Singapore if I suffer permanent injury in the course of NS?</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">It used to be said at least you can count of your CPF when you’ve reach retirement. Now who the fuck knows. They went ahead and changed the law so that if the CPF fund becomes insolvent, they can actually not pay you your money which they took away without asking for your permission. So as a Singaporean, who can I really count on except myself.</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">Stand up for Singapore?</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">Did Singapore stand up for those who lost their life savings because banks sold unsafe financial products? Did Singapore stand up for those who got conned by paper mills selling degrees of dubious origins? Did Singapore stand up for those lost their lives performing their duty as male citizens. Amid the sound and fury of the National Day parade, was there a moment of silence for those fallen NSMen? Did Singapore stand up for those people who can’t stand up for themselves. Did Singapore stand up to the transport companies that increases their fares year after year in good or bad times?</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">I think at some point during the celebrations, everyone was supposed to stand up and recite the Singapore Pledge together. Do these people even know what they are reciting or are they just going through the motions? Do you even know the true meaning of the pledge?</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">I for one did not recite the pledge for in reciting it would be the tacit support of a gross hypocrisy. To build a democratic country? When one thinks of democracy, singapore is just about as far away from that as you can get.</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">The truth is there is nothing in the world I want more than to celebrate National Day, to proudly stand and declare myself Singaporean.</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">But I can’t. I can’t celebrate National Day while Singapore remains a nation in captivity and its people stripped of their rights and civil liberties. I can’t celebrate National Day until Singapore is returned to its rightful owners- the people of Singapore.</p>
              <p style="color: #000099;">If some fucker came into your house and stole all your stuff, you sure as hell don’t celebrate that.</p>
              <p style="color: #330033;"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">My sincere appreciation to insanepoly for telling it like it is.<br></span></p>
