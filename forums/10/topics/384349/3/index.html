              <p>More on Lee Kuan Yew's rubbish views:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Toynbee</strong></p>
              <p>Central to the thesis propounded by Toynbee in A Study of History, was the<br>notion that societies and civilisations develop in response to certain challenges.</p>
              <p>Toynbee argued that "civilizations come to birth in environments that are unusually<br>difficult and not unusually easy."</p>
              <p>The Sinic Civilisation, wrote Toynbee, was nurtured in the north of China, where the climate was severe, and swamps and regular floods made agriculture difficult, and so it became a "hard" society. (48) Conversely, societies that were nurtured in easy environments, without challenges from people or nature are inherently weak.</p>
              <p>In Volume I of Study, Toynbee repeated a parable originally told by Ellsworth Huntington in his Civilisation and Climate. It was the story of a group of savages from the tropics who travelled north into the colder climate. Upon the onset of the first winter, some returned to the tropics, "resumed the old life and their descendants are untutored Savages to this day."</p>
              <p>All of the others perished except for one group which invented clothes,<br>constructed shelter, learned to dry meat and store it, and discovered how to make fire.</p>
              <p>"And in the process of adjusting themselves to a hard environment they advanced by<br>enormous strides, leaving the tropical part of Mankind in the rear." (50) No one<br>should suggest that Lee, Toynbee or Huntington believed that this parable was<br>literally true.</p>
              <p>The story does demonstrate, however, Toynbee's lesson of the importance of the challenge of climate and more generally, of the environment, whereby those people whose civilisations grew in the "soft" life of the tropics were left behind by their hardier cousins in harsher climates. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lee has taken Toynbee's arguments and used them to justify a dismissive attitude towards the Malayan and Indian Cultures. This logic explains the hierarchy of hardiness of the three women in Lee's parable. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Southeast Asian died first because she came from an easy tropical climate.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> The South Asian lived a little longer because the climate of the Subcontinent<br>is less amenable than that of tropical Southeast Asia.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> The East Asian lived because she - or at least her ancestors - came from a very harsh climate which brought out tougher qualities in her people. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>With a harsh climate go many challenges which develop a plethora of cultural and racial characteristics in a people.</p>
              <p>In 1965, in an interview on Australian television, Lee discussed the differences<br>between the Malays and the Chinese in Malaysia: "One is the product of a civilisation which has gone through all its ups and downs, of floods and famine and pestilence, breeding a people with very intense culture, with a belief in high performance in sustained effort, in thrift and industry.</p>
              <p>And the other people. more fortunately endowed by nature, with warm sunshine and bananas and coconuts, and therefore not with the same need to strive so hard. Now, these two societies really move at two different speeds. It's like the difference between a high- revolution engine and a low-revolution engine. I'm not saying that one is better or less good than the other.</p>
              <p>But I'm just stating a fact that one was the product of another environment another<br>history, another civilisation, and the other is a product of another different climate,<br>different history."</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"Incentive to invent" is sometimes difficult for students to
                                          grasp because they assume that all societies are equally inventive,
                                          or that "necessity is the mother of invention," or that invention is somehow related to innate, hereditary biological
                                          talent (so that there are "inventive races" and "noninventive
                                          races").</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>None of these things is true.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Some societies, like Mesopotamian civilization or our own
                                          Western civilization, are very inventive. Others, like many
                                          primitive tribes, or civilizations like the Egyptian, are very
                                          uninventive. Nor does "necessity" have much to do with
                                          inventiveness.</p>
              <p>If it did, those peoples who are pressed down upon the
                                          subsistence level, or even below it, in their standards of living,
                                          like some of the Indian tribes of the Matto Grosso, would be very
                                          inventive, which they are not. Or, if invention were in any way
                                          related to necessity, the povertystricken fellahin of Egypt or
                                          Trans-Jordan or the equally hard-pressed coolies of China or the
                                          peasants of India would have devised some new and helpful methods
                                          for exploiting their available resources. This is far from being
                                          the case.</p>
              <p>Or, again, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>if biologically inherited talent had anything to do
                                          with inventiveness we would not have seen the great decrease in
                                          invention by the Chinese in the last thousand years, or the
                                          decrease in inventiveness among Anglo-Saxon Americans in the last
                                          hundred years, or the sudden appearance of inventiveness among
                                          noninventive peoples of eastern European stock when they migrated
                                          to America.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Inventiveness<span style="color: #ff0000;"> depends very largely on the way a society is
                                          organized.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Some societies
                                          have powerful incentives to invent, because they are organized in
                                          such a way that innovation is encouraged and
                                          rewarded.</strong></span> This was true of Mesopotamian
                                          civilization before 2700 B.C., of Chinese civilizations before A.D.
                                          1200, and of Western civilization during much of its history.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the other
                                          hand, many societies are organized so that they have very weak
                                          incentives to invent.</strong></span> Suppose that a primitive
                                          tribe believes that its social organization was established by a
                                          deity who went away leaving strict instructions that nothing be
                                          changed.</p>
              <p>Such a society would invent very little. Egyptian civilization
                                          was something like this. Or any society that had ancestor worship
                                          would probably have weak incentives to invent.</p>
              <p>Or a society whose productive system was based on slavery would
                                          probably be uninventive, because the slaves, who knew the

                                          devise new methods since these would be unlikely to benefit
                                          themselves, while the slaveowners would have only a distant
                                          acquaintance with the productive processes and would be reluctant
                                          to invent any new methods that might well require the ending of
                                          slavery for their successful exploitation.</p>

                                          Southern states of the United States in the period before 1860,

              <p>On the whole, the division into seven stages is largely my own except that I have used Toynbee's ideas, if not his nomenclature, with reference to the last four or five stages.</p>
              <p>The great advantage that my seven stages provides over Toynbee's recognition of the last five of them rests in my insistence that any division into stages must be based on analysis of the process of "rise and fall" that is being discussed.</p>
              <p>It is not sufficient merely to describe and to devise name tags for stages based on such description. This is what Toynbee has done, and this is why Toynbee is so<br>notably unsatisfactory in dealing with the earlier stages of any civilization's evolution.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Toynbee's process of "Challenge and Response" explains nothing, is based on a mistaken Darwinian biological analogy, and provides no technique for analyzing a society or for communication with others about it. It is true that societies are challenged and either do or do not respond to these challenges. This is so true as to be quite unhelpful. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The important point is why a society responds or fails to respond, how we can judge the likelihood of either beforehand, and what is the consequence of either<br>alternative.</p>
              <p>Moreover, Toynbee's failure, already sufficiently emphasized, to correlate his process with his division into stages is a major weakness.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Toynbee's failure to provide a satisfactory analysis of process explains his failure to understand, or to provide stages for, the first part of a civilization's existence. </strong></span></p>
              <p>The whole process of mixture, gestation, and incipient expansion is of vital concern to us today when the buffer fringe between the Western and the Soviet blocs, from Morocco to Indonesia, offers a real challenge in this very regard.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Here Toynbee has almost nothing to offer, either to the peoples of those areas who are struggling to establish viable societies or to us who are trying to understand what is happening there...</strong></span></p>

              in rubber plantations and started a factory producing rubber shoes. In
              the early 1900, Tan Kah Kee and Teo monopolised Singapore's rubber
              shoes manufacturing industry. On securing his foothold in this
              industry, Teo embarked on his revolutionary career. In the final years
              of the Qing Dynasty, Teo Eng Hock had supported the Constitutional
              Reform movement and was a member of the reform's "Learning Society". He
              embraced Dr Sun's cause in later years.<br></p>

              <p>In 1904, he started the Thoe Lam Jit Poh with Tan Chor Nam and was its editor. The paper ended 2 years later.<br> <br> In 1906, Teo Eng Hock offered his villa, Wan Qing Yuan, to Dr Sun for
              his stay. In February 1906, Dr Sun established the Singapore branch of
              the Revolutionary Alliance. Teo was the vice chairman. <br> <br> In June 1906, Dr Sun came to Singapore from Japan to reorganise the Revolutionary Alliance. Teo was elected the chairman.<br> <br> In July 1907, The Chong Shing Press was founded by Teo, Tan Chor Nam
              and Lim Nee Soon. They started the Tong Teck Books &amp; Newspapers
              Association that year. Teo was the president of the association.<br> <br> In February 1912, after the founding of the republic, the Kuomintang
              (Chinese Nationalist Party) established a branch office in Singapore to
              replace the Revolutionary Alliance. Teo was the honorary chairman. The
              British colonial government forced the office to close in 1926.<br> <br> In 1932, Teo Eng Hock returned to China and became Mayor of Shantou,
              Commissioner of overseas Chinese affairs, and Branch President of the
              Central Bank of China (Shantou). Due to his displeasure with the
              communists, he became an ally of Wang Jingwei.<br> <br> After the war, Teo returned to Singapore. He died in Hong Kong in 1957.
              His daughter, Teo Soon Kim, was Singapore's first female lawyer. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>His

              <p>I am extremely disturbed by Lee Kuan Yew's racist beliefs.</p>
              <p> <br><strong><br>Around this time you were discussing the succession to PM Lee?</strong></p>
              <p><br>Lee Kuan Yew had been discussing this since about 1983. At that time, the second echelon was Tony Tan, S. Dhanabalan, Goh Chok Tong and myself.</p>
              <p><br><strong><br>Were you a candidate for the top job?</strong></p>
              <p><br>I was considered as a member of the group. At that time, we did not know who would be the successor to Lee. We finally made the decision to pick Goh Chok Tong. He agreed on condition that I agreed to be his number two. So I was the second DPM; he was the first DPM. In 1988, Lee asked Goh to take over, but he was not ready. He said: two more years. So two years later, he took the job.</p>
              <p><br><br><strong>Lee did not agree with your decision to pick Goh.</strong></p>
              <p><br>No, he did not disagree. He said he would leave it to us. His own first choice was Tony Tan. Goh Chok Tong was his second choice. I was his third choice because he said my English was not good enough<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>. He said Dhanabalan was not right because Singapore was not ready for an Indian prime minister. That upset the Indian community.</strong></span></span> There was quite a bit of adverse reaction to what he said. But he speaks his mind.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He is the only one who can get away with it. </strong></span></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Why Singapore not ready for indian prime minister?</p>
              <p>David Marshall was a jew, he was the first chief minister of Singapore, We had two indian Presidents, Devan Nair and the current Nathan and also JBJ as opposition MP.</p>
              <p>I have no problems whatsoever if JBJ was prime minister.</p>
              <p>I am completely ready for JBJ as prime minister.</p>
              <p>And come mon lah, Lee Kuan Yew, you are also from peranakan minority group.</p>
              <p>What right do you have to go and judge other minority groups?</p>
              <p>Are you from chinese majority group?</p>
              <p>No wah.</p>
              <p>You are from peranakan minority group.</p>
              <p>Still want to go and judge other minority groups as if you are from chinese majority group.</p>
              <p>What the fuck is that Lee Kuan Yew?</p>
              <p>Just what the fuck is all this?</p>
              <p>What the motherfucking fuck is all this fucking racial shit about Lee Kuan Yew?</p>

              <p><strong>Lee Kuan Yew: Race, Culture and Genes</strong></p>
              <p>...This article has described in detail the character of Lee
                                          Kuan Yew's racial views<br> substantially using his own words as evidence.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After a
                                          lifetime of being circumspect on the question of race, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee has
                                          finally spoken openly, revealing himself as doctrinaire
                                          racist.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>Yet it would be a mistake to condemn Lee as a hard line racist
                                          in every sense of the word. Such a characterisation of his views
                                          would be a distortion of both his logic and his natural
                                          disposition.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">There can be
                                          no doubt that Lee is a racist in the sense that he believes that
                                          some races and some ethnically-based cultures are inherently
                                          superior to others.</span> His own words leave no doubt about this
                                          assertion, though it should be recognised that this in itself
                                          hardly makes him remarkable in Asia.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">He is also a
                                          racist </span>in the sense that he has integrated his racial views into
                                          his political agenda and he has created a regime which accentuates
                                          racial categorisation.</strong></span></p>

              <p><br>The Taiwanese 'hum' never fail to inject more hot gas into its over inflated idol that will meet its urges for a slave driver hiding within the Stalinist-Autocrat.</p>
              <p>It will cleverly "play play" with LKY and polish his apples with its tampon removed from the tight strings that prevent its clitoris from flapping.</p>
              <p>Or is this made up story to get its needed attention to satisfy its urge for another orgasmic fix as an "Attention Seeking Whore" ?</p>
