              <p>After lecturing China on how it should continue to grow and develop, Singapore’s MM Lee Kuan Yew now turns his attention to Japan.</p>
              <p>During a speech to more than 1,000 Japanese businessmen and guests at the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry Singapore’s 40th anniversary celebrations, MM Lee urged Japan to learn from the Singapore’s experience and rethink its longstanding reservation towards foreigners.</p>
              <p><em>“There is a reluctance on the part of both leaders and people to dilute or to complicate the society by bringing in people of different cultures, different races. It’s not just bloodlines but also language, culture, the way you communicate with each other. I think Japan faces a difficult choice here,”</em> he said.</p>
              <p>MM Lee said he is aware that the foreigner versus local issue is a sensitive one which even Singapore is have difficulties in dealing with.</p>
              <p>He quoted the example of the recently opened foreign worker dormitory in Serangoon Gardens:</p>
              <p><em>“When we had to put work-permit holders in Serangoon estate, there was tremendous unhappiness. But in fact, we’ve fenced it off, made a different entrance, and I think it will work out. But nevertheless there is a certain amount of discomfort,”</em> he added.</p>
              <p>Though he is aware of the unhappiness of some Singaporeans at the relentless influx of foreigners into Singapore, he continues to reiterate just how important immigrants were:</p>
              <p><em>“Supposing we remove 1.2 million of our foreigners, we’ll find suddenly, all the restaurants, theatres, everything is one-third empty. Some will close shop.”</em></p>
              <p>Singapore is able to implement such a liberal immigration policies to mass import foreigners from elsewhere because its government is dominated by a single party with no opposition to check on it, unlike Japan’s.</p>
              <p>If the Japanese ruling party – the Democratic Party of Japan were to adopt MM Lee’s suggestion and open its doors to immigrants, it will soon be booted out of office in the next election.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s ruling party does not have such worries or fears as it is in firm control of the electoral process as well as all institutions of the state which enables it to manipulate the system grossly in its favor.</p>
              <p>MM Lee should realize that the world does not revolve around Singapore and what works here is seldom applicable elsewhere before he dishes out his usual “dose” of wisdom to others.</p>
              <p>Japan will have to find its own way of dealing with the aging population and though immigration is a plausible solution, it should be tweaked so as to serve the interests of the native Japanese instead of foreigners like in the case of Singapore.</p>

              <p><span>He was speaking at a dialogue organised by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry yesterday.</span></p>
              <p><span>China’s current President Hu Jintao is serving his second five-year term and <img class="alignright" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/jintao100.jpg" alt="" width="90" height="81">is expected to step down by 2012 together with his premier Wen Jiabao to give way to a new generation of leaders.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Lee said this is what is being done in Singapore before realizing that he is the most senior member in the present cabinet:</span></p>
              <p><em>“We also have a rule, I’m the exception to the rule, I’m 86….But I’m not doing the work; I’m just forecasting… The work is being done by younger people in their late 40s and 50s. So there’s an energy and a drive, and an understanding of the contemporary world. And they are also linked up with the younger generation of voters,” </em>he added.</p>
              <p><span>In his eagerness to dispense with his usual dose of (highfalutin) wisdom to the Japanese and to impress his audience, it appears that it has slipped Mr Lee’s mind that the Singapore’s political system is based on seniority too and there is no rule in Singapore requiring its leaders to step down when they reach a certain age.</span></p>
              <p><span>For a small nation like Singapore, it has two former prime ministers in the <img class="alignright" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/smgoh70.jpg" alt="" width="88" height="115">cabinet, one as a senior minister and the other is Lee himself – the minister mentor, in addition to two deputy ministers, both of whom are above 62 years of age.</span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Lee should walk his talk first before asking Japan to learn from China and set the example himself by stepping down completely from all positions in office by the next election when he will be 87 years of age.</span></p>
              <p><span>Having already broken the world record for being the oldest MP in parliament, there is no need for him to set another record again by being the first living MP who is above 90 years of age.</span></p>
              <p><span>Regardless of the reality, the lingering presence of the elder Lee in the Singapore government will continue to fuel the public perception that he is still “running the show” from behind.</span></p>
              <p><span>After all, his honorific title “minister mentor” seems to suggest that his role is to “mentor” the ministers including the prime minister as and when the need arises.</span></p>
              <p><span><br></span></p>

              <p>He quoted the example of the recently opened foreign worker dormitory in Serangoon Gardens:</p>
              <p><em>“When we had to put work-permit holders in Serangoon estate, there was tremendous unhappiness. But in fact, we’ve fenced it off, made a different entrance, and I think it will work out. But nevertheless there is a certain amount of discomfort,”</em> he added.</p>
              <p>Though he is aware of the unhappiness of some Singaporeans at the relentless influx of foreigners into Singapore, he continues to reiterate just how important immigrants were:</p>
              <p><em>“Supposing we remove 1.2 million of our foreigners, we’ll find suddenly, all the restaurants, theatres, everything is one-third empty. Some will close shop.”</em></p>
              <p>Singapore is able to implement such a liberal immigration policies to mass import foreigners from elsewhere because its government is dominated by a single party with no opposition to check on it, unlike Japan’s.</p>
              <p>If the Japanese ruling party – the Democratic Party of Japan were to adopt MM Lee’s suggestion and open its doors to immigrants, it will soon be booted out of office in the next election.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s ruling party does not have such worries or fears as it is in firm control of the electoral process as well as all institutions of the state which enables it to manipulate the system grossly in its favor.</p>
              <p>MM Lee should realize that the world does not revolve around Singapore and what works here is seldom applicable elsewhere before he dishes out his usual “dose” of wisdom to others.</p>
              <p>Japan will have to find its own way of dealing with the aging population and though immigration is a plausible solution, it should be tweaked so as to serve the interests of the native Japanese instead of foreigners like in the case of Singapore.</p>

              maybe he should go train the japanese on how to become a better samurai or soldier or tell them to forge a better samurai blade....or be a better shogun,,,,,,,,damn....unimaginable how so many sporeans just let this old man run around talking to 1000 foreigners on  whats to be done in japan.
              
              the japanese did that back in 1930s....the same government spore has now under pap but without the warlike  country expansion!!instead they expanded into yer wallets and yer own salary. 
              so anyway they japs followed lky methhod of governing a country till 1945.all the cabinet members were removed,millions died and 2 atom bombd wiped out 2 cities and nothing was left.
              
              the japs already followed LKY governing method back in 1945....it was worldwide failure.
