            <div class='col-md body'>Is Singapore turning into an America? I myself would think so, but perhaps you think not so. Singapore has lessen its feelings towards their China heritage and roots. The Muslim or Malay proportion of the population that is integrated into Singapore is also very stereotyped. How does this relate to America? The majority of Americans are caucasian and have a European history or heritage. But if you look at today, many of the youths and adults of America show resentment towards Europe - they do not even think themselves of European. Do Singapores think they are more Singaporean or Chinese? Mexicans in the United States are very stereotyped. It is similar to the general dislike of Malaysians by Singaporeans. However, many agree that it is the leader of Malaysia that is ignorant and/or stereotypical towards Singapore. No doubt Singapore is greatly influenced by America, through television, the internet, fashion, movies, etc.. However, many negative beliefs of America are floating to Singapore. For example, the general belief that male circumcision is better formed the Americans is floating to Singapore slowly. The male circumcision rate in Singapore is increasing slowly, and this particularly isn't a good thing, to most people educated on the matter. The nurses or doctors recommending circumcision may be too influenced by religious beliefs and cultural beliefs, and America itself to actually believe in the humanitarian aspects, the truth, and scientific evidence. Circumcision is never needed - almost all disorders the Americans believe that people that are uncircumcised get have no scientific backing. Nearly all Chinese people do not circumcise; is it the same with Chinese-Singaporeans? The rap culture of America is not particularly amusing. Even now, the leader of Singapore's stance with America on the war against Iraq is quite noticeable.<br><br>Is Singapore turning into America in cultural views?

(which is incorrect.) only those who are ignorant or miseducated would support it. i did not state anything of pain if your dick head rubs against the pants, i specifically just said it was bad if it did. and it's bad because it gets your dickhead keratinized and lose most its sensitivity of touch.<br><br>half my argument was on circumcision because i only found out recently that some Singaporeans do this sort of crap.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lol. If we're truly turning into America, PAP would be liberal. There would be big criticism all over about PAP turning Singapore into a police state by the many many parties that will rise if we would be that liberal. Alternate views would flood the newspapers and so much crap.<br><br>But we're not turning into America!! Alternate views are being smashed like a sledgehammer smashing an egg by our good ole government. Opposition parties are being oppressed. So are we truly turning into America??<br><br>You might think that we're turning into America, because of globalisation and all. Everywhere in the world, you'll see the same thing. Highways. MacDonalds, malls, cars, whatever. You'll still see people smoking Marlboro. We're not the only one to be affected by globalisation, kiddo.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>kiddo? you're just a year older than me, so what? commercial colonialism is everywhere. your point? you don't seem to comprehend the fact that i'm saying the negative influence of america's culture. you seem to percieve it as financial businesses and companies.<br><br>as for you pocketpig ii, i just realized that you posted a topic on circumcision in the bar forums a couple weeks ago. it's quite hilarious actually, that you resort to announcing to a crowd that you "may choose to get a circumcision." that already shows enough ignorance or miseducation in many minds, lol.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the law is not liberal, that is true.<br><br>In schools everything is so bloody restrictive; hair length etc.<br><br>The  singapore govt is not american. But the singaporean people desire to be more american, becoz they think it is cool and all. Which is not  a bad thing, it is true that american/european/western culture is cool.<br><br>The chinese pretend to be whites sometimes, the indians/malays try and be african americans etc etc, the eurasians (like me) are caught in between their tainted blood, but most of us (except me i think) side with our western side. I try to be proud of my both worlds, but i am caught in between cos i am not accepted by eastern side, and i am driven to my western side for acception, since i look like them. That is my reason. But anyway moving on.<br><br>On the radio u hear DJs putting on their fake american accents to try and sound more american. U hear most teenagers saying "I wanna go to the states". U see people suddenly getting into hip hop and wearing funny cotton caps on their head in this hot weather. There are many other instances of Americanisation; e.g. people are wearing shoes, drinking more wine, cooking more steaks and potatoes, dining more at fast food outlets (unless they are dragged by their older relatives to the Kopi Tiam).<br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen, I have no answers, i have merely posed more questions. As a people, in doing this, being sapped (so to speak) by American culture, is it wrong? It sure does not feel wrong does it? Except when the whites look at you strangely and in a peculiar manner. Is it wrong to forget our culture like chinese masks, language and writings etc etc (Most of chinese students don't like chinese, most are not that good in Chinese, many did not get distinctions for O levels)? Is it wrong?<br><br>Are we desiring to be of a certain heritage of which we don't have? Or do we even have the right to be of that heritage which we so anxiously seek to be?<br><br>I await answers...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes Singapore is turning into America. Although the laws do not permit this transformation fully with pure democracy; e.g. absure rules in schools, teachers thinking they are god, PAP in control with little seats for any form of opposition.<br><br>However the population has the desire to be American/White, or at most to be accepted in the same light and status as caucasian americans. More and more people are Christians, it could be because they have communed with God, but i think it is because of the anxious desire to be more western, as Christianity is seen as the white man's religion, more importantly America is predominantly Christian.<br><br>More and more people are into hip hop and other aspects of American culture; wearing silly cotton hats over their head in this South East Asian weather for example. More young people are hugging one another in an effort to express love/care/friendship thing which is practised widely in Western culture. Most of the local students do not do very well in their mother tongue especally Chinese, more importantly, most students don't like mother tongue in favour of Western languages.<br><br>You can hear more "Cool" "Its Like" "I wanna go to the states" being sprouted among the locals. Even the local DJs put on fake American accents while on air to be more Westernized. Young people opt for American fast food before being dragged by the older generation for meals at hawker centres. Students are more interested in American culture than Asian culture. The Prom has been adopted in schools now.<br><br>But even more interesting, is the fact that people dye their hair with light colours and putting in coloured contact lens. Some even go to the extent of having special nose jobs. Some even go to the extent of denying their true cultural roots due to embaressment.<br><br>This is what is happening to our society now as far as I can see. I don't have answers, I have merely brought more questions.<br><br>Is it wrong for us to desire to be of a different culture from our own? Is it wrong for us to denounce aspects of our own culture in favour of something else? Do we even have the right to physically/unnaturally tamper with ourselves to try and be of a different heritage?<br><br></div>
