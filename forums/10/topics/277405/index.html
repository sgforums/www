I did what I was told but one excuse was given after another and finally I told them if I was merely interested in debates why should I be subjected to party regulations governing membership.<br><br>I wrote to youngpap to be invited for such debates but my request was turned down probably because youngpap or pap was afraid to face a real debate on its policies of which they had no control or prepared answers.<br><br>Let's face it, this is a sham debate session and people who were invited were insiders who already know the youngpap members who will only put up a good show and nothing else. If they are interested they should have admitted people who have views to express like some forumers here or elsewhere who have had interest.<br></div></blockquote>Has anyone seen the programme on LKY meeting the young people on CNA?  If PAP's way of handling such session has no change, I guess this will just turn out to be the same as the programme on LKY meeting the young people on CNA.</div>

I sincerely hope they will change for the better, but all these years they have not, instead, they have become worse.</div>
