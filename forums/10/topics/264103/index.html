            <div class='col-md body'>Like benchmarking Ministers' salaries to the lucky private sector CEOs, it is wrong and not apple-to-apple comparison at all.<br><br>However through self-centred autocratic practices, the ministers have been able to use fallacious arguments to impose their interests on the ordinary citizens.<br><br>By constantly talking through the media it has created a hype making it look like if we do not pay them the lottery prizes we the citizens will be losing their services or getting corrupted ministers. But look at the whole picture of our standard of education, and the highly educated workforce and maturing population is this scenario true or faked  that we will not have talented people to serve the country. Or is it a case of only limiting the pool of potential to a few and at the end conclude that we do not have talents. Who is the ultimate judge of this pool and what are the criteria adopted to determine people with the potential to serve. Is educational level the only criterion?<br><br>Nevertheless by years of brainwashing, it is like the ministerial salary benchmarking has now been accepted as truths and we will lose talents in finding political leaders or getting corruptions if we do not give in to their demands.<br><br>Truths eventually will prevail over fallacies so eventually when they try their luck again by benchmarking for another million pay increases for the ministers they got backfired with PM Lee having to concede wrongful benchmarking by donating his own salary increases to charity to save face.<br><br>Similarly for years it is all hypes talking about tripartism but do any workers really support tripartism. It was merely a ploy to give them a free hand to do as they like to manage with their own narrow agenda of getting a few MNCs and foreigners to set up shops here while neglecting the plight of workers or the local companies.<br><br>Without overwhelming support of the people and workers of tripartism it is only Lim Boon Heng who praised the tripartism policy. Owing to tripartism hypocrisy the workers lost out on all fronts - getting their CPF cut during deep recession and retirement age postponed to 55 and now likely to be 62.<br><br>So who are our talents who will really look into workers' and citizens' problems like dropping wages and postponed retirements and collections of their retirement nesteggs. It is sad that none of our million-dollar ministers are able to solve such problems at all despite writing their own pay cheques by another million.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously man.<br><br>With 200K in our savings account AND minimum CPF payout, its not enough for us to survive past 62(or is it now 65?).<br><br>How much do i have to scrimp and save in my prime and youth, just to TRY and survive when i'm old and feeble, and its time for me to retire?<br><br>One less piece of cake today, just to live one more day on bread and butter in the future?<br><br>Truly man, the economy is great now! The ministers are having pay rises! Yay! But wait.. how come private sector doesn't seem to be having a pay fest? Or at least the ones below. Strangely enough i don't think the pay for entry level or managerial level has increased noticibly in the past few years, but the prices for movie tickets, GST, and almost everything has increased.<br><br>If everything is increasing but our pay(which is of course inversely proportional to the minister's pay), how will we survive 5 or 10 years down the line? Much less thinking of retirement.<br><br>Maybe the people committing suicide actually thought of all these, and it scared them so much they literally died. Phew.<br><br>I'm thinking of leaving the country after i get some decent qualification. Hongkong maybe. Anyone with me?<br><br></div>
