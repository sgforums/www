            <div class='col-md body'>In terms of what? Numbers? Training? Equipment? Theres no certain answer to that question, its just like asking "Whats the best fighter plane/tank/warship/rifle/missile in the world". The answer is as usual, "It depends". Asking a general question like this would result in no certain answers and to me, is totally pointless.<br><br>Even if you ask the question in more specific terms, the answer is still, "It depends".  Too many factors to consider for a definitive answer.<br><br>There are a lot of comprative tables in terms of numbers about world armed forces, including Asias, either on the web of in libraries. I would suggest you refer to those.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally think that there are 2 general viewpoints to look at the question, the first is to take the "power" in absolute context, eg. the greater the quantity, the more powerful, second, is to look at the quantity against the population or land mass ratio.<br><br>In terms of the first viewpoint (gross/absolute power), Russia will have to be the most powerful in terms of their nuclear capabilities and conventional force.  Ok, it is hard to say Russia being entirely an Aisan country (as part of Russia is in Europe), then China would be the most powerful given their nuclear capabilities. I doubt China will win a conventional war against Japan or India but when they have that many nuclear bombs at your disposal, I guess we have to admit that is just absolute power.<br><br>In terms of power per capital, Israel would definitely be the best. Israel has many times proven that they could defeat enemies with a strength 10 times their own force in all aspect, from land warfare to air warfare. Only their naval forces has not seen too many actions except a couple of exchanges between themselves and the then mighty Eygptian navy. Israel lost a destroyer while the Eygptian lost a few smaller boats.<br><br>In terms of the "best armed" armed forces in conventional weapons, Japan would be the best. They currently posses the best air force (most advanced American jets), the most advanced naval ships with Ageis and standard missiles, and one of the most advanced tank, the Type-90 based on German Leopard 2 tank design. Israel will be the equal first. South Korean would be second, and Thailand probably third.<br><br>In terms of numerical superiority, China, Vietnam and India could possibly fight for the #1 spot.<br><br>So, there is no real answer to this question.<br><br>If the answer is, who would probably win a all out conventional war, if everyone is fighting everyone in a marlee, then, I think Australia will win... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There won't be any clear winner if you are looking for the 'best ' armed forces.  While I agree with Joe Black on his choice of Russia and China, they will still be bound by international treatise not to use them due to repercussions that will be abound after the war.  Japan probably has the most powerful conventional force, however, Japan as a whole is particularly vulnerable to electronic attacks.<br><br>China's weakness is its large borders.  Every country has an Archilles heel waiting to be exploited in any war, so it is difficult to judge.<br><br></div>

NO<br>Is it because all the countries are very powerful?

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, I agree with you on the point that co-operation is the most important thing when dealing with other countries today.  however, where on earth do you get the extra oomph or the weight behind whatever you wanna say?  Do you think everyone in this forum is a moron??? Why do you think when people from Malaysia and SIngapore bomb each other in this forum, the thing that gets thrown in first is the size and power of each countries armed forces??? Every country wants to co-operate of course, but then they also have their own interests to secure and protect.<br><br>For eg. look at the UN security council, you think Britain, France, US, Russia and China are in there for what??? They are the big players with the biggest guns, thats why they are the ones with permanent seats in the SC.  Why does UN send out 'peacekeeping' forces?  This is to stop others from attacking countries too small to defend themselves or to ensure that military violence does not escalate.<br><br>Although today, countries have reached an unprecedented level of co-operation as compared to in the past, history has shown that war can never be eliminated.<br><br>Gulf War:<br>Kuwait did not have a strong armed forces, and Iraq attacked it, which caused a US-led coalition to come to its rescue.  If kuwait had a proper armed force in the first place able to at least fight back a bit, I doubt Iraq would have chosen to attack Kuwait in the first place.<br><br></div>
