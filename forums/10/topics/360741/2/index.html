              our Singapore Police Force should be commended for their constant

              <p>In May a group of five activists came together to mark the 22nd
              anniversary of the Marxist arrests. Led by Seelan Palay, the group got
              together at Hong Lim Park and called for the for the abolishment of
              ISA. (See <a href="http://yoursdp.org/news/singapore/2380-remember-may-21st">here</a> and <a href="http://yoursdp.org/component/content/article/67-general/2400-remembering-22-singapore-victims-of-isa">here</a>.)</p>
              <p>On Sunday afternoon, Martyn See organised discussion forum about the
              22 arrests. The indoor event was supposed to have taken place last
              Saturday. However, about before that, the owner of the venue called
              Martyn to inform him that he had to cancel the booking to to an ongoing
              CID investigation (see <a href="http://singaporerebel.blogspot.com/2009/06/ops-spectrum-forum-to-go-on-with-new.html">here</a>.)</p>
              <p>Undeterred and despite further police harassment, Martyn sought out
              another venue and held the forum yesterday. Activists, bloggers,
              politicians, civil society actors and reporters turned up for the event.</p>
              <p>Ex-detainee Michael Fernandez spoke about why he was detained by the
              Internal Security Department (ISD) in 1964 for nine years for his role
              in championing for workers rights back then.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Alex Au pointed out whilst Singaporeans were bombarded with the
              Marxist plot propaganda, that the other side of the story, has never
              quite been told. He urged the ex-detainees to write about their arrests
              and their experiences thereafter.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Former ISEAS senior fellow, Russell Heng wondered why the government
              had arrested these 22 young men and women when it flew against the face
              of logic. He was also unsure if civil society has evolved to become
              less afraid of the threat of the ISA being used on them.</p>
              <p>SDP's Chee Siok Chin then spoke about the lack of public outrage
              when it was clear that the arrests were farcical. She spoke about the
              current JI detainees and how similar it is to the 1987 arrests in that
              there have been no questions asked about these non-transparent
              detentions. Ms Chee also spoke about the PAP's strategy of making sure
              that the people do not come together to challenge oppressive policies.
              She urged those in the audience to contact groups who are advocating
              for transparency and to work with them, including the Singapore
              Democrats.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>John Tan encouraged the audience not to turn a blind eye to
              injustice and violations of human rights. Civil participation is badly
              needed in our society if we want to be a vibrant democracy. </strong></span></span>He honed in
              the point that Singaporeans must look out for each other and even those
              beyond our shores. In the final analysis, Mr Tan argued, the ISA must
              be abolished in order to prevent another Operation Spectrum in the
              future, and to remove the fear that grips Singaporeans when it comes to
              citizen participation.</p>
              <p>The forum discussion was peppered with Martyn reading excerpts of torture from <em>So That We May Dream Again</em>, a compilation of brief essays of the 1987 arrests, <em>To Catch a Tartar</em> by Francis Seow and also an extract about Chia Thye Poh from Chee Soon Juan's book <em>To Be Free</em>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Martyn ended the forum with the assurance that this will not be the
              last forum he will hold about the ISD's unlawful arrests of the 22
              young people some 22 years ago.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>Why were the 24 persons arrested between May 1987 and May 1988? The
              common denominator for nearly all those arrested was that they were
              trying to help low-paid factory workers and other underprivileged. They
              were Roman Catholics, and moved to manifest their faith by social
              action.<br><br>As Vincent Cheng, one of those detained, wrote:<br><br></p>
              <blockquote>What
              is justice and how do you bring it about? Was Jesus bothered about
              justice? Why are some churches more interested in charity than in
              justice?<br>[snip]<br><br>The old theological understanding of justice
              as commutative justice – that is, the kind of justice that deals with
              how individuals relate to one another – clouds the newer understanding
              of justice as a Kingdom value that is fundamental to the Old and New
              Testaments of the Bible. Individual justice has to be understood as
              part of the larger whole of social justice, not the other way round.
              Thus, justice is to be understood primarily as being concerned with how
              society is organised, Working for justice means working to build a
              society that is intrinsically just. The World Council of Churches
              summed it up best: "What the world needs is a just, participative, and
              sustainable society."<br><br>-- Vincent Cheng in That we may dream again, published 2009 by Ethos Books, edited by Fong Hoe Fang,<br></blockquote>
              <p><br><br>Cheng, who had trained as a priest, committed himself to working for migrant workers and domestic helpers.<br><br></p>
              <blockquote>In
              1982, the Geyland Catholic Centre needed someone to help coordinate its
              various functions as a mediation centre fo runaway domestic helpers, an
              activity centre for young Malaysian workers, a halfway house for
              ex-prisoners and a counselling centre for troubled people. I took up
              the job and concentrated on the issues of migrant workers. These
              foreigners came to develop our economy, many leaving their homes at
              high personal and financial cost to take up lowly-paid jobs here which
              were shunned by the locals. They lived in substandard housing
              conditions and faced various restrictions on their personal and social
              life.<br>- ibid.</blockquote>
              <p><br><br>Tang Lay Lee wrote about her involvement with the Young Christian Workers (YCW) Jurong Centre, 1980 – 1987.<br><br></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I
              remember the long bus journeys to Jurong which seemed so remote. So
              when the YCW asked me to take one of their English classes for factory
              workers – mostly Malaysian and young females – why did I agree? I felt
              I wanted to do something practical, I wanted to see for myself what
              factory workers were like, and I wanted to see Jurong, our largest
              industrial estate.<br>-- Tang Lay Lee in That we may dream again, published 2009 by Ethos Books, edited by Fong Hoe Fang,</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br><br>Such was the idealism of youth. Further on, she wrote,<br><br></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I
              chatted, cooked, joked and laughed with the workers who came to the
              Centre for English classes, or games, or just to relax and socialise in
              the evenings and during weekends. We also had activities like Labour

              anyone who thinks that it is easy to "instigate" workers to do what
              seems to right should have his head examined and his heart replaced.
              Well, the YCW was not involved involved in instigating workers, which
              would be disrespectful, dishonest and heartless.<br>[snip]<br><br>One
              thing we did together was to organise a modest survey on the effects of
              the 12-hour shift and publish our findings and recommendations in the
              Catholic News. Workmen's compensation was another issue workers were
              concerned about, so we organised volunteer lawyers to provide legal
              counselling and representation.<br>-- ibid.</p>

              <p><br><br><br>My
              guess is that most younger readers of Yawning Bread would find all the
              above to be news to them. Was that all they were doing? And they got
              detained under the ISA and subsequently tortured, for that?<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>The
              horror of such heavy-handedness may be one reason why Singapore's
              political conversation in the years since has avoided discussing these
              arrests. It's as if we have been so traumatised by these events, we
              suffer a collective amnesia and mental block</strong></span></span>.<br><br>Our mainstream
              media, naturally, cannot delve far into it either. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The problem is that
              the injustice is to stark, and official explanation so ridiculous,
              there is no credible way for journalists with any shred of integrity to
              revisit this story without poking huge holes in the government's case.</strong></span></span><br><br>As
              my friend Russell Heng pointed out at the forum, by the late 1980s,
              Marxism was in terminal decline. The Soviet Union was on the verge of
              collapse, workers in Poland -- the same workers that Marxism and
              communism claimed to champion -- were demonstrating under the banner of
              Solidarnosc against the communist state, while in China, Deng Xiaoping
              had buried Mao-Tse-tung thought and opened Special Economic Zones for
              capitalists. Did Lee Kuan Yew really think that labelling Vincent Cheng
              et al "Marxists" would convince anybody?<br><br>In my view, it didn't.
              That being the case, how does anyone -- journalists, academics, etc --
              discuss this case without drawing attention to the absurdity, and thus
              the likelihood of illegal abuse of power, at its very heart? Yet,
              accusing the government of abuse of power is fraught with risk. Hence,
              talking about it became a kind of taboo for 22 years since.<br><br>* * * * *<br><br>The
              irony is, Martyn See said, non-government organisations today, such as
              TWC2 and HOME, are doing ten times more than what those early activists
              did for migrant workers. Indeed, it seems to me that people Like
              Bridget Lew, Jolovan Wham and Stephanie Chok are far more outspoken
              than any of those lay Catholics in the 1980s.<br><br>Heng, who is
              active in TWC2, reckoned that many of the younger volunteers would know
              very little of the 1987 detainees and their work history. Today's young
              volunteers go about their work driven by their own idealism.<br><br>If
              that is so, I asked, shouldn't we let forgetfulness stand? Why recall
              the details of 1987 and 1988 and scare a new generation away? Why not
              let the young beat a new path blissfully unaware of the pain suffered
              by others?<br><br>Because those who are unaware of history may end up repeating it? suggested See.<br>I
              don't know if history is programmed to repeat itself. Our government
              leaders change too, and old instincts to crack down on the slightest
              attempt by anyone to pursue an agenda not to the government's liking,
              may not stay the same. Or am I wrong?<br><br>* * * * *<br><br>I was a
              little surprised to see The New Paper send a reporter to Martyn See's
              forum. I thought our mainstream media would studiously ignore the
              forum. Even so, I was skeptical about a report eventually appearing in
              the newspaper.<br><br>Yet, there it was on the next day's print
              edition. And a pretty fair account it was too, one that even carried
              what Chee Siok Chin said. She is the sister of opposition leader Chee
              Soon Juan and herself one of the leaders of the Singapore Democratic
              Party. I had thought there was a complete ban on any publicity for the
              Chees.<br><br>Have some things changed?<br><br>Or is the editor going to get the rap for going out on a limb? We shall see.<br><br>* * * * *<br><br>The
              initial response of the Catholic Church in the days following the first
              arrests, was quire supportive, with a solidarity mass held. But by the
              second week, Archbishop Gregory Yong's arm had clearly been twisted by
              the government. After that the Church no longer stood by its lay
              workers, a betrayal that some of the detainees have written bitterly
              about. The archbishopric owes them all an apology.</p>
