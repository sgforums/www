            <div class='col-md body'>Chief U.N. Inspector Blix to Leave Job<br>1 hour, 53 minutes ago<br><br>By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer<br><br>UNITED NATIONS - Chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix said Friday he will leave his job at the end of June, with disappointment that his teams weren't given a few more months to try to disarm Iraq (news - web sites) peacefully.<br><br>Blix extended his contract for four months at the end of February, when inspectors were seeking substantive answers from Iraq on disarmament issues and the United States was warning that Saddam Hussein (news - web sites)'s time to cooperate was running out.<br><br>Blix said he will submit a quarterly report on June 1 to the Security Council on the work of the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission and leave at the end of the month, a few days after his 75th birthday.<br><br>"I look forward to going back to research, to writing about international law and to not least to be with my family, my wife," the former Swedish foreign minister said in an interview with Associated Press Television News. "Summer is nice at home, and I think after the hectic life here it would be a nice time to come home."<br><br>Would he stay on if asked?<br><br>"I would have wanted to leave last year. However, the way things looked then we were into dialogue and I didn't think I could do that," Blix said. "But as things look now, certainly I will be very happy to go home in June."<br><br>Blix took over the commission, known as UNMOVIC, in March 2000, three months after the Security Council established it to replace the first weapons inspection agency for Iraq, the U.N. Special Commission.<br><br>His inspectors returned to Iraq for the first time in four years in late November, soon after the council strengthened inspections and gave Baghdad a final chance to disarm peacefully or face serious consequences.<br><br>Blix said he is certain President Bush (news - web sites) "hoped that this path to disarmament would be successful." But he said the U.S. administration "gave up on inspections" in late January or early February and began to prepare for military action.<br><br>Blix said he regrets he didn't press the Iraqis earlier to do more to show they were actively cooperating on substantive issues. He said they showed more cooperation in late January and early February.<br><br>The United States decided, however, to push for a resolution giving Saddam an ultimatum to disarm or face war. The U.S. and allies Britain and Spain withdrew the resolution on March 17, facing strong resistance from council members France, Russia, Germany and China. The war began two days later.<br><br>"I think we were given a bit too short time," Blix said. "A few more months would have been useful."<br><br><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=540&amp;ncid=716&amp;e=6&amp;u=/ap/20030329/ap_on_re_mi_ea/un_iraq_blix" rel="nofollow">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=540&amp;ncid=716&amp;e=6&amp;u=/ap/20030329/ap_on_re_mi_ea/un_iraq_blix</a></div>

Sometimes this raises doubts about their attitude to the (weapons) inspections," Blix told the Spanish newspaper El Pais.<br><br></blockquote><blockquote><br><br>"I now believe that finding weapons of mass destruction has been relegated, I would say, to fourth place, which is why the US and Britain are now waging war on Iraq.<br><br>"Today the main aim is to change the dictatorial regime of Saddam Hussein," he said.<br><br></blockquote><blockquote><br><br>But he said he knew at the time "there were people within the Bush administration who were sceptical and who were working on engineering regime change".<br><br></blockquote><blockquote><br><br>Blix said that he thought the US might initially have believed Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction -- although its "fabrication" of evidence raised doubts about even that -- but that Washington was now less convinced by its own claims.<br><br></blockquote><blockquote><br><br>"I think the Americans started the war thinking there were some. I think they now believe less in that possibility. But I don't know -- you ask yourself a lot of questions when you see the things they did to try and demonstrate that the Iraqis had nuclear weapons, like the fake contract with Niger," he explained.<br><br></blockquote><blockquote><br><br>By attacking Iraq, Washington had sent the wrong message -- that if a country did not possess biological, chemical or nuclear weapons, it risked being attacked.<br><br>"The US maintains that the war on Iraq is designed to send a signal to other countries to keep away from weapons of mass destruction. But people are getting a different message. Take the announcement North Korea has just made. It's tantamount to saying 'if you let in the inspectors, like Iraq did, you get attacked'.<br><br>North Korea accused the United States on Sunday of using a UN Security Council discussion of its nuclear programme as a "prelude to war" and warned that it would fully mobilise and strengthen its forces.<br><br>"It's an important problem," Blix continued. "If a country perceives that its security is guaranteed, it won't need to consider weapons of mass destruction. This security guarantee is the first line of defence against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."<br><br></blockquote></div>
