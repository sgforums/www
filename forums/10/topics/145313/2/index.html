I am actually getting that uneasy feeling...<br>The funny thing is that other countries want more experienced workers cause their young people are irresponsible and do not have that level of over-view and knowledge. In some companies, the older workers are pair with the younger to let them learn from each other. And the companies have job rotation to develop and groom the people further. Only sg where they see older people as liability to be kick out with no growth opportunities nor is there any development to these people. The govt training is a joke and farce. And only in sg where they worship the young people with no experience to come out with ridiculous suggestions and do not take into consideration the current setup and the impact of the suggestions. Then when it bombs out, the govt would cover it up...<br>The biased, narrow thinking will not change... not in our lifetime.. I know I would be look upon as 2nd class in other country but to me, when I retire, I want to get out of his sh!tty place. My bf never understood why I am so biased against sg till I brought him out to US.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PAP government has deny our rights as citizens of a so called democratic country through -<br><br>1) absolute control of the medias<br><br>2)  the use of NS to deny young men the freedom to protest against unfair policies and from becoming too active against government .<br><br>Our Dear Leader   fears a possible 'people power' like those in other countries where University and high school students were people power leaders that brought down corrupt governments - eg Philippines and Indonesia .  So NS was incorporated.<br><br>Todate Singapore is only other country in the world that has 24 months NS - and our country isnt even being threatened by our neighbours!  Even Taiwan had slashed its NS to 12 months.<br><br>3) .......and  total control of Union movements in Singapore.<br><br>So you see, after having ensured they have got all these in a tight iron fist, Our Dear Leader turned us into obedient slaves,  to serve, bring glory and fame to our Dear Leader.</div>
