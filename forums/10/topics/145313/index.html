Yes<br><br>2. Hmmmm...you mean guidelines then.<br><br>3. See your 'typical civil servant' response above.<br><br>4. Yes. However, you are assuming that the school lacks candidates who meet the reqs as set out in the prospectus etc. I doubt that is the case.<br><br>5. see 3 + my response above.<br><br>6. Look, this is clearly an absurd suggestion. There are only so many resources available. How can you expect the school to start another class, at the expense of other students.<br><br>7. That is illogical and insensible. Imo.<br><br>8. I do not think the rules are silly. I think they serve a very practical function. To change entry requirements on a whim would be unfair to all those who meet the requirements. They put in the time. They put in the effort. They worked towards a target. They made it.<br><br>And the person concerned is not deprived for the rest of his/her life. He can accept a place on another course. If that is not possible because his results can't get him into poly, and he really really wants to go into poly, i would suggest he try again next year. Just retake the subject. Its not the end of the world.<br><br>On a more general note, i think that there can be too much focus on grades. They ought to consider more than just grades eg. For entry into a Mech Eng course, maybe the school could give priority to students who have shown a genuine interest in the course by taking part in some work experience program or some robotics competition. Then, i do not think the student should be turned away if he falls just short of the entry guidelines. The policy must, however be made official.<br><br>PS: Note that redstone was given an appeal. He appealed but the appeal was unsuccessful. We do not know how his appeal was considered. Wouldn;t it be presumptuous of us to say that the system is too rigid?</div>

Jack Neo was to be Steven Spielberg. Fandi would have been Tiger Woods. But our selection sucks. They missed by one point and was asked to do a next best course close to their interest. hehehe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
