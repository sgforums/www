And so over 10 years, we've had peaceful years, and we've come closer together."<br><br>Mr Lee said he was also glad to see many families from other races coming together for the lantern festival last night.<br><br>"When we celebrate the lantern festival or when we celebrate the other community festivals in Singapore - whether it's Hari Raya or Deepavali - we all celebrate together regardless of race, language or religion and tonight I am very happy to see many Malay families, Indian families, bringing their kids here and celebrating with us this lantern festival.<br><br>"It reminds us how happy we have been and it reminds us how hard we have to work to keep this harmony together for many years to come," said the Prime Minister.<br><br>Mr Lee, who was accompanied by his wife, Ms Ho Ching, for the festivities, was also presented a calligraphy scroll at the event and took part in a lantern walk with residents.</div>

              <p>IMHO, Singapore is safe because No. 1, God blessed Singapura, No. 2, Our boys sacrificed our youth for it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Always NATO. Dont claim credit for something you didnt do. I am reminded of the backstabbers in office by this thing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But despite all the booze talk seems like something is deliberately left out. What is it again? Oh ya !!! Someone forgot to say that they allowed Mas Selamat to escape! Worked hard hor ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh, and with terrorism SO RAMPANT now, and they still allowed so many FTs to come in.</p>

              <p>Wonderful man ...  Safe right ? Secured huh?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nothing happen time, claim credit, got thing happen time, will it be the same thing? I wonder would someone be so upfront to take responsibility for it hor ??</p>

              <p>On the contrary, Singaporeans are very outspoken and all of us stand by our own free will and viewpoints.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, our gahmen implements very hard handed tactics in an attempt to suppress and obstruct any person or organization that may rise up and challenge them. So far, all who have tried have failed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The average Singporean doesnt wanna bother about all that shit. We have much more important things to worry about. Because Singaporeans have come to the realization that nothing else beats protecting our rice bowl and we have to earn as much as money as we can. Everything else is fake except for having money in your pocket. This is particularly amplified living in Singapore's society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whoever is in the gahmen doesnt matter to us. Because no matter who is in there, whatever promises they make, they are not doing anything practical to help Singaporeans. Period.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the end of the day, you and i have only ourselves to depend on for our survival. If tomorrow you were to wake up without a cent on you, you are as good as DEAD. Sayonara pal.. The gahmen is not going to do a shit to help you out of any predicament that may befall upon you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporeans are not timid, cowardly, naive nor guai. The stinging fact is that if you and i have to even struggle to feed ourselves, how else can we pay our attention to other matters? If your hand stops, your mouth stops, you know?</p>

              <p>This is a Work-Til-You-Die country, in case you havent realized.</p>
