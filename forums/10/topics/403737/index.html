              <p>But it's not so ok if I have to see them as Singaporeans as well, which I did before.</p>
              <p>When the Viet is only in Singapore for 4 years and yet dare to have the cheek to say us Singaporeans deserve to lose if we don't buck up.</p>
              <p>The Viet is certainly fucking selfish for her own desires to live in Singapore man whithout considerin the feelings of general Singaporeans without jobs.</p>

              <p>Singapore must be run as a nation even if it is global city.</p>

              <p>It's ok if I jsut see them as Viets, as foreigners.</p>

              well, which I did before.</p>
              <p>When the Viet is only in Singapore for 4 years and yet dare to
              have the cheek to say us Singaporeans deserve to lose if we don't
              buck up.</p>
              <p>The Viet is certainly fucking selfish for her own desires to
              live in Singapore man whithout considerin the feelings of general
              Singaporeans without jobs.</p>

              <p>What the fuck does my vote got to do with you? Can you read English? </p>
              <p>Just becoz of one person you blame a whole nation. WOW..Genius. Really you deserve a nobel peace prize.</p>
              <p>I think she is right. I think anyone with an open mind would say she is right. We are a 3rd world country in reality. Why can't you just take criticisms and use it as an advantage? You think Singapore is so high and mighty? </p>
              <p>Really, it doesn't matter whether she is a refugee, a beggar or a nobel prize winner. </p>
              <p>Rankings in society means nothing for people who take initiative to learn. Your blindness to prejudice will never let you learn anything. </p>
              <p>If every single Singaporean had that kind of attitude, Singapore would be doomed and more foreigners will come in to replace our jobs. Unlike most people here, they do not complain as much. For that reason we really need to go beyond what we are thought.</p>
