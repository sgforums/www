If the poor were truly meant to be the receipients of such a 'noble' cause, then why tax all across the board?  Why not apply the tax increase to luxury goods only?  [/b]</blockquote>Yeah i think applying more tax on luxury good its a good suggestion too, since the rich have benefited most from the tax reduction. The government has to show fairness and not tax only the middle and lower income group. The luxurious cars should come under higher tax.</div>

If you don't know already our Income Tax Act has certain exemptions and deductions too. It's possible to reduce the Singapore Corporate Tax Rate to 9.5% of your profits if you know how. Hell, you don't even have to pay any corporate tax for the first few years, if you know how to plan your tax affairs.
