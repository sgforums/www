But such a Marxist tax system is self-defeating. The group that contributes most to the nation's revenue also provides the most jobs. They are also the most mobile. By targeting them, they will move elsewhere, just like the Finnish financial expert who re-located to Singapore to escape the high taxes of the welfare state.<br><br>Minimum wages will be the fastest way to kill off SMEs. Big corporations can withstand an increase in manpower costs better than small businesses. In any case, it is unlikely that imposition of the minimum wage will affect businesses with full-time workers in a fairly high-value industry.<br><br>How high should the minimum wage be? Let's put it at $750 a month or its equivalent in hourly rates. Most Singaporean workers are already paid more than that. Even a Singaporean cleaner with Ministry of the Environment trained to use modern cleaning equipment stands to earn about $1k a month. The workers who will be affected will be your domestic maids, the unskilled Bangladeshi cleaner in your office and the like.<br><br>A minimal wage will benefit foreign domestic workers the most. Try to impose a minimum wage: it will be Singaporeans who will be up in arms, having to more than double the wages to their maids.<br></div>
