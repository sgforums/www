            <div class='col-md body'>I REFER to the proposed GST increase from 5 to 7 per cent, to provide for those who are poor. There is indeed a pressing need to help lower-income Singaporeans caught in the globalisation tide.<br>Being a small-business owner, I can attest to this. I have many employees who earn less than $1,000 in basic salary and are the sole breadwinners (One such staff member hails from a family of 11). It is heart-rending hearing them bemoan the cost of living, utility bills, household expenses, etc. Much as I would like to pay them more, it is not possible to do so without affecting cost and the business' survival.<br><br>The minimum-wage argument is not tenable. Should employers be forced to pay a minimum wage, many like myself would choose either not to hire because we cannot afford it, or not to set up shop in Singapore. This will result in lesser employment.<br><br>I am glad the Government has heeded the call to take care of the lower-income. Workfare is unique to Singapore and is a far better principle than welfare. Under workfare, hardworking Singaporeans are given a chance to level up whereas welfare destroys all incentive to work.<br><br>It will take some time for Singaporeans to accept the GST increase. I urge everyone to take a measured and rational approach and to support it as it is designed primarily to help poorer fellow citizens. In order to make the reason for the GST hike more persuasive, I suggest the Prime Minister gives a full account of the two-point increase by Budget 2007 - what is the exact dollar value and how much of each dollar will go into workfare.<br><br>Theodore Yeo Guan Huat<br><br>(Straits Times 21 Nov)<br></div>

You've become a plagirist!!! So smart can quote from Wikipedia!!!<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_in_Hong_Kong<br><br>For your information, the trade unions in Hong Kong are not government institutions, there is no conflict of interest, unlike Singapore where the trade unions are government bodies. The trade unions in Hong Kong can negotiate wages for it's worker's interest.<br><br>First of all minimum wages guarantees a minimum living standard for the poor.<br><br>Secondly, our supply of labour is always increasing, with imports of "foreign talents" from China, India, Philipines, Indonesia, etc. Singaporeans are not able to compete with imported labour from those regions. If those labourer saves SGD 100 and remit it back to say China, it will translate to RMB 500, with the RMB 500 he can support a family. The same SGD 100 given to say the labourer's parent (only 1 parent) will last only 10 days at best.<br><br>We are not playing on a levelled playing field.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">A minimum wage may not work very well for Singapore right now, especially since a sudden change will not please foreign investors and with current attitudes / lack of graciousness on ALL levels of society.<br><br>I foresee one problem arising with non-skilled work - minimum wage set, but non-adhereing employers resisting the change (small businesses in particular).. and MOM having difficulty enforcing it.. It may very well turn into a widespread, ugly race of whoever's cheaper gets the job.  I also foresee an increased demand for "FTs" and resentment towards this group for "spoiling the market".<br><br>I do not feel that Singapore is ready for such an undertaking at this moment.  It is already difficult enough as it is for a worker to have MOM take action against errant employers with the current set of worker "protection" laws.<br><br>I do, however, feel that a minimum wage would only work when truly INDEPENDENT workers' unions are in place (without their hands tied).  This would ensure real needs are addressed without too much compromise on the part of the worker in favour of the ONE party policies. Empower the workers with rights and an EFFECTIVE avenue to pursue a course of action against errant employers.. THEN have the union/s <strong>gradually</strong> negotiate minimum wage when there is enough respect for the individual worker.  Then it might just work.<br><br><strong>As for GST</strong>, it's truly ludicrous to justify the increase as a way to help the poor.  If the poor were truly meant to be the receipients of such a 'noble' cause, then why tax all across the board?  Why not apply the tax increase to luxury goods only?  </span></div>
