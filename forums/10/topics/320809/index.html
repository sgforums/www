              <blockquote>
              <p>Today, the Court of Appeal delivered its long-awaited judgement
                  in an appeal over the sentences imposed by District Court judge
                  Sarah Bradley.</p>
              <p>The three men were sentenced to six years, one boy to three
                  years' detention and one boy to two years' detention. The rest were
                  sentenced to three years probation with orders to attend
                  treatment.</p>
              <p>Chief Justice Paul de Hersey said: "The prosecution must bear
                  substantial responsibility for what occurred but ... the imposition
                  of a proper sentence was ultimately the responsibility of the
                  judge.</p>
              <p>"The errors, and the resulting miscarriage of justice, were so
                  serious, and the circumstances in which they occurred so
                  extraordinary, as to warrant allowing the Attorney-General's
                  appeals."</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Janine Chevathun, a Aurukun councillor and member of the Justice
              Group, said the committee had taken Judge Bradley out on the
              community boat where they had explained to her over several hours
              the impossible levels of social dysfunction and alcohol-related
              crime tearing the community apart.</p>
              <p>"I don't wish to blacken her name, but she was told what the
              problems were. We cannot understand her decision. It has mystified
              and deeply disappointed us. We want her to come here and explain
              why she ignored our group. We believed she was a good woman."</p>
              <p>It is understood Judge Bradley, a regular visitor to the
              community in her official roles as both a magistrate and a judge,
              was briefed on Aurukun's spiralling crime well before she handed
              down her decision in the rape case on October 24. Until her
              controversial decision, now subject to official review and appeal,
              she had been held in high regard by the community.</p>

              <p>The leniency of the sentences originally handed down sparked
              nationwide outrage and raised questions abou<span style="color: #ff0000;">t the standard of justice
              for Aboriginal communities in the remote northeast wilderness of Cape
              York.</span></p>
              <p>District Court Judge Sarah Bradley last year gave the three
              adults six-month suspended prison sentences. The six juveniles received
              12-months probation with no convictions recorded against them.</p>
              <p>Appeal
              Court president, Chief Justice Paul de Jersey, said Friday that Bradley
              had made serious errors in passing the sentences and disregarded court
              precedents.</p>
              <p>"These errors were so serious as to produce a clear miscarriage of justice," de Jersey told the court.</p>
              <p>The three adults were sentenced Friday to six years in prison. They will be eligible for parole on June 13, 2010.</p>
              <p>Two
              teenagers were ordered detained in juvenile detention. One is to serve
              18 months and the other a year. Four other teenagers who also pleaded
              guilty to the crime were given three years probation.</p>
              <p>None of the nine convicted can be named.</p>
              <p>The
              state government lodged the appeal against the leniency of the
              sentences despite a government prosecutor arguing against jail terms
              during the original sentence hearings. That prosecutor has since
              resigned.</p>

              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>

In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="color: #0066cc;">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>

              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned.

              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>

              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>

These repercussions have its causes and effects. Bringing more liability to youths and youngters who patronise drinking areas in big groups. They get more boisterous and seemed more prone to start fights then say, middle aged drinkers? (maybe 35yrs and above).</p>

              <p><strong>SINGAPORE:</strong> A strain of dengue new to Singapore is <span style="color: #ff0000;">impeding efforts to stem the spread of the mosquito-borne disease that has infected hundreds in the affluent city-state</span> this year, a top health official said Thursday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said the <span style="color: #ff0000;">current rise in infections</span>, including a <span style="color: #ff0000;">record 210 cases last week</span> and <span style="color: #ff0000;">one fatality</span>, evoked memories of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">2005 epidemic that killed 25 in the tropical island-nation of 4.5 million</span>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #ff0000;">I'm quite worried about the dengue trend,"</span> Khaw told reporters on the sidelines of an infectious diseases exhibition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Authorities said earlier this week that Singapore recorded a nearly <span style="color: #ff0000;">50 percent increase in dengue infections in the first 4-1/2 months of this year compared to the same period in 2006.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dengue cases reported from the start of January to May 12 rose to <span style="color: #ff0000;">1,488 — up from 993 in the corresponding period last year</span>, the Health Ministry said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The dengue virus now predominant in Singapore is believed to be the same as in neighboring Indonesia, and is different from the main active strain in Singapore over the past few years, according to local media reports.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those previously infected with other types of dengue are not immune, and may even face a higher risk of complications when infected with a different strain, The Straits Times newspaper said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Health officials have been combing public housing estates in search of mosquito breeding sites. Dengue-carrying insects can breed in tiny pools of water found in flower pots, discarded bottles or cans, or old tires.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Health Ministry said the recent spike in infections is likely due to warmer weather during this period of the year, which is conducive for breeding mosquitoes and the spread of dengue.</p>

              <h2><span style="color: #0000ff;">Dengue Outbreak Means Sagging Fortunes for Singapore Bustlines</span></h2>
              <p> </p>
              <div>My adopted long-term home, Singapore, is having its worst outbreak of mosquito-borne dengue fever in recent memory according to an AFP <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-09/11/content_476784.htm"><span style="color: #0000ff;">article</span></a> carried in Voice-of-the-State, <em>China Daily</em>. Don't underestimate what a big deal this is for Singapore, which invests huge amount of effort into mosquito control and which prides itself on being the one Southeast Asian nation that you would actually consider raising your children in. This is being called the biggest health crisis in Singapore since SARS. That's really saying something, because I remember SARS in Singapore, and it was a spooky and weird time. Medical facilities are being pushed to their limits, and the nation is being called upon to make the sacrifices that you would expect in times of severe hardship:<br></div>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">By one estimate, over 100 new cases per day are now being reported, and since there is no effective vaccine against the virus, mosquito eradication is the only means of containing it.<br><br>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan has gone to the extent of urging Singaporeans to postpone breast enlargement and other forms of non-critical surgery to ease the load on public hospitals in Singapore, where foreigners regularly go for sophisticated operations.</span></p>

              <p>yes they have corrected the mistakes.But why this happen in the first place?</p>
              <p>The penalty to the rapiests in the first gang rape to the poor girl</p>
              <p>cant deter the rapists to strike again,to the same girl.</p>
              <p>i cant remember how many involved in the 2 gang rape.</p>
              <p>u have to read my old postings that  some rapistes</p>

              <p>Rapists just tell the public:What can u do with me even i get convicted?</p>
              <p>Just short jail and probabtions.</p>
              <p>Yes , Brisbane barrister Peter Davis SC has reviewed 71 sexual assualted cases</p>
              <p>,incluing this case.The report has been released.</p>
              <blockquote>

              </blockquote>
              <p>But look at the Appeal Judge comments:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"In a case where, without compelling and articulated reasons, an adult
                  who was 25 years of age is sentenced on the same footing as a
                  13-year-old boy - in terms of criminal responsibility - for raping a
                  10-year old girl, the lack of disparity bespeaks an error of some

              <p>Do you think that gang rapist will get it easy? He won't . If he get released , he might get hammered in the community. And where he is now, he probably have to watch himself carefully because prisons are a danger zone to rapists. And best of all , they are appealing against him being released.</p>

              <p>despite this being prob for many years</p>
              <p>SG maid abuse still dunt can solve</p>
              <p>where is the justice systems?</p>
              <p>if this is first world country, is this losing the heart of the people?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore was confronted with the horrible spectacle of the worst maid abuse case in its history.</span></span> </strong></p>
              <p><span><strong>Muawanatul Chasanah was for nine months regularly starved, whipped, punched, slapped, kicked, jabbed with sharp objects and scalded with hot water by her employer, Ng Hua Chye. She eventually died after a severe beating on Dec 2 last year. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>At her death, the 19-year-old girl - who was 50 kg when she arrived in Singapore - weighed only 36 kg and had more than 200 injuries on her body. Ng was originally accused of murder but the charge was changed to manslaughter. Last week, he was sentenced to 18 years and six months in jail and six strokes of the cane. Has the matter ended there? Most people assume so. They can't be more wrong.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Ng has been found guilty, but he couldn't have carried out his deeds without the tacit approval, or at least inaction, of other parties.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Let's consider some facts:</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Ng's wife and sister were present at many of the beatings and did nothing to stop him.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Foreign maids are required to go for six-monthly checks for pregnancy, VDRL and HIV. During her nine months of torture, Ms Chasanah had two check-ups. Though her physical condition and injuries clearly showed she was in deep distress, no alarm was raised by the doctors and nurses.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Going by a guidebook for employers produced by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), it has assumed that heavy punishment, along with an appeal that such action will 'undermine Singapore's effort to be a gracious society', is sufficient to check abuses.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>In fact, MOM doesn't seem to believe maids could actually die from abuse in Singapore. Its guidebook laid out 11 types of abuses ranging from rape to causing bodily harm to criminal intimidation to wrongful confinement. Death was not mentioned.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Ms Chasanah may not be the first to die of abuse. There have been instances of maids jumping to their death, some of which could be linked to severe physical and psychological ill-treatment by employers.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Maids seem uninformed of their basic rights as residents of Singapore, such as protection by the police. Many maids come from a background which carries with it a natural fear that the police are working for the rich, and are reluctant to seek their protection even when the opportunity presents itself.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Concerned neighbours have become the only check against abuses for some maids. It was Ms Chasanah's bad luck that Ng's neighbours either didn't know or didn't care. A Mr Neo told the <em>Straits Times </em>that even if he knew, he wouldn't report to the police. 'It's not my business. He (Ng) can do what he wants, that's his problem. And anyway, God can see,' he was quoted as saying.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>There's a good chance Ms Chasanah's family won't get a cent from insurance. Employers are required to buy a minimum $10,000 insurance for maids, benefiting herself or her next of kin. But this is meant only for accidents in the course of work that led to death or disability. Insurance agents told BT this probably won't apply in the case of Ms Chasanah.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>So, is the matter of Ms Chasanah closed?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>The answer should be obvious. Two courses of action must be pursued. The first is to see whether there are other parties to be punished for helping and abetting the wrongdoing.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>This would deter others who can, but do not, help the victim. The second is to remedy the system to prevent similar abuses in the future. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>And if Singapore is indeed serious about being a gracious society, there's also a third course: do something for Ms Chasanah's family. Punishment is the job of the state and all eyes will be on the public prosecutor to see whether other parties involved in Ms Chasanah's abuse and death will be charged. But this could take some time.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Meanwhile, some steps could be taken immediately to protect maids. For instance, the government can make it mandatory for doctors and nurses who conduct regular check-ups to ask specifically whether they have been hit or beaten and to identify maids in distress and report the cases to the police. Agents could also be required to make regular checks on maids placed by them. Any agent whose placements show a high number of abuses should have his licence revoked.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Such measures are, of course, not foolproof. Abuses will continue, no matter what the government does. Some maids, who owe their agents vast sums (at least to them), might be too scared to complain. But at least the government would be doing something on prevention. Given the nature of Singaporeans, this very fact should go a long way to reduce maid abuse. Singapore, it has been said, is little more than groups of people tied together by economic interest. The government is trying hard to change this impression. Ms Chasanah's case presents a perfect chance.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>To show how a gracious society should behave, the government can set up a fund - perhaps draw upon the half-a-billion dollars of maid levies it collects every year - to compensate abused maids and their families. It need not be a large sum, as abuse cases are not common. But at least victims, such as the family of Ms Chasanah, now deprived of a daughter and a breadwinner, will be able to get something out of the tragedy. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>After all, Singapore has failed Ms Chasanah. Isn't it only right, now, for the country to give something back to her loved ones, over and above punishing her tormentor?</strong></span></p>

              <p>SINGAPORE
              still falls short of international standards to fight human
              trafficking, despite recently amending the Penal Code so those who
              sexually exploit minors overseas - as well as child-sex tour organisers
              and promoters - can be jailed. Based on the US State Department's
              annual Trafficking In Persons Report released recently, Singapore is
              among 70 nations placed in 'Tier 2', alongside countries like Cambodia
              and Thailand</p>
