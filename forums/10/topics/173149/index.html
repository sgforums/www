            <div class='col-md body'>Ideal organization for Election 2006- Singapore.<br>.<br>1)	Return to the original concept of GRCs- (to maintain social harmony through a 25% representation of minority races).<br>-	Remember the principle of meritocracy is not to deprive the Â‘poor with good ideasÂ’, having &gt;4member-GRCs is akin to turning elections2006 into a Â‘High stakes GambleÂ’- that only favors Â‘high stakes capable playersÂ’- ie.PAP (current situation).<br>-	It is thus truth- that SG is only a good place to stay if you are Rich and Powerful, -- the small and ordinary-u have been forgotten.<br>-	Please do not fool around with the lives of SGporeans- we have families and daily needs- we need every choice possible to select leaders whom we think will serve us well. We need to be given more options wrt the planning of our countryÂ’s future.<br>-	PAP and us know that continuing the GRC system of elections will make it continually difficult for smaller parties/ independents to succeed, only PAP has the large membership rates and good financing to participate in as many GRCs as prescribed- all independents will then have to stand in single seat constituencies [SSC]- over participation in SSC will result in the consequent dilution of opposition votes &amp; this will favour the PAP- so opposition is disadvantaged on ALL fronts.- smart PAP engineering but bad for the future of SG.<br>-	Last minute election boundary revelations only serve to confuse the voter and opposition candidates further- giving opposition political parties little time to plan/ announce their election plans/ promises. - As a citizen, it seems that my constituency is being changed to suite the needs of the PAP- the loss of voting rights because of opposition non-participation for a/m reasons only adds to my misery.<br>-	PAP has done well in the past- but that is no guarantee about the future- and the lack of opposition consensus- will hurt SGpore eventually- we need a more mature governance.<br>-	And this prejudice has existed since 1988- a dishonesty that will perpetuate through society- people learn from their leaders- so I wouldnÂ’t be surprised if the average SGporean might scheme, cheat and swindle- learning by the example- of the ruling elite!<br>-	Example: Enron, NKF? (http://happycitizen.blogspot.com/2005/12/only-10-cents-per-dollar-donated-goes.html)<br>In short:<br>-	Earlier announcement of election boundaries the better (stop gerrymandering!)- - so SGporeans can have a decent access and wider choice of views/ ideals of their potential leaders/ be heard.<br>-	2/3 of SG can be 4member GRC, the other 1/3-SSCs. (my rough estimate).<br>-	DO NOT out place individual creativity just for the sake of PAP elitism.<br>.<br>.<br>2)	Discuss mature and relevant rally issues;<br>-	Stop the illicit use of National funds for the selective benefit PAP supporters. National funds are the contributions of ALL SGporeans; so voterÂ’s choice should NOT deprive them the rightful use of such funds. By linking estate upgrading to party support- PAP has effectively manipulated voterÂ’s rights for their personal party gain (a blatant act of bullying the voter)- use of such funds should in future lie with the govt in discussion with MPs and the access to such funds should NOT be used as an election carrot (concept: how to utilize  vs the Â‘rightÂ’ to utilize).<br>-	I feel embarrassed for the 70odd% of voters who might have voted PAP for personal benefit instead of collective good of the country- these are myopic people.<br>-	Topics IÂ’d like discussed incl:<br>-	The worldÂ’s 3rd lowest  birth rate (http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html)Â…,<br>-	The economy<br>-	The poor/ jobless in SG http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/poverty.html<br>-	High health care costs.<br>-	Terrorism- thoughts and concepts- the more SGporeans get swept aside- the more depressed and ignored folks there are around- some will jump down fr Swiss hotel, some will mess up MRT tracks, , the worst are those way laid by radical terrorist (and who feel betrayed enough)- these are the worst situations- they blow them selves in Swiss hotel/ Suntec/ IR [lost all his $$]- this cannot be good for the future of SG (no way immigration can possibly stop the trafficking of 1 kg high explosive- with dire consequence!)- so dear PAP- for the good of all SGpore- please resolve poverty issues- and keep all SGporeans observant and happyÂ…<br>.<br>-	IKEA: Â‘U donÂ’t have to be rich to be clever  [/happy]Â’<br>-	Â‘Make room for ideasÂ’<br><br>Happy.<br><br></div>

But the GRCs help to promote racial harmony by getting members of the other races to participate in the politics.<br><br>PAP attracted people because it is multi-racial. That was the basis when senior Lee started the party. And it still is the basis.<br><br>There are definitely ways to improve the situation. One of them is to remove the GRCs. But the problem is will PAP approve of this? The PAP will only approve if the other races participate. What if after removing the other races no longer participate?</div>
