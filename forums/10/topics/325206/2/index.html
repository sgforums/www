              <p>A lot of it is just misplaced anger and frustration at our own government for selling us out.</p>
              <p>Bringing in real talents is fine, if they had put in proper guidelines and policies to protect the citizens first.   As it is, they are throwing out the red carpet to just about any and every foreigner even if there are locals who are able and willing to do the job.</p>
              <p>All this does is surpress our wages in an ever increasing inflation period.  It also makes our job security vanish when our expenses are climbing (housing, gst, erp, etc, etc, etc...).</p>
              <p>Maybe a hollow comment here, but don't take the hostility as a personal attack.</p>
