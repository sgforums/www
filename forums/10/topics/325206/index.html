              <td class="georgia11 padcell8" colspan="2">I REFER to the lively Forum discussion about home ownership in Singapore. As a new Singapore permanent resident (PR) from India, let me respond this way.
              <p>First, Singapore is the only country with such a high percentage of home owners. Trust me, your home will never be repossessed because of a sub-prime-like crisis.</p>
              <p>In New Delhi, where I came from, government housing is a luxury. Once in two years, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) releases land and builds basic, two- and three-bedroom homes.</p>
              <p>A lottery decides who gets to own the flats. Snaking queues, with hundreds of required documents, no salary or income cap and no cap on the number of flats applied for are a few of the scheme's characteristics. The balloting is fraught with irregularities. Most successful applicants sell the flats almost immediately in the open market for a huge premium.</p>
              <p>My parents in India still live in a rented apartment because they have not been successful in getting a DDA flat and cannot afford expensive private housing. These things happen in India because it does not have a system like the Housing and Development Board's.</p>
              <p>Second, I am 33 years old and live here with my wife and two children. I consider myself well educated, worldly wise and useful to my employers.</p>
              <p>What am I doing in Singapore, leaving my parents, family, friends and comfort zone back home? Why did I strive to become a Singapore PR, and perhaps a citizen in future? I did it because Singapore is safe, dynamic, modern and conducive to a decent livelihood. Most important, the Government promotes harmonious living and equality for all. Many Singaporeans take these virtues for granted. I don't blame them because they probably don't know what it is like elsewhere, including a country like India which may have the world's fastest growing economy, but is fraught with corruption and an unsafe environment and does not have what Singapore has.</p>
              <p>So it pains me when I read letters which say that PRs like me should not be treated well enough. I know we cannot be given the same rights as citizens, but why demand no rights at all?</p>
              <p>Now, this is my country too. There is no turning back. So why can't I buy a flat directly from the HDB? And although I came as a permanent settler, why treat me like an enemy?</p>

              <p>Dear <strong>Amit Nagpal,</strong></p>
              <p>I bid you a warm welcome to our shores and finding our country a nice place to stay and work, very much different from yours.</p>
              <p>The security you enjoyed in our country is provided by hundred thousands of young citizens in various military and civilian units on a daily basis, with much sacrifice and paid, maintained and much honoured by all citizens appreciatively and with pride. But we do not ask that you, a PR to partake in it, yet we will provide you with equal security as a fellow citizen.</p>
              <p>The excellent and comfortable transportation, intelligent civil service and laws, as well as our national public infrastructure, had been paid and maintained by our previous generations as well as current generations, by blood, sweat and toil. But we do not seek that you, a PR, pay a premium over what other fellow citizens would pay.</p>
              <p>I am a chinese, and had shared many a beer and a packet of curry rice and tom yam soup with our foriegn workers at their places of recreation, share a song or two with guitar playing filipinoes in our parks, offered offered many a cup of coffee to China, Thai, Viet young women over their sob stories to find opportunity in Spore, partake in welcoming parties of PR neighbours, and find them no different from me, with only a common aim - to work for prosperity and live in peace within our shores.</p>
              <p>The only difference between you and me is that I was born in this land of my forefathers, who had toil hard to give me what i enjoyed today. Their taxes and votes contributed and ensured that i would have a house over my head, education to have a job, and facillities that would ensure peace and prosperity to our country.</p>
              <p>Their foresighted efforts ensured that my fellow citizens, espacially the young whom would start their own families, would not be without a roof over their heads, even when the price of properties escalates as it would on our little red dot island, and their funds would be use to help offset such rises, for this generation and the next to come.</p>
              <p>To offer you, a PR, their funds, would be a sacrilege to the memory of their honour. You might have contributed to our growth and success, but you are paid for what you agreed to perform, and hold another passport, the son of an ancient civilisation, of heroes and much blood spilt for your continuity over a 4000 year history, yet you chosed to leave the land of your birth to offer what you had benefitted from those heros to another land. This tells much of your allegience to your homeland and your committment to your fellow citizens.</p>
              <p>Your passport entails you to leave anytime and anywhere, but i carry no other passport. I either sink or swim in this land. My committment to this country is total and absolute in every way of my life, as foresworned with honour in our pledge, created by our founding fathers to be sworn with each successive generations. A thousand may leave each year, but 29,000 each year chosed to stay and honour their pledge and contribute to our fellow citizens.</p>
              <p>Give up your passport and swear to our flag, and you will be entitled to the full rights of our citizenship. We make no difference to whether you are black or white, rich or poor, 1st generation sporean or 101st generation sporean. You will be equal in our eyes and our laws, sworn and taken in honour.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>this indian man is not making sense, he is lucky to get a PR to even start with, if it was any other country like Australia, there will be tons of requirements to get even a PR and yet he is demanding these things.</p>
              <p>Remeber he did not get his PR the hard way like in AUS or Canada. And he is enjoying most of the benefits of citizens yet he is asking for more. Listen up no other country is going to give u near close or perfect rights which citizens enjoy.</p>
              <p>If u want to the govt to give u anything u want, please serve your national service, swore your loyalty and allegiance to this country and u can rightfully demand what u want if it is possible. Like someone said, he left his own country to come here,  already given up on your country and the agreement that u made to become a PR, u have to accept and live with  the terms and contract that u signed as a PR.  u have got which is defintely better than what u get in India.  Please appreciate that first.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and the govt are no fools, they will not trust a PR who will one day enjoying the benfits and go back to India with the profits he has made. Locals cant leave but  this man still can.So there should be some sort of balancing act or legislative measure to be put in place from exploitation from occuring. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly by writing such a letter, u are causing disaatisfaction and irking among the local people too. Worst still, if the govt is goign to give u equal rights in landing a HDB home, that will put millions of locals at a disadvantage and what goes around will come around. There will be widespread problems amonst all other problems like the il and food crisis and we dont need u one more to contribute.</p>

              <p>first, they allow the jobs to go, what's stopping them tweaking the housing policy? this unlikely thing can happen when the housing market trends south and hdb gets desperate they are behind their `quota' to deliver their fair share of revenue to the PAP.</p>
