              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Hi,</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I am an Indian
              and have been here for a year now. Applied for my PR sometime last
              week and came across this forum during some random
              googling.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Now, I must say
              that i am quite surprised at the anti-PR tone that a lot of these
              posts are taking. It is a little unfair to club all foreigners into
              the whining-lot category. I know for a fact that I am
              speaking for many out there when I say that citizenship
              is a privileged position. It MUST come with benefits over and
              above those offered to legal tax residents. Government's first
              responsibility is the well being of its citizens and that
              should be its priority.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I, for one, am
              here because I find Singapore to be a more convenient
              place to live in than India. It also feels more like home than
              Europe or USA does. That itself is a huge benefit and anything
              on top of that is a bonus. It is foolish to demand same rights as
              citizens; anyone doing so should first become a citizen and
              commit to national service.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">PRs here are not
              freeloaders. We are grateful to be welcome in this
              country. I am sure there are a few black sheep, but that’s true for
              any community.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Singaporeans are
              very friendly people. I have quite a few local friends and am
              having a great time la</span><span style="font-family: Wingdings; color: black;"><span>J</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">.
              Let’s not make our relationship acrimonious. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Cheers</span></p>

              <p> To reassure you, most of what you think are "anti PR" posts are actually not directed at the PRs themselves but rather on the perceived favouritism that the government places on everything foreign over her citizens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are right when you say that governments have an obligation and responsibility to care for her citizens first and foremost.  However, this is apparently lost on the current leaders who make it a point to think of ways and means to make as much money out of the general population as possible while splurging the money it makes to make the country better for foreigners (note: not singaporeans).  Reasons given for the relaxation of rules and regulations - to attract more foreigners to come stay in Singapore. (note: not because of Singaporeans' wish for more openness)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a PR, you might not feel it.  You might even be tempted to label Singaporeans as a complaining lot, of not appreciating all that Singaporeans have.  All I can say is when you eventually decide to convert to sg citizenship, you will realise what is happening as your kids serve their NS obligations, are not able to enter the local universities due to increase foreign student demand, can't take out your CPF monies when you are 60 or 70 or 80 years old etc and face some of the problems that Singaporeans grapple with everyday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It will be an eye opener for you, I am sure.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
