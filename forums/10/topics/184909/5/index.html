Its because online every one can bea heared. there is freedom of speech and oppinion in a sense as opposed to the overly regulated public forums.<br><br>Its important to understand, that political views and debate is the right of every citizen in a democracy. Now even if these attacks on the goverment are of no truth, it is not the right of a democratically elected government to silence them with the full force of the law. They should defend themselves in a fair arena of debate.<br><br><span style="color: red;">You talk of distortion of truth. Does that mean u accept the ruling part's truth as the actual truth. We as citizens have a right to decide what truths we wanna believe in. It ur freedom of oppinion that is at the core of the idea of democracy. </span><br><br>Its important that we have available to us a gamut of ideas. Only then can we choose the one that fits us best.<br><br>To be told what to think seems really communist/authoratarian/dictatorish/monarchish.<br><br>I say we tell the goverment waht to do.. and not the other way around.<br><br>is it not irrelevent to have a party in power for so long?<br><br>Restructureing is needed.

            <div class='col-md body'>You know, all this new ruling or law over podcasting, blogging, and the internet just because of election, makes PAP look very INSECURE.<br><br>I mean look, what's the point of allowing for oppositions when you allow the oppositions NO other avenues of reaching out to the public? You might as well forget about allowing for opposition parties to exist! Forget about GE.<br><br>If there's so much restrictions, forget about election.<br><br>Just stay in power permanently.<br><br>After all , who is there to object or even protest???<br><br>Only that we will keep loosing capable citizens to other countries.. that's all.

            <div class='col-md body'>caught snippets of new PAP candidates in action over the last one or two days.  have some comments ...<br><br>there was this malay, lady doctor who supported the ban of political discussions on the Internet saying that people do not understand the long term implications of such political discussions.  this to me is the same haughtiness that the PAP has always exhibited, telling us they know better and that we're stupid.  this is the kind of govt i do not want because if they really could see better than us, they would've foreseen the grave political consequences of Shin corporation, they would've done things differently in Suzhou, they would not have waited till today to start the R&amp;D engine ... they're really no different from us, yet they act as though they're superior.<br><br>i think we shouldn't be overly concerned with the pedigree of candidates.  we're not choosing pet dogs for goodness sake.<br><br>there was this lawyer candidate who questioned the purpose of having a stronger alternative voice.  an alternative to what he says?  what are the things that needs to be changed he asked?<br><br>1.  our economy is in bad shape ever since the turn of the millenium.  our stewards haven't been doing a good job.  we need more people with no relationship whatsoever with the steward to come on board to scrutinise the steward's choices and decisions and make sure he is not steering us towards the rocks.<br><br>2.  the casino saga has shown us that whatever diversity of opinions the PAP may breed within itself, at the end of the day, everyone listens to the captain.  that is why we need more opposition so that in the event of another issue of national importance there can be more voices that reflect our wishes rather than those of any single entity.<br><br>3.  the NKF saga may simply be the tip of the ice berg.  as a member of the white team, how would we know that the lawyer would effortlessly dig out anything that would stain their white shirts?  only another person, not wearing a white shirt would have no qualms digging out any possible dirt underneath those white shirts.<br><br>there are many more and unless the lawyer hasn't been in touch with the ground, he should know better.<br><br>finally just want to make comment about the comment about opposition not making enough contributions in parliament.  that is the exact same thing i feel about PAP candidates.  during the casino saga, there were only one PAP candidate and one NMP i was impressed with.  Loh Meng See and Eunice Olsen.  they really spoke with conviction, from the bottom of their hearts without fear.  apart from these two, i think Wang Kai Yuen is also pretty vocal too in speaking up for the people.  other than these handful, the majority of the 70 plus PAP candidates sound more like parrots or boot lickers to me.</div>
