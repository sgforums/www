Because, isnt it true that there is no point if suggestions are taken in - but nothing done about them? Do people expect something to come out from their views? Or are they just blowing hot air for the hell of it.<br></strong><br><br>as long as we can correct mistaken perceptions, put a balance to govt rhetoric and contribute to the awareness of the general public, we have done some good.<br><br><strong><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Done intelligently with proper knowledge, research and a well rounded viewpoint, it can benefit a country. BUT the thing is, most complaints and ramblings are done out of boredom and childish frustration, and i find they tend to do more harm than any real good.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Just look at the majority of the forums topic in your Straits Times today. The quality is appaling. That is only one example. You may say that it is the result of the over-control of the government in reining in our views and expressions, but what i will say is that - people first need to start giving valuable, insightful and well-thought out views, only then will the government see that there is some good trains of thought out there. Perhaps then, political discourse will not be viewed with such aversion.<br></strong><br><br>i'm alright with the quality of forum posts and i do not see them as chidish.  also, when people point out things that they see wrong, we should not regard them as complaints.  if the govt can simply acknowledge their mistakes, i'm sure the 'ramblings' would simply fizzle out and we can move on to focusing on the solutions to those problems.  much like the japanese who refuse to admit their past and so the chinese and koreans would keep reminding them of their past.<br><br><strong><br>i still hold onto my stand that the Thai people did not make a good decision in the ousting of Thaksin. Read the artical on Thanksin in this month's Economist magazine to get an idea of why. Btw, he did not "forget" the concerns of his people. He knew exactly what he was doing - it was an opportunity to make money. And right now singapore is at the bad end of the deal (ie we've lost money!!! Haha.) Anyway. This is a real life example of the action of "people power". We'll see how this one goes. Although indonesia should already be a great example after Suharto.<br></strong><br><br>will try and get hold of the magazine.  he forgot in the sense that a nation's pride can be a whole lot more precious than money.  why do you think Hitler could command the respect of all Germany?  because he restored their sense of national pride.<br><br>i don't think people power is entirely bad.  no one wants conflict or confrontation but when you push the limits of tolerance it will erupt.<br><br><strong><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>why choose countries like india? why not choose countries like USA, switzerland, finland, australia? compared to these countries how much luckier can we get? teritary education in germany is free. here, they're jacking up fees year after year, so should i count myself unlucky instead?<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This is exactly the kind of mentality that i'm talking about - the idea that theres so much lacking in singapore that people feel the need to whine. Oh and nothing is ever "free". Check the tax rates if you think so. Btw, the USA isnt much better. Ever been to lower Manhattan? Or the Bronx. Or or or... choose your pick, but please see that we are alot better off than majority of the countries in the world in terms of safety, education and standard of living. i know i sound so damn cliche and cheesy, but its true.<br></strong><br><br>it is not whining.  it is merely an example to show you that we're not as 'lucky' as you say we are.  their tax rates may be higher but so are their wages, that more than make up for their higher taxes.  i debated this with someone here recently, even used his figures to show him why.  you can check that out.<br><br>no country is perfect, if we were to compare, there would always be things that we lose out and things we're better at.  US may not be as safe but their standard of living is higher and their university education is better (even our MM wants his grandchildren to go to US universities).<br><br><strong><br>Injustice, wrong-doing? Oh i've never mentioned anything at all about such unfairness, my friend. Please do not assume or put words into my post. i was referring to "nit-pickers" as you will definetely see in my original post, people who speak up for things that they know nothing logistically about.<br></strong><br><br>you have chosen to see those who spoke up as 'spoilt'.  i see them as speaking up for injustice and wrong doing.  therefore from my point of view, you have branded those who spoke up, be it for injustice or wrong doing as 'spoilt'.<br><br>maybe we are not refering to the same examples.  could you give examples of 'nit-pickers', or 'know nothings'?<br><br><strong><br>And i dont understand why i cant compare our two nations. Right after WW2, we were on the same page, werent we?<br></strong><br><br>we cannot compare the two nations because cambodia never had peace until recently.  the pol pot regime massacres, invasion by vietnam, subsequent infighting between khmer rouge and other insurgents ... so even though we were on the same page right are WW2, war continued to ravage their country while we were blessed with peace.<br><br>if you want to compare, compare with countries that had relative peace like ours.<br><br><strong><br>i doubt the ability of the people to form a new government that can be as successful as previous.<br></strong><br><br>you look at the mess in taiwan's govt and you look at how they're doing, as successful if not more so.  you look at hong kong, so laissez faire yet so successful too.  whether it is the same govt or a different one, as long as it doesn't impede the good work of its people, the people's drive and ingenuity will ensure that the country stays on top.<br></blockquote></div>

I'd happily admit that I play the part of "mental masturbator" sometimes, when I see something that particularly irks me (search for "would you fight for Singapore if ....
