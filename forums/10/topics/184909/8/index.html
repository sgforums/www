            <div class='col-md body'>To SG,LauBaiXing: Your post of questions means nothing. i can come up with a list twice as long as yours for every single damn country in the world. You think only singapore is politically unfair?!<br><br>Snow Leopard:<br><br><blockquote>you're saying freedom of speech and the right to exert our wishes isn't achievable in any society?</blockquote>i think i may have been misunderstood. i need to clarify myself (my previous post was hurried, i was rushing it after work). i meant to say my first line in response to certain peoples who seem to think that they are more capable in running singapore than the present government. i should have quoted. Apologies. My intention is not to fuck freedom of speech, hell, i wholly support our generation in exercising their rights and intellects to think for themselves. But i am questioning if it is possible to have a well-rounded, wealthy society with a total lax in the area of such. <strong>At what point do the views of people turn from suggestions into demands?</strong> Because, isnt it true that there is no point if suggestions are taken in - but nothing done about them? Do people expect something to come out from their views? Or are they just blowing hot air for the hell of it.<br><br>Listen: i think its all fine and perfectly okay if people are able to voice whatever is on their minds and such. What i am wary of is when people, who are living perfectly healthy lives try to better things around them. Ie, "PEOPLE POWER" as it is known in indonesia. It may all be in good heart, but with the lack of knowledge in the complexities of such consecution, such demands can and will cause damage.<br><br>Ok i know what the rebuttal will be. "Why let such fear come in the way of people's rights and their views?" That is why i said,<br><br><blockquote>Done intelligently with proper knowledge, research and a well rounded viewpoint, it can benefit a country. BUT the thing is, most complaints and ramblings are done out of boredom and childish frustration, and i find they tend to do more harm than any real good. </blockquote>Just look at the majority of the forums topic in your Straits Times today. The quality is appaling. That is only one example. You may say that it is the result of the over-control of the government in reining in our views and expressions, but what i will say is that - people first need to start giving valuable, insightful and well-thought out views, only then will the government see that there is some good trains of thought out there. Perhaps then, political discourse will not be viewed with such aversion.<br><br><blockquote>the same can be said about Thaksin, of how he forgot that, at the end of the day, he needs to answer to the needs of the people. the more successful he became, the more carried away he became so much so that he forgot the concerns of his people and sold away the symbol of their national pride.</blockquote>i still hold onto my stand that the Thai people did not make a good decision in the ousting of Thaksin. Read the artical on Thanksin in this month's Economist magazine to get an idea of why. Btw, he did not "forget" the concerns of his people. He knew exactly what he was doing - it was an opportunity to make money. And right now singapore is at the bad end of the deal (ie we've lost money!!! Haha.) Anyway. This is a real life example of the action of "people power". We'll see how this one goes. Although indonesia should already be a great example after Suharto.<br><br><blockquote>the same can be said about our leaders achievements. i always hear people say that they built this country, they gave us economic prosperity. but did they achieve these all by themselves? without the hardwork of us people, what could they have built? what prosperity would we have had? </blockquote>i think we can call even on this one.<br><br><blockquote>why choose countries like india? why not choose countries like USA, switzerland, finland, australia? compared to these countries how much luckier can we get? teritary education in germany is free. here, they're jacking up fees year after year, so should i count myself unlucky instead?</blockquote>This is exactly the kind of mentality that i'm talking about - the idea that theres so much lacking in singapore that people feel the need to whine. Oh and nothing is ever "free". Check the tax rates if you think so. Btw, the USA isnt much better. Ever been to lower Manhattan? Or the Bronx. Or or or... choose your pick, but please see that we are alot better off than majority of the countries in the world in terms of safety, education and standard of living. i know i sound so damn cliche and cheesy, but its true.<br><br><blockquote>what right do you have to brand individuals who speak up for injustice or wrong doing as being 'spoilt'? you belittle our concerns and demonstrate ignorance and haughtiness. there are certainly things we appreciate. but if these things can buy our conscience or shut us up then surely we must be spineless creatures.</blockquote>Injustice, wrong-doing? Oh i've never mentioned anything at all about such unfairness, my friend. Please do not assume or put words into my post. i was referring to "nit-pickers" as you will definetely see in my original post, people who speak up for things that they know nothing logistically about.<br><br>You know, i think what got me upset the most was that reading through the thread, people seem dissatisfied and upset at the government, but for what logical reasons i do not know. The fact that blogs such as http://singabloodypore.blogspot.com/ exist already show that the government isnt as totalitarian as you have claimed. Anyways i apologise if i was unclear in my first post. It was hurried, angst-ridden and not very concise.<br><br><blockquote>Your arguments are all focused on 3rd World nations, sounds so much like a typical piece that is trying to scare the unwashed of Singapore about a government led by any other party.<br><br>What a hoot.</blockquote>Oh, but if you are soooo upset with our present government, why not hold a revolution? If you believe soooo much in people power? Then go form your own government with people who share your ideas via "pure democracy" (if it exists), then come back to me and let me know how your country is currently doing, if it is any better than "3rd World Nations". Ps: How do you think 3rd World Nations got like that in the first place?<br><br>Oh and with reference to Cambodia, it was a rich nation. i know because i was recently there, and of course i have spoken about their history with the locals. It may not have been SUPER DUPER MEGA RICH but they were self-sufficent and a business center. And i dont understand why i cant compare our two nations. Right after WW2, we were on the same page, werent we? And <strong>Atobe</strong>, as for South Africa, Thabo Mbeki is the president, yes? Did you know that he did not win the elections fairly? And that his cabinet is highly corrupted?<br><br><blockquote>This is super selfishness in you if you said "no matter how corrupted or authoritive or dogmatic it may be" </blockquote>Yes i am ready to discuss with an open mind. i know i am taking the difficult stand here, but i am ready to take it on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (Mind you, i do share alot of similar views with you guys.) Oh and for that particular line, i meant that if the country is still successful, the people taken care of, are happy and well fed, living comfortably... i doubt the ability of the people to form a new government that can be as successful as previous.<br><br>Just to say. i am not fanatically pro-singapore government, but i am highly appreciative of what they have done with singapore. i am against crackdowns on the views of singaporeans. If i did not believe in having freedom of speech and views, i wouldnt even be posting this :p i know the singapore government isnt right in everything, (they tend to make alot of investment mistakes too), and at some times they can be overly paranoid too. (Like i think the jail term for that guy whatshisname for showing contempt towards the court and "insulting" our judical system may have been abit harsh.) Anyway. i hope this post is more concise, i apologise for the previous unclear, angst-ridden one.</div>
