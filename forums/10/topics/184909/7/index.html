Like skills development fund that already exists? How will that help those who cannot work? The devil is in the details....the armchair politicians here have to think more deeply than they have so far..<br><br>The easy money given out in the progress package is an election ploy..I think that is clear. But for all it's worth, they do give out more to those who are poorer.<br><br>Car pool? It will never work in Singapore. Go ask Singaporeans if they will share a car with a stranger. However, I do not see why there is a need for COE if we already have ERP to regulate the usage of cars on the road. Because the cost of car ownership is so high, Singaporeans would pay the ERP since they already have incurred high capital costs buying the car.<br><br>People can criticise the government and give their alternative ideas. That's fine but I do not see any balance in the arguments presented and there is a tendency to disparage those who support government policies.

To expect people with differing comments to have to register a political party just to criticise, is laughable and simply downright presumptious. There is no place for elitist politics, same as there is no place of only parochial politics to exist by itself.We need both types to represent all spectrums of the populace.<br><br>Inclusive nation means embracing all kinds of political commentary, from the MP all the way down to how we as men in the street discuss and comment on things that affect the nation.<br><br>Hey, at least we care enough to open our mouths and sound off. Apathy is so much worse.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
