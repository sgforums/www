            <div class='col-md body'>For a govt that prides itself on setting the standards, they seem cowed in fear over the unrelenting spread of information over a source they have almost no control over - the internet.<br><br>For one, the statement made by Dr Balaji Sadasivan, while typical of the manner in which our MPs never give direct and specific views, is simply <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;"><strong>too general. </strong></span></span><br><br>Under what conditions will a comment or statement on the internet be considered 'POLITICAL'? Do we have any indication what kind of remarks will lead to persecution? <strong><span style="color: darkred;">Yes, we have SOME VAGUE impression that a certain KIND of remark will land us a verbal warning. But what exactly constitutes unlawful remarks? </span></strong><br><br>In a sea of comments, the govt should take the lead and DEFINE these so-called obscure OB markers (to coin PM LHL's phrase). This streamlines all misconceptions about what can and cannot be spoken and ensures the transparency of free speech on the internet, especially in relation to the govt.<br><br>Yet our govt is visibly RELUCTANT to take this step, probably worried that they may end up outmanoeuvred by some dissident factions who continuously subject the govt to a tirade of criticisms without infringing on the law.<br><br>To that end, they prefer the definition of the 'OB Marker' to REMAIN OBSCURE, subject to their interpretation and enforcement<span style="color: brown;"></span><strong>. I don't expect our 'honest' and 'transparent' govt aka the ruling party to bother addressing this issue. They will prefer to remain vague and indirect, just like all their new so-claimed 'non-conformists' election candidates. </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If government can lift the controls on the press and media, then what it says about the need to control politicising in the internet will be seen as fair comment and supportable by the people.<br><br>If government on its part still cannot change and only want to gerrymander with one-sided media look-good presentations of old draconian policies and control freedoms of expressions and participations then it is taking the citizens for granted and not acknowing existence of problems as posted by many in the net.<br><br>If government wants to have more people taking part in political renewal, it must be prepared to loosen up to allow people to speak and write so that all the civil servants and ministers who are not doing their jobs properly will be scrutinized and all the existing problems properly solved based on free flow of objective and accountable information.<br><br>Which is the better alternative - controls and more restrictions or opening up to all citizens to give a better chance to get solved without planting the time bomb for future destruction.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's the party behind the government machinery. The machinery is a tool that can instil progress or hinder discourse.<br><br>Which is why, we need a strong society that keeps an eye out for such things to ensure our political culture does not go this way anymore than need be.In the end, it all boils down to whether Singaporeans give a f**king damn about their future and whether they want to live under a state which loves being grey and vague.<br><br>The power lies with the one doing the interpretation, which naturally, they won't want to clearly delineate for fear of groups who can and are smarter in outwitting those rules.The challenge is how to produce the next generation of Singaporeans who, when in power, reject the implementation of such issues, which has an adverse impact on the macro-political space and growth of discourse in Singapore.<br><br>We want a more liberal and socially conscious Singapore, a real nation, not a corporation masquerading as one.</div>
