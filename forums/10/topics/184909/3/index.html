            <div class='col-md body'>Although Vague law are hard to interpret but such law does not immediately means giving a plaintiff a winning verdict should the matter be hailed to court. It is afterall, dependent on the circumstances and nature of the offence in our independent judicary. Time and court fees are heavy consideration too.<br><br>Instead, in my opinion, vague law does serve its purpose by reminding any person who intend to express views especially of national concern over the internet to be socially responsible especially such comments are accessible to the general public.<br><br>Another point of issue is that, what is 'acceptable' comment are hard to define. So in here we are faced with two extreme scenerios. Free speech or No speech, either which may result in discontentment among its citizens. Hence, vague law may seem proper after all.

So in here we are faced with two extreme scenerios. Free speech or No speech, either which may result in discontentment among its citizens. Hence, vague law may seem proper after all.

Just what 'RESPONSIBILITY' have been well-displayed in regards to NATIONAL CONCERNS...?<br><br>May I bring to YOUR UNDERSTANDING that 'FREE SPEECH' and 'NO FREE SPEECH' are NEVER 2 EXTREMES by THEIR OWN NATURES... You think SINGAPOREANS don't wanna worry more about their bread issues...? About how to BETTER their LIVES....?<br><br>'FREE SPEECH' has BECOME an EXTREME ISSUE because PEOPLE ARE PRESSED INTO IT.... Haven't you notice by now how majority of our income is hardly overcoming our expenses...? It's just a way of dangling the carrot in front of the donkey...
