              <p><br>Underlying the uprising in Egypt and
                  Tunisia is a growing global crisis due to soaring food prices and
                  unemployment. Roughly 40% of Egyptians struggle at poverty
                  levels of under $2 per day. Food price inflation in Egypt
                  is currently at 17% yearly. In poor countries, <a class="articlelink" href="http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2008/1000826/index.html">60-80%</a> of people's incomes go to food, compared to 10-20% in industrial countries. An increase of a dollar in the cost of food can mean starvation for people
                  in Egypt and other poor countries.</p>
              <p>Once, food was considered a poor speculative
                  investment but that changed with the development of ETFs
                  (exchange-traded funds) and other financial innovations.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the first place millions of americans are suffering under poverty and those dumbarses up there in mega banks like goldman saches are sucking up funds by the billions whilst firing half the company when they 'feel' like it. they underpay the whole company for their own villas and stuckup wiveys. USA is in the state she is in now because of how the ppl at the top are too greedy, too complacent and to lazy to progress and instead just sleep like pigs and line their own pockets. the average american barely earns enough to support himself and his family; the average goldman sachs boss earns billions a year, regardless of how bad the company is doing. annual million dollar retreats for the top ppl in the company despite a downturn in performance. explain that.</div>
