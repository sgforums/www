But I also happen to notice that the provisions don't just provide for the government to appoint the Chief Elector, but include other people such as the opposition and the President. So I suppose there is more objectivity in that sense?</blockquote>Chief Elector is a good suggestion. Let there be a key constitutional position to help safeguard the election and take the government's hand off the whole dirty game of gerrymandering the election process.<br><br><blockquote>2) Are you mixing up economics with politics?</blockquote>Politics and economics are intertwined and cannot be separated. Good corporate governance is good for good politics and good economics.<br><br><blockquote>3) Guess so; or perhaps it is the Hierarchy itself. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.</blockquote>The American's and Western democracy has worked well so far on the basis of check and balance to prevent absolute power which has taken deep root in our Island.<br><br><blockquote>I wonder why this thread is being ignored... it seems pretty interesting to me...</blockquote>Singaporeans have been brainwashed into believing almost anything the leaders have been assuming but were not working. That will take quite some time to change.</div>

I don't understand your second point though. For the third point, people "usurp" roles all the time in Acts; I read a good deal before writing this "Bill" out. And yes and no, I am suggesting and not suggesting that a new pillar be built into the Constitution. Yes, in the sense that there is are new roles established in the sense of the Chief Elector and the Chief Registrar, and no in the sense that most of the Act is basically a government reshuffling; the only new agency introduced is the RCD, which can hardly be considered a new branch of govt. RCD is more like an appendage or extension of ROS. PARAS is upposed to provide a means to ensure the integrity of the role of President and of elections and feedback in general.<br><br>At the same time, PARAS is constructed in a way to make it palatable to the authorities. In many areas where it could be more drastic in its measures, it isn't. We need to make incremental changes, since the nature of the govt is still very conservative.</div>
