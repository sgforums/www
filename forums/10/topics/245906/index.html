            <div class='col-md body'>This is a true case i met in my hdb flat! I know this China girl who work in  factory as an Setup operator.She told me her husband also work here but left back to China while she continue to stay here to work.If i am not wrong, she told me she stayed in Singapore for the past 7yrs.And both of them brought a house here.She pay by installment.She apply for the citizenship and was granted.I was so surprise as she's only a setup operator.And worst of all is she left Singapore for China just last week.One of her fren told me she apply for a 2yr visa and went back China to stay.She will come back after 2 yrs time but will return again.I still remember very clearly what she told me before she left for China, she said.. Singapore is so small and nothing to like about.She still dare to claim that China is better off then our small little Island.She just treat here as a earning base so that she can earn enough and stay in China.And because of the loophole here, she still can continue to have Singapore red i.c while she stay back in China.Now her house was rented out for 1200k to a family.This is a true story i met and i did not make it up.<br>The reason i told this is because i find it quite funny how come they can get red i.c so easily?What is our citeria for them to get red i.c?And they can have the priviledge of going back home and also staying here while how about us?<br>Is the government trying to bring in more China people here so that the locals can be replaces by them?To win more vote?There is this rumours going around that... because more foreigners who get their red i.c will 100% vote for PAP because it's the PAP who give them the red i.c and they dare not vote against them or grateful to them, so the government will give more red i.c to the foreigners.I how true is this rumours until another of my fren who is also from China and also a operaotor setup girl who get her citizenship afew years ago.She and her husband came here and got it just after a few years working here.I asked her about this thing and yes she told me she vote for the PAP.<br>If this kind of situation is not under control, 10 years more and we will see more China people here..... and we will call ourself little China!!!!!!!Any comment please do so!!!!!</div>

I agree with u wholeheartedly!!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  But the problem with many Sinkaporeans is, they rather earn as much money to feed their materialistic two selves [husband n wife]  than earn to upkeep more babies......their OWN babies who will become thier children.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  [Read ... a comment by our very own "celebrity" Jamie &amp; Glenn Ong, who was quoted in a local magazine about not wanting babies now.]. Dun noe bout the future. Noe why, well go figure out..hehehe. That sums up about many Sinkaporeans thinking..... especially the chinese Sinkaporeans.<br><br>So therefore, we Sinkaporeans have ourselves to be blame when SG govt have to rely on them foreign "talents" to increase our future population..... U see, we need these foreign "talents" to work on jobs that our own Sinkaporeans dislike or where our greying population cannot or are uncapable of doing....... read....."too old....need someone younger with more dexterity on their fingers and grey matter to get the job done.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
