              servant placed 10 cents, gulped down his drink and mumbled "I have paid 
              for my drink. If you want to have a drink, go ahead", before walking 
              away. They were stunned.....S R Nathan, who worked with Goh in the defence ministry in the 1970s, 
              said that <strong>Goh was so averse to spending that whenever he travelled 
              overseas he would carry soap flakes to wash his underwear in the hotel 
              bathroom.</strong></p>

              <p>Good riddance! He’s the guy who forced our fathers, sons and
              brothers to become slave soldiers with little recourse to justice
              while paying them pittance allowances of $90/mth. Until recently,
              if you die in NS or reservist your family only gets a freaking
              cheque for $10K.</p>
              <p>He is also responsible for all the shenanigans in our education
              system — Pri 3 streaming, Pri 4 streaming, monoligualism and Pri 7
              &amp; Pri 8 for “less intelligent” people, funneling and
              fast-tracking late bloomers into VITB/ITE with no questions asked.
              He basically started all the streaming, separation by tests &amp;
              IQ, and caused the entire education system to degenerate into the
              kiasu-ism, elitism, expensive tuition, pressure cooker that you see
              today.</p>
              <p>He’s also part of the gang that came up with eugenics for
              Singapore with the Graduate Mother Scheme, stopping or reducing
              financial help to poor people, keeping tight political quotas on
              those who want to study law or medicine in NUS (40 per year), while
              pushing for mass entry into engineering and polytechnics. All
              because his grand economic plan depended on supplying cheap, low
              cost and uncomplaining technicians &amp; engineers to greedy Ang Mo
              &amp; Nipponese MNCs. Plus giving all these Ang Moh and Nips
              freebies, tax breaks, rebates and incentives from the blood taxes
              of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The only thing he did right was to retire in 1984, unlike some
              old fcukers still masturbating to their monthly million-dollar
              checks. Be it as it may, GKS retired with full pension and full
              A-Class medical treatments — Singaporean taxpayers have already
              paid enough for his long 26-year retirement and “long illness”.
              Although he retired before the era of multi-million dollar
              salaries, his pension would still be at least $15,000 a month —
              enough for Europe holidays, Bahamas, Taihiti, Alaskan cruise,
              Mediterranean cruise every year. And remember he and his wife do
              not have to come up with even a single cent for A-Class ward
              medical treatments.</p>
