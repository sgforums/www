              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FORMER Deputy Prime Minister and Singapore's economic 
              architect Goh Keng Swee died early on Friday morning after a long 
              illness. He was 91.</p>
              <p>Dr Goh Keng Swee will be remembered, above all, for his role
               as one of the prime architects of Singapore's economic success. Many of
               the key milestones in Singapore's journey from Third World backwater to
               globalised, First-World city can be found in the story of his life, 
              vividly portrayed in the new book Goh Keng Swee: A Portrait by his 
              daughter-in-law Tan Siok Sun.</p>
              <p>The son of a rich Malacca family - his father, Goh Leng Inn,
               was a manager of a rubber plantation, his mother was from the family 
              that produced famous Malaysian politicians Tun Tan Cheng Lock and his 
              son Tun Tan Siew Sin - Dr Goh joined the Department of Social Welfare in
               1946, and was active in post-war administration.</p>
              <p>He resigned from the civil service in 1959 to enter politics
               and was elected as the People's Action Party representative for Kreta 
              Ayer, his constituency until he retired in 1984.</p>
              <p>He had one word to describe the state of the economy when he
               became finance minister in 1959: 'Wretched'.</p>
              <p>Upon Singapore's independence in 1965, Dr Goh also became 
              Minister for the Interior and Defence until 1967, assuming 
              responsibilities for strengthening Singapore's military and domestic 
              security capabilities. A key policy was the creation of National 
              Service, a mandatory conscription system for able-bodied young males.</p>
              <p>In 1979, Dr Goh moved on to the Education Ministry, where 
              his Goh Report greatly influenced the development of Singapore's 
              education system, introducing key policies such as streaming and 
              religious education.</p>
              <p>Dr Goh retired as Deputy Prime Minister in December 1984, 
              due to personal reasons.</p>

              <p>Dr Goh is a pioneer in economic thought. He does not accept the then popular economic school of thought ie Keynesian economics. Instead, he modified them to suit Singapore's economic growth. Furthermore, he is the pioneer to advocate economic growth through exports and attract MNCs and foreign investments and this model is adopted by many developing countries now.</p>
              <p>Dr is the engine of growth ie he drives Singapore economy with his great foresight and deep understanding of the economy and the world economy.</p>
              <p>It is sad that Singapore no longers has a person as capable as him and now no one can take his role and drives Singapore economy with great foresight.</p>
              <p>Rest in Peace Dr Goh and you are deeply missed by all of Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>Good riddance! He’s the guy who forced our fathers, sons and brothers
               to become slave soldiers with little recourse to justice while paying 
              them pittance allowances of $90/mth. Until recently, if you die in NS or
               reservist your family only gets a freaking cheque for $10K.</p>
              <p>He is also responsible for all the shenanigans in our education 
              system — Pri 3 streaming, Pri 4 streaming, monoligualism and Pri 7 &amp;
               Pri 8 for “less intelligent” people, funneling and fast-tracking late 
              bloomers into VITB/ITE with no questions asked. He basically started all
               the streaming, separation by tests &amp; IQ, and caused the entire 
              education system to degenerate into the kiasu-ism, elitism, expensive 
              tuition, pressure cooker that you see today.</p>
              <p>He’s also part of the gang that came up with eugenics for Singapore 
              with the Graduate Mother Scheme, stopping or reducing financial help to 
              poor people, keeping tight political quotas on those who want to study 
              law or medicine in NUS (40 per year), while pushing for mass entry into 
              engineering and polytechnics. All because his grand economic plan 
              depended on supplying cheap, low cost and uncomplaining technicians 
              &amp; engineers to greedy Ang Mo &amp; Nipponese MNCs. Plus giving all 
              these Ang Moh and Nips freebies, tax breaks, rebates and incentives from
               the blood taxes of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The only thing he did right was to retire in 1984, unlike some old 
              fcukers still masturbating to their monthly million-dollar checks. Be it
               as it may, GKS retired with full pension and full A-Class medical 
              treatments — Singaporean taxpayers have already paid enough for his long
               26-year retirement and “long illness”. Although he retired before the 
              era of multi-million dollar salaries, his pension would still be at 
              least $15,000 a month — enough for Europe holidays, Bahamas, Taihiti, 
              Alaskan cruise, Mediterranean cruise every year. And remember he and his
               wife do not have to come up with even a single cent for A-Class ward 
              medical treatments.</p>

              <p>Dr Goh is a pioneer in economic thought. He does not accept the
              then popular economic school of thought ie Keynesian economics.
              Instead, he modified them to suit Singapore's economic growth.
              Furthermore, he is the pioneer to advocate economic growth through
              exports and attract MNCs and foreign investments and this model is
              adopted by many developing countries now.</p>
              <p>Dr is the engine of growth ie he drives Singapore economy with
              his great foresight and deep understanding of the economy and the
              world economy.</p>
              <p>It is sad that Singapore no longers has a person as capable as
              him and now no one can take his role and drives Singapore economy
              with great foresight.</p>
              <p>Rest in Peace Dr Goh and you are deeply missed by all of
              Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>well but sadly, Spore has not evolved from that strategy meant for developing countries. We are still hunting ground for cheap labour. While countries like Japan, Korea and Taiwan have developed their own brands the past 20-30 years, we are still dependent on the presence of MNCs.</p>
