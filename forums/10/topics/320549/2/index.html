              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you want to play guns like a true DeerHunter - learn to load your weapon with real bullets and not just 'blanks' to shoot aimlessly at some useless 'Point blank'.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">and this was not the first nor the last time that the Bear had made this debasing remark at a Singaporean - who did him no harm in any direct or indirect ways, and even if CSJ had harmed him, the Bear do not even possess the gall or the balls to confront CSJ and make himself hit the headlines in chastising CSJ face-to-face.</span></p>

              <p>now.. THAT, my friend, is democracy... the power of the people.. not whatever the hell that attention whore CSJ says... <strong>he prostituted his party</strong> and <strong>politically sodomised the one</strong> who brought him up politically... you think he'll even hesitate to throw you, those whom he doesn't even know, to the dogs?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">and this was not the first nor the last time that the Bear had made this debasing remark at a Singaporean - who did him no harm in any direct or indirect ways, and even if CSJ had harmed him, the Bear do not even possess the gall or the balls to confront CSJ and make himself hit the headlines in chastising CSJ face-to-face.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you miss out this grand master-piece from the Bear in his post on the thread :-</span></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/320393?page=1">“A best Present for a child”  </a>-</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">which clearly showed the personal spite that an unknown Bear has borned towards CSJ, in instigating hatred towards a fellow-Singaporean.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This was the Bear's handiwork:</span> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With his poppycock claim of ''I love my country'' - he has no qualms at stealthily sabotaging all little efforts at sheilding the small political flame from dying, by throwing his wet blanket on the flame - when his impotence make him wet his bed and blanket on seing the warm amber.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Bear has clearly shown himself as a devious shenanigan, a master in disguising his true political agenda with the minimal of post in this SC; and with each infreqent post that he makes, he will spare no efforts at plunging deep stabs into the character of CSJ - even with blatant lies that he has no reply when his efforts were trashed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With your dubious observation skills at reading, it is doubtful if you can even make any success at DeerHunting.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you decided to hang up your guns shooting at your "$27 Billion China-Singapore Trade" - and trying so hard to shoo attention off "BOTH WAYS" ? </span></p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Thanks for bringing this topic to my attention, as I was wondering what happened to the some remarkably entertaining issues that had produced some great laughs.</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Hahahaha... your Great Mentor Shepher will be quite disappointed in your weak and juvenile reply given.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So indecisive with your thoughts, so inprecise with your words - all refecting the impotency of a mind that is unfamiliar with an adopted language not learnt carefully when the time was given.</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">How pathetic you can be in sinking to such low levels of political idiot-logy that is a poor bastardised version of the supremacy of the Great Mentor Shepherd ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The one that is bitten by the rabid bug has been a juvenile DeerHunter going out to hunt but with the poorest knowledge and equipment for any kind of hunting.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it not surprised that you have turned rabid with all your remarks as you become feverish at every reply made, when you have been constantly embarrassed looking like a fool holding a toy wimpy gun as a DeerHunter ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">All you can do - and have continuously done - is to make generalise statement of my efforts at changing the facts, speaking of half-a-truth, and propagate half-baked ideas - yet you have not been able to pinpoint any one single issue from my replies that support your accusation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is this not reflective of a impotent mind become more and more ajggressively  defensive - as a DeerHunter withdraws into a $27 garbage bin to sulk and scream ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Carefull that the echoes in the $27 garbage bin do not amplify your screams of frustration with loud echoes that will surely push you to the next level at the IMH.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely with your stupendous reading ability, we can all accept your rabid views and interpretation of the various responses ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not playing to a wider audience amongst the readership in this Speakers' Corner ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not being very careless in your present adventure in purposefully being dishonest with the remarks made by the Bear and claiming it to be my creation ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hahahaha - your Great Mentor Shepherd will laugh at your juvenile antics that he will probably see in the manner that CSJ is attempting to pin on LKY ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are your actions now not similar to CSJ's efforts at undermining the Great Mentor Shepherd ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Actions that you claim CSJ as being dishonest ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">At least, CSJ had grounds in his statements made from actual events that occurred in Singapore - which LKY had created his own self-inflicted injury onto his own reputation by making his own preferred inferences.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What grounds do you have to substanatiate your claims except to extract words out of context in my rebuttal to the Bear ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Bear has accused CSJ as being an ''attention seeking whore'' and it seems that you are similarly being bitten by one too - with your constant attempts at seeking the attention of a wider audience in this Speakers' Corner.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As much as the Bear is a dishonest political commentator, are you similarly attracted to his style and is now adopting his methods too ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With your political idiot-logy so proudly displayed across several threads despite being trounced consistently by one whom you deride as a village fool - you certainly qualify to be equal to the Bear as an "attention seeking whore'' ?</span></p>

              <p>Hello Gazelle, have you taken on another new nick after being exposed for all the others that you have registered simply to become a sock-puppet - to support your own positions in different threads when no one is standing on your side ?</p>
              <p>Where were you when the exchange between your clone DeerHunter and myself was at its heights of the entertainment ?</p>
              <p>Have you fought off your panty-sniffing ways by re-registering into different nicks and take on differing styles - but all with the same characteristics aimlessly mischevious efforts to cause confusion with your dishonest regurgitation of the standard propaganda ?</p>
              <p>No matter which nick you pick-up, the tycpical Gazelle style will always surface, you simply cannot resist becoming the original Gazelle from the Bar.</p>
