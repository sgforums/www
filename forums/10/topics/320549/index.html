              <h1>Character assassination of the most uncharitable kind</h1>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana;">Anthony Yeo, Consultant Therapist at the <a href="http://www.counsel.org.sg/index.htm">Counselling and Care Centre</a>,</span></em></strong><strong><em></em></strong><strong><em><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana;"> wrote the following letter to the Straits Times political editor, Chua Lee Hoong.</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Morning Chua Lee Hoong,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I cannot deny how appalled I was reading your article on Chee Soon Juan (ST June 7).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">It appears to be an unwarranted scathing attempt at character assassination of the most uncharitable kind.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">This attack
              culminated in your amateurish attempt at offering a diagnosis of his
              personality that is flawed in all ways as a diagnosis of personality
              disorder requires a fuller expose of that which constitutes a disorder.<br> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><br> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">MM Lee Kuan Yew
              decided to engage in such denigration of Chee Soon Juan on more than
              one occasion. <strong>His name calling of him as being a psychopath reflects
              his ignorance as to what a psychopath is.</strong></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In any case,
              such labelling with psychological nomenclature merely exposes his
              truncated understanding of what a psychopath is, of which Chee does not
              in any way qualify.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">This goes for you as well in your rather denigrating, demeaning and dismissive description of Chee.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">You have chosen to highlight whatever you consider to be flaws in his approach and even worse, his character.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">And yet, those of us who know him and have worked in some ways with him know otherwise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I do wonder if
              you would do yourself, and the public for whom you wrote that article,
              a favour by embarking on a careful research of everything else he
              stands for and all that he has been doing without fanfare and
              publicity. And having done that, would you then have the integrity to
              offer another perspective of him, another “truth”, that you have so
              carefully sought to present in your article.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I would have
              thought there could be a little more charity in commenting on Chee
              rather than indulge in augmenting the already prejudicial opinions of
              this man.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">One would have thought that any person regardless of what he does deserves respect and regard for human worth and dignity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In
              any case, if you do wish to be better acquainted with what would
              present as an anti-social disorder, I would gladly assist on the basis
              of my more than 36 years of psychological work with disturbed people.</span></strong></p>

              <h1 class="title">Chua Lee Hoong, why do you even bother?</h1>
              <p><strong>Written by Ng E-Jay<br> 08 June 2008</strong></p>
              <p>Although I have been a contributor to the Straits Times Forum page
              now and then, I know full well that it is a well-oiled propaganda
              machine designed to support the establishment and spin the yarn of the
              PAP Government.</p>
              <p>Throughout the entire hearing of PM Lee’s and MM Lee’s defamation
              suit against SDP leaders Dr Chee Soon Juan and his sister Ms Chee Siok
              Chin, the Straits Times has been telling the story in a one-sided
              fashion, demonizing the Chee siblings as inept trouble-makers out to
              create a political theatre out of a court case and peppering the court
              proceedings with irrelevant questions, questionable antics, even
              outright lies.</p>
              <p>I would like to remind readers of what Lee Kuan Yew said in 1956 as part of the Legislative Assembly debates:</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">“<strong>Repression, Sir is a habit that
              grows. I am told it is like making love - it is always easier the
              second time! The first time there may be pangs of conscience, a sense
              of guilt. But once embarked on this course with constant repetition you
              get more and more brazen in the attack. All you have to do is to
              dissolve organizations and societies and banish and detain the key
              political workers in these societies. Then miraculously everything is
              tranquil on the surface. Then an intimidated press and the
              government-controlled radio together can regularly sing your praises,
              and slowly and steadily the people are made to forget the evil things
              that have already been done, or if these things are referred to again
              they’re conveniently distorted and distorted with impunity, because
              there will be no opposition to contradict.</strong>” - Lee Kuan Yew as an opposition PAP member speaking to David Marshall, Singapore Legislative Assembly Debates, 4 October 1956</p>
              <p>Today, we see this philosophy enacted in full by the Straits Times,
              which published an article in the Insight page written by ex-ISD
              officer and current Political Editor Ms Chua Lee Hoong on Saturday 07
              June 2008. This article, which puts the finishing touches on a long and
              disgusting propaganda campaign against Dr Chee Soon Juan, was published
              at a time when Dr Chee is in prison and is unable to respond directly
              to her.</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">“… <strong>or if these things are
              referred to again they’re conveniently distorted and distorted with
              impunity, because there will be no opposition to contradict</strong> …”</p>
              <p>No opposition to contradict, because the person is in jail!</p>
              <p>Entitled “The squandered potential of Chee Soon Juan”, Chua Lee
              Hoong puts together such a splendidly craftily summary of the entire
              propaganda attack on Dr Chee Soon Juan and the SDP that it does not
              leave any doubt in my mind the true intentions of our state-controlled
              media in fixing the Opposition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chua Lee Hoong begins by saying Dr Chee created a stir when he first
              entered politics in 1992, drawing high praise from even the then-leader
              of the SDP, Mr Chiam See Tong. Then the niceties stop abruptly. She
              goes on to question rhetorically, “What has happened in the 16 years
              hence? Today, one cannot help but conclude that the trailblazer is more
              a sputtering meteor, and perhaps one with an antisocial personality
              disorder.”</p>
              <p>Apparently, Ms Chua now wants to be a psychiatrist as well. Perhaps
              she aspires to be the “doctor” who allegedly told MM Lee that Dr Chee
              was “near psychopath”.</p>
              <p>Chua Lee Hoong says the SDP of today is “hardly credible as an opposition party”.</p>
              <p>So how does Chua Lee Hoong argue her case that SDP is not credible?
              She states that during the 3-day court hearing to assess damages in the
              defamation suit brought on by PM Lee and MM Lee, the public gallery was
              invariably full, whilst SDP supporters numbered at most 15 or so.</p>
              <p>I say Chua Lee Hoong is hardly credible herself. Does she not recall
              that on the first day of the court hearing, it was announced in the
              state media, in particular the New Paper, that PAP grassroots members
              went down by the busloads to show their support for the Lees? I am
              amazed that the PAP can be considered to render other opposition
              parties less credible by merely pulling on their vast machinery and
              bringing out huge numbers in force.</p>
              <p>And who is to say SDP did not have silent supporters in the gallery,
              who followed the proceedings without publicly showing where their
              hearts were leaning toward?</p>
              <p>Chua Lee Hoong then goes on to say that the SDP argument that the
              ruling party has used all means at its disposal to suppress it cuts “no
              ice with the majority of Singaporeans”, citing Mr Chiam See Tong and Mr
              Low Thia Khiang as examples of Opposition politicians who have
              succeeded despite the odds.</p>
              <p>My question: Succeeded in what sense? In the sense of just holding
              on to their single seat in Parliament? Or in the sense of building a
              more credible Opposition that can stand up to the PAP and provide a
              sound challenge to its power base?</p>
              <p>How about the alternative explanation that the PAP has held back
              from destroying Mr Chiam and Mr Low, for whatever reason, but has
              chosen not to pull its punches when it comes to Dr Chee, for the simple
              reason that Dr Chee, if left unchecked, will provide a far more
              forceful and comprehensive challenge to the system? I will let my
              readers decide for themselves on this one, as I’m sure most already
              know where I stand.</p>
              <p>Chua Lee Hoong claims that Dr Chee has “disappointed an entire
              generation of voters” with acts that include misuse of university
              funds, a hunger strike that included the intake of glucose, the ouster
              of Mr Chiam from SDP, and the so-called heckling of then-PM Goh Chok
              Tong near a Jurong hawker centre in 2001.</p>
              <p>Look Ms Chua, I know you are trying your darnest to bring down that
              man, but do you really believe that thinking people will buy into this
              old refrain any longer? For one, Mr Chiam was not ousted from SDP by Dr
              Chee. He voluntarily engineered his own exit, contrary to what the
              state media would have us believe.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee’s question to Goh Chok Tong, “Where is the money”, remains
              valid even till today, as Singaporeans are forced to helplessly watch
              as the nation’s reserve are funnelled into dubious foreign investments
              whilst their CPF is still earning a very low interest rate and they are
              forced to take up schemes such as CPF Life because the national pension
              system can no longer adequately take care of their retirement needs.</p>
              <p>On the heckling of then-PM Goh, our dearest Ms Chua sobs that “It
              was my misfortune to have witnessed the incident with my own eyes.” Oh,
              poor thing, that is so sad! Another “Poor me! I’m a victim” mentality,
              so it seems — exactly the same thing she has accused SDP of having.</p>
              <p>But Ms Chua is not done yet. She goes on to mention the
              International Bar Association (IBA) conference held in Suntec City in
              2006 in which Ms Sylvia Lim distanced herself from Dr Chee by siding
              with the establishment in implying that our laws are fair and just, and
              saying that “Singaporeans are quite capable of deciding for themselves
              the kind of country they want and did not need foreigners to canvass
              our agenda for us … … Singapore is not perfect, and we don’t pretend
              that it is. But neither should we make it out to be worse than it
              really is.”</p>
              <p>In a country where basic civil rights such as the freedom of speech
              and assembly are regularly denied, it is astounding how Sylvia Lim
              could have come up with such a blatantly one-sided comment. Yet our
              dearest Chua Lee Hoong spares no effort in putting Sylvia Lim on a
              pedestal so as to make Dr Chee look small in comparison.</p>
              <p>So was that the end of her tirade? Fat hope. What came after this
              makes the previous parts of Ms Chua’s article pale in comparison.</p>
              <p>Chua Lee Hoong said that last Monday (02 June 2008), it was JBJ’s
              turn to distance himself from Dr Chee. She quoted JBJ as saying, ” the
              counsel doesn’t have to agree with whatever has been done by the
              client.”</p>
              <p>In the first place, that was blatantly taken out of context. JBJ’s
              main concern at that time was that he did not sufficient time to
              prepare the appeal for Dr Chee (against his contempt-of-court
              conviction) as the court had given them too short a notice. Mr
              Jeyaretnam, counsel for Dr Chee, had made two preliminary applications:
              one for Judge Ang to recuse herself from the matter, and the second for
              more time to study the facts of the case as he had only received the
              Judge’s citations only during the weekend. Both applications were
              rejected. Dr Chee accordingly discharged Mr Jeyaretnam as counsel and
              said that he would not be defending the charges.</p>
              <p>And to top the icing on the cake, our dearest Ms Chua drags out Dr
              Chee’s Christian faith and unceremoniously questions whether
              “Christians will accept his pattern of behaviour as being particularly
              Christian”.</p>
              <p>I wonder if any Christians are actually offended by the dragging of
              their faith into what is undoubtedly a political discussion, and a
              horribly lop-sided one at that.</p>
              <p>As for our dear Ms Chua’s remarks that Dr Chee could be suffering
              from antisocial personality disorder (APD), even going to the extent of
              saying “if he does, we have got to feel sorry for him”, the tragic
              irony of her audacious claim is that people suffering from APD have a
              lack of regard for the rights of others, which is precisely what Dr
              Chee has been fighting for on behalf of all Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Let me say this, even if Dr Chee is indeed suffering from APD, our
              dearest Ms Chua need not feel sorry for him. I would feel sorry for her
              instead, for her shameless engagement in gutter journalism, for her
              putting up such a shoddy and lame attempt at finishing Dr Chee off.</p>
              <p>Chua Lee Hoong has made absolutely no effort at hiding the true
              intentions of the state media which she works for. One propaganda piece
              after another, each one distorting the facts with greater and greater
              impunity, leaves me no doubt that Ms Chua and her state media are
              obsessed with putting the man down at all cost, even at the risk of
              destroying whatever credibility they have left (if any).</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, Ms Chua cannot even put together a coherent piece that is even remotely rational.</p>
              <p>Ms Chua Lee Hoong, why do you even bother to try?</p>

              <p>Bear, what are your views on this:</p>
              <ol>
              <li id="comment-1007"> <strong>Blurred by spin</strong> Said,
              <p>“For
              one, Mr Chiam was not ousted from SDP by Dr Chee. He voluntarily
              engineered his own exit, contrary to what the state media would have us
              believe.” Ng E-Jay, you are absolutely correct. If one reads the 1994
              Volume 1 of the Singapore Law Report at page 278, the following
              sequence of events were established:</p>
              <p>(1) On 17/5/1993, at a Cenral Executive Committee (CEC) meeting of
              the SDP, Chiam tried to introduce a motion to censure Chee SJ for his
              hunger stike. NOBODY (not even his 2 favoured party members (I’m not
              referring to CSJ) brought into SDP by him) supported him. Not being a
              team player, he wrote out a resignation note on the spot. (During the
              trial Chiam famously declared - and this was reported in the Straits
              Times - that he was like a General; when he gives an order everyone
              must charge!)<br> (2) For the next few weeks, several attempts were made by CEC members
              to ask Chiam to withdraw his resignation. He refused and instead
              started making demands. Meanwhile, the CEC tried to keep a tight lid on
              Chiam’s resignation.<br> (3) On 18/6/1993, when the local media started to sniff closer to the
              door, the CEC had no choice but to announce Chiam’s resignation and
              even then tried to put a positive spin to the event by praising Chiam
              for his contribution to opposition politics.<br> (4) On 16/7/1993, Chiam did the unthinkable, and, to me as an outside
              observer, an unforgivable thing: he went to the very core of the PAP
              propaganda machine, namely, the Times House (then at Kim Seng Road),
              and gave a talk denouncing his fellow CEC members.<br> (5) Events were then set in motion when the SDP CEC asked Chiam to
              appear before a disciplinary committee. Chiam was found guilty and
              expelled from SDP.</p>
              <p>Look, if you join a club with rules and you start bad-mouthing the
              leadership and your own members, the leaders really have no choice but
              to haul you up for discipline isn’t it? Although the judge found the
              disciplinary process against Chiam ineptly conducted - and there are
              some who do not quite agree with the reasoning of the judge -
              nonetheless it was Chiam who brought it upon himself. After the
              judgment, Chiam was reinstated as SDP member, but he chose to resign
              thereafter.</p>
              <p>So you see, the above sequence of events have been morphed, by a
              sleight of hand, assisted no doubt by the likes of Chua Lee Hoong, into
              Chee Soon Juan (the ingrate brought in by Chiam) having ousted Chiam
              See Tong.</p>

              <p>For a Bear that is not even lucid to the events that led to CST ouster by the SDP Exco - can you even be present to see any shock appearing on CST's face ?</p>
              <p>Was SDP fall in its fortune due entirely to CSJ, or was it the mobilising of the entire political machinery to demolish CSJ completely - with the politially machinery owned and operated by the Government and its GLCs that are controlled by the PAP ?</p>

              <p>CSJ has been able to stand up to LKY, as CSJ refused to play football based on the International Foot Federation Rules that is specially interpreted by LKY to suit his own size football field, and his own specially design Goal Post that he constantly shift depending on the weather that refuse to follow his own choice.</p>
              <p>LKY can hope to control anything and everything that he can think that he can touch, but only Nature's elements will be beyond his reach, and the political minds of Singaporeans' are out-of-his reach.</p>
              <p>He can attempt to buy the hearts and minds of Singaporeans, but he will still have to shift the goal posts come every Big Game that comes along every five years, tinker at the rules that will govern the Game, and may even redraw the perimeter lines and change the shape of the corners or even redesign the standard Goal Posts, or make the field muddier by soaking the playing field and making it unlevel.</p>
              <p>Are you better than all those whom you accuse as better than the "idiots in white" ?</p>
              <p>With everyone being an idiot, where does that place you when you are living within your deluded nation of idiots ?</p>
              <p>Are you in some kind of state of denial ?</p>
