              <div><br></div>
              <div>July 27, 2009</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span>By Tian Wei<br><br>The producer of
              Transformers, Tom DeSanto, claimed that his goal in making the movie
              was to gain back the sense of wonder that Hollywood has lost over the
              years. When Autobots and Decepticons roared onto the movie screens
              worldwide, his dream came true.<br><br>The sense of wonder appeals to
              not only blockbuster producers, but also every one of us. From time to
              time, we tend to pin our hopes on something, wishing that it will
              magically extract us from a challenging situation.<br><br>Previous
              rounds of the US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) have taken
              place amid high expectations. Although there has been steady progress
              made, and both sides have listened closely to each other's positions,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> it wasn't the miraculous breakthrough many people were hoping for,
              leading to complaints that the Strategic Economic Dialogue fails to
              produce either strategy or dialogue.</strong></span><br><br>What will come of the new
              "Strategic and Economic Dialogue" (S&amp;ED) – now with bonus ampersand
              – is still unknown, but it's of even more significance than the
              previous events. According to the Obama administration, the S&amp;ED
              will tackle long-term strategic and economic objectives between China
              and the US.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Pretty abstract, isn't it?</strong></span> The dialogue is even more
              complicated than before, given the complexity of the bureaucratic
              process involved, the efforts to match on issues of the key US and
              Chinese players, and the wide sweep of issues on the agenda.<br><br>China
              sent 28 minister-level officials from Beijing to Washington. On the US
              side, both the legendary Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the
              "old China hand" Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, are going to
              co-chair the opening ceremony of S&amp;ED attended by US President
              Barack Obama. One can imagine the thoughts going on in the heads of
              politicians, and the big and small dramas that the press will capture
              and no doubt enjoy.<br><br>The Washington press corp have already begin
              to predict that both sides will be as focused on managing the logistics
              of a bureaucratic circus as achieving concrete results.<br><br>So, why
              do we need the S&amp;ED, in all its complexity? Five years ago, former
              US Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick said something that might
              help to explain. He said that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"it is time to recognize China for what
              it is and may become, not what we imagine China to be."</strong></span><br><br>What
              exactly is China to the US and the US to China? Analyzing such an
              intertwined relations could be very difficult. But China's influence
              and national interests are now far broader than they have been at any
              time in the history of People's Republic of China and the prospect for
              mutually reinforcing diplomacy or diverging diplomatic strategies is
              also greater than it ever has been.<br><br>While excited about the
              significance of the S&amp;ED, one has to be very careful to distinguish
              it from<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> "G2," the belief that the US and China are integral p l a y e r
              s in most if not all global issues.</strong></span></span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span>As a result, there are concerns in some
              capitals that America's search for a solution to its worst economic
              crisis since the Great Depression may lead the Obama administration
              into not only expanded strategic and economic dialogues with China but
              also deal blows to its strategic partnership elsewhere.<br><br>But to
              those who worry, it is important to know that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>China does not agree with
              "G2" theory</strong></span>, citing the country's status as a developing nation and its
              trust in multilateral mechanism to resolve issues as evidence.<br><br>Meanwhile,
              both Beijing and Washington believe the S&amp;ED is a bilateral
              mechanism designed to achieve greater mutual congruence on matters of
              shared concern. It is not a forum for the US and China to solve all of
              the world's problems.<br>But will wonders happen this time? It seems unlikely, but there can be progress regardless.<br><br>According
              to official documents, "both P r e s i d e n t Obama and President Hu
              Jintao of China have placed the S&amp;ED at the center of the bilateral
              relationship. They are committed to delivering concrete, meaningful and
              sustained progress over time on long-term strategic and economic
              objectives through the S&amp;ED."<br><br>In plain words, Jeffrey Bader,
              from the East Asian affairs office for the National Security Council,
              gave his version: "China, since its reform and opening-up policies 30
              years ago, has made a series of choices that were all designed to be
              supportive of the existing order." Geithner puts it even more simpler:
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"They (China) have a deep stake in the system now. And they recognize
              this."</strong></span><br><br>I am afraid the hope is similar from Beijing to Washington:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> recognize the reality of the situation for what it is.</strong></span></span></div>

              <p><strong><span class="BHL">Obama says US, China to shape 21st century</span></strong></p>
              <p><span class="BDL">July 27, 2009</span></p>
              <p><span class="BDL"><br></span> <span class="BTX"> US President Barack Obama on Monday called for broad
              cooperation with China to set the course of the 21st century, saying
              the<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> relationship between the Pacific powers was "as important as any"
              in the world.</strong></span></span></span></p>
              <p>Kicking off two days of in-depth talks in Washington, Obama appealed
              for cooperation on a broad range of issues from reviving the global
              economy to fighting climate change, while also nudging Beijing on human
              rights.</p>
              <p><span class="BTX">
              </span></p><p>"The relationship between the United States and China will shape the
              21st century, which makes it as important as any bilateral relationship
              in the world," Obama said.</p>
              <p>"That reality must underpin our partnership. That is the responsibility we bear," he said.</p>
              <p>In what appeared to be a coordinated new slogan, both Obama and Chinese
              President Hu Jintao, who sent a message to the meeting, said they
              sought a "positive, constructive, and comprehensive relationship."</p>
              <p>"Our two countries should endeavor to expand common ground, reduce
              differences, enhance mutual trust and strengthen cooperation," Hu said.</p>
              <p>Obama, who is expected to travel to China later this year, has sought
              to broaden the relationship with Beijing which is now the largest
              creditor to the heavily indebted United States.</p>
              <p>The dialogue revamps an earlier set of talks launched under former US
              president George W. Bush in 2006 that focused solely on economic issues.</p>
              <p>But China, whose delegation is led by State Councilor Dai Bingguo and
              Vice Premier Wang Qishan, said it would press the United States on
              concerns including over the safety of its more than 750 billion dollars
              invested in US Treasury bonds.</p>
              <p>A senior US official said the first day of talks, led by Secretary of
              State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, was
              "very constructive, very candid," but mostly general.</p>
              <p>"We're going to spend most of our time getting to know each other,"
              David Sheer, director of China affairs at the State Department, told
              reporters on a conference call.</p>
              <p>He said the two sides would identify "common interests" to pursue in future sessions.</p>
              <p>US leaders have generally refrained from describing the China
              relationship as the "most important" in the world. Clinton used the
              language during her failed presidential bid, raising concerns among
              some US allies, particularly Japan.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Clinton on Monday rejected predictions of a "multi-polar world," often
              used as codeword by Chinese, Russian and other policymakers to signal
              the end of a US-dominated era.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>"Although past relations between the United States and China have been
              influenced by the idea of a balance of power among great nations, the
              fresh thinking of the 21st century moves us from a multi-polar world to
              a multi-partner world," Clinton said.</p>
              <p>Both Clinton and Obama, while pledging not to see China as a rival,
              also acknowledged differences with the rising Asian power --
              particularly on human rights...</p>

              <p>alamak, u misinterpret liao...I also can shape the world, so do you, everyone also can,..they are just saying that they will be a part of shaping the world, not merely just both of them, many other too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>China and American has come into a close relationship lately due to economy reason, China bought US treasury bonds, US needs to uphold it bonds and currency to satisfy China. US then sell arms to South Korean and taiwanese to make money inorder to uphold is currency and hopefully higher its bonds to the Chinese delight. So the Chinese dun mind, just play the game of cat and mouse with S korea and taiwan, the American sell arms, and the chinese can profit from it too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The conspiracy here is to ask China to disturb abit on S korea and taiwan or even japan, and the america can sell arms liao, and let me tell you Uncle, Arms trading is the best business, better than selling oil. So, my dear Uncle, dun look thing at it face value, think hor. All things is not so simple, there are conspiracy, agents, double agents etc etc</p>
