Also present is Armed Forces Chief Gen Tan Sri Mohd Zahidi Zainuddin.<br>KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 2 (Bernama) -- Any attempt by any neighbouring country to violate Malaysia's sovereignty on the basis of "forward defence" will be handled by the armed forces with all its military might, Defence Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said Thursday.<br><br>He said the armed forces warned any country with the "forward defence" doctrine not to try to breach the land, air and sea sovereignty of Malaysia.<br><br>"We'll use all our military power to defend our independence and sovereignty if any country wants to implement "forward defence" or launch pre-emptive strikes.<br><br>"<span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We're giving a clear warning</span></span>," he told a media conference at his ministry.<br><br>He said the armed forces had thorough military planning if Malaysia faced threats from a neighbouring country as a result of implementing a defence doctrine that breached Malaysia's sovereignty.<br><br>"We have our plans but there is no need for me to reveal them. If we are under threat, we'll respond," said Najib, without elaborating on the plans.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad yesterday exposed the plan by certain countries which wanted to use Malaysia as their battlefield in the event of war. </span></span><br><br>The Prime Minister said these countries believed that by adopting such a strategy, they would be able to prevent the horror of war from reaching their shores.<br><br>Najib said the "forward defence" concept was not something new to the armed forces and it did not pose a threat to any country if it was only a plan.<br><br>"But if the concept is executed and violated the sovereignty of this country, then we'll take action," he said.<br><br>Asked whether Malaysia need to increase its defence budget to acquire more modern weaponry systems, he said the armed forces would buy new weapon systems if the country's financial situation permitted it.<br><br>He, however, said the situation in Malaysia had not reached a war footing stage.<br><br>"We are not in a war footing yet to the extent of postponing developments in other fields to acquire weapons for the armed forces," he said.<br><br>Asked whether Malaysia needs to change its defence policy to handle the "forward defence" threat, Najib said the armed forces defence policy and strategies suited the current situation.<br><br>Asked whether the military intelligence had received reports or information on the "forward defence" plan by a neighbouring country, he said: "Maybe there is. If the Prime Minister says so, there must be some basis to it."<br><br>To a question whether foreign spies had sneaked into Malaysia to lay out the plans to use Malaysia as a battlefield, he said the armed forces had not detected anything so far.<br><br>On criticism that the country was too soft in handling its problems with a neighbouring nation, Najib said Malaysia did not want to be involved in any conflict or war.<br><br>He also said the Royal Malaysian Navy was investigating the incident of a navy personnel who was found in southern Philippines recently after he fell off from a moving navy ship. -- BERNAMA<br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sigh.....y must the situation be like that.........<br><br>Malaysians listen up , Singapore will stand for good . No point threatening us in the media , <strong>as we all know that Malaysia will of course fight back if being wack.</strong> Ur minister is onli toking cock , or should i say , ur minister is not helping in the situation between Singapore and Malaysia relationship.<br><br>Ur minister can vow to inflict high damage on his enemy , Singapore will vow to do the same , with distinction through our overseas excercises. Ur minister is onli a N-A-T-O over the situation.<br><br>Ur minister claim openly that they nv welcome war and had made it to a point as if, her neighbouring country is planing an attack. So a question to ask , did singapore reply with statements abt our defence capacity to wipe any neighbours if crisis arises? The answer is no. So now who is the one who is starting the war topic in media????<br><br>I nv support war , however if crisis arrives. I will support my country above all my personal feelings. Good luck malaysians . Carry on ur racism policy , try to sit down and wonder how to help ur economy , and most importantly , try to maintain ur Weapon-Zoo in tip top condition........and pls dun Yada in the media on stupid and hostile topics...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is nothing to be said about the article.  Should there be a need to employ such a strategy, the SAF also won't expect the MAF to just sit there and watch.  If the MAF believes it can deliver a bloody nose, then let it try when something like that happens.  Even if Mahathir didn't say this, it won't make a difference.  Nothing new about this character.<br><br>I hope that SG and M'sia won't have to go to war.  War profits nobody, not us, not them.  War is not about who is right, and what is right... it is what is left that matters.<br><br>In anycase, I think its cheaper for us to build desalination plants and produce newater than it is to go to war.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The upsetting thing about this Pedra Branca fisaco is that such unreasonable contradictory behaviour from Malaysia has happened before and will happen again. Again, they resist going to the ICJ, like in the water issue. They always set the image to their own consumers that they were the ones that would drag Singapore to the ICJ. However, everytime Singapore calls their bluff and says "Alright, let's go to the ICJ", Malaysia would just pretend to forget that they wanted to go to the ICJ in the first place.<br><br>www.thevoiddeck.org[/url]</div>
