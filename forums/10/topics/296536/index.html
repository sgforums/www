            <div class='col-md body'>We have been hearing about human right groups trying to establish human rights for people everywhere. When it comes to human rights the subject seems to be sensitive meeting with resistance of government in various countries.<br><br>To be practical therefore Human rights must define what they want to achieve practically and avoid politicising themselves as freedom fighters or anti-government in their primary objectives.<br><br>There are many types of rights. Some are readily achievable while others cannot be achieved being side-tracted by respective governments due to fear of rebellions or use of human rights for political or insurgency purposes.<br><br>On the other hand if human rights are the primary sets of rights of human beings why should any government want to object to such rights.<br><br>It is important for human right groups to establish themselves more clearly in such areas and by making their objectives non-political they are more likely to be of help to their fellow humans everywhere they go to promote their rights.<br><br>Citizens everywhere must come up with a list of basic human rights which are basic and inviolable and to be attained without compromise. For example the following rights should be defined as rights to be fought for everywhere irrespective of differences in social or political conditons people are in:-<br><br>(1) Right of speech<br>(2) Right to elect government<br>(3) Right of belief and creed.<br>(4) Right of association.<br><br>To be practical there is a need to monitor violation of human right. A panel can be set up in every country to investigate all such rights as listed so that it will be meaningful to have such international movements.<br><br>If all countries accept such rights willingly then there will be no need to politicise any issues brought up to the respective government who will then be willing to look into respecting such rights without making them into further issues.<br><br>All humans on this planet must show some mutual respect for the rights of fellow humans and only when they can be of help to safeguard such rights will they and their fellow brothrens enjoy such rights irrespective of the political or social philosophy adopted everywhere.<br><br></div>
