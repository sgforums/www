              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me relate my story. I am 30+ this year, married for three years. My wife and I have been very supportive of the government's baby policy and we already have a baby.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We would like to have more kids, but our current situation does not allow us to do so. I will elaborate further.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since 2004, I have been balloting for HDB flat. And the queue number has been always extraordinary long. From not married, to married and now having a baby. I am a avid subscriber of HDB news, and a loyal HDB balloter. 5 years have passed and no flat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have brought up my case to my MP and MCYS and the reply from HDB is always to same...that is too look out for resale market. Now the problem is....a young married couple like us, and especially now with a new member in our family...how could we afford the upfront cash involved in resale flat transaction. To be honest, I am very disappointed with the kind of insensetive answers from the authority. To quote the actual word used by my MP, he thinks that I am super "suay". And also another quote from him, "Yes, you are first timer applicant, but first timer applicant with first timer priority does not guarantee you a first timer flat".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are other disadvantages of resale flat, which I will explain further.</p>
              <p>1. Possibility involvement of high cash payment, pending to the seller. Which equate to no more money to pay for renovation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Yes, you can use CPF to pay the loan (whether bank or HDB). However, you need to use cash to pay for the cummulative interest accumulated over the period you have loan. And this means, that when you are old, make sure you have lots of cash to pay for the interest accumulated over 20 to 30 years. It could amount to $1000 a month for a period of 3 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. As a first timer, you are entitled government grant if you buy resale flat. When you decide to give up this resale flat for a new HDB flat, you have to pay back this government grant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. The unknown history of the flat, whether wear, tear or others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the HDB reply, they also point out that we can go for BTO (Build To Order) flat. Again, problem is we are already married with baby, how can we wait 3 years?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In addition, HDB also point out that they have shorten my queue number. In the last balloting exercise for 149 flats, my queue number is half of the total 1500++ application. My God! there are bascially 10 applicants competing for 1 HDB unit. Does the head of HDB even aware there is an extreme shortage of flats in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And with queue number of 700 for 149 flats, it does not even get me any place nearer to choose a flat. So we continue our live as modern nomad...till the next balloting exercise we will try our luck again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The morale of the story is...(in my opinion)</p>
              <p>There is extreme shortage of HDB flats in Singapore, but if you are rich and can afford a condo or if you have lots of cash on-hand then you will not face housing problem like an average Joe.</p>
              <p>Don't get married, because you will not have flat problem</p>
              <p>Don't have kids, because it does not prioritize your chances of getting a flat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you for your attention and please share your thoughts.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>i couldnt agree more. the govt's stance of controlling the supply of flats just for the sake of propping up property values do not take people like u and me into consideration. ST always like to propagate the fact that hdb flats are enjoying red hot demand.. but of course! how many people can afford private property? to think that i have to pay 200k+ for a 4 room flat in a suburban district pisses me off....  but i also have no balls to migrate because i feel that this is ultimately home.</p>
              <p>and to think that now they are trying to boost demand by converting foreigners into citizens and PR... what's wrong with having a 3 million plus population? where did the arbitrary figure of 6 million come about?</p>
              <p>don't worry. u're not alone on this. i feel for you. anyway, congrats on your newborn!</p>
              <p>p.s. sorry just had to rant for abit.</p>

              <p>Hi TS,</p>
              <p>i bought my current unit in 2004. from my application and getting one, i took me less than a year. In fact it was too fast for me.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Since 2004, I have been balloting for HDB flat. And the queue
              number has been always extraordinary long. From not married, to
              married and now having a baby. I am a avid subscriber of HDB news,
              and a loyal HDB balloter. 5 years have passed and no flat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have brought up my case to my MP and MCYS and the reply from
              HDB is always to same...that is too look out for resale market. Now
              the problem is....a young married couple like us, and especially
              now with a new member in our family...how could we afford the
              upfront cash involved in resale flat transaction. To be honest, I
              am very disappointed with the kind of insensetive answers from the
              authority. To quote the actual word used by my MP, he thinks that I
              am super "suay". And also another quote from him, "Yes, you are
              first timer applicant, but first timer applicant with first timer
              priority does not guarantee you a first timer flat".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are other disadvantages of resale flat, which I will
              explain further.</p>
              <p>1. Possibility involvement of high cash payment, pending to the
              seller. Which equate to no more money to pay for renovation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Yes, you can use CPF to pay the loan (whether bank or HDB).
              However, you need to use cash to pay for the cummulative interest
              accumulated over the period you have loan. And this means, that
              when you are old, make sure you have lots of cash to pay for the
              interest accumulated over 20 to 30 years. It could amount to $1000
              a month for a period of 3 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. As a first timer, you are entitled government grant if you
              buy resale flat. When you decide to give up this resale flat for a
              new HDB flat, you have to pay back this government grant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. The unknown history of the flat, whether wear, tear or
              others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the HDB reply, they also point out that we can go for BTO
              (Build To Order) flat. Again, problem is we are
              already married with baby, how can we wait 3 years?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In addition, HDB also point out that they have shorten my queue
              number. In the last balloting exercise for 149 flats, my queue
              number is half of the total 1500++ application. My God! there are
              bascially 10 applicants competing for 1 HDB unit. Does the head of
              HDB even aware there is an extreme shortage of flats in
              Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And with queue number of 700 for 149 flats, it does not even get
              me any place nearer to choose a flat. So we continue our live as
              modern nomad...till the next balloting exercise we will try our
              luck again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The morale of the story is...(in my opinion)</p>
              <p>There is extreme shortage of HDB flats in Singapore, but if you
              are rich and can afford a condo or if you have lots of cash on-hand
              then you will not face housing problem like an average Joe.</p>
              <p>Don't get married, because you will not have flat problem</p>
              <p>Don't have kids, because it does not prioritize your chances of

              I don't see any problem buying resale flats.
              My friend didn't want to wait and bought a 3 room flat in AMK for about 280k.
                      
              I'm sure TS could easily have found one in a less central location for less money.

              <p>do you even have your own flat? how old are you?</p>

              <p>the choice of a matrimonial home is a huge decision and a heavy financial commitment. if the threadstarter so decides that resale flats are out of his reach and decides that new flats offer more value, who are you to say his decision is wrong?</p>
              <p>are you paying for his flat? do you know that resale flats are (imho: unneccessarily) more expensive than new flats in the same area? (which doesnt make sense to me, esp on a 99 year lease)</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>personally i think you have to sort out your thoughts. what are you married and have kids for? If you think they are impt, you could have compromise to buy a resale flat at a location that is affordable or demand a lower cash.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I somehow relate that to nowadays youngster believe :"dont have a good uni degree, you are nothing".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think the reason you dont a unit is because you care choosy about location. coz in 2003-2005 there ar abundant of units in jurong west area and sengkang. unless you are looking for queenstown, redhill, etc.</p>

              <p>Let me relate my story. I am 30+ this year, married for three

              However, you need to use cash to pay for the cummulative interest
              accumulated over the period you have loan. And this means, that

              <p> </p>
              <p>In the HDB reply, they also point out that we can go for BTO

              <p> </p>
              <p>In addition, HDB also point out that they have shorten my queue
              number. In the last balloting exercise for 149 flats, my queue
              number is half of the total 1500++ application. My God! there are

              <p>And with queue number of 700 for 149 flats, it does not even get
              me any place nearer to choose a flat. So we continue our live as
              modern nomad...till the next balloting exercise we will try our
              luck again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The morale of the story is...(in my opinion)</p>
              <p>There is extreme shortage of HDB flats in Singapore, but if you
              are rich and can afford a condo or if you have lots of cash on-hand
              then you will not face housing problem like an average Joe.</p>
              <p>Don't get married, because you will not have flat problem</p>
              <p>Don't have kids, because it does not prioritize your chances of
              getting a flat.</p>
