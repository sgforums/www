              <p>the choice of a matrimonial home is a huge decision and a heavy

                          value, who are you to say his decision is wrong?</p>
              <p>are you paying for his flat? do you know that resale flats are

                              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me relate my story. I am 30+ this year, married for three
              years. My wife and I have been very supportive of the government's
              baby policy and we already have a baby.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We would like to have more kids, but our current situation does
              not allow us to do so. I will elaborate further.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since 2004, I have been balloting for HDB flat. And the queue
              number has been always extraordinary long. From not married, to
              married and now having a baby. I am a avid subscriber of HDB news,
              and a loyal HDB balloter. 5 years have passed and no flat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have brought up my case to my MP and MCYS and the reply from
              HDB is always to same...that is too look out for resale market. Now
              the problem is....a young married couple like us, and especially
              now with a new member in our family...how could we afford the
              upfront cash involved in resale flat transaction. To be honest, I
              am very disappointed with the kind of insensetive answers from the
              authority. To quote the actual word used by my MP, he thinks that I
              am super "suay". And also another quote from him, "Yes, you are
              first timer applicant, but first timer applicant with first timer
              priority does not guarantee you a first timer flat".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are other disadvantages of resale flat, which I will
              explain further.</p>
              <p>1. Possibility involvement of high cash payment, pending to the
              seller. Which equate to no more money to pay for renovation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Yes, you can use CPF to pay the loan (whether bank or HDB).
              However, you need to use cash to pay for the cummulative interest
              accumulated over the period you have loan. And this means, that
              when you are old, make sure you have lots of cash to pay for the
              interest accumulated over 20 to 30 years. It could amount to $1000
              a month for a period of 3 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. As a first timer, you are entitled government grant if you
              buy resale flat. When you decide to give up this resale flat for a
              new HDB flat, you have to pay back this government grant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. The unknown history of the flat, whether wear, tear or
              others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the HDB reply, they also point out that we can go for BTO
              (Build To Order) flat. Again, problem is we are
              already married with baby, how can we wait 3 years?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In addition, HDB also point out that they have shorten my queue
              number. In the last balloting exercise for 149 flats, my queue
              number is half of the total 1500++ application. My God! there are
              bascially 10 applicants competing for 1 HDB unit. Does the head of
              HDB even aware there is an extreme shortage of flats in
              Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And with queue number of 700 for 149 flats, it does not even get
              me any place nearer to choose a flat. So we continue our live as
              modern nomad...till the next balloting exercise we will try our
              luck again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The morale of the story is...(in my opinion)</p>
              <p>There is extreme shortage of HDB flats in Singapore, but if you
              are rich and can afford a condo or if you have lots of cash on-hand
              then you will not face housing problem like an average Joe.</p>
              <p>Don't get married, because you will not have flat problem</p>
              <p>Don't have kids, because it does not prioritize your chances of
              getting a flat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you for your attention and please share your thoughts.</p>
              <p> </p>
                            </div>

              i think it is a bit unrealistic to expect the supply of flats to meet the demand as these are supposedly the cheapest kind of accommodation available to the average Joe.

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I didn't expect lots of responses. But here are my thoughts after readings. Yes I must admit, I am a cry baby now....I am crying for HELP!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Yes, I did ballot for Jurong West and even Lakeside flats. In fact, my last application was Lakeside which is so far west from ours parent's place. And my queue number is still 800++ out of 1500</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. The reason why I didn't choose Sengkang and  Punggol is because they are not available for balloting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. In my first mail, I mentioned BTO is not an option for us. We have started my family and we already have kids. I am not quite choosy for place, but because we have kid now, we want to stay near our parents like mine is in SengKang and hers is in Jurong West. So place like Punggol is not quite an ideal option. I mean no offence but the big plan for Punggol 21 started in 1997 and now after more than 10 years, its still Punggol 21. So the reality is I am really skeptical about the development of Punggol despite the fact that the government has pushed for it three times. If its just the two of us, then any place will do. But now having a kid, we definitely need some place nearer to our parents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Of course we married for love. But We are frustrated. We have gotten married and no flat. We have kid and no flat. It seems the state does not give us priority at all. Or like the multi-million dollar tax payer paid MP mentioned, "You are damn super suay"</p>

              <p>i don't mean to be judgemental but don't you think you should plan your life according to the situation rather than expect the situation to fit into your life?</p>
              <p>those balloting, bto, up front cash, etc don't appear overnight, so don't you should have taken these into consideration before you start your family?</p>

No great shortage in areas you don't want (Punggol 21). There are flats BTO and resale but you cannot afford them. So your thread title is misleading.</p></div>

                              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me relate my story. I am 30+ this year, married for three
              years. My wife and I have been very supportive of the government's
              baby policy and we already have a baby.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We would like to have more kids, but our current situation does
              not allow us to do so. I will elaborate further.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since 2004, I have been balloting for HDB flat. And the queue
              number has been always extraordinary long. From not married, to
              married and now having a baby. I am a avid subscriber of HDB news,
              and a loyal HDB balloter. 5 years have passed and no flat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have brought up my case to my MP and MCYS and the reply from
              HDB is always to same...that is too look out for resale market. Now
              the problem is....a young married couple like us, and especially
              now with a new member in our family...how could we afford the
              upfront cash involved in resale flat transaction. To be honest, I
              am very disappointed with the kind of insensetive answers from the
              authority. To quote the actual word used by my MP, he thinks that I
              am super "suay". And also another quote from him, "Yes, you are
              first timer applicant, but first timer applicant with first timer
              priority does not guarantee you a first timer flat".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are other disadvantages of resale flat, which I will
              explain further.</p>
              <p>1. Possibility involvement of high cash payment, pending to the
              seller. Which equate to no more money to pay for renovation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Yes, you can use CPF to pay the loan (whether bank or HDB).
              However, you need to use cash to pay for the cummulative interest
              accumulated over the period you have loan. And this means, that
              when you are old, make sure you have lots of cash to pay for the
              interest accumulated over 20 to 30 years. It could amount to $1000
              a month for a period of 3 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. As a first timer, you are entitled government grant if you
              buy resale flat. When you decide to give up this resale flat for a
              new HDB flat, you have to pay back this government grant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. The unknown history of the flat, whether wear, tear or
              others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the HDB reply, they also point out that we can go for BTO
              (Build To Order) flat. Again, problem is we are
              already married with baby, how can we wait 3 years?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In addition, HDB also point out that they have shorten my queue
              number. In the last balloting exercise for 149 flats, my queue
              number is half of the total 1500++ application. My God! there are
              bascially 10 applicants competing for 1 HDB unit. Does the head of
              HDB even aware there is an extreme shortage of flats in
              Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And with queue number of 700 for 149 flats, it does not even get
              me any place nearer to choose a flat. So we continue our live as
              modern nomad...till the next balloting exercise we will try our
              luck again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The morale of the story is...(in my opinion)</p>
              <p>There is extreme shortage of HDB flats in Singapore, but if you
              are rich and can afford a condo or if you have lots of cash on-hand
              then you will not face housing problem like an average Joe.</p>
              <p>Don't get married, because you will not have flat problem</p>
              <p>Don't have kids, because it does not prioritize your chances of
              getting a flat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you for your attention and please share your thoughts.</p>

              <p>Oh man. I think there's a terrible shortage of HDB flats in Singapore. But the posers who mentioned about being choosy over location - you guys are quite right. I'm gonna try my luck balloting when I return to Singapore but I'm so adverse to staying in Punggol! It's so, far. Nevertheless, I don't think supply is meeting demand to be honest. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To the OP: I think I can understand your pains. With a kid in your marriage, you are quite limited in the sense that you have to live near your parents so that they can help take care of your child? (I'm assuming you don't wanna pay for childcare). So I think your best bet is a resale flat. To be honest, I think they would be bigger and in more convenient locations and on the plus side you probably get it soon. With regards to upfront cash payment, I know banks probably ain't loaning anymore so you have got to settle for a zero cash above valuation flat I guess. I believe there should be quite a number out there, you gotta take a compromise on quality and furnishings though.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, you could work out a better system of picking your kid up after work from your parents before heading home? That way you dont have to stay near your parents and have more options in choosing resale flats. I mean, SIngapore is still quite well-connected after all. Ultimately, i think you have options, you just need to really consider what you want. You don't have to buy a new HDB after you got your resale flat, I mean - just continue living in it I guess :)</p>
              <p>I guess one of the lessons I'll be taking away from your example is to start early... which is why I'm 21 and going to try this year!</p>
