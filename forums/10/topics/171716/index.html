            <div class='col-md body'>The script will take on a softer but more effective psychological conditioning approach to the public...No more chest thumping and propaganda harangue on loyalty, quitters/stayers, teamwork, multi-racial, more good years, economic progress, shouting matches of past generations as these have positive-negative, coersive and fear connotations that are highly debatable, given the better educated new voters.<br><br>Work on the values attitudes and lifestyles. To motivate the public with more material comfort, bigger cars, education. nevermind if everything else is more expensive. Have a more subtle approach with a tinge of hipness and individuality to attract the young. People have become more self-centred, not group-centric. E.g. 'everyone has a place in Singapore!'<br><br>Hence, the profile of those supporting the main party are associated with well balanced, educated professionals with stable income and family oriented values =&gt; these suggests a progressive individual with 'greater good years' in a global world surrounded by all the material needs. Nevermind if he has to regress into a kowtowing dog to the same top down machinaries.  Afterall, it is going to be the year of the dog.<br><br>While those old, poor, single, fringe type, spiteful, lunatics, idealist, jobless and what nots go with the opposition =&gt;losers fighting their own demons in a cave. However, all is not lost as compassionate baby steps to 'deliver' them from their plight and have a red/blue/white ribbon campaign (comes with a trendy wrist band) to re-integrate them back into mainstream behaviours is provided.<br><br>Hence, one will always know the majority party as the omnipresent and magnanimous machine, with daily news reports of all the good people and things that are being done. It blends with the current affairs, tabloids and the trends of current lifestyle needs and wants. This will also prevent any sane joe from challenging the boundaries and risk losing what the Jones are enjoying. Keep them preoccupied or striving for more material glut, nevermind if one will never have a voice, or to understand the meaning of democracy; as Pavlov needs to only salivate and not bark. Finally, these could very well be explained to bothersome foreign critiques as 'uniquely Singaporean traits' that sync well with centuries old Asian cultures and values like old emperors atop their loyal subjects, focus on the splendid white robe, not the decadence. A common analogy would be for one to select 2 differently programmed slot machines that kaching one into the richer/poorer divide, so its your choise. and don't forget the privilege membership to  the opulent casino, or would one rather be those mingling outside, raising placards and staging protests?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by anonymouscoward:</div><div class="quote_body">you guys are missing the point... nobody is doubting that PAP will win but what do you think PAP should do to get a true landslide mandate (not the self proclaim, fake mandate)<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
