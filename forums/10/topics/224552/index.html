            <div class='col-md body'>Hey OM, read this<br><br><blockquote>... According to the Helsinki-based institute 'rich vs poor' study for which there is only limited data, in 2000, a couple needed capital of US$1 million to be among the top 1 percent on the wealth list -- the richest 37 million people in the world.... And it also found that net assets of US$2,200 per adult would put a household in the top half of the world wealth distribution....</blockquote>So if our poor benefited &gt;S$13,000 in kinds, how's that they are still poor, did you see any catalytical benefits realised in the 'homes' of the poor, in their daily lives (S$1000 a month plus 13th month bonus)? - U sure know how to crack my arse, incidentally, thanks to u, I am using that area there to think! An ang bao a year together with the 'hand-outs' for that particular highly hyped generosity month and that leave 11 months of maggie mee... better NOT fall sick!<br><br>Doing good is never enough, is that <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">all</span></strong> they can provide? Hello, they are paid millions of dollars in cold figures... what is S$13,000 in abstract kinds? It's the day to day living expenditures not just the benefits amounts per se lah.<br><br>Proof of posting is not proof of delivery. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> What better ways is to hear from the poors who received what you claimed benefits in total if their lives actually improved for the better as a result of all these efforts, after 41 years have enough targetted aids done? etc... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Found this funny story in a book about maths abuse. ItÂ’s easier for a layman like me to understand.<br><br>A man was walking home from work when he spotted a $5 bill on the pavement. He picked it up and put in his pocket. His other pocket already contained a $10 bill. The man smiled. Â“My wealth has increased by 50%,Â” he said to himself.<br>Unfortunately, the pocket that held the $5 bill had a hole in it. When he went home, he discovered to his dismay that the $5 was missing. Â“ThatÂ’s not so bad,Â” he said. Â“ earlier, my wealth was increased by 50 percent, now it has decreased by only 33 percent. IÂ’m still ahead by 17 percent!Â”<br><br>Such a claim made by this man succeeds in making something out of nothing<br>Did the man gain any money by first finding, then losing, the same amount?<br><br>Is this not similar to what the government  is doing? Give $5 and then take it back by another means and says, Â“Hey, we gave you money. Yeah, we took it back later but youÂ’re still better off!Â”<br><br>If one listens to the number and donÂ’t think about them too much, it sounds like the government is doing a good job or an even better job than ever.<br></div>
