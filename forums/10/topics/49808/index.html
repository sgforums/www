            <div class='col-md body'>Censorship in Singapore is more like a knee jerk reaction to a scene/topic, without any coherent well thought out process or justification.  This comes from a closed system that bestows authority to a few people to work things out for everyone, without taking in any outside discussion or analysis.  I've long since given up on trying to understand them - because there is nothing to understand.</div>
