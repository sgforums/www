But THIS YEAR's CNY, The sight was very much "beautiful" across Malaysian's skies, with fireworks, of course!<br><br>There... It's Chinese New Year's Eve and one of my young cousins, aged about 10, was playing firecrackers and fireworks on his street.<br>But unlucky enough, one of his crackers flew to a front of a Malaysian police patrol car...<br><br>To solve this problem, my cousin gave the policeman a RM10 <span style="font-style: italic;">Ang Bao </span> and the policeman open one eye and shut the other...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>So much FUN, I was having  with the firecrackers and fireworks though it was illegal...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scene 2:</span></strong><br><br>I saw this WITH MY OWN EYES!<br><br>It was CNY and was a Malaysian public holiday for all. But there were "hardworking" people in Malaysia. One of them were the Malaysian Trash Collectors, without them trash would have accumulate at home during CNY.<br><br>There... It was CNY's first day. Happily all my relatives and I was busy having fun. Then... A smell came... and flies came... Then we saw a garbage truck at out doorstep...<br><br>To avoid giving  <span style="font-style: italic;">Ang Bao </span> to them, the garbage men, we send our kid to give them garbage only... But then, the garbage men did not leave but was compressing garbage with a little garbage water *Urg  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> *  Then we quickly gave them a <span style="font-style: italic;">Ang Bao </span> and ask them to leave.<br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Ang Bao </span> giving was very much, almost traditional every CNY, my relatives say.<br><br>Though nothing really much to fuss about, since it was a happy CNY. But this really "helps" in the reputation of the garbage men...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> (Well, they already did not have a good image...)<br><br>Dr. Mahathir NOW REALLY needs to watch out for his people...<br><br>(It's quite obvious his Garbage Men and Policemen were under-paid or something...)<br><br>These scenes prove one thing, "MALAYSIA! Truly ASIA!"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Haiz...
