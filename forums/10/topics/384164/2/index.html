              <p>Shy is not in my dictionary. And as i said so many times, there is no $$$ here, so, there is nothing to smile about. We are just merely doing some soul searching here.</p>
              <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I would to thanks, Bill Gates for windows and microsoft, peoples for technologies and the govt for giving us a peaceful access to internet posting which enable us to be connected, be if foes or friends, we are united. Let continue to support our govt so that we will have many good years to come in posting and fun.</p>

              <p>Finally, the X-rated Fraud appears as anticipated to play its role as an X-rated Hero in a X-rated Plot specially crafted for its part that satisfy both the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.jarofjuice.com/2008/03/attention-seeking-syndrome-the-early-experiences/">‘<strong>A.S.S.</strong>’  </a>of an X-rated Fraud and an "Attention Seeking Whore".</p>

              <p><br>It is with utter horror and revulsion that I watched the repetitive and continued senseless personal attacks hurled against you by that repulsive piece of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">self-admitted</span> shit known as Atobe.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Atobe and not even an <a rel="nofollow" href="http://dictionary.reverso.net/spanish-english/aturdir">‘ATurdie’ ?</a></p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the fraud never fail to appear with its own self-created delusion to continue with its fantasy of anyone to be "self-admitted shit" - except perhaps for its own actions that certainly confirms its fraudulent effort to conceal its own origins from a Turd World Country of Turdistan.</p>
              <p>It is obvious that the X-rated Fraud will find common ground with the Taiwanese 'hum' - as both are here in this Speaker's Corner to derail the threads, with their deliberate actions that parallel the PAP efforts to spread lies and falsehood to conceal the truth of the political realities in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Infact, it is more than personal - it went even to a lady's modest private part, such as the post I qouted from that detestable nick and placed on top. If this is not a verbal outrage of modesty, i know not what else is!</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The X-rated Fraud must be commended for its ability to discern words related to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">a lady's modest private part</span></em>" when it can get confused with simpler words expressed by the Taiwanese 'hum' and will contradict with its own hopeless display of pseudo-intellect in the thread - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/383807">”Philip Jeyaretnam clarifies mis-reporting by Straits Times” </a></p>
              <p><strong>[Quote]</strong></p>
              <p>It is not pathetic for the X-rated Fraud to be unable to note that the Taiwanese 'hum' - that it sees as an angel with a capital 'A' - had a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">totally different view</span></strong> from its own fraudelent interpretation of the reporter's intentions.</p>
              <p>While the X-rated Fraud read the post as "<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>no more than a curiousity that the reporter thought would be of an interest to readers, and thus the focus was on this famous son, on his thoughts and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not about his father</span></span> </em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">or his</span></span> up and comming politician</em> <em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">brother</span></span></em></span></span> "</p>
              <p>- its 'angelic' Taiwanese 'hum' had intepreted it as - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">not interested in his position, that wouldn't bring much news and front page sensational in the media,</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">his brother and late father is the ultimate news the reporters wanted</span></span></em>".</p>

              <p>Why does the X-rated Fraud not attend to the various exposures of its embarrassing role as a determined X-rated Fraud ? </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>With the abilities of the X-rated Fraud to mis-read simpler words, and its remarkable attempts to distort the truth, can anyone excel the X-rated Fraud skills in the art of "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">fabrication</span></em>" of half-truths that is its X-rated specialty ? </p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>All this is constantly done to wear you out, to tire you, to sicken you, and hurt you, simply because that self admitted shit <strong>fears</strong> you and what you say, and longs to destroy the cheerfulness and humour you bring here, in place of the doom and gloom the fecal waste often used here to control and sow discord amongst politically naive others.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>This must be quite an enlightening insight into the thinking of an X-rated Fraud, who has again deluded itself with its own perceived greatness to think that it will need to be feared by anyone.</p>
              <p>It is certainly surprising to know of its X-rated reaction in receiving similar attention to expose its pseudo-intellect, and now admit to being "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">tired out, sickened and hurt</span></em>" ?</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Unfortunately for that nick, not many are naive anymore, and are in fact sicken by such attacks.</p>
              <p>That nick used by the self admitted piece is beyond any words of condemnation by such distatesful actions, a reputation tattered and torn by the revelation of what that nick truly is after so many long years here, and a constant reminder of deprivaties used by that nick to be remembered notoriously with disgust forever, no matter what else is to be said comming from that name.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not amazing that the X-rated Fraud is afraid of "that nick" after having the tables turned on its X-rated attempts to tarnish others with its childish perversion of other's creativity by plagiarizing their words but fail to deliver it with any of its skills that are at best X-rated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I personally thank you for your fortitude, your courageous resilence to show readers here, for <strong>unmasking that foul cretin and what that despicable nick politically stands for.</strong></p>
              <p>Even though as hideous as those attacks had been, your cheerfulness and aplomb had never diminished, an attitude many can learn from in the face of cruel and senseless gross attacks by spiteful others.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The X-rated Fraud certainly has alot to learn and pick-up from a Taiwanese 'hum' - as it can only feel frustrated with all the attention to feel "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">tired, sickened, and hurt</span></em>" - while the Taiwanese 'hum' continue with its 'la la la' attitude to continue with its efforts to derail every thread in this Speaker's Corner that reveal the ugly political reality in Singapore.</p>
              <p>It is not a surprise that the X-rated Fraud will be so eager to defend its X-rated partner in their joint efforts to pervert the Speaker's Corner with their fraudulent efforts.</p>

              <p>Shakespeare must be touched with the performance of the romantic duo in this Speaker's Corner, with the moving display in a X-rated attraction between the Taiwanese 'hum' to the X-rated Fraud.</p>
              <p>In the brilliant attempt that is characteristic of the Taiwanese 'hum' to distract and derail a thread, it has yet again derail this thread with the help of the X-rated Fraud with their combined efforts in irrelevance and irrerevance to deny the truth from being spread.</p>
              <p>It is not a surprise that both are inflicted with the common <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.jarofjuice.com/2008/03/attention-seeking-syndrome-the-early-experiences/">‘<strong>A.S.S.</strong>’  </a>- as seen in their perpetual attempts to satisfy their common identical needs as the infamous X-rated "Attention Seeking Whores".</p>

              <p>Can the word 'shy' exist in a Taiwanese 'hum' - who will shamelessly wag its 'clitoris' even when it has nothing of substance to offer in any thread ?</p>
              <p>If connecting to the internet is only intended to spread one's frivolous mischief with ignorance and misleading information - it is not a surprise that the word 'shy' does not exist in the sly methods of a Taiwanese 'hum' to spread the PAP propaganda.</p>
              <p>The "Attention Seeking Whore" will continue to ply its thread with its X-rated Fraud as its angel standing with its X-rated pseudo-intellect, both joining forces to spread the well learnt propaganda crafted by their Masters in White.</p>
