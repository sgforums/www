            <div class='col-md body'>i would say that govt is the cause of inflation:<br><br>Prices - A Relentless Spiral<br>Creeping pre-GST price hikes tighten the pockets of Singaporeans.<br>By Seah Chiang Nee, littlespeck.com<br>Jun 16, 2007<br><br>MIDDLE class Singaporeans are being weighed down by rising costs of daily necessities that seem to show no sign of abatement.<br><br>Hardly a week passes without a report or two of some service or bread-and-butter item becoming more expensive and biting into peopleÂ’s fixed incomes.<br><br>The surge started with condos (one that cost S$1mil or RM2.2 a year ago is now S$1.3mil or RM2.9) and cars, moving to the MRT, buses, taxis, hospitals, polyclinics, mail and utilities.<br><br>The latest one hit some 750,000 households who subscribe to cable TV. They will soon have to pay S$4 more for the Basic Package Â– and a whooping S$15 (up from S$5) for the sports channels that televise English football.<br><br>This has got soccer fans hopping mad with some threatening to cancel subscription, an unlikely solution since cable television is a monopoly run by a single operator.<br><br>It is also the most important source of entertainment for the Singapore family, which is embittered at the arbitrary hike and the absence of a market alternative.<br><br>In recent weeks, inflation worsened as merchants jumped into the bandwagon, hiking prices in restaurants, supermarkets, food courts, coffee shops and retail outlets.<br><br>This affects the budget of every Singaporean but the hardest hit are the middle class and lower-income workers.<br><br>To put it in perspective, not all shops everywhere are doing it and those that do are not raising prices for every single item in their premises.<br><br>It is a sporadic, selective practice that depends on the person and the location. Some are reluctant to charge more for fear of losing customers.<br><br>A stall near my home has just hiked his nasi lemak and mee rebus from S$2 to S$2.20. Across the road, a glass of sugar cane water is up 20 cents to S$1.20.<br><br>In some places Â– but not all Â– chicken rice, the closest to a national dish here, now costs 50 cents more at S$3.50. Condensed milk, bubble tea and Campbell soup have become dearer.<br><br>For consumers, the worst is to come. On July 1, Singaporeans will have to pay a higher Goods and Services Tax (GST) when it is increased from 5 to 7%.<br><br>Â“The price increases look unstoppable and the government is either unable or unwilling to take action to deal with it,Â” said a retired teacher.<br><br>In the governmentÂ’s view, inflation here is largely imported or due to globalisation and represents only an insignificant rise in the Consumer Price Index.<br><br>The only watchdog, the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), has been a relative bystander especially when the perpetrator is the government or a Temasek-linked company.<br><br>Inflation is not only a Singaporean phenomenon. It is also threatening stronger economies like the US and China, which are considering higher interest rates to dampen it.<br><br>With an expected growth of 6% this year, Singapore is not spared.<br><br>But the governmentÂ’s strong business role and preoccupation with the bottom line are part of the dilemma.<br><br>There are other official causes. Firstly, the authorities themselves had started the ball rolling when they raised charges for public services like education, hospitals and utilities.<br><br>Secondly, the government is SingaporeÂ’s biggest landowner, owning some 70% of it and thus has a powerful say on prices. Rents in Temasek-controlled commercial and shopping properties have risen significantly.<br><br>The impact on the retail trade is inevitable.<br><br>In addition some of these linked companies operate a total or near-monopoly services that limit market competition.<br><br>Â“Monopolistic price increases have happened all too often,Â” a commentator of current affairs observed.<br><br>Â“It is time the ministers form a committee to look into government monopoly or cartel collusion to fix prices to ensure there is no infringement of the Fair Trading ActÂ”.<br><br>What is more worrying is structural inflation.<br><br>As it speeds towards becoming into a global city with a large number of rich and talented foreigners, Singapore would likely take on a new high-cost structure.<br><br>Becoming another city like New York, Tokyo or Paris, stirs excitement, but the cost of living is bound to take after them as well.<br><br>The present predicament may be a sign of things to come. SingaporeÂ’s economy is gradually favouring the businessman over the ordinary worker.<br><br>Some economists think the price surge will eventually settle back when the economy slows.<br><br>Â“But many of the basic food prices, once raised, will not become cheaper ever again,Â” exclaimed a housewife. Â“WeÂ’re stuck with them.Â”<br><br>There is rumbling in the heartland where 85% of Singaporeans live. The price hikes of basic goods and services are hurting many citizens with average or low incomes.<br><br>The government is watching with some concern, although it has so far taken little public steps to combat the snowballing increases.<br><br>When the GST increase comes into effect next month, the Singaporean pocket will be hit even harder. He will have to pay a 7% tax of almost every product or service, unless an exemption is stipulated.<br><br>The authorities are dishing out S$100-S$400 a year to each adult over next four years to mitigate its impact. The poorer people get the higher sum.<br><br>Apart from possible political fallout, the government will likely want to prevent higher costs from derailing its strategy of attracting foreign investment and talent.<br><br>Already American businessmen have complained that spiralling rents are creating problems for them, forcing a number to relocate elsewhere.<br><br>Cases of condo rents at choice areas rising up to by 50-70% once a lease expires have been growing, a trend that could benefit SingaporeÂ’s neighbours.</div>
