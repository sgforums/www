After i go back to Singapore...I learnt to appreciate Singapore more ...<br><br>The food, the clean surrounding, etc...<br>Every country has its pros and cons and after that 6 mths stay in Shanghai and after my frad tour in TAiwan...<br><br>i am damn sure now that i am PROUD to be a SINGAPOREAN...<br><br>We are rude....yes...Our service pales in comparison to Taiwanese....<br>In fact, every service in SINGAPORE, MALAYSIA, INDONESIA, PHILIPPINEs, etc sucks...<br><br>Best Services are offered in JApan and Taiwan....WHY???<br>Cos their country is filled with people and not many good jobs....<br>In Jap...Pretty gals become AV stars...Else the rest lead Fucked up office life...<br>Those wif poor education can only get into service sector and if they dun have good service...they can be easily replaced....<br><br>Same goes for TAiwan.... They have so many University etc...but not enough jobs... Singapore job market has been expanding and there's so many jobs...<br>Those in service sector can easily switch jobs and thus they dun need to act being courteous to preserve their jobs... I rather have a country full of job opportunities than one that is great in service but lacking in jobs...<br><br>GO CHINA and see lah... SERVICE SUCKS in most rural areas but service is gd in shopping centres cos those in service sector have to be courteous in order to preserve their jobs...<br><br>As for sex...Yup....we ranked poorly in sex...Stressful life in singapore ..wat do u expect..??<br>In general, Singaporeans are a conservatve lot but that is slowly changing...<br>U MAY BE POOR IN SEX BUT NOT THE NEXT GENERATION with the easy access to Internet nowadays enables them to easliy downlaod Jap porn to learn the techniques.. U think Tammy is just an isolated case ??? U will be damn wrong..<br>The kids nowadays are damn HAPPENING.... If u have frds who are teachers in primary sch...ask them for the stories ...<br><br>As a fellow Singaporean, I advise all of u to be more open minded and more streetwise cos we are really CAI TAO (VEgetable head) out there in the world as we are especially naive.....

But the lack of it is still  justified...Cos of the opportunities to job hop....<br><br>Wat i wanna address is that SINGAPOREANS have NO PROBLEMS...<br>The problem is the environment that we are brought up...The environment that PAP has shaped...I agree that our society today has it's faults but in comparison...we are stilll lucky lot..<br><br>But then as the world become more and more globalised...We need major changes in order to keep up our competitiveness..<br>Wat may work in the past will definitely not work in future if things are to stay as they are now..<br><br>Points to ponder:<br>1) Over influx of foreign talents to saturate our country and steal our jobs ..especially the jobs of fresh graduates..<br><br>2) Inflation.... The way and speed, the standard of living increase nowadays is ridiculous... Yes...Prices do inflate overtime but so must PAY !!! When was the last general increase in pay ?? When crisis hits, yeah...Everyone gotta take pay cuts....it was understandable...But when crisis is over, the pay cuts remains but price of stuff went up..Foreign talents can happily work in Singapore and take lower pay cos the standard of living in their home country is lower ...But how abt Singaporeans ?? We need to eat also leh... We also need to live comfortably ...<br><br>3) The rising income gap.... Based on some report i read somewhere, the average income of Singaporeans per head is SGD 3000 +++....How many of us are earning that amount ??? Poly Grad ??? Look at all the aged around... So many people are not working...or working at a meagre SGD $1300 +++... So wat doe this means ?? It means that there'e tons of #@$%^&amp; super rich assholes around to contribute to such a statistics...These rich #$%^&amp; help to inflate the living standards and cause those at the lower income to struggle to maintain a comfortably standard of living.... Progress Package is just crap...Some candy to Singaporeans to show that the govt is doing something to lessen the gap when the situation is not improving...More need to be done.... GST will increase soon.... It's a matter of time<br><br>There's more SHIT that is going on in this tiny little red dot and it is getting worse ...The statistics the govt show abt growth of 7% blah blah is just statistics... How many of those growth benefits actually goes to the majority of Singaporeans ?? I guess TE**SEK ^&amp;LDING contributed 3% of that statistics... Hope i will not be sued for all these comments... There's an INTERNAL SECURITY ACT to limit our freedom of speech...<br><br>Haizzzzz....I really hope the govt will hear us and those MPs with their ever increasing payroll WILL NOT link their payroll increase with the general benefits of Singaporeans as a whole....<br><br>Opposition ....Hope u will do something... Prove to us that U can do a better job than the current cabinet...</div>
