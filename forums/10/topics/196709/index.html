Because whatever policies the gahment make out probably have very far-linked butterfly effect on your hamster... Unless your gahment make some stupid policies to make your family miserable and you killed yourself because you can't cope with the fact that you're already working like sh|t but it's barely enough to keep your family alive.. With accumulating bills and your gf just wish you've got at least reasonable financial stability and would be there to spend adequate time with her when she needs you.. And your hamster died because you're dead and nobody's around feed it... Then maybe? Or something close enough to that picture...?</div>
