But the lack of it is still  justified...Cos of the opportunities to job hop....<br><br>Wat i wanna address is that SINGAPOREANS have NO PROBLEMS...<br>The problem is the environment that we are brought up...The environment that PAP has shaped...I agree that our society today has it's faults but in comparison...we are stilll lucky lot..<br><br>But then as the world become more and more globalised...We need major changes in order to keep up our competitiveness..<br>Wat may work in the past will definitely not work in future if things are to stay as they are now..<br><br>Points to ponder:<br>1) Over influx of foreign talents to saturate our country and steal our jobs ..especially the jobs of fresh graduates..<br><br>2) Inflation.... The way and speed, the standard of living increase nowadays is ridiculous... Yes...Prices do inflate overtime but so must PAY !!! When was the last general increase in pay ?? When crisis hits, yeah...Everyone gotta take pay cuts....it was understandable...But when crisis is over, the pay cuts remains but price of stuff went up..Foreign talents can happily work in Singapore and take lower pay cos the standard of living in their home country is lower ...But how abt Singaporeans ?? We need to eat also leh... We also need to live comfortably ...<br><br>3) The rising income gap.... Based on some report i read somewhere, the average income of Singaporeans per head is SGD 3000 +++....How many of us are earning that amount ??? Poly Grad ??? Look at all the aged around... So many people are not working...or working at a meagre SGD $1300 +++... So wat doe this means ?? It means that there'e tons of #@$%^&amp; super rich assholes around to contribute to such a statistics...These rich #$%^&amp; help to inflate the living standards and cause those at the lower income to struggle to maintain a comfortably standard of living.... Progress Package is just crap...Some candy to Singaporeans to show that the govt is doing something to lessen the gap when the situation is not improving...More need to be done.... GST will increase soon.... It's a matter of time<br><br>There's more SHIT that is going on in this tiny little red dot and it is getting worse ...The statistics the govt show abt growth of 7% blah blah is just statistics... How many of those growth benefits actually goes to the majority of Singaporeans ?? I guess TE**SEK ^&amp;LDING contributed 3% of that statistics... Hope i will not be sued for all these comments... There's an INTERNAL SECURITY ACT to limit our freedom of speech...<br><br>Haizzzzz....I really hope the govt will hear us and those MPs with their ever increasing payroll WILL NOT link their payroll increase with the general benefits of Singaporeans as a whole....<br><br>Opposition ....Hope u will do something... Prove to us that U can do a better job than the current cabinet...</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  In fact, you've more or less stated my points already...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Except that I don't quite totally agree with you on the 'job availability' and 'service mentality'... I've seen PROFESSIONALS who ain't afraid of the lack of job at all... And they're HUMBLE... MOST HUMBLE and EXCELLENT in their SERVICE and attitude towards people below them... Though they consist of both Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans... I can only say MAJORITY of them are NON-Singaporeans...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  Anyway... These are all quite beside my point....<br><br>And another thing is PLEASE don't always do 'CHEAPO CAMPAIGNS' ONLY... What GEM CARDS and such... So what thereafter...?? Even the 10% SERVICE CHARGE restaurants often take from us... Whether if the STAFF really have a SHARE or not...??<br><br>I just can't help but to think that Singapore has got such a 'CHEAPO' strategy... 'Allowance' for NS... Ask for volunteers here and there... Work 'EXTRA' just so that you're not 'marked'.... END OF THE DAY, the $$$ still get into the SAME OLD POCKETS... DEFINITELY NOT MAJORITY of YOURS and MINE....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What I think we singaporean should do to be more humble, global smart and have some manner. We belong to a developed country and we should behave like one. Its a disgrace to me when my german colleague told me there was a time that this a bunch of singaporean who packed away the lobster during a company lunch buffet in America.<br><br>The increasing number of singaporeans who whine gets on my nerve sometime. Look at this forum and u will find many who will whine about ns lar, spg, gals look down on guys lar, can't find job with high pay lar and sex. Come on get a life and do something more worthwhile. Its not something that u seat down here and everything will change. There is so much things that I don't agree with the government and how the society works but I can't do it with bombastic words, so dun want to xia sway.<br><br>But there is one good thing about singapore is that we live in country with many races. We get to see different kind of culture in this tiny little country.</div>
