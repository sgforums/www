Is it true that government does listen to the people and people indeed could influence the government with power on certain major decisions e.g.<br><br>(1) Cost of living.<br><br>(2) Bus fare increases<br><br>(3) HDB Flat prices<br><br>(4) Employment of foreign workers where locals are bypassed.<br><br>(5) NKF type of problems<br><br>(6) Freedom of speech or political views or electing their own MPs without constraints by so many walkovers caused by GRC system.<br><br>etc.<br><br>Your views please.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If ministers reduce their salaries by 1/3 their salaries will still be the highest in the world and remain high enough to prevent them from corruption.<br><br>On top of receiving the highest salaries our ministers will still enjoy two-thirds of their last pay for life (soon after ministers abolish teachers' pension scheme in the 1970s just imagine) in the event or retiring after two terms of office. It is best deal of any remuneration package  in the whole world without having to prove any true worth (iron rice bowl as their jobs are not subject to hire and fire) unlike people in the private sector.<br><br>So why not make ministers' salary reduction as election platform to win back the trust of the people again.

            <div class='col-md body'>I did not read the article on people power. It doesn't apply to Singapore anyway.<br><br>To say frankly, I wish Singapore never prosper that fast. Now, a lot of people are losing jobs. People who are lowly-educated and not enough skills are retrenched and they take an eternity to find jobs. To help them, we have upgrading courses. And these courses aren't cheap. How to upgrade when they have no money? And the whatever CITREP doesn't help. You have to be an employee of the company to receive subsidies for your upgrading. And then there's the middle-aged workers. Once they hit 35 and holding pretty high posts in the company, the company will start preparations to retrench them.<br><br>Secondly, to help our economy, we increase our GST to 5%. While increasing will help minimize the impact, I don't really see a need. If people don't even want to spend money, does increasing help?<br><br>Thirdly, transport fares. Transport fares are ever increasing. Feeder buses used to cost lesser than the main ones, and now they cost the same as the main ones. What's more, feeder buses don't even travel as much as the main ones, yet we pay the same price as the main ones. And the new system of regulating bus fares, I think it really sucks. With Singapore's economy improving (according to PAP), we will be paying more and more, not decreasing in some years and increasing in other years.<br><br>Lastly, the education system. Teach less, learn more. While it's good, I think they meant it literally. Teach less = cut syllabus. Cut syllabus, how to learn more? You need basics to understand how something happens, which then leads to this and that and all. For the Sports School, glad that they finally allow students whose grades are poor yet are talented to enter. For through-train programs, I don't know the results. Waiting to see if it will really make Singapore students better or worse. Learning Chinese using English is good, but I wonder if it will create a reliance on English or even direct translation to Chinese. This could make our Chinese standards even worse.</div>
