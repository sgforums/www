Because too many 'rich' families will be inconvenienced? <br> <br> According to - <strong>'Measures to improve welfare of Foreign Domestic Workers'</strong>[<a href="http://www.938live.sg/News/Singapore/EDC100312-0000398/Measures_to_improve_welfare_of_Foreign_Domestic_Workers">93.8live, 12Mar2010</a>]: <em>"Presently, there are about <span style="color: red;">196,000 foreign domestic workers</span> (FDW) in Singapore." </em><br> <br> According to <strong>'Salaries of new Indonesian maids to rise to S$450'</strong> [<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1105453/1/.html">CNA, 18Jan2011</a>]- S$450/ month is the salary of an Indonesian maid in Singapore.<br> <br> <a href="http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/What%27s+sauce+for+the+goose+is+sauce+for+the+gander">What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</a> Perhaps the govt knows that SG economy will certainly collapse 
              overnight when many of foreign workers and maids see overnight salary 
              increments in line with the implementation of such a minimum salary 
              policy.<br> <br> Perhaps if the Singapore government is so intent on lavishing its rich 
              with the luxury of 'subsidised' maid services and its business 
              corporations through the exploitation of cheap foreign labour; then 
              wouldn't it be quite reasonable to request that the Singapore government
               treat all it's own citizens a more equally rather than with evasive 
              excuses such as <em>"When I talk to my grassroots leaders, I just did a 
              walkabout in my constituency, we also have to send another message, 
              which is that, only about 50 per cent of Singaporeans pay taxes." </em>K Shanmugam <strong>'Looking out for the young and old'</strong> [<a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC120312-0000040/Looking-out-for-the-young-and-old">CNA:12Mar2012</a>] Aren't GST and property tax are indeed taxes too?<br> <br> Shouldn't the GST credit scheme be renamed the salary top up scheme in lieu of the absent minimum salary scheme? <br> <br> Also, shouldn't the foreign domestic worker levy (currently: btw S$170 -
               265) also be increased given that in both services and construction 
              sector worker's employment levies will go up to $600/month?<br> <br> Since foreign domestic workers also add to the total population of 
              foreign workers residing in Singapore, why should those who employ maids
               be allowed to pay lesser levies as compared to other employment 
              sectors- and conversely, aren't Singaporean manual (domestic) workers 
              getting short changed given to the fact that anybody can employ a 
              foreign domestic worker at a relatively low levy as compared to other 
              sectors under the work permit scheme? Is the SG government trying to 
              send the signal that it is more desirable to have a maid in tow than to 
              employ a foreign worker other than as a maid in tow? That it is 
              desirable for someone else to have do your domestic chores for you? Are 
              Singaporean women really so calculative that they need to be bribed with
               cash handouts and discounts on work permit levies just to entice them 
              back to work- how much more handouts then should the disabled/ the 
              handicapped receive? <br> <br> Also, I cannot fathom why the S-pass is cheaper than a work permit to 
              attain since making work permits harder to attain would encourage 
              employers to employ more Singaporeans in lower skilled jobs, wouldn't a 
              relatively more expensive S/ employment pass encourage employers to 
              train-up and employ more Singaporeans in these higher paying positions? 
              Is Singapore's desire for a status and a high GDP too intense for its 
              own long term good?<br> <br> In commenting about the short fall in government revenues after 2016 in <strong>'New ways to raise revenue needed, says DPM Tharman'</strong> [<a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC120302-0000064/New-ways-to-raise-revenue-needed,-says-DPM-Tharman">TDY; 02Mar2012</a>][<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XWVCzfrBS-4/T1cWaLixjjI/AAAAAAAAAfI/K_RLXCaM4hE/s1600/120302-+New+ways+to+raise+revenue+needed,+says+DPM+Tharman,+quote.JPG">pict</a>];
               it might perhaps be good for Mr Tharman to also ask himself how long 
              more the rich should be allowed their foreign maids at subsidised levies
               whilst Singaporeans working as maids and nannies are being deliberately
               paid less due to the relatively cheap FDW maid levies.<br> <br> Once again, Singapore's overpaid ministers have shown themselves to be 
              good only in adding steroids to the Singapore economy. No wonder they 
              were the first to tag their own with the pinnacle of all Singaporean 
              salaries.<br> <br> Reference(s):<br> - <strong>'Foreign worker levies to increase, says MOM'</strong> [<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1112102/1/.html">CNA; 21Feb2011</a>]: <em>"There are nearly 1.1 million foreigners employed in Singapore as at end-2010. Out of the <strong>871,000 work permit holders</strong> employed in Singapore, 248,000 are in the construction industry....The 
              next big consumer of foreign workers is the services sector. Its present
               levy structure of S$170 to S$450 will go up to between S$300 and <strong>S$600</strong>. ...Employers of <strong>S Pass</strong> holders can expect an average increase of S$240 in the monthly levy 
              between now and 2013. The current levy of between S$110 to S$150 will go
               up to S$300 to <strong>S$450</strong> in two years time."</em><br> <br> <strong>PS</strong>: For those really in need of the assistance of a FDW: Aged (w 
              handicap), disabled or with young children: perhaps a levy subsidy can 
              be given according to need/ affordability however the FDW levy shouldn't
               be in first instance so excessively cheap to the extent that it becomes
               an embarrassment as compared to other levy- ditto the S-pass and 
              employment passes: a foreign banker/ lawyer is no more valuable then a 
              foreign construction worker if he were to quibble over the same 
              $300-600monthly  levy every month given his ostensibly high salary to 
              start with. If the banker/ lawyer cannot afford the $300-600/mth levy, 
              then neither can the construction worker... and the MOM ought appreciate
               that well too.</div>
