              <p>Hong Kong SAR has very affordable healthcare system, Australia has free healthcare system, whereas Singapore has very expensive healthcare system.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wonder if the Singapore system neglects it's elderlies because they have an inablity to pay for healthcare. In another thread, the mortality rate for above 45s to 75s are extremely high when compared to Australia. With higher mortality for the elderlies, there will be less patients for doctors, that could probably explain why the waiting time is shorter for Singapore than Australia, despite Australia having almost twice the doctor population per 100,000 compared to Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the snapshot below you will see the mortality for the age groups per country:</p>

              <p><br>I remembered few years ago I accompanied my mom to the poly clinic in Y_____ and witnessed a man in his late forties (I think not good in gauging agelah) begging and apologizing to the social worker and the counter cashier for having no money to pay for the medical checkup and the medicine which he clutched in his hands and refuse to let go.</p>
              <p>This was roughly what the conversation went like :-</p>
              <p>Sick man : 'Sorry miss, I don't have money. Can help or not?</p>
              <p>Social worker : Mr. So-so we cannot allow you to go without paying for the service rendered. No matter how you need to pay something.</p>
              <p>Counter cashier mumbled under her breath but loud enough for everyone within their vicinity to hear : 'No money don't come see doctor loh'</p>
              <p>Sick man : But Miss, I really don't have money at all. And I really need the medicine. Can we arrange something like when I got money I come back to pay you?</p>
              <p>Social worker very loud : 'Aiyah Mr. So-so, how can we do that? If everyone is like you then we will get very 'ma fan'. Why don't you go talk to your GRC MPs. You get them to help you then you come back and we will release the medicine. For now we don't charge you even for the consultation fees since you said you really have no money.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that I don't know what happen liao since my mom's number were called and we went in to the consultation room. I was like thinking ' Aiyoh people no money so poor thing already why some more drop the rock into the well to seal his fate'. Talk so loud as if other patients cannot hear. I mean it was like trying to embarrass the poor man. Already people so cham liao. And moreover it was really uncalled for that the counter cashier made such a nasty remark. If the man got money wouldn't you think he would try to embarrass himself publicly by begging? And this is poly clinic!

              <p>Which country cannot run the best health care system if it taxes, hoard or underspend on taxes and set up all the basic government services as GLCs to profiteer citizens by the billions and at the same time charge the highest market fees for every service like medicare until most ordinary citizens are heavily indebted and enslaved by such a system.</p>
              <p>If any country taxes in such a manner it could even provide free medicare at the best quality without batting an eyelid.</p>
