            <div class='col-md body'>Another defamation case.   they are ever so on the alert!!!  Sue sue sue!! What else????   Has anybody here read the article?<br>________________<br><br>Apr 27, 2007<br>AsiaOne<br><br>The Far Eastern Economic Review (Feer) magazine has filed an affidavit seeking permission to engage a Queen's Counsel (QC) to represent it in a defamation suit.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew are suing the magazine's publisher and its editor.<br><br>Mr Peter Low of Peter Low Partnership, lawyer for Feer, filed an affidavit to the High Court this week. Mr Low said this is because it could not get a Senior Counsel (SC) to act on its behalf and pointed to the complex nature of the case.<br><br>Senior Counsel are the local equivalent of the QC, who are top lawyers from Britain. Singapore has 45 SCs.<br><br>The hearing for the application to the High Court for a Queen's Counsel is set for May 10.<br><br>However yesterday, a Senior Counsel Harry Elias of Harry Elias Partnership told The Straits Times that he is Â“ready, willing and ableÂ” to represent Feer, if no SC came forward.<br><br>Â“As SC, it is incumbent on us to say we are ready to help...I would argue the case as I would for any other client, without fear or favourÂ”, said Mr Elias.<br><br>Mr Low, who applied to engage QC Gavin James Millar represent Feer, declined to comment.<br><br>Review Publishing and Feer editor Hugo Restall are being sued by PM Lee and MM Lee for an article which the magazine published last July.<br><br>The article questioned whether Singapore deserved its reputation for having a "squeaky-clean government". PM Lee and MM Lee said the article had set out to disparage them.<br><br>In his application, Mr Low said that QC Millar had successfully argued several high-profile defamtion cases in Britain. He also sought to have Mr Millar to represent Feer in its current bid to throw out the defamation suit.<br><br>Feer, a monthly magazine, has already failed twice to dismiss the case and the hearing for its third and last attempt will be held in July.<br><br>Â» Have your say on this and other issues in our forum pages<br></div>
