            <div class='col-md body'>Its just how our economy was built.  Also the social culture here in Singapore and how it has developed. A culture that was based on money. Fines for everything. Always including a financial cost for something the government discourages. Like ERP and COE to reduce traffic congestions, but then why are car made for affordable then? why the removal of the 30% mandatory down payment and then charge higher ERP? Classic example of Selective protectionistsm by the govt. (in this case, the banks were being protected)<br><br>From the early 90s, there was a frustration among Singaporeans that has been building up ever so gradually. Singaporeans bite the bullet, work 60 hour weeks to keep their jobs. Almost no social security, the fear of dying on the street due to no income hence no medical care, is a ever-present and constant worry among working middle class. To a point that the government, facing criticism of not promoting work-life balance, has started some worklife initiatives.<br><br>A first world nation, where only a minority elite enjoy first world comforts (not just material, but psychological and social as well.) While the huge majority of the workforce are left to chase their rice bowls (peasant mentality). Should enjoying life be left to only the rich and elite?<br><br>The nation is now like a huge production machine, or rather was moving in that direction. They take the best scholars into govt service, a substantial portion of money earned by singaporeans, go back to government.<br><br>How?<br><br>Over 90% of Singapore live in HDB flats, which means CPF savings go back to government. With HDB prices being government controlled. Cost of building HDB flats was never revealed comprehensively.<br><br>How many of you have savings in Banks that are owned by Temasek holdings? Then again, money that doesn't go into CPF, goes into those banks, DBS, OCBC etc.. Again the cash is in the government hands.<br><br>no accountability on the failed investments with the CPF money.<br><br>Spread the word.. create awareness...</div>
