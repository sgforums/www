            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore distancing itself from Myanmar -analysts<br>Reuters<br><br>Reuters - 2 hours 36 minutes ago<br><br>BANGKOK, Oct 30 - While opposing sanctions against Myanmar in public, Singapore's government and its banks in particular appear to be quietly distancing themselves from the ruling junta, analysts and bankers said on Tuesday.<br><br>Officially, Singapore has not deviated from the line given by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong a month ago, at the height of the junta's bloody crackdown on democracy protests, that sanctions would be unlikely to shunt Myanmar towards political reform.<br><br>But gradually, signs are emerging of institutions in the city-state pulling back from involvement with the generals, for whom Singapore is a top medical and leisure destination -- and widely believed to be home to their off-shore bank accounts.<br><br>"What's going on behind the scenes, particularly on the financial side, is de facto sanctions," said Sean Turnell, author of the Burma Economic Watch journal at Sydney's Macquarie University.<br><br>The latest indication of that is Air Bagan, a small Myanmar airline on a U.S. government blacklist that will suspend flights to Singapore from Nov. 5, travel agents say.<br><br>Singapore's Today newspaper said the final blow came when Singapore banks said they would "stop dealing with" the airline, owned by Htoo Trading, with close ties to the junta's top brass.<br><br>"That would seem to be an indication that Singapore either is lining up behind the sanctions, or that they have other financial concerns or issues with Air Bagan," said Victor Comras, architect of U.S. economic sanctions against Yugoslavia in the 1990s.<br><br>EASY TARGET<br><br>It is financial links to the likes of Air Bagan that have made Singapore a target for Myanmar activists and members of the U.S. Senate desperate to find a lever to use on the junta, a regime that seems to thrive on isolation.<br><br>Banking sources told Reuters that the Monetary Authority of Singapore was unlikely to ask banks to cut ties with Myanmar firms unless there were U.N. sanctions on the country.<br><br>"Without legal authority such as U.N. sanctions, it won't be possible," a Singapore-based banking source said.<br><br>The MAS and Singapore's three banks, DBS Group Holdings , Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp and United Overseas Bank , declined comment.<br><br>But a second banking source said banks were taking measures on their own to restrict links with Myanmar companies on a case by case basis. "It is not a blanket ban. If a customer comes to us, we can't turn him away," the banker said.<br><br>Activist group Burma Campaign UK lists 10 Singapore firms on its "Dirty List" of those with involvement in Myanmar, including the three banks and conglomerate Keppel Corp .<br><br>Foreign Minister George Yeo said on Monday Singapore would act according to international agreements.<br><br>"We are an international financial centre. Whatever policy we apply to Singapore banks, we must apply to all banks operating in Singapore," he told reporters.<br><br>The police announced last week Singapore would step up efforts to detect money laundering from Nov. 1 by requiring anyone carrying or transferring more than $20,650 in or out to submit a report to immigration authorities.<br><br>While Washington and Brussels have tightened the screw gradually, Singapore has become one of the biggest investors in the former Burma. Its three banks all have offices there and firms have poured money into hotels and tourism.<br><br>Singapore senior statesman Lee Kuan Yew told an American columnist he rued advising hotel companies to go in. "They have sunk in millions of dollars there and now their hotels are empty," he said. He also called the generals "rather dumb".<br><br>(Additional reporting by Saeed Azhar in Singapore and Darren Schuettler in Bangkok)<br><br><a href="http://nus.facebook.com/share_redirect.php?h=4d40add87b61a8154f4406d0b9940fca&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmalaysia.news.yahoo.com%2Frtrs%2F20071030%2Ftbs-myanmar-singapore-a5a65c6.html&amp;sid=5281024986" rel="nofollow">http://nus.facebook.com/share_redirect.php?h=4d40add87b61a8154f4406d0b9940fca&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmalaysia.news.yahoo.com%2Frtrs%2F20071030%2Ftbs-myanmar-singapore-a5a65c6.html&amp;sid=5281024986</a></div>

The main thing they care about is to maintain power," he said.<br><br>ASEAN is under intense international pressure to rein in the junta, whose crackdown on the protests led by Buddhist monks claimed at least 15 lives and sparked international outrage.<br><br>One shopkeeper, selling traditional food, said the United Nations and ASEAN should send military forces to "get Myanmar."<br><br>But Robert Maung, 50, expressed doubt about whether sanctions would work unless Myanmar's powerful neighbours China and India joined in.<br><br>"ASEAN can't do much," said Maung, who stopped to meet with a friend at his shop.<br><br>One young woman who arrived just 10 months ago and is studying management while working at her family's import-export shop said simply: "I don't want to go back."<br><br>Around the plaza's central atrium, young men leaned against the railing, chatting with each other.<br><br>Sunday is their day off, a chance to visit the plaza to get a haircut, buy a bottle of cheap whisky, eat fish salad or bamboo curry from home, or relax on the bare floor with a newspaper.<br><br>Weekends are also a busy time across town at Singapore's only Burmese Buddhist temple, where a steady stream of barefoot visitors prayed before a large image of Buddha with coloured lights flashing around his head.<br><br>Maung, who has lived in Singapore for 20 years, said Myanmar's powerful junta leader Than Shwe will dare not come to the city-state, and so has sent his "puppet" Thein Sein.<br><br>"He's just like an office boy," said the retired engineer.<br><br>Not everyone at the plaza spoke as frankly.<br><br>"As you know, in our country we cannot do politics freely," one man said, politely suggesting that he could not comment further.<br><br>Even if they did not say much, some merchants clearly displayed their sympathies, with pictures of Myanmar's detained pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi on the walls.<br><br>A red T-shirt hanging beside the cash register in a shop that lends out Burmese books bore the slogan: "We will never forget! We will never give up!"<br><br>Copyright Agence France-Presse, 2007 All reproduction and presentation rights reserved.</div>

Until the Philippines Congress sees that happen, it would have extreme difficulty in ratifying the Asean Charter."<br><br>The charter commits the region to economic integration, creates a rules-based legal entity and protects human rights, among other things.<br><br>In a final twist, it was revealed late last night that a controversial briefing to Asean leaders by United Nations Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari on the situation in Myanmar, which had been scheduled for tomorrow, has been scrapped after protests by Myanmar's Prime Minister Thein Sein.<br><br>Explaining the change, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong read out a statement last night detailing how during the leaders' dinner, <span style="color: red;">General Thein Sein had emphasised that Mr Gambari ought to only report to the UN Security Council</span> and not to the Asean or the East Asian Summit (EAS) leaders.<br><br><span style="color: red;">"Prime Minister Thein Sein made clear that the situation in Myammar is a domestic affair and that Myanmar was capable of handling the situation," </span>said Mr Lee, flanked by all the Asean heads of state except the Myanmar leader.</div>

After all, it's hypocritical when Burma doesn't want the Security Council involved when they want to consider this an international issue.<br><br>ASEAN covered Burma's ass and brought it back into the regional dialogue. And now when Gambari wants to address ASEAN, Burma wants to throw the ball back to the Security Council.<br><br>Time to end this table-tennis game. Thein Sein has made a fundamental error in judgement, and has eroded ASEAN's authority like a slap in the face, perhaps he knows with certainty that whatever issue that is thrown to the SC may face a Russian/China veto.<br><br>One more reason why ASEAN needs to remain resolute and not bow to blackmail from a nation that has no say in this whole matter given that they have massacred their own citizens in cold blood.<br><br>There are expatriate Burmese in Singapore calling for military intervention against the illegal regime of Burma.</div>

That was why Singapore thought it would be a good idea for Gambari to brief the East Asia Summit. That was Mr Lee's point,' said a person who listened to the speech.<br><br>Diplomats familiar with the developments said that there were some murmurs when Singapore initially mooted the proposal. But as no one objected to the idea, Singapore went ahead and invited Professor Gambari to address the summit.<br><br>However, even as the UN envoy was winging his way to Singapore from New York, the winds shifted.<br><br>Another diplomat said that as late as last Wednesday, Myanmar had said explicitly that it had no objections to the Gambari briefing.<br><br>But around the weekend, Myanmar sent word that the briefing was not a good idea, but did not reject it.<br><br>By then, said a summit participant, the Chinese had also voiced objections to the Gambari briefing for the EAS. But their concerns centred on whether the briefing would be in a formal setting, hence lending the EAS more weight over the Myanmar situation than China felt necessary.<br><br>Singapore, acting as the Asean chair, reassured China that the setting would be informal. The Chinese then relented.<br><br>Even as early as Monday morning, Myanmar Foreign Minister Nyan Win told his fellow Asean foreign ministers that it was acceptable for Prof Gambari to brief the Asean grouping, but not the EAS. The Asean leaders accepted this position, according to a source, especially after initial rumblings that some did not like the idea of the briefing going beyond the group's 10 members.<br><br>But by the time Myanmar's Prime Minister Thein Sein arrived in Singapore, there was a volte face. No Gambari briefing, he said.<br><br>'It was obvious he was here on a short leash,' said a diplomat.<br><br>'The real issue was never Gambari. The real issue is what role you want Asean to play,' he added.<br><br>At Monday's dinner discussion, which some observers described as 'heated', Mr Thein Sein simply would not budge.<br><br>There was no need for Prof Gambari to brief the East Asia Summit or the Asean leaders, he said firmly. Every Asean nation is a UN member and if they wanted Prof Gambari's report, they could ask their envoys to the United Nations in New York to get a report from him.<br><br>His message came down to this, said a person who listened to Mr Thein Sein's speech: 'I look after my own house. You cannot come in and rearrange the furniture. The furniture may not be great but I do it the way I want it. Period.'<br><br>Faced with his intransigence, other senior summit members spoke up. Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia suggested that this no longer could be considered a domestic matter.<br><br>One diplomat reported what was said by one leader: 'The rest of the world thinks that this is a matter that concerns Asean also and have begun to hit at us.'<br><br>Mr Thein Sein remained immovable. It is a matter between Myanmar and Prof Gambari, he said, and between Prof Gambari and his UN bosses.<br><br>Asean? The grouping has no role in it.<br><br>The entreaties were in vain. Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia wilted and made the point that 'one of our members is objecting'.<br><br>That was the end of the consensus.<br><br>That triggered the three-hour brainstorm among the leaders to come up with a Chairman's Statement to explain why they had to call off the Gambari briefing.<br><br>Just as family quarrels will inevitably have its eavesdroppers, the night's drama was heightened when a microphone was accidentally switched on and it fed back into the media room snippets of the leaders' angst-filled exchange on how to word the statement.<br><br>When Mr Lee finally appeared before the media, flanked by the others, the message had been crystallised to this: Myanmar was 'on its own' in its dealings with the UN and the international community.<br><br>Less than eight hours later, the man without an audience to brief landed here and immediately declared himself 'very disappointed' with Myanmar's stance.<br><br>But Asean's loss, as it turned out, proved to be individual members' gain, as several of them sought to meet Prof Gambari separately, including at co<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>cktails just before last night's gala dinner. Some even hugged him.<br><br>He met Philippine President Gloria Arroyo briefly and is scheduled to meet other leaders today.<br><br>One delegate described Myanmar's decision as one 'they will regret'.<br><br>But on Monday night, Mr Thein Sein did not look like he had lost his appetite over that thought. He ended his meal with ice cream ensemble and fruit, after he was done with his plain speaking.<br><br>velloor@sph.com.sg<br><br>suk@sph.com.sg<br><br>ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY CAROLYN HONG<br><br>-----------------------<br><br>SOME reactions to the cancellation of Professor Ibrahim Gambari's briefing:<br><br><strong>ANOTHER TIME</strong><br><br>'We live to fight another day.
