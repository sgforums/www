              <p>Dear Lionoasis,</p>
              <p>Singapore is not sinking but leaking badly.</p>
              <p>While the PAP government is trying to maintain an even keel, it is plugging holes at one end of the vessel, but causing new leaks elsewhere.</p>
              <p>The resilient and creative Singaporeans will know how to cope with the situation, and some have found new opportunities to survive the precarious situation.</p>
              <p>Those who are more resourceful have found themselves a dinghy, or a luxury yatch, even a private jet - that serves as a getaway for leisure and as an insurance.</p>
              <p>The remaining Singaporeans - who are less able to fend for themselves for a variety of reasons - will remain at the mercy of circumstances, with a Government that will not give any direct assistance in any significant ways that can alleviate this group from their desperate situation; but will place more demands on the entire population in the various communal self-help programs as the Government remain aloof to the situation that they have created.</p>
              <p>This will require more Singaporeans to be educated and informed of the present injustices and abuses.</p>
              <p>It will require more Singaporeans to be aware of the responsibility of each individual that the Rights of the Community must be protected from being hijacked by the Government for the most insignificant reasons.</p>
              <p>It will require the Community to be aware that the Individual, who is protecting the Community, will also need the support from the Community to protect the Individual.</p>
              <p>It is through this understanding that Singapore is not the exclusive project of any single political party.</p>
              <p>This Singapore project - which require as much support from Singaporeans - must also result in the interests of Singaporeans being protected first and foremost, and not the interests of any single Political Party, whether in power or waiting at the side-lines.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Dear Atobe,</p>
              <p>I am with you when you commented on the following:</p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">"This will require more Singaporeans to be educated and informed of the present injustices and abuses.</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">It will require more Singaporeans to be aware of the responsibility of each individual that the Rights of the Community must be protected from being hijacked by the Government for the most insignificant reasons."</span></em></strong></p>
              <p>I think there are reasons why certain subjects have been replaced by what are deemed "progressive" subjects that are more suitable for this day and age.  Back in younger days, we were taught lessons that would provide is a higher level of awareness for government accountability &amp; responsible citizenship.  These subject are now deleted, and for calculated objectives to make citizens more submissive or ignorant about government roles and missions.</p>
              <p>I think we have probably passed the point of no return and it will take a long to create awareness amongst citizens once again, if it does happen at all.</p>
              <p>Your views?</p>

              <p>Singapore is bound to failure if it keeps going on this route. Government expects people to take initiative but keep so many red-tape around that entrepreneurship keeps failing. The key investment board makes bad investments but there is no lesson learnt on why it makes bad investments. Government so bloody scared of religious boards that scientific and technological advances are being hindered. Think-tank bodies gives out so many possible routes to achieve certain objectives but government again becomes a coward when it needs to be immoral and vicious and takes the please-everyone course. Government better start to figure out what techno-preneur companies can become the flagship MNCs for Singapore and be able to start a minimum wage for all instead of worrying about business losses if foreign MNC leaves.</p>

              <p>There are probably two ways to escape the iceburg:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Better rader and manouvering ability;</li>
              <li>Stop and re-chart the course.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Unfortunately, for both options, the commoner being is left out.  We are asked to lend faith to the current leadership to steer us through.  No question tolerated it seems.  The passengers at the Titanic did not question the captain either...</p>
              <p>Well at least the passengers get some service, whereas here, we "service" them.</p>

              <p>Look Lionoasis, I do not know what is your true agenda, or want to know. yah, yah, ...you claim you are neutral, but c'mon,. it does not take even a village idiot to see what you are driving at.</p>
              <p>Why not just come clean and be yourself?</p>
              <p>Am I being to paranoid? No, look at what you are writing and implying - read your post again, and i plead others to read your posts above as well as the numerous others littered here.</p>
              <p>Using your same analogy, if you have a better idea to steer the Titanic out of its course, you think the captain isnt gonna accept it? But are you knowledgeable enough to come up with credible solutions that millions of others lives will depend on? Are you prepared to take that responsibility if it fails?</p>
              <p>Or will you just bad mouth the captain, who is doing his best, within his knowledge and capabities to bring everyone to safety, failing which, to save as many as possible, in the eventual fate that the titanic faced?</p>
              <p>Still, its your freedom of speech. But please, I plead, do not presume my fellow citizens are fools and not see thru duplicities. It is an insult.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not secretly against the government.  If you look at all my posts, you will find some consistency in my stance:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>I rate the government 7.5/10 - but there is a 2.5 that I feel compelled to discuss about.  Certainly for a person who takes on Atobe, this love-hate thing is not beyond your level of comprehension;</li>
              <li>There is no agenda, there exists people who are thinking broad base enough, and NOT interested in politics (at government level and/ or here in the forum) - I am one of these people;</li>
              <li>Intellectual Wrestlemania?  No thanks.</li>
              </ul>
