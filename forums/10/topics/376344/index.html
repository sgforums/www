              <p>I like this movie, and recently, I have had the chance to watch it again.  After a few years, I still appreciate the detailing, the emotions &amp; the effort put in.</p>
              <p>And then..., I thought the Titanic was in some ways much like our government!</p>
              <p>It was deemed the unsinkable ship, the passengers stayed in differnt classes (like day and night), there was not enough safty boats, there was no Plan B should the ship run into trouble, there was only two recce's at the lookout tower (and NOT paying much attention except the kissing between Jack &amp; Rose), it was not able to change direction just before hitting the iceburg &amp; finally, only a few people survived the disaster.</p>
              <p>I don't think we are this desperate, but the similarities are the following...</p>
              <p>Singapore is regarded as "unfailable" by many Singaporeans (we have had 44 years of uninterrupted progress); the gulf in differences between the rich and the poor is ever increasing; do we have sufficient retirement contingents or competitive edge (not opposing to FT of course); what lies ahead of the average Singaporeans - their Plan B; do our leaders have the vision to steer us through (the analogy of the two recce's, no radar); <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can we react effectively to the unexpected challenges in the world; who will survive after tomorrow?</span></p>
              <p>The final two questions (underlined) is something we need to ask ourselves, and asking just our government is not good enough.  They can lead, and we need to do our part.</p>
              <p>And as a follow up to my other forums - the 2.5 points they dun get from me are because of below par: accountability/ leadership/ care for lower end of social hierachy/ tapping local talents.</p>
              <p>So are we sinking?  Your turn to take the stage....</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Singapore is bound to failure if it keeps going on this route. Government expects people to take initiative but keep so many red-tape around that entrepreneurship keeps failing. The key investment board makes bad investments but there is no lesson learnt on why it makes bad investments. Government so bloody scared of religious boards that scientific and technological advances are being hindered. Think-tank bodies gives out so many possible routes to achieve certain objectives but government again becomes a coward when it needs to be immoral and vicious and takes the please-everyone course. Government better start to figure out what techno-preneur companies can become the flagship MNCs for Singapore and be able to start a minimum wage for all instead of worrying about business losses if foreign MNC leaves.</p></div>

              <p>I am taking an analogy with a soccer team.</p>
              <p>If you are the manager, how to open up if you know that your team cannot handle the offensive and defensive of the other soccer team.</p>
              <p>Although you have a strong team of soccer players who have studied and scored on the paper chase about playing soccer, you have a team of players who have never played a ball or even go to the field to kick a ball.</p>
              <p>That is what the soccer team we have now.</p>
              <p>So, you created an illusion that the present team is as good as the previous team with good scoring records.</p>
              <p>You paid million dollars to a paper qualified players and hope that he can play like ronaldo.</p>
              <p>The sad part of the illusion about the players is that he believe he is a good player cos he is paid million and not because he need to score a goal.</p>
              <p>How competent the team is clearly illustrated on what they have messed up so far in the last ten years.</p>

              <p>Medicated Oil,</p>
              <p>If I follow your analogy, our team seems to be looking down the table instead of challenging for the Title.  This is your point, yeah?</p>
              <p>Well, I think we are in the top 6, but are probably paid better than the Champions with no immediate pressure to deliver, the players are just too comfortable.  In addition, the Manager continues to pamper them, and the Board of Directors (the true owners of the club) can't do anything, as they have decided the Manager is the only talent in town and too powerful to be replaced... we hear this every year....very real very similar...</p>
              <p>I get your drift though...</p>

              <p><br>The Captain and his new crew at the Bridge are steering an old Titanic into unchartered waters, but will keep the more experienced crew in the engine room and perform the mundane jobs to build relations with the passengers and grow their loyalty to continue with the ship.</p>
              <p>With the Captain and his crew at the Bridge trained only with simulators that are all computerised with familiar training scenarios, and tested by trainers who have their own favorite training settings - can the team at the Bridge cope with new real world scenarios ?</p>
              <p>It becomes obvious that when they are put into the real world, their over-reliance on futuristice electronic systems have made them blind to the small quirks that can exist in the system that when left unattended, will have accumulated consequences in some major epic proportions over time..</p>
              <p>When electronic navigation system depends on the accuracy of the satellites that can be affected by "sun storms" - any inaccuracies measured by 1 minute latitude or longitude that are not picked up early, can send the Titanic totally off course after one hour at a determined set speed in the expected direction.</p>
              <p>When over dependance on electronics becomes a convenient habit, trusted old maps from ages past are seen to be dubious and discarded, even as it could be used with the old sextant to measure the stars and save the Titanic.</p>
              <p>Even as the Captain and his team at the Bridge are hopelessly lost, will they admit their failure, and call for help from the more experienced "old hands" that have been pushed below decks - to the less glamorous and mundane jobs ?</p>
              <p>Will they call for help from some of the passengers - who may possess the knowledge and training to fix the quirks in the systems installed onboard the Titanic ?</p>
              <p>Will they admit that not everyone in the Crew may have all the complete training nor familiarity with the new real world scenario, or will they simply prefer not to alarm the passengers and have them lose confidence to abandon ship too early ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, the Captain and his Crew will prefer to keep that prerogative to make that last call "to abandon ship" when they have prepared themselves for it.</p>

              <p>Reminds me of a quote I saw recently:</p>
              <p><em><strong>"The Titanic was built by 'Professionals', the Ark was built by 'Amateurs'..."</strong></em></p>
              <p>We all know what happened in both cases.</p>
              <p>Coincidentally the Amateurs really had passion in building the Ark, and had space for all living creatures. While the Professionals who did the Titanic was doing it for fame and fortune, and prepared enough fallback measures only for the rich.</p>
              <p>Pride comes before a fall, the Titanic could not survive when the lower class scrambled, realising the only way to save themselves was to fight over their survival with the rich and powerful.</p>
