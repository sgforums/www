            <div class='col-md body'>although the gabrament is sometimes "inhumane", let's temper this with some personal observations i've overheard from the kopitiams...<br><br>there is this ranter at the kopitiam near where i work.. occasionally, he'd rant about the gabrament.. one of his rants, i remembered.. take what you want from the rant (which was in hokkien):<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">the gabrament!! they are worse than dogs... people take 10 year car loan, have to pay $800 a month for 10 years! and when they cannot pay, they "pull away" (repossess) the car... i tell you the gabrament is terrible...</span><br><br>now.. here, we could be looking at some of those who refuse to practise financial prudence.. there was someone who worked for my organisation who was like that.. he didn't even have enough to pay for his flat yet he had a 2.4 litre car, wore expensive clothes, bought all kinds of crap like bowling balls, expensive shades and crap like that.. running up a credit card bill which he could never have a prayer of paying...<br><br>from what we heard, after not paying for his flat and his utilities for almost a year, they had to sue him for payment.. which caused him to be declared bankrupt..<br><br>things like that happen.. although some are, you have to look at the other side... we do have our own responsibilities to shoulder...<br><br></div>

They have a job to convince the rest of 66.6% not to give in to wrongs committed like the nkf has been doing.<br><br>For those who are the MPs, Civil Servants and the grass root, they are advised not to pretend nothing has happened or hip-hop to prove anything.<br><br>We remind them that and they are elected or nominated to do their jobs in speaking up against wrongs like over-charging people and not to be engaged in any hypocrisy to secure their own career advancements.<br><br>We are testing their courage by asking them to differ and disassociate from anything which are wrongs like over-charging by HDB or NKF hoarding of public monies which cause our present problems of high cost of living and over-spending by government on expensive facade and signposts etc many problems.<br><br>Eventually wrongs will have to be put right by the citizens.

Happy cny!<br>I'm a neutral party.<br><br>Regarding your statment above, you'll be surprise at the kind of people we sigaporeans are. The earlier post by The Bear about people spending beyond their means is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very</span> common. I guess most would not want to be in that kind of awkful situation of being forced to move out, but some people do not consider the future circumstances when something happen.<br><br>A friend, who's a RM for priority customers (approx net worth of above $200K) of a local bank said alot of his clients (be it priority or normal like us) are overly optimistic of their financials. They tend to purchase flats such that it will max out their CPF monies. Some of their monthly installments are even much more than their combined monthly CPF contribution by themselves and their employers, such that they have to top up substential amount of cash. Guess what happens when either party experiences a pay cut? (Dun even talk abt retrenchment here).<br><br>The truth is there are alot of people with this kind of thinking. When banks forced them out, they come up with funny excuses saying bank so immoral, so cruel so heartless. They'll then complain to their MP. The most the MP can do is just to send us a letter in his/her highest capacity. But ultimately it's up to the bank, as the contract is between the home owner and the bank.<br><br>However, most banks, because of public goodwill/reputation/whatever, will actually not repossesed the flat by force immediately. They'll sit down with the home owner to devise a payment schedule. It's usually only when their suggestions are not taken up, or that the owner does not seem promisable (pretend up front to agree but just trying to drag for time) that the bank issue lawyer letters to take back the flat.<br><br>Your view point is very valid, and is a problem people face. However, we have to sometimes consider both sides of the coin. The home owner in question is not entirely responsible to himself and his family in the first place, hence now he'll have to suffer the consequences.<br><br>The same happens with credit card/credit line/credit facilities debt. Chalking up above $5000 of credit debt is not uncommon where one's income is just $2.5k/month. When a one loss his/her job, and complain to the bank/credit company about how he got many mouths to feed, grandmother sick, another child coming out soon, who's fault is it?<br><br>Both ways, (person defaults payment, or arranges a new payment schedule with bank/credit companies) the bank/credit company loses.<br><br>I guess your post (and others above) about our government being the cause of all this interests, etc etc. Guess we can't do anything constructive about it. Much as a person is disagreeable to the system, we still face the same thing when we buy flats, etc. Guess what we can do is perhaps vote better, be responsible and honorable.<br><br>Just my 2 cents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. There is an obvious flaw in hdb and bank loans.<br><br>For downgraders, (4room to 3 room or even 4 room to 4 room), we have to take a bank loan. The interest rate for bank loans are higher and the repayment criteria is stricter. But hdb does not understand why we need to downgrade. We downgrade becos we have no money. N when we have no money, we will still need to take a bank loan which commands higher interest rate. Thus, there will obviously be more downgraders who will have their house repossesed by banks. This is truly a situation which HDB can just change by a simple policy of granting hdb loans to downgraders, who needs the loan more than others.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Neutral party.<br><br>I am working in the "Collection" line, for a bank to repo the house is not an SOP. Banks dont repo once it reach the 90 days due, most will nego for repayment rather than just seize and sue. If a person is adjude a bkpt, it will do the bank no good either. Same goes for reno loan, credit card , autoloan etc, banks will rather engage collection service to recover as much as possible than to waste money on legal action. Most legal action carried out is because banks find that that particular debtor have the ability to pay but chose not to hence the procced with legal to pressure them to pay. But to those debtor now, being a bkpt is nothing to them as them always assume only 3-5 years they will be free man. Not that banks / gov in inhumane to evict them from the house, but alot of nego and attempts is done to allow the debtor to pay the dues in instalment or have given debtor a chance to downgrade but no valid. Alot of pple out there are using the plastic card to spent the money that they are not even earning. Maybe instead of pointing fingers at banks and gov, we look look things the other way, the teaching and mindset of the younger generators...<br><br>Just my humble opinion**</div>

There is an obvious flaw in hdb and bank loans.<br><br>For downgraders, (4room to 3 room or even 4 room to 4 room), we have to take a bank loan. The interest rate for bank loans are higher and the repayment criteria is stricter. But hdb does not understand why we need to downgrade. We downgrade becos we have no money. N when we have no money, we will still need to take a bank loan which commands higher interest rate. Thus, there will obviously be more downgraders who will have their house repossesed by banks. This is truly a situation which HDB can just change by a simple policy of granting hdb loans to downgraders, who needs the loan more than others. </div></blockquote>good suggestion.
