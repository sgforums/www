            <div class='col-md body'>For hundreds of years the Asian region has been the playground of those white trash piece of S@#t.<br><br>For centuries they have been exploiting our people taking what they need and trampling over our heads.<br><br>Whether in name of their so called "Democracy" or wanting to defend themselves of terrorism by attacking an Asian country without permissoin is another act of invasion.<br><br>Have we not learned from all these hundreds of years? Have we grown to fat and lazy that its muddled our brains?<br><br>If theres anything to be done. WE should do it ourselves not some white assed PM of another country sticking his stinking white nose into our business.<br><br>Terrorism is a GLOBAL threat. By the word GLOBAL it means the whole damn world. Therefore it is safe to say that be it Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, USA or even Great Britain......terrorism can strike anywhere....anytime.<br><br>I would rather die than have American or Aussie military put their foot into our Homeland. Remember....no one made the Americans the world's police....they made themselves that way by decades of slowly brainwashing other super powers (namely the USSR) to lay down their arms and dismantle their nukes. Thereby making themselves the only threat to the rest of the world because no one can stop them.<br><br>John Howard just wants to make sure Australia has that kind of power...but over us Asians. Thus he uses the excuse of terrorism. However...as I said b4.....terrorism can happen anywhere in the world at anytime.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You people are taking John Howard's words too seriously. First of all, no way did he mention he is going to bomb any SEA countries. No point did he mention he is going to send Australia Defense Force into another country without the permission of the govt or UN. What he did do is trying to "scare" some terrorists anywhere in the world, be it in Afaganistan or Indonesia or even Phillippines that Australian will act to destroy them before they strike (but not necessary alone and without any UN backing and the host nation permission). The pre-emptive strikes could be in the form of providing support to the host nation army to hunt them down even before they attack Australian targets.<br><br>Whatever Howard has said, I wouldn't take it too literally as he would not act against the majority of the Australians' wishes when he is trying to "protect their interests" and win the next election,<br><br>Australia, is afterall, not as powerful as the US or Israel.<br><br>Just relax... lots of talk... but no action - its just politics!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What the whole mess needs now is a win win situation.  Australia might attempt to make pre-emptive strikes on TERRORIST targets, not government targets.  This whole war was never one between nations.  Unfortunately, nations that do not do their part to eradicate their pests seem to have made the war on terrorism a war on them?  I empathise with them.  Why, because they are simply not as well connected in the global arena?  The world doesn't understand their difficulties?  They only know that they are not doing their job.  Indonesia is fighting more than terrorism at the same time.  Its fighting corruption and poverty.  Their government knows damn well they can't win.  Does John Howard care?  He couldn't give a rat's ass even if the rest of his people wanted to. Now, he wants to come in as an enemy, to take care of the terrorist infestation himself.  He doesn't make any attempts to really HELP does he?  Offer any economic packages yet?  He could have put it nicely, did he?<br><br>I don't blame him for wanting to protect his country.  I respect that.  I feel sorry for the Australians that died in the Bali bombing, and i feel some sort of retribution is necessary.  But by being so insensitive to his neighbours, he'd probably helped the terrorist in dealing a critical blow to Australia and the world.  FEAR, CHAOS, and Distrust.  Would any SEA nations trust Australia now?  Hell, NO.  What should he have done?  He could have offered suggestions to organise another international task force to apprehend and take down these terrorist hide-outs.  Indonesia needs help, not a rabid dog growling down its ass.<br><br>Whats Singapore's role in all this ruckus?  Definitely not sending F-16s in.   Even if we HAD accurate intelligence, its still a violation of sovereignty.  We are not a superpower.  Only superpowers play preemptive games.  We can only watch our borders tight, keep our customs on the ball, and security forces on the alert.  Even if some damned bomb goes off in City Hall, all I can say is WE FUCKING SCREWED UP already.  F-16 or not, WE SCREWED UP.  So far, we did not.  And should work hard and keep it that way.  At the same time, we should be at peace with our neighbours.  We should unite all of them, against the terrorism, and deal with the problem and not the people.  Make peace between the nations and rain hellfire on the crazy bastards.<br><br>I think we have reach a time, when every nation's own ego, self-centredness, and sovereignty has bitten the country in the foot.  Every leader who seeks to portray himself as the strongest man to lead his people, finds himself caught between possible conflict, and embarrassment.  Perhaps, just perhaps, it is time for mankind to learn how to do what is right, instead of what is politically acceptable.  Do What Is Right.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, then the entire concept of national sovereignty as already backfired on the world.  What is national sovereignty? It includes the right to defend the nation's people.  And another country's national sovereignty remains to defend encroachment by another country to defend it's national sovereignty.<br><br>In anycase, my view is that, we have the right to make stringent checks to prevent these terrorists from infiltrating and operating.  We have the right to terminate these people.  And that is all we, as a sovereign nation can do.  To use military force, as a nation, to encroach another country's border without permission, is an act of aggression no matter how you put it, justifiable or not.<br><br>And should there be such a need to use such military force, we must then be ready to be at war.  Overtly or covertly, we must then be prepared to face the consequences of our actions.<br><br>Call me idealistic.  It is best that SEA tackles this terrorist infestation as a whole.  And to use military force, not as individual nations, but operating under a UN banner.</div>

IF terrorism is not eliminated... Countries will end up in wars to protect their own respective citizens... then the UN would have FAILED just as well....<br><br>And if the UN move against a particular nation through sanctions or even military expedition... wouldnt that signify a failing of the UN as well??<br><br>The UN is not GOD and definitely has no final authority where every nation MUST obey... the UN is only as strong as the nations that makes up the UN... and to have the UN to move against its members is equivalent to weakening its very foundation of support...<br><br>The current war against terrorism is actually led by the SUPERPOWERS... namely AMERICA that has suffered direct attack from such groups such as AL-QE...<br><br>the truth is... terrorism has existed for decades!! as INDIA, ISREAL and RUSSIA would have testified... BUT NO actions on the part of the UN was forthcoming... while innocent civilians were blown to pieces......<br><br>SO... i put forward the posiition that.. the UN has long long ago FAILED when it failed to heed the cry of fellow nations.. and has continue to fail the nations that have placed their faith in it...<br><br>The UN at best... is a venue of resolution... but it is NOT the ultimate authority, and ITS position is severely limited by its lack of resources, autonomy and power (millitary and economics)<br><br>so... i support howards idea...

            <div class='col-md body'>The views that have been posted so far by Tripwire and myself can only be hypothetical and no more.<br><br>It is regrettable and unfortunate that Indonesia has been referred to in the postings, as it has so far had its own citizens and residents being Â“caughtÂ” and "fingered" in some very Â“compromising situationsÂ” in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore; and as a single South-east Asian country, it has the most active number of Radical Islamic Groups that are running amok even within its territory (reference the Molukus Riots, Church Bombings, Night Club raids or riots, Aceh Rebellion).<br><br>Indonesia as a reference country, can also easily be replaced by Malaysia or Thailand or the Philippines, each country has its own variation of radical Islamic Groups that are actively taking up arms against the established rule of the Legitimate Governments of each of these South-east Asian Countries.<br><br>Any one of these countries will have to respond to the pressures of world opinion at the risk of a united action from the United Nations; if ever an incident such as that of the size of the 9-11 incident should befall onto Singapore.<br><br>Even for a Bali Incident within its own sovereign territory, Indonesia cannot afford not to respond, given the gravity of the situation; just as it has confirmed the hypothetical position that it cannot afford not to ignore outside opinions - which in this case is Australian pressures to let in Australian investigators to Â“HELP(??)Â” in the investigation of the Bali Incident.<br><br>No country can put National Pride and withstand the U.N. embargo and prefer to be a Â“Pariah StateÂ” by not taking actions against their own Nationals or Residents, and give protection and safe harbor to these perpetrators of Â“crime against humanityÂ”.<br><br>Even Libya finally cave in after more then 10 years of preferred self isolation as a result of the U.N. embargo for the bombing of a  Pan-Am 747 jet at Lockerbie, Scotland.<br><br>India had accused Pakistan of harboring Islamic Terrorists, and India would have launched a war against Pakistan, except for the fact that both now possess Nuclear Weapons Â– which Pakistan has assured that they will not hesitate to use the Nuclear Option, if their Army face massive defeat.<br><br>Israel has held the Palestinian Authorities responsible for the Terrorist Attacks against the Israelis. This accusation from Israel is repugnant and totally disingenuous, as the Israeli Army had systematically dismantled the effective tools of policing by the Palestinian Authority against any raids conducted by Palestinian Radicals.<br><br>Indonesia is a recognized friendly state towards Singapore, although there exist many vocal radical groups that remain volatile and exploited by extremists with their own agenda to gain power from the Islamic pulpit.<br><br>These radicals can usurp the leadership of the country from the Government, much as the Ayatollahs of Iran had usurped the powers of Government from the Shah of Iran.<br><br>If the Indonesian Government should suddenly fall and give rise to such a Radical Group to come into power, and which prefer to support and perpetrate hostile actions against Singapore, we cannot simply sit still and allow such groups to harm our lives and properties in Singapore.<br><br>Singapore will have to respond in an aggressive manner with the S.A.F.<br><br>Singapore is recognized as a Regional Power despite our size; and Singapore is quietly and modestly keeping a low profile.<br><br>Much to the discomfort of our Political Leaders, and as much as we would like to avoid the comparison, the truth of the unholy word is that Singapore is like Israel in the Middle East, with both being surrounded by Islamic Countries that has seen a strong revival of Fundamentalist Islamic practices.<br><br>Like Israel, Singapore cannot afford not to respond aggressively against terrorist Acts of Wars by individuals or groups that take refuge in neighboring countries that are either inept or powerless to stop such perpetrators.<br><br>How to end a war that involves the S.A.F?<br><br>We should learn from history to study how other wars ended.<br><br>From my own view, it depends on how the war is being planned and executed, and the goals and objectives that are to be achieved by the S.A.F.<br><br>It depends on the type of war that the S.A.F will have to fight. It depends on the duration of the war that the S.A.F can afford to fight; and how much has been achieved within the allotted period.<br><br>However, like the USA in its fight against terrorism, Singapore will depend on how much international support the Singapore Government and the S.A.F will receive in such a war.<br><br></div>
