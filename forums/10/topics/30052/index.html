            <div class='col-md body'>With the big bouhaha stirred up by Johnny Howard's remarks that Australia may act against terrorists in Asia with or without the Asian countrys permission to defend Australia from terrorists, heres what I feel about the major players:<br><br>John Howard: Typical Johnny Howard. Arrogant, disrepectful of Asia and Asian sensitivities. Nothing new from him IMO, considering most Aussies I know regard him as an arrogant prick to begin with. However hes right when he says he will act to defend Australia and Australians. After all, Australians elected him and he should serve their interests first. Still, his arrogance and insenstivity knows no bounds.<br><br>Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia: Guilty conscience. These countries know they have not done enough, not by a long shot, to combat terrorism and know that they fall directly in Howard's sights if he acts on what he says and are reacting accordingly. Rather than react like headless chickens to Howards playing to the home gallery, maybe they should get off their fat corrupt asses and start doing something concrete.<br><br>Malaysia: Typical attitude problem and big mouths. If you are doing enough to combat terrorism (which they claim they are and I believe them to a certain extent), why the f*** do they need to concern themselves with this issue? As usual, inferiority complex, which manifests itself all too often in its dealings with the West, Australia and Singapore. Sad case.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway...i dun wish that **** to be involve in our business of anti-terrorism.<br><br>If they were to intrude any country , i personally see it as a act of agression , dun care got reason no reason , i dun think the international community will accept it , ever he is doing it for the interest of his pple. ( many agression in record occured due to own country's interest , however was condemmed till now.)<br><br>Malaysia might be a big mouth but being stated in the media by australian authorities as a listed spot for terrorism, he have the right to condemm wat the aussie prime minister said. Personally i dun wish to see Aussie's UAV being flown into Singapore , jus because their qu qu intelligence officers listed us in. I believe thats wat the malaysian are thinking.<br><br>Australian should not practise their pre-emptive strikes but , wat they should do is to co-operate with the SEA nation to settle the problem, pre-emptive strike will onli bring more hatred to themselve.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So its alright Tripwire by your logic to ignore international borders, conventions and law and trample on another country's sovereignity? Do not do unto others what you do not want to be done unto you. Remember? How would you like it if the roles were reversed and Singapore is the one who gets foreign troops running all over the place without our say-so?<br><br>The op in Yemen does not apply as a precedent because the Yemeni government tacitly gave the US the ok to strike. It told the US that the local government couldn't handle the Al-Qaeda in-country and asked for assistance.<br><br>Read what was said properly. What Howard is in effect suggesting simply states that they'll go in when they feel like it and do the job. Screw the other countries laws, screw asking the other country to tackle the problem first, screw their sovereign rights, screw their permission, we do what we want.<br><br>I don't like how some SEA countries are handling the problem and I've made that clear.

            <div class='col-md body'>No matter how much u say, i can bet Singapore will not do such pre-emptive strike actions. Singapore is no israel in this region, the onli mean of survival is to make friend and deter , if deterrence fail then a all out strike would be possible, however it is out of the topic.<br><br><strong>arent you in a paradox... by your opinion... one bomb wont force you to send your falcons over... then base on JI's ideology.. all they need to do.. is to set off 10 bombs.. maybe 100 bombs... or maybe spread a plague in singapore... but then... hopefully, by the time you felt it is time for the pre-emptive strike... there is still an SAF around...      </strong><br><br>Dun u understand, we are agaisnt terrorism not agiasnt any government , by senting falcons in u are going agianst the two group of them<br><br><strong>did i say ... i must send falcons over?? is falcons the best way to deal with terrorist?? i think not... I got a better idea...tit for tat... malaysia dont arrest JI on their soil... we can fund KMM on our soil...    </strong><br><br>U will make Singapore a even hatred island for those terrorist out there. U dun even understand the lesson of 911 , y is US being bomb not us?<br><br><strong> terrorist are brainwashed freakos... they are no better then the tame donkeys in the circus..... they will hit any country that their overlord declare as enemy... if they should hit us.. wat are u gonna do?? beg for mercy?? </strong><br><strong><br>as for 911... it doesnt matter who is right or who is wrong.. its a contest of WILL and POWER... that is the real truth... ALLAH is bullshit.. FREEDOM is also bullshit... its a contest under the law of nature... the strong eat the weak... the weak bite back... the strong show the weak what will happen...next    </strong>Because the way they handle things are in the interest of their pple , however a pain in the *** for others.
