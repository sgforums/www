Ambalam was jailed for three weeks, and Yap, 10 days, when they, too, refused to pay the fines of $3,000 and $2,000 respectively. The maximum fine is $10,000.<br><br>An AFP report said that the trio came to court ready with their personal belongings before being hauled off to jail. Chee hugged his wife and three young children before police led him away.<br><br>Chee, 44, denounced his trial as a farce. He the told the court before the verdict was read: "Every hour, every day, every month that I spend in jail only strengthens my resolve to fight." He said he had "absolutely no remorse" for his actions, and vowed to continue fighting for democracy in the city-state.<br><br>He also slammed the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act (PEMA), which prohibits public speaking without a police permit.<br><br>Reuters quoted him as telling the court: "The PEMA has been used by the PAP to prosecute and deter legitimate political activity."<br><br>In September, Chee attempted to defy a government ban on protests during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Singapore.<br><br>Chee was bankrupted and barred from standing in elections after failing to pay S$500,000 in libel damages to Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong for comments he made during the 2001 elections.<br><br>The SDP did not win any parliament seats in the May election, but won 23 per cent of the votes in the wards that it contested.<br><br>The three opted to remain silent in their defence during the trial, which ended on Nov 9. They said they had decided to boycott the trial "in protest of our treatment in this court."<br><br>Yap was prepared to go to jail when the trial ended. He told the court then: "I would not pay a fine, and I ask for the maximum sentence. And I am going on a hunger strike in prison to protest the series of daily oppression."<br><br>Chee and his sister, Chee Siok Chin, a central executive committee member of SDP,are also facing a defamation lawsuit from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and MM Lee over an article in the SDP's newsletter.<br><br>Ms Chee Siok Chin told Reuters that a group of SDP supporters would hold vigils outside the Queenstown Remand Prison to protest against the imprisonment.<br><br></div>
