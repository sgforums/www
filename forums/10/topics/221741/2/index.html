One day, the dichotomy between our words and deeds/ideology will become very glaring. It's in Singapore's favor to listen to what Chee has to say sometimes, after all, we are only as good as what we can produce, not what we can say.</div>

He is simply its voice. He alone cannot engineer or oust Mr. Chiam without the combined, voting capacity of the Central Executive Committee and the cadres of the SDP. The SDP, the Party being democratic and not autocratic or monastic, believed that it was time to have a change for leadership to steer it in the right direction. That was why Dr. Chee Â‘took overÂ’ Mr. ChiamÂ’s role as Secretary General. Mr. Chiam resigned from the SDP in 1993. The Party and/or Dr. Chee did not Â‘kick him outÂ’ --- a myth which The Straits Times has and had propagated, a myth which so many Singaporeans so readily swallow without question.<br><br>Hence, let the following facts be now known:<br><br>Mr. Chiam See Tong of the Singapore PeopleÂ’s Party (SPP) RESIGNED as Secretary-General of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) in 1993.<br><br>Even then the SDP held back releasing this news for one month in the hope that they could persuade him to change his mind.<br><br>The SDP only went public AFTER Mr. Chiam refused to yield and insisted that for him to come back as the Sec-Gen., he must be given the powers to appoint CEC and cadre members (in effect, single-handedly controlling the party). This is undemocratic as this is what many SDP members joined the Party to fight the PAP on.<br><br>Mr. Chiam then decided to go to the Singapore Press Club, which has never been friendly to the Opposition to run down his colleagues and leaders of the party, leaders which members freely elected.<br><br>(All members had earlier on signed an oath -- that no member shall criticize the party publicly after they left it.)<br><br><strong>It was only then that  <span style="color: red;">the Party voted to expel Mr. Chiam</span></strong>.<br></blockquote></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">If all the scholars engaged by the present Government cannot run the country, perhaps it is time for this Government to loosen its grip, so as to allow a more competitive environment in which the first generation of leaders found themselves in, and which threw up the best from the Community.<br><br>Is it not a surprise that we see less self-made Singaporean success stories, when compared to the early Singapore History under the Colonial Government ?<br><br>Are there any self-made Singaporean equivalent to the likes of Tan Lark Sye, Tan Kah Kee, Lee Kong Chian, Ng Quee Lam, Chen Su-Lan, Kwek Lian Hong, the Aw Brothers of Haw Par, and their other modest contemporaries ?<br><br>CSJ and the likes of Chia Ti Lek and Goh Meng Seng - have dared to stand by their principles, and at least have dared to challenge the establishment with their impeccable private life.<br><br>They were honest to their cause and their beliefs.<br><br>What can a mushroom from Oxford hope to establish - despite the claims of a PhD qualification - when claiming to disassociate from the politics of the Ruling Party, will unashamedly further their cause in sneakiest manner ?<br><br></span><br><br></div>
