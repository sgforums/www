            <div class='col-md body'>To: PM Lee Hsien Loong, MM Lee Kuan Yew,<br><br>The fundamentals in governing Singapore will have to change as PM Lee has said many times.<br><br>For example, the civil servants are being asked to change their mindset being concerned to build surpluses or recover all costs.<br><br>There are still no change to government's policies. The policy to corporatize government services and recover all costs is basically unchanged as can be seen from all the debates and discussions on the latest GST increase.<br><br>The government's past policy of charging lands at full market values for basic housing and medical cares is yet to be changed.<br><br>Reach has been asking citizens for feedbacks but such feedbacks as given by citizens concerning these two topics have been constantly ignored or disregarded.<br><br>I have replied to Reach to ask whether any more feedbacks will be useful if feedbacks are not taken seriously being largely ignored.<br><br>Now citizens will ask : do they have a governmment which is caring and looking after their interests and wellbeings any more or is the government now over-obsessed with protecting its own reserve for the sake of reserve or high salaries because of greed.<br><br>Govt tries to put the blame on globalization? Actually, there is no need to jack up costs through double-charging or market-pricing on lands owned by the people for essential services.<br><br>It does not follow that because of globalisation, we must run all the costs high to get the government to accumulate all the surpluses through taxations and recovering all costs through corporatization schemes of all sorts.<br><br>The government is only using globalisation as a front or excuse to charge citizens the highest fees and recover all costs to the maximum possible.<br><br>The government may not want to admit it but their past policies are producing the highest costs any citizens could be made to bear on this planet.<br><br>Its past policies on land and cost-centre creative accounting have been only aimed at producing ever-increasing surpluses like the NKF and at attracting the foreign MNCs or GLCs and look after the ministers and civil service elite fews (0.1% of population) as can be seen in the present economy.<br><br>So what is the point of working so hard on the part of the citizens.<br><br>Property market strategy sadly is still based on the past policies. Just look at the master plan which is made to emphasise on growths of certain areas connected to URA/developers.<br><br>People must now ask the Singapore Land Authority/URA to dilute the concentration on CBD and spead their multi-billions land sale profits to develop all for medical, childcare, and lower the costs of doing business for all the normal businesses.<br></div>

At least if leaders still want to tax some more, tell us HOW MUCH RESERVE IS ENOUGH RESERVE to avoid killing the economy from over-taxing.<br><br>To do so just to satisfy ego or protect the elites and elites's protectionism is even worse.<br><br>Is such profiteering from double-charging on lands not an economic plunder or economic crime against the people. Is government not doing exactly Durai is doing in NKF ?.<br><br>When government does the GRC, there is actually no more level-playing field in voting or voting right.

What milton expertise or first-hand experience or knowledge do we need to know about this fact?<br><br>It was a statutory board set up with power to acquire lands at cheap prices to provide people with low-cost housing.<br><br>The fact is that HDB has now over-built with 10,000 surplus stock with the minister not even knowing much about the problem until Journalist Lee Han Shih wrote an article in the Straits highlighting HDB problems with lack of proper management. Should people be penalised for such errors or should the ministers concerned resign to take responsibility for mismanagement?<br><br>That HDB by 1990s has housed 90 % of the population should not have given government the rationale or logic to say that now is the time to start charging the public flats at market price as lands were originally acquired cheap using citizens' taxes and not for the purpose of allowing HDB to make a dirty profit.<br><br>Ms Kay of HDB has given very unsatisfactory and unconvincing replies to readers of Straits Times recently who raised the issue of HDB wrongful assumption that it is subsidising its flats correcting HDB's claim that it is subsidising HDB flats by pointing out that HDB was merely giving a trade discount rather subsidy.<br><br>HDB officers and minister Mah in the ensuing public debates have totally failed to give fortright honest reply to citizens on their exposed wrongful claim of discount as subsidy. So this is yet another instance of government's failing to engage people in robust argument at all as PM Lee said government will.<br><br>In other words, government has now lost leadership standards and leadership quality as it is no longer able to government by laws, logics and reasoning.<br><br>A government which has failed to engage its people in rationalizing its policies and practices is no longer a good government.<br><br>I hope government will see this defect in the present administration - unable to engage public in debates and logics of reasoning out government policies affecting their housing.<br><br>The double-charging on lands of HDB occurs when HDB has acquired lands at dirt-cheap prices using taxations and powers under HDB Act and Land Acquisition Act to do so but quietly, it is selling HDB flats by giving a small discount (which developers are also doing) to look good.<br><br>This kind of government is not good government if it charges the lands acquired and paid for and owned by the people at market price.<br><br>But when government is meeting challenges by bigger bullies like the souzhou local authority or port palepas, it capitulated all too fast. Where is the moral standard to govern - afraid of bigger outside forces but refuses to relent on wrongs committed against its own people.<br><br>HDB should have charged the public housing flats at reasonable prices by using a fairer formula i.e. e.g. (4 room flat at Seng Kang) S$200,000 (Market Price reflecting location) - S$120,000 (Land Cost) - discount (e.g. 35% given by HPL) = S$52,000.<br><br>This was what ex-Minister Lim Kim San has done, but Minister Mah Bow Tan appears to be trying to make monies for the government all the time to secure his position.<br><br>We cannot keep taxing on housing like this against the people if we want to make our citizens committed to the country.<br>Back to top<br>View user's profile Send private message Visit poster's website</div>
