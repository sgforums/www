              they should be shooed out.its a civil service club for government officials.they must be laughing at sporeans then...the foreigners probably dun think much of the civil service club other than it being a public toilet or some bus stop meeting place.
              
              it is yer duty as a civil service to clobber them in front of their kids,friedns n family...even if there are hundreds of people.
              u are weak thats why u are here bitchin...if that was me....u wouldnt hear them ever being there again.

              <p>if you travel often and visit changi airport T1, T2, T3. you will realise there are always 10 counters for foreigners visitors. but onlu 1 lane to cramp out the singaporeans/ workpass/ together. i ask why not have a lane for a singaporeans only  to separate from the foreigners working in singapore, the custom officer say, no such need.</p>
              <p>please show some respect to singaporeans and take care of their needs before all those foreign shit!!</p>

              security should be beefed up at civil service club.
                  
                  why dun they go stick posters n crowd around outside istana or parliament building for a change????
                   
                  these foreigners if they see u good to eat with no security in the vicinity,they will do anything from sticking posters outside yer club to murder even.
              
              maybe someone should hold an army reservist call up at foreign indian church outside...and stick up notice and signboards too.

              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Is the PAP Govt the only ones allowed to have Double Standard Paradoxes?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">A couple of weeks ago, my wife went for a massage in the Spa in the Civil Service Club in Bukit Batok, so I brought my kids to the children’s play area to keep them entertained. After a while, a big group of Indian FT mothers and kids came in and we got overcrowded. I was a little curious at why such a big group of them appeared together at the club. As we were leaving, we realized why. An Indian Church holds services for them at the Wine Bar in the Civil Service Club on Sunday evenings. There is also a poster near the door identifying the church.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Recently, a friend of mine was lamenting that their church was having difficulties securing a place to hold their services because, last year, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan’s MCYS together with URA issued new guidelines to limit Religious Activities in Commercial spaces. (</span> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://app1.mcys.gov.sg/PressRoom/CommercialSpacesforReligiousActivities.aspx"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">http://app1.mcys.gov.sg/PressRoom/CommercialSpacesforReligiousActivities.aspx</span></a> <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">)</span></p>

              </ol>
              <p><br><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Since only existing approved auditoriums, function halls, convention halls and cinemas located within commercial and hotel developments can be considered, why is it that church services can be held in a wine bar inside the Civil Service Club? Why are they allowed to put up 2 posters on the premises?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="color: #464646; font-family: Arial;">Though religious activities are generally not allowed in commercial buildings, URA is prepared to exercise some flexibility and allow commercial premises to be used…</span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="color: #464646; font-family: Arial;">To ensure that the character and secular nature of commercial premises are not eroded or displaced by religious activities…</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Why Is it that only the govt is allowed to flout their own rules? Why are religious activities generally NOT ALLOWED in commercial buildings but allowed in their Club? Shouldn’t a Govt related building, all the more, remain secular?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Or does the govt feel they need to bend over backwards to provide the FT venues to gather while they persecute the local churches because they feel threatened by their size? I am not totally against all FT. I recognise that we need them for certain jobs like construction. But, shouldn't our Govt show preference to us locals? Also, why the need to give concessions instead to FT in providing venues for their gatherings? Didn't the Govt claim that they are trying to get them to INTEGRATE into the local community?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Isn’t the club’s wine bar meant to be for the public to chill over a drink instead of being blocked as a venue for FT to gather on the weekends? I wonder, if an opposition party wants to book the place for their weekly meetings, would the Civil Service Club let them use it? Or would they call it an illegal gathering? Will they show the same welcome if an Opposition Party wants to book the Club for a rally or the Wine Bar for their Victory party after the elections? Maybe NSP Team for Jurong GRC can consider having an event at the Civil Service Club at Bukit Batok. It would be a very “meaningful” event!</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">In addtition, since a wine bar should have a liquor license and serves liquor, how come so many young children are allowed in there?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Isn’t it also morally wrong for a church service to be held in a bar?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">I thought about writing to MCYS but I suppose Dr Balakrishnan and the government would again treat this as noise since they have not even responded to the YOG Budget queries after such a long time. A pity, because I would really like to hear how they are going explain this away. Or, more likely, would they change the rules once again for their own convenience and for the sake of their beloved FTs?</span></p>

              <p>"FT mothers and kids"?  Did you check and confirm that those indians are foreigners, or FT, I didn't know that indian construction workers come here with their wives and kids.</p>
              <p> "shouldn't our Govt show preference to us locals? " so It is ok if the church activities are for locals in the club?</p>
              <p>don't mix religious with politics, especially when you don't get your facts right.</p>
