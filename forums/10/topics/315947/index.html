              <p>can be true in this sense:</p>
              <p>1 citizen cost $5K to hire withdraw all his money and went to live in NZ.</p>
              <p>This gives companies the reason to hire 2 x 2.5K thus, on paper, purely on paper alone, it can then be said that 2 jobs are created. To whom, that is another totally mutually exclusive question all together wherein unworldly people may never comprehend.</p>

              <p>Why EUROPE , entire 'continent' able to prosper and continue to pay its IT staff who are european passport holders the highest IT salary in the world? now USA currency is like so cheap cannot compare with euro.</p>
              <p>I think the answer is</p>
              <p>because Europe Boleh!</p>
              <p>Its not about cost. Its whether you are able to provide them the salary and no need resort to lowering costs.</p>
              <p>Business is about SALEs.  No sales, no matter how cheap your IT budget is, also you go fly kite and bankrupt. Its about your business capability. Some INC says able to pay its staff world record salaries because salary is not the issue. Its the Gross Domestic that is the issue.</p>
              <p>If you can , you can.</p>
              <p>If you cannot, you cannot.</p>
              <p>Europe CAN!</p>
              <p>Businesses which are weak and cannot afford even IT staff should not use the excuse or reason  that if they don't use cheaper resources, their business will collapse.  The real reason is these businesses are either weak fundamentally, not smart, not competent, not able to capture enough market share, generate sales, poor in marketing or too stingy to invest in supplychain software of the best quaility or simply, someone or several people are corruptioning from the inside out.</p>
              <p>1st world cost of living.</p>
              <p>1st world everything except freedom and salary will not work. This equation is fundamentally flawed.</p>

              <p>1) Singapore is in the continent of Asia. So is PRC. Within the European continent, the europeans work in the different european countries. So why the double standards now when Asians work in different Asian countries?</p>
              <p>2) Do you know Germany (in Europe) is short of engineers, and they are looking overseas for them?</p>
              <p>3) Business is not only about sales. It is sales vs expenses. You can have $10 billion of sales, but if your total expenditure is $11billion, you still go bankrupt.</p>
              <p>4) As you have said, you have to walk the talk. Start your own IT business and pay them the highest salary possible. Show us you are as competent as Mr Low Thia Khiang in hiring only locals.</p>

              <p>since you are so obsessed with the bmw, get a pre-owned one. i will attest to it that it is a better drive than a picanto (tho' i have never driven a kia b4). your image quotient will also go up a few notches. i can recommend which beemer will suit your profile and budget if you need help.</p>
              <p>i can't help you with the bungalow and land near the gold courses since i also live in a highrise like most of us.</p>
              <p>do you have the actual numbers of the total number of singaporean who studied overseas stayed on and those who return to back up your sweeping statement? </p>

              <p>Why EUROPE , entire 'continent' able to prosper and continue to pay its IT staff who are european passport holders the highest IT salary in the world? now USA currency is like so cheap cannot compare with euro.</p>
              <p>I think the answer is</p>
              <p>because Europe Boleh!</p>
              <p>Its not about cost. Its whether you are able to provide them the salary and no need resort to lowering costs.</p>
              <p>Business is about SALEs.  No sales, no matter how cheap your IT budget is, also you go fly kite and bankrupt. Its about your business capability. Some INC says able to pay its staff world record salaries because salary is not the issue. Its the Gross Domestic that is the issue.</p>
              <p>If you can , you can.</p>
              <p>If you cannot, you cannot.</p>
              <p>Europe CAN!</p>
              <p>Businesses which are weak and cannot afford even IT staff should not use the excuse or reason  that if they don't use cheaper resources, their business will collapse.  The real reason is these businesses are either weak fundamentally, not smart, not competent, not able to capture enough market share, generate sales, poor in marketing or too stingy to invest in supplychain software of the best quaility or simply, someone or several people are corruptioning from the inside out.</p>
              <p>1st world cost of living.</p>
              <p>1st world everything except freedom and salary will not work. This equation is fundamentally flawed.</p>
