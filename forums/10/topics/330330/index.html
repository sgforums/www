              <p>If there was ever a racial riot in Malaysia started by that stupid remark, have no doubt, that remark was just the beginning of a planned political manipulation.</p>
              <p>No riot of massive scale and damaging nature will be sparked without being well planned and organized.  This was what happened to Jakarta back in 13 May 1998.</p>
              <p>Riots can easily be sparked when sentiments are high.  You only need a small incident between two races to ignite a massive scale of unrest, if all are well planned and organized.  However, I believe the majority of Malaysians are more civilized and educated and not that easy to manipulate comparatively.  Furthermore, Chinese and the Malay live in harmony for centuries in Malaysia.  So it will not be as effective to use racial as an issue for political means.</p>
              <p>In any case, the Malaysian better have their security forces stand-by and these forces shall only have "peace-keeping" as the only objective, and they shall not be serving the political interests of a bias party like they did in Indonesia.  On the day of the riots, police and armies were on paid holidays and those on duties put on civilian clothes to instigate riots.  Leaving only the commander of the marines and his troops to do the dirty job.</p>

              <p><br>Even their security forces are all one sided race, how to keep peace, all the while, malaysia does not have a good balance in racial discrimination, it is alway there, the tension and dissatisfaction. However, what kept them for so long is perhap tolerance and endurance, so at times, these emotion overwhelmed certain top leaders and they started to slurp out racial remarks, otherwise all should be ok and fine. I believe no one in malaysia likes to have riots and fighting among each other. Things should settle in a way of big to small, small to nothing.</p>

              <p>I have no comment on the possibility of racial riots and Malaysia's security forces. I agree with that quote of yours though and I have something to add to these silly politics.</p>
              <p>I think if one forgets about our collective poignant history and miss out on the economic pie slices, one will never understand how UMNO's political leaders can easily excuse themselves of racism and yet continue being discriminating against the non-Malays.<br><br>This to me is the ongoing story of us as a British colony of immigrants of many races sponsored by British interests - who actually have little to none in common - we look different, our occupations were different, our food, religion, clothes, architechture, festivals, customs, language are all different - transiting into a new nation.<br><br>Come 1970, it is realized the Chinese and some little left foreign hands controlled around 95% of Malaysia's wealth despite being a minority. The complaints of our forefathers were that for the Malays, they feel they are the have-nots in their own motherland. For the Chinese, they have been here for many generations on end and have developed the country using their skills and so have as much rights as the Malays to be here. The Indians felt the same.<br><br>So soon, the NEP was launched to address the wealth imbalance, with precedence in Article 153 of Malaysia's Constitution, drafted by the Reid Commision to 'safeguard the special position of the Malays'.<br><br>Its effects, bad and good, is felt up until now.<br><br>Present time, it seems there has been some grassroots movements to re-examine the NEP agenda and influence. Sadly though, it is always met with demagoguish and demonizing reactions from political leaders of accusations of [i]khianat melayu[/i] (malay betrayers). These politicians can't get that "questioning the NEP, its strengths and weaknesses, and its future standing does not tantamount to.... the repeal of Article 153 of the Federal Constitution. The NEP is but a policy instrument of Article 153. What is being questioned is [i]whether as a policy instrument it remains the most effective and just means[/i] to achieve its.... objectives."<br><br>The struggle for change and to be relieved from racially-charged politics remains. Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, however much he is disliked now, did it right. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></p>

              <p>Woot. It happened exactly as I described.</p>
              <p>Refer to the Straits Times Nov 4th, "A traitor to race" article and the last paragraph of my post above.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Straits Times:</strong> Former defacto law minister Zaid Ibrahim has come under withering
              criticism from Umno politicians for saying that the concept of
              'Ketuanan Melayu' or Malay supremacy championed by the party has led to
              failed policies.</p>
              <p>Home Minister Syed Hamid Albar led the charge, saying Mr Zaid was a traitor to his own race and should apologise for his remarks.</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p><strong>Gauze: </strong>Present time, it seems there has been some grassroots movements to re-examine the NEP agenda and influence. Sadly though, it is always met with demagoguish and demonizing reactions from political leaders of accusations of <em>khianat melayu</em> (malay betrayers).</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Straits Times: </strong>Mr Zaid, meanwhile, hit back at those who want him to apologise, saying he was not suprised by the reaction of some Umno leaders 'especially since they have an ongoing party election'.
              Mr Zaid said he was<em> not questioning the special rights of Malays as enshrined in the Constitution</em>, the Star reported.</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p><strong>Gauze:</strong> These politicians can't get that "questioning the NEP, its strengths and weaknesses, and its future standing does not tantamount to.... the repeal of Article 153 of the Federal Constitution. The NEP is but a policy instrument of Article 153. What is being questioned is<em> whether as a policy instrument it remains the most effective and just means</em> to achieve its.... objectives."</p>
