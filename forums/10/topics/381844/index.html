              <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 7 – Fugitive blogger Raja Petra Kamarudin is taking his fight to the government with a series of video interviews that are expected to be posted on the Internet from this Thursday.</p>
              <p>His popular Malaysia Today website began airing a trailer yesterday to promote the video interviews. In the short trailer, RPK, as he is popularly known, is shown talking about what he claims is government persecution against him.</p>
              <p>“They already decided on my crime and the punishment I am getting without investigations,” he is shown saying.</p>
              <p>He also comments on the continuing debate about Islam. He says in the trailer: “Muslims are the biggest enemies of Islam, not the kafir (infidels).”</p>
              <p>The Malaysian Insider understands that the interview lasts for up to two hours, but is likely to have been edited down into a number of shorter segments.</p>
              <p>It is unclear where the video interviews were recorded. RPK’s whereabouts remain a mystery.</p>
              <p>Malaysian police are seeking the help of Interpol to apprehend him, suggesting the authorities believe he is overseas.</p>
              <p>RPK went on the lam in April when he failed to turn up for his sedition trial. There is also a second warrant of arrest issued against him for failing to turn up for his criminal defamation trial in May.</p>
              <p>Despite being a fugitive, RPK continues to taunt the authorities and remains a thorn in the side of the administration of Datuk Seri Najib Razak.</p>
              <p>Both his sedition and criminal defamation trials are related to his allegations that Najib was involved in the murder of Altantuya Shaariibuu, the former mistress of the prime minister’s associate.</p>
              <p>RPK continues to write regularly on his Malaysia Today website, giving his take on political developments and criticising the police and the Barisan Nasional (BN) government.</p>
              <p>According to a news report in May, police said they believed RPK was in Brisbane, Australia, together with his wife.</p>
              <p>But in July, a Sessions Court was told that RPK was believed to be in the country and not in Australia as reported by the media.</p>
              <p>Deputy public prosecutor Mohd Dusuki Mokhtar said police investigation revealed that RPK, 59, had never left the country.</p>
              <p>It is unclear if the video interviews will offer any clues as to RPK’s whereabouts.</p>

              <p>NO HOLDS BARRED</p>
              <p>Raja Petra Kamarudin</p>
              <p><br>The company is called Carpet Raya Sdn Bhd (company number 492434-H). The paid up capital of the company is RM8.7 million. The company has five directors who are also the shareholders of the company; each holding almost equal shares in the company.</p>
              <p>But I am interested in only one of its shareholders/directors who goes by the name of Deepak -- 37 years old, unmarried, and good-looking enough to qualify for a Bollywood movie.</p>
              <p>The company was registered ten years ago on 26 August 1999. The last accounts filed with the Registrar of Companies on 24 November 2006 shows that the company has total assets of almost RM90 million, total liabilities of about RM67 million, and reserves of more than RM12 million.</p>
              <p>The revenue of the company for 2005 was RM122 million and the profit in excess of RM7 million. Of course, the RM7 million profit is the official or declared profit. No company in Malaysia declares its real profits anyway. So, on a revenue base of RM122 million, you can expect the real or undeclared profit to be many times that.</p>
              <p>But that was the accounts for 2005, which was four years ago. How much more has the company made over the last four years, which they prefer to keep hidden from public view? Take my word for it. We are talking about hundreds of millions here.</p>
              <p>The company is supposed to be in the business of selling carpets. Is the carpet business really that lucrative that one can earn hundreds of millions? RM122 million a year is sure a lot of carpets. Ah, but that is not really what the company does for a living. The carpet business is just a front. Sure, they do sell carpets. But that is not where the real money is. The real business of the company is to act as the Bagman for Rosmah Mansor, the wife of the Prime Minister.</p>
              <p>I met the Carpetman more than a year ago. He asked to meet through a mutual acquaintance because he was alarmed that I was about to reveal that the Carpetman is actually Rosmah’s Bagman. But that was not the thing that got him all flustered. What did was the revelation I was going to make that he is not only the Carpetman who is Rosmah’s Bagman but that he is also her Toyboy.</p>
              <p>I only do business with Rosmah, said the Carpetman. My relationship with Rosmah is only for business purposes. I am not sleeping with Rosmah, he pleaded. So please do not tell the public that I am Rosmah’s Toyboy. The impression he wanted to make is that his relationship with Rosmah is confined to the boardroom and does not extend to the bedroom.</p>
              <p>Well, that is not what Mumtaz Jaafar says. And who is Mumtaz Jaafar? Hey, if I start talking about her then I would also have to mention her relationship with Saiful, the person who alleges that Anwar Ibrahim sodomised him. And if I start talking about that then we will end up talking about the Sodomy 2 case as well. So let’s get back to the subject of the Carpetman, Rosmah’s Bagman cum Toyboy.</p>
              <p>The whole country is very focused on Najib Tun Razak’s extramarital affairs. Sure, every Malaysian knows about this. And every Malaysian also knows about him getting caught in a Port Dickson hotel room with Ziana Zain. In fact, Isa Samad even had photographs of Najib clad only in a towel with the delicious young thing in his bed. And Isa handed the photograph over to the then Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad. (And that is why Mahathir just does not understand why Najib would choose Isa to contest the Bagan Pinang by-election when it was Isa who tried to bring Najib down with the photograph).</p>
              <p>Anyway, let’s not digress too far. As I said, every Malaysian knows about Najib’s extramarital affairs. But how many also know that Rosmah has a penchant for Bollywood types. Hell, she will even arrange datukships for them if they treat her the way she loves to be treated, if you know what I mean. And this particular chap I am talking about, the Carpetman cum Bagman cum Toyboy, is far better looking than Shahrukh Khan (or is it Datuk Shahrukh Khan now?) -- not to mention younger as well.</p>
              <p>Yes, I have been keeping this story under wraps for more than a year now. But it is now time that the story be told. There is more, though. Deepak the Carpetman cum Bagman cum Toyboy has been very naughty. And all these naughty deeds were done on behalf of Rosmah.</p>
              <p>In due course more will be revealed about the role of the Carpetman and how he has served Rosmah. Today is not the time to do that though. So stay tuned for further episodes of the Carpetman cum Bagman cum Toyboy of the so-called First Lady of Malaysia.</p>

              <p>Deepak Jaikishan was entrusted with the job of taking care of ex-police officer turned private investigator P. Balasubramaniam. Do you remember Bala? Bala was the individual who signed the very damaging Statutory Declaration linking Najib Tun Razak to Altantuya Shaariibuu.</p>
              <p><br>Okay, and with that intro, it is now time to continue the story of the Carpetman cum Bagman cum Toyboy of the ‘First Lady’ who goes by the name of Deepak Jaikishan and reveal what naughty things he has done.</p>
              <p>Deepak Jaikishan was entrusted with the job of taking care of ex-police officer turned private investigator P. Balasubramaniam. Do you remember Bala? Bala was the individual who signed the very damaging Statutory Declaration linking Najib Tun Razak to Altantuya Shaariibuu.</p>
              <p>A few hours after Bala revealed his Statutory Declaration during a press conference on 3rd July 2008 he went missing. The following day he filed a second Statutory Declaration that contradicted his first one the day earlier. And then he disappeared totally.</p>
              <p>(Read PI Bala missing, says nephew by The Star, 5th July 2008).</p>
              <p>By the way, I also went to Rawang to meet Bala's nephew, R. Kumaresan, mentioned in this news report.</p>
              <p>What many did not know is, even as Bala was giving his press conference just before lunch on 3rd July 2008, some security personnel were in front of his house in Rawang. They then kidnapped his family.</p>
              <p>While Bala was enjoying his lunch a certain ASP Suresh phoned him and asked to meet. Bala was also told that his family’s safety was at stake if he refused to meet. Actually, Bala was having lunch with me at the time the phone call came in so I was sort of aware of what was happening, especially when I saw his face suddenly turn pale and he started panicking. And of course ‘they’ knew that I know and that is why they decided to go for me as well.</p>
              <p>After Bala filed his second (and contradictory) Statutory Declaration, they whisked him out of the country and hid him in India. Deepak then paid Bala RM50,000 a month to buy his silence.</p>
              <p>Bala had no choice, really. It was either RM50,000 a month and ‘retirement’ in India or suffer the same fate as Altantuya. And there was also his family to worry about -- so better the money than C4.</p>
              <p>And with that all safely in place Deepak thought that he and the ‘First Lady’ could afford to live happily ever after without any further problems.</p>
              <p>Little did they know that Bala was just biding his time, waiting for the right moment to strike back. And now he is striking back and has come out to reveal what really happened since the time he signed his first Statutory Declaration, followed by the second one the following day, 16 months ago.</p>
              <p>Today, we are going to show you just a small part of what Bala has revealed. Yes, only a small part. And there is much more to reveal over the next month or so, all very damaging indeed.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, until the real juicy parts are revealed, let us keep Seri Perdana in Putrajaya in suspense. Why should we allow them to sleep soundly? By the time we finish revealing everything there will not be a single Malaysian left who would any longer doubt Najib’s involvement with Altantuya.</p>
              <p>As an appetiser, take a look at the copies of the cheques below which the Carpetman cum Bagman cum Toyboy called Deepak paid Bala. If Bala signed a false Statutory Declaration, as they claim he did, then why do they need to hide him in India and pay him RM50,000 a month?</p>
              <p>Well they needed to do this because the first Statutory Declaration that Bala signed is true. And that’s why they needed him out of the way.</p>
              <p>Yes, the Carpetman cum Bagman cum Toyboy is soon going to be in deep shit so stay tuned for more as the shit hits the fan good and proper.</p>
              <p>Sleep soundly Putrajaya, wherever you are.</p>
