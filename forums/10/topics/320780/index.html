              <p> MEMBERS of Parliament, security experts and ordinary Singaporeans said
              they were shocked at Wednesday's double escape attempt at the
              Subordinate Courts, which came barely four months after the daring
              escape of Jemaah Islamiah detainee Mas Selamat Kastari.</p>
              <p>As more details of the arrest attempt emerged and pointed to a
              false sense of security on the part of some policemen, MPs, in
              particular, questioned if the lessons learned in the wake of Mas
              Selamat's breakout had filtered down to all levels.</p>
              <p>The two men, who had been in court to face charges related to
              robbery with hurt, had, on the pretext of asking for water, knocked
              down and brutally beaten up a cop when he opened the cell - a breach of
              procedures.</p>
              <p>The mistake was compounded by that of a second cop, who
              unlocked the main gate to the lock-up area without verifying the men's
              identities through closed-circuit television.</p>
              <p>Chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Home
              Affairs and Law Teo Ho Pin said on Thursday: 'When Mas Selamat escaped,
              that was a wake-up call. But I'm not very sure how many people have
              woken up.</p>
              <p>'There must be checks and balances that the message is
              conveyed down effectively to the last man in the force. Things
              mentioned at the management level or in the media may not go down to
              the last man.'</p>
              <p> He said he would 'definitely query the Home Affairs Ministry again' at the next parliamentary sitting next month.</p>
              <p>In online forums and interviews, other Singaporeans expressed
              their incredulity that another escape, though botched, had occurred.</p>

              <p>Escape bid from court: SOPs not followed
              					  </p>
              <p>A BREACH in procedure allowed two detainees to make an escape bid
              from the lock-up at the Subordinate Courts on Wednesday, said police,
              which will carry out a probe to see if there was any negligence
              involving the officers.</p>
              <p>Although the two men were re-arrested swiftly after their
              dash to freedom, the lunchtime breakout attempt will again raise
              questions about complacency and readiness levels withing the security
              forces, coming so soon after the escape of terrorist Mas Selamat
              Kasturi in late February.</p>
              <p>Commissioner of Police Khoo Boon Hui said in a statement
              issued at midnight: 'We have a proper system to manage
              persons-in-custody. Though our officers have arrested the two men
              expeditiously, I am treating the matter seriously and have directed CID
              to investigate into the escape, including whether there was any
              negligence involving the officers.'</p>
              <p>'Actions will be taken against those found to have not carried out their duties properly.'</p>
              <p>The flight to freedom for the escaped detainees was short-lived.</p>
              <p> One of them did not make it out of the court building. He was
              apparently tripped and fell near the security checkpoint at the court
              entrance and was pinned down by three uniformed officers and brought
              back to the lock-up.</p>
              <p>The other man managed to get as far as the driveway of the
              nearby Furama Hotel about 100m away after leaping over a rope barrier
              and dashing out of the building, with a pack of security guards and
              cops in hot pursuit.</p>
              <p>He was caught and brought back to custody.</p>
              <p>Police said the duo had appeared in Court on Wednesday's morning for separate charges related to robbery with hurt.</p>
              <p>They were brought back to the lock-up to be transferred to the Queenstown Remand Prison and were placed in the same cell.</p>
              <p>At about 1.45pm, a police officer opened the cell gate to give water to one of the men who had asked for it.</p>
              <p>On opening the gate, the two men seized the opportunity to attack the officer and charged out.</p>
              <p>They continued to assault the police officer violently,
              punching and kicking him in the face and stomach, said the police
              statement.</p>
              <p>While the Police officer was down on the floor, they made
              their way to a gate at the exit of the lock-up. They then pressed a
              buzzer to indicate for the gate to be opened.</p>
              <p><strong> Officer did not follow procedure</strong><br>'According
              to procedure, the police officer responding to the buzzer should verify
              the identity of the person via the CCTV before opening the gate. He
              failed to do so,' said the statement.</p>
              <p>'He opened the gate without checking, thereby enabling the
              two men to make their way through a stairwell leading to the ground
              floor public area of the Subordinate Courts.'</p>
              <p>An alert was raised and police officers were immediately deployed to seal off all exits.</p>
              <p>Within 10mins of the escape, police officers spotted both
              escapees at the lobby and managed to subdue one of them just before the
              main entrance.</p>
              <p>The other tried to dash out of the Subordinate Courts. He was arrested after a short chase.</p>
              <p>For voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant, the two men may be jailed up to seven years, fined, and caned.</p>
              <p>They will also be charged for escape from legal custody, which
              carries a jail term of up to two years and fine, if convicted.</p>
