            <div class='col-md body'>Adopted from http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html<br><br><blockquote>Article 2.<br>Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty.</blockquote>But somehow,there's only 1 malay pilot in the air force.<br><br><blockquote><br>Article 9.<br>No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.</blockquote><blockquote>Article 10.<br>Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.</blockquote>But imprisonment without trial exists.<br>For those who you who feels that only dangerous people such as terrorists gets this treatment,think again.<br>Everytime the papers report about them,it's always "A SUSPECTED JI MEMBER."<br><strong>A SUSPECTED</strong><br>If you had enough proof,might as well charge them in court for all to see.<br><br><blockquote>Article 11.<br>(1) Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence.<br><br>(2) No one shall be held guilty of any penal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a penal offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the penal offence was committed.</blockquote>It's strange,because in a recent drug-trafficking case.<br>Whereby 2 men were hung,Vignes Moorthy and his friend.<br>Both argued that they did not know there were drugs.<br>Vignes said his friend had framed him and vice versa.<br>One of them was lying but both were hung.<br><br><blockquote>Article 18.<br>Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.</blockquote>Jehovah's Witness followers are sent to DB or jailed for refusal of NS.<br>Even I,a freethinker,do not believe in touching guns,but I've still got to serve NS.<br>Christians,buddhists,sikhs,hindus,muslims all of which believe war is wrong.<br>We've still got to serve and touch this weapons which were meant to kill.<br><br><blockquote>(1) Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.<br><br>(2) Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.</blockquote>Martyn See &amp; 'Singapore Rebel' ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the West, human rights has evolved to a level where criminals have more rights than victims. Individual has more rights than the community. Some countries even use the name of human rights for personal interest. In my opinion, it is a matter of individual preference.<br><br>Would you want to live in a country where somebody has the right to takeaway the life of your love one and you have no right to seek equal justice?<br><br>Would you want to live in a country where the burgler can harm you but you cannot protect your family because the burgler has more rights then you?<br><br>Would you want to live in a country where you cannot lesson your children because they are protected by human rights?<br><br>And the lists go on...<br><br>Having said that, Singaporeans are getting more affluent and matures. I can see the government is slowingly liberalising freedom of expression. I think it is healthy for the nation in long-term. It is happenning, just be patient.     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
