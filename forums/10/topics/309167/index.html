              <p><strong>Use of Speakers' Corner for political activities could be liberalised</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The use of the Speakers' Corner as an outdoor venue
              for more political activities, including demonstrations, could be
              liberalised.
              <br> <br> Presently, only indoor venues are allowed be used for demonstrations.
              <br> <br>Deputy Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng
              disclosed a government review on this when he responded to Nominated MP
              Eunice Olsen's call for more avenues for Singaporeans to express their
              views on important issues.
              <br> <br>Mr Wong said accessibility to avenues to express one's views is not
              wanting, and generally there are more accommodative dialogues with the
              man-in-the-street on key issues.
              <br> <br>Over the years, he said the government has also seen and allowed
              more divergent views in various media - but it will stop short at
              outdoor and street protests.
              <br> <br>Referring to how recent demonstrations by the Hindu Rights Action
              Force or HINDRAF in Malaysia led to riots, Mr Wong added that
              Singapore's own experience in the past have also taught it to be very
              circumspect about outdoor and street protests.
              <br> <br>He also said that while most people involved in a demonstration may
              have no intention of using violence, a handful of agitators is all it
              takes to spark off violence.
              <br> <br>So while young people, in their exuberance may think it is fun to
              demonstrate, Mr Wong said that they would have no control of the
              situation if the agitators choose to exploit it.
              <br> <br> Mr Wong said: “The question for Singaporeans is whether we should accept the risks and accept the culture of street protests. 
              <br> <br>"In my view, one riot is one too many. Violence in the community
              takes a long time to heal. Once lost, public confidence in our security
              would take a long time to return." -CNA/vm </span></p>

              To called those incidents of stone-throwing and minor scuffles as riots is really exaggeration.
              
              If our ministers are to stick to the 1960s mindset how is Sg going to become a 1st world nation?
