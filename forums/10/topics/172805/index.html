You have no idea what nonsense you are spouting.<br><br>Chaim See Tong has done an excellent job in Potong Pasir in the resident's context. Here's a few example...<br><br>1) He spends his own money to rectify public defects when the government refuse to give him money to do so<br>2) He visit every single funeral and offer his condonlence in his constituency<br>3) He build facitilities that touches the heart of the residents.. (i.e. benches for the elderly, brick well for burning incense etc...)<br>4) You don't get fined for carpark in Potong Pasir !!<br><br>What has any PAP done to touch the heart of the people??

I have never had the chance to see my MP in person, but of course my constituency had a walkover each time...they don't see the need to build links with the people.</div>
