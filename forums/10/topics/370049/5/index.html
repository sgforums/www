              <p>The intelligent and rational realises his roots and knows he wasn't born intelligent.

              <p>Who is the government but representatives of the people through an election? Who are telling you to be that or do this for your country, none other than the people, to foster greater societal cohesiveness and unity? Such are crap to you?</p>

              <p><br>Humans are afterall territory protectism creature, as graceful as we wanted to be, I cannot blame singaporeans for discriminating and dislike for foreigners here, in fact, we Singaporeans are more tolerable then most country due to our multi racial adaptation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is the same if we work in another country, perhap you get more discrimination than them, especially so in country with a majority of homogenous citizens and few minorities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As far as i observed working in pubs, there are two types of foreigners perception, in term of singapore, one group understand that because their country is poor or poorly governed with no job or low pay job, they come here to search for better pasture and opportunity, the other are kind of booasting that their country is better than here, everytime compare ours and theirs, get his own fellow workers to join him in condemning Singapore, but still come here to work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I found that the former is more truth and understanding that they are here to work and we welcome them to help our economy, whereas the latter are just jealous, troublemakers and got lots of dissatisfaction but do not want to admit it. For these type of people, yes you can discriminate them all the way.</p>

              <p>Not really. It's only because the government welcomes them and our laws are extremely strict.</p>
              <p>Actually in many singaporeans' minds, we are not so tolerant towards the foreigners. I think we are still far behind US and Canada's standards, as I had mentioned in another topic, if we do a comparison in tolerance towards foreign races. The people there seem to be more open-minded and have strong support for human rights.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Never fly flag does not mean dun love SIngapore la. I only just put up the Singapore flag because last few weeks got no time and also forgot that must put. However, I do love my country - it constitutes part of what I am and also those whom I love. Although Singapore has changed since my childhood days, and I personally find it really hard to reconcile some of these changes within myself, I still belief deep down that it is still home. I'm sure many of you feel the same way as I do. As such, we should not allow any disgruntlement with the current state of our country to develop into an entrenched cynicism or disregard for our country or the celebration of our nation's birthday. Instead, we should celebrate the occassion in our own little ways and through our little endeavors or common adherence, seek to steer our country upon the path we belief to be the best for it. </p></div>

              <p>Quincey,</p>
              <p>Sorry lor, don't mean to rain on your forthcoming  jaunt (parade) to 'celebrate' but if u 'unlearn' the deluge and the barrage of info that is telecast, transmitted and enumerated by the govt - one can only opine and wonder why Singaporeans have to put up with this regressive , elitist and holier-than-thou stance (n policies) when it benefits only certain sector(s)  and so-called foreigners who are supposedly talented lah. I can add on but when one scrutinizes the rest would appear crystal clear.</p>
              <p>One who is intelligent (not to be confused with intellect), perspicacious and can read between the lines can see through the bluff.</p>
              <p>Of course, you are free to subscribe to what you have been conditioned to and stay maudlin!</p>
