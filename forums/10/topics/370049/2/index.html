              <p><em>Alfian Sa'at</em> <br> <br>Singapore you are not my country. 
                  <br>Singapore you are not a country at all.
                  <br>You are surprising Singapore, statistics-starved Singapore, soulful
                  Singapore of tourist brochures in Japanese and hourglass kebayas.
                  <br>You protest, but without picketing, without rioting, without Catherine Lim,
                  <br>but through your loudspeaker media,
                  <br>through the hypnotic eyeballs of your newscasters, 
                  <br>and that weather woman who I swear is working voodoo on my teevee screen.
                  <br> <br>Singapore, what are these lawsuits in my mailbox? 
                  <br>There are so many sheaves, 
                  <br>I should have tipped the postman. 
                  <br>Singapore, I assert, you are not a country at all. 
                  <br>Do not raise your voice against me,
                  <br>I am not afraid of your anthem although the lyrics are still bleeding from the bark of my sapless heart. 
                  <br>Not because I sang them pigtailed pinnafored breakfasted chalkshoed in school 
                  <br>But because I used to watch telly till they ran out of shows.
                  <br>Do not invite me to the podium and tell me to address you properly. 
                  <br>I am allergic to microphones and men in egosuits and pubicwigs. 
                  <br>And I am not a political martyr,
                  <br>I am a patriot who has lost his country and virginity. 
                  <br>Do not wave a cane at me for vandalising your propaganda with technicolour harangues, 
                  <br>Red Nadim semen white Mahsuri menses the colourful language of my eloquent generation. 
                  <br>Your words are like walls on which truth is graffiti.
                  <br>This has become an island of walls. 
                  <br>Asylum walls, factory walls, school walls, the walls of the midnight Istana. 
                  <br>If I am paranoid I have learnt it from you, 
                  <br>O my delicate orchid stalk Singapore, 
                  <br>Always thirsty for water,

                  <br>always running to keep ahead, 
                  <br>running away from yourself. 
                  <br>Singapore why do you wail that way, demanding my IC? 
                  <br>Singapore stop yelling and calling me names. 
                  <br>How dare you call me a chauvinist,
                  <br>an opposition party,

                  <br>but who will not hesitate from thrusting his tiger ribcage into
                  another fight because the lanterns of his lungs have caught their own
                  fire and there is no turning back. <br>Tell that to the yuppie who sits in meat-markets disguised as
                  pubs, listening to Kenny G disguised as jazz on handphone disguised as
                  conversation and loneliness disguised as a jukebox. <br>Tell that to all those exiles whose names are forgotten but who leave behind a bad taste in the thoughtful mouth, 
                  <br>reminding us that the flapping sunned linen shelters a whiff of chloroform.

                  <br>Tell that to Natra Hertogh a.k.a Maria who proved to us that blood

                  <br>Tell that to Lee Kuan Yew's squint. 
                  <br>Tell that to Josef Ng, who shaves my infant head amidst a shower of one-cent coins, and both of us are pure again. 
                  <br>Tell that to my Warrant Officer who knew I was faking.
                  <br>Tell that to the unemployed man who drinks cigarettes smokes
                  tattoos watches peanuts unself-conscious of his gut belch debts and
                  wife having an affair with the Salesman of Nervous Breakdowns. <br>Tell that to our Maya Angelou's who are screeching like witches
                  United Nations-style poems populated by Cheena Babi Bayee Tonchet
                  Melayu Malas Keling Geragok Mat Salleh.
                  <br>Tell that to the fakirs of civil obedience, whose headphones are pounding the hooving basslines of Damyata Damyata Damyata.
                  <br>Tell that to the statue of Li Po at Marina Park. 
                  <br>Tell that to the performance artists who need licences like drivers
                  and doctors and dogs when all they really need is just three percent of
                  your love. <br>Tell that to the innocent faggot looking for kicks on a Sunday
                  evening to end up sucking the bit-hard pistol-muzzle of the CID,
                  ensnared no less by his weakness for pretty boys naked out of uniform. <br>Tell that to the caretaker of the grave of Radin Mas.
                  <br>Tell that to Chee Soon Juan's smirk. 
                  <br>Tell that to the pawns of The Upgrading Empire who penetrate their
                  phalluses into heartlands to plant Lego cineplexes Tupperware
                  playgrounds suicidal balconies carnal parks of cardboard and condoms
                  and before we know it we are a colony once again.
                  <br>Tell that to Malaysia whose Desaru is our spittoon whose TV2 is
                  our amusement whose Bumiputras are our threat whose outrage is our
                  greater outrage whose turtles are weeping blind in the roaring daylight
                  of our cameras. <br>Tell that to the old poets who have seen this piece of land slip
                  their metaphors each passing year from bumboats to debris to sanitation
                  projects to drowning attempts to barbed neon water weeds on a river
                  with no reflections a long way off from the sea.
                  <br> <br>O Singapore your fair shores your garlands your GNP. 
                  <br>You are not a country you are a construction from spare parts. 
                  <br>You are not a campaign you are last year's posters. 
                  <br>You are not culture you are poems on the MRT. 
                  <br>You are not a song you are part swear word part lullaby. 
                  <br>You are not Paradise you are an island with pythons. 
                  <br> <br>Singapore I am on trial. 
                  <br>These are the whites of my eyes and the reds of my wrists. 
                  <br>These are the deranged stars of my schizophrenia. 
                  <br>This is the milk latex gummy moon of my sedated smile.
                  <br>I have lost a country to images, it is as simple as that. 
                  <br>Singapore you have a name on a map but no maps to your name. 
                  <br>This will not do; we must stand aside and let the Lion crash
                  through a madness of cymbals back to that dark jungle heart when eyes
                  were still embers waiting for a crownless Prince of Palembang.</p>

              With the way the current government works, it will be a matter of time before they brought Singapore down to it's knees. The question is when? Would it be 10 years, 20 years or 30 years? Even if they haven't brought Singapore down by then, will the lives of the people be better off or be worse than now?

              <p><br> With the way the current government works, it will be a matter of
                      time before they brought Singapore down to it's knees. The question
                      is when? Would it be 10 years, 20 years or 30 years? Even if they
                      haven't brought Singapore down by then, will the lives of the

              <p><em>     Lee Hsien Loong currently earns an annual salary of S$3,870,000 (US$ 2,856,930 ) Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said in parliament that the Singapore head
              of state and his ministers deserve such a high income because Singapore
              is a small country that lacks a large pool of talented people</em></p>
              <p>Will the next pay increment be 4.8m? reason be - it is only fair to say he should get paid $1 per population. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>to the people who say "i love my country but not the gahmen". think again about your stand. who is it that shapes the country that you so love? the people? then think again, who shapes the people? ultimately its the gahmen, who's ruled singapore since 1959. so if you love your country, its almost as good as saying you love gahmen :)</p>
