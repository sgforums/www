              <p>I think buying high and selling low is a unique culture to certain firms in a minority of one. That probably explains why anyone who doesn't share the sentiment (ie. most rational market participants who buy low and sell high) is said to possess "strategic differences"...</p>

              <p><br>Singapore is still vibrant and moving is because of its open policies in embracing FTs and Free trade. As such, we are also vulunerable to any economy gitches both domestically and internationally.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As far as  top FT is concern, you need to employ 6 singaporeans inorder to get one, and that taper off till the lower workers side whereby you need to have 1 singaporean inorder to employ 3 foreign workers. This basic rule of thumb can change as we move along. Therefore, you can guarantee Singaporeans getting jobs, especially at the higher end. As for the lower end, in fact, heavy industrial is finding it difficult to get locals to join in, this may due to old age population and the younger ones dislike of dirty and hardwork. In the end this lower end bosses have to seek MOM for more foreigner workers with an exception of no singaporeans. This typically happen in our IR construction, it lack of locals and without locals, boss cannot get foreigners to help out.</p>

              <p>Yes foreign workers are needed to do the dirty jobs. But not so much for white collar professions.</p>
              <p>I just feel it's normal for foreigners to receive discrimination at the workplace by Singaporeans by being judgemental on their cultures. Mock their cultures to make them feel embarassed. Don't make their races new official races of Singapore in future.</p>

              <p><br>Humans are afterall territory protectism creature, as graceful as we wanted to be, I cannot blame singaporeans for discriminating and dislike for foreigners here, in fact, we Singaporeans are more tolerable then most country due to our multi racial adaptation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is the same if we work in another country, perhap you get more discrimination than them, especially so in country with a majority of homogenous citizens and few minorities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As far as i observed working in pubs, there are two types of foreigners perception, in term of singapore, one group understand that because their country is poor or poorly governed with no job or low pay job, they come here to search for better pasture and opportunity, the other are kind of booasting that their country is better than here, everytime compare ours and theirs, get his own fellow workers to join him in condemning Singapore, but still come here to work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I found that the former is more truth and understanding that they are here to work and we welcome them to help our economy, whereas the latter are just jealous, troublemakers and got lots of dissatisfaction but do not want to admit it. For these type of people, yes you can discriminate them all the way.</p>

              <p>Obviously you do not know what you're talking about.</p>
              <p>Clearly, if there were that many North Koreans seeking political asylum, it would go to suggest you cannot separate a country from the party in dictatorships. It hardly is "another case altogether"!</p>
