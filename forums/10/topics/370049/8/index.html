I haven't given them many hints and even tell them what to do, but they turn a blind eyes and keep scolding me, of course in cyber, i got hard feeling over it, but let say if it is a dialogue session with the young ones, i think people would throw chair and tables at them.

              <p>Hi George Tan<br><br>I don't believe for a moment that voting for the Opposition will hurt her pub business. She is the type who enjoys being a contrarian here. Sometimes, she goes too far and she has to be told of that.   </p>
              <p>When enough people like her or the frequency of her, bring this forum to an extreme veneer, this forum becomes anything but a political forum - perverse, side-show, theatric and laughing-stock.</p>

Dun come and tell us about temasek investment or LKY or LHL personnel life and all those shit...that will only make more people look down on opposition, good for nothing except digging people arse..</p>

              <p>sure, dying is easy if you pass away peacefully, good life, but if you go in and out of hospitals and still struggling in bed, most likely u did something wrong in your life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and as long as you earn an honest living, be it on your knees and scrub the floor, your conscience is clear, the day you go, you can afford a smile.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>waht is golf and sharkfin compare to a clear conscience, those materialism is not going to make you any happier than to help someone realise the meaning of life. You understand what i am saying??</p>

              <p>You have the tendency to selective quote what people's posting here. Good if you read carefully of what people's posting <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for you</span> before replying. <br><br>Frankly, who you vote is your own business. But know this, people like Atobe, Ah chia AndrewPKY who posted here in Sgforums may not be the Opposition or representative of the views of the Opposition. You don't find PAP backbenchers giving a damn here, you really think the Opposition give a damn here? <br><br>The Opposition here never made headway, never win the heart of the people simply because politics is never a fair game - here and anywhere else in the world.  <br><br>This is a forum. If people come here and talk about Temasek investment or LKY or LHL's personnel life, these people are still better than you who come here to talk about your pub, your girls and sexaul talks.<br> <br>The old hags didn't dig up old grandma story. The new book about PAP is written by a group of 3 journalists - who knows for what, out to make some money? As far as I know, only Ah Chia like to dig out some old grandma stories here in Sgforums -and nobody harasses or chides or calls him goondu like the way you did.</p>
