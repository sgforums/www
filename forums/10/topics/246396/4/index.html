            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by BillyBong:<br><strong><br><br>Let's review the situation that is contributing to dissent among the people:<br><br>When Seng Han Tong gets 'assaulted', the perpertrator is arrested on the spot without a moment's hesitation. When the average man on the street is punched and beaten, he is offered a benign response. No arrests are made and no attempt to dilligently offer chase while the trail is warm, even after repeated requests from the victim.<br><br>After consulting the lawbook, yes it is proven that the police acted 'appropriately'. A civil servant performing his 'duties' was assaulted and the police duly acted according to the law. On the other hand, the guy assaulted at Geylang was not a civil servant, hence was required to lodge a complaint to the magistrate's court to pursue a 'civil case'.<br><br>Does this make sense? Both got assaulted, but the law offers secure protection to one party and rather neglects the other. Could the lopsided nature of this conundrum be more revealing? Or is it a broken reflection of a system gone very wrong in its approach?<br><br>This obvious flaw further widens the gap between equals, and adds weight to the phase: <span style="font-style: italic;">[b]'some are more equal than others' </span></strong><br><br>As advocates of change and improvement, should we not try to constantly improve a system? I cannot fault the Police for not always being around when they are needed most, but they deserve to drop points for not responding when they should.<br><br>Some at least...[/b]</blockquote>Actually, it is not a 'civil case'. a civil case is one in which police intervention is not required, simply because there is no offence disclosed. however, in this case, there is an offence disclosed, therefore it is not a 'civil case'. the officers were wrong to claim as such. this type of offence is a 'non-seizable offence'.<br><br>the main difference being, the police cannot arrest the perpetrator without a warrant, and there are also limited powers of investigation. certain special rights [sec 120, 121, 125 and 126] of the criminal procedure code [cap 68] cannot  be exercised at all. yes, the police can and will investigate, but their powers are limited to a certain extent. this is what happens when the offence is a non-seizable one. if the offence is a seizable offence, then there will be no issues because an arrest can be effected immediately, without a warrant. and the special rights as mentioned above can be exercised too.<br><br>again, as I said, the difference in the two cases that you have mentioned is that one guy is a civil servant deemed to be on duty while the other is not. but i also believe that the reason why people react strongly to this matter is because of the perceived lack of action on the Police's part. To assume that, however, is very, very wrong.<br><br>preliminary investigations will be under way. however, there is a limit to police powers in these type of cases, as I have said. so, in order for police to be able to exercise full powers of investigation, the police would require either the green light from a magistrate, or a sanction from the head investigation of the police div concerned. So all the Police can do will be to conduct preliminary &amp; limited investigations until they receive the green light from the magistrate.<br><br>the primary purpose in requiring a magistrate's intervention in such cases is because as I have mentioned before, technically, voluntarily causing hurt happens all the time. the hurt caused can be from anything from a quick flick of the hand, to a punch. the hurt caused is starkly different, but it will still fall back into the same classification.<br><br>the magistrate will hear out each case, and depending on each case's merits, he will decide if police intervention is necessary. if it is, then the police division concerned will then be empowered with full investigation powers.<br><br>you also have to understand that the Police do not have unlimited powers, they're not above the law. they too have their hands tied sometimes.

It was tied to a fence so tightly that it looked as if it was having difficulty breathing so I decided to try to release it. Suddenly, a man shouted at me, claiming I was trying to steal his kitten.<br>Before I could utter a word, he punched me in the face.

Anyone reading her article will feel incensed at the police for not doing more. However, none of us really know what happened, do we? Ms. Kong stated that '  Suddenly, a man shouted at me, claiming I was trying to steal his kitten.

Assuming what Ms. Kong said about the guy accusing her of stealing his kitten is true, can anyone here say, she kept quiet all the time even as she attempted to free the kitten?  And if Ms. Kong is just a guai guai girl/woman, she would have retreated when she heard the guy's accusation, wouldn't she?

Any compassionate human being would have responded with the same instinct - free the kitten regardless.<br><br>Your preference of 'calling the cops' is simply passing the buck, when at that point of time, it seemed a straight-forward matter any decent person could accomplish, certainly something that did not require police assistance.<br><br>When set upon by a deranged stranger making false accusations, why assume him to be a mental case? Why draw this conclusion as an excuse when he is more likely a typical street thug and bully? His brazen claim that he is 'not afraid of the authorities' clearly demonstrates contempt and utter disregard for the law, and certain displays no psychotic behaviour.<br><br><blockquote>My second thought is, what is that guy doing near her?

By making so many assumptions about the writer, have you fallen into your own trap of making presumptions? How a person responds to any situation is surely up to what experience or how level-headed the person is.<br><br>There is nothing to conclude whether Ms Kong handled herself well in the situation, if at all. The facts simply are: an attempt was made to free a trapped animal. During the process, the would-be rescuer was assaulted, and verbally abused, sufficient enough to involve the police, a shopkeeper and outpatient treatment at a local hospital.<br><br>Your entire 'mind my own business' approach bellies the apathetic reflection of Singaporeans content to 'stay out of trouble' rather than step forward to right a simple wrong.</div>

However, it is not possible for discretionary powers to be exercised all the time. I'll quote you an example:<br><br>let's say you were a victim of road rage, and you call for the police. upon police arrival, both you and your assailant are still there. you are obviously still very much distressed. and upon being interviewed by the police, your assailant makes a scene and is behaving in a very disorderly manner. in this instance, he could be arrested. however, he will not be placed under arrest for hitting you. rather, he would have been arrested for behaving in a disorderly manner, thereby disrupting the peace of the place. this is just one example of exercising discretion. If the alleged assailant is of unsound mind, then he will be arrested for being of unsound mind. It's another example of discretion.<br><br>It's about analysing the situation, and if an arrest needs to be effected, using the appropriate laws to do it. Interrogations will definitely take place, but you have to understand that the Police do not have the right to detain anyone to do it. Unless of course, the offence is a seizable one, eg theft, robbery, causing hurt by dangerous mean, causing grevious hurt, etc.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>In the case of the Mazda rookie who took an MX-5 for a spin and ended up causing the death of the sales executive, surely there was sufficient evidence to at least suspend his license pending the outcome of investigation?

It could be the evidence attained, medical reports, coroner's inquiry verdict/findings, etc. It could also be due to other unforeseen circumstances that we do not know of.<br><br>And if the laws are what rile you the most, then it really is no point at all lashing out at the frontliners who have to work around/with them, is there?</div>
