If it results in a fracture, emasculation, loss of sight/hearing, dismembering of any joints, permanent disfugration or any other criteria that would allow the case to be classified as voluntarily causing grevious hurt, sec 325 cap 224, then you will be placed under arrest.<br><br>If not, then it will fall under voluntarily causing hurt, sec 323 cap 224. In which, you would know by now, would require a magistrate's complaint to allow the police to have full investigative/arrest powers.<br><br>One reason why voluntarily causing hurt requires such a procedure is because it is needed to filer out the less serious cases from the ones which are more severe, but do not fall under sec 325 cap 224. As you can see, there is no in-between. Either you get injured real bad or you don't.<br><br>And technically, voluntarily causing hurt happens all the time. Even if you were to playfully hit your friend on the arm, then that would be voluntarily causing hurt too. As would be a slap to the face.<br><br>If an arrest is made everytime a call is made for cases of alleged assault, can you imagine what would happen? People will be saying cops jump the gun too early and are arrest-happy.

When the average man on the street is punched and beaten, he is offered a benign response. No arrests are made and no attempt to dilligently offer chase while the trail is warm, even after repeated requests from the victim.<br><br>After consulting the lawbook, yes it is proven that the police acted 'appropriately'. A civil servant performing his 'duties' was assaulted and the police duly acted according to the law. On the other hand, the guy assaulted at Geylang was not a civil servant, hence was required to lodge a complaint to the magistrate's court to pursue a 'civil case'.<br><br>Does this make sense? Both got assaulted, but the law offers secure protection to one party and rather neglects the other. Could the lopsided nature of this conundrum be more revealing? Or is it a broken reflection of a system gone very wrong in its approach?<br><br>This obvious flaw further widens the gap between equals, and adds weight to the phase: <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>'some are more equal than others' </strong></span><br><br>As advocates of change and improvement, should we not try to constantly improve a system? I cannot fault the Police for not always being around when they are needed most, but they deserve to drop points for not responding when they should.<br><br>Some at least...</div>
