It was tied to a fence so tightly that it looked as if it was having difficulty breathing so I decided to try to release it. Suddenly, a man shouted at me, claiming I was trying to steal his kitten.<br>Before I could utter a word, he punched me in the face. As I staggered backwards I tried to explain but he punched me a second time. Fearing for my life, I picked myself up and ran. The man chased after me, hurling abuse along the way.<br><br>I ran into a nearby shop to seek refuge as well as to call the police. The man followed me in, proclaiming that he wasn't scared of the authorities. He grabbed my bag and used it to strike me.<br><br>The shopkeeper told the man to back off as he did not want trouble inside his shop.<br><br>After calling the police a few times, two officers finally arrived about 20 minutes later. One took down my particulars as well as my account of what had happened while the other appeared to do the same with my assailant.<br><br>An ambulance was called and I was taken to hospital for a checkup. Upon being discharged, I immediately filed a police report.<br><br>Three days later, when I managed to speak to the officer-in-charge on the phone, I was told that the police would not be taking any action as it was a 'civil case'. I was told to file a magistrate's complaint, which I did.<br><br>What is the role of the police in such cases, where hurt has been caused?<br><br>What kind of message is the police sending to people such as the individual who assaulted me?<br><br>Kong Lai Meng (Ms) </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This must surely take the cake. After the Geylang incident when a passer-by was assaulted by a group of thugs who promptly escaped on their bikes, it seems the police actually allow lawlessness, unable to draw a distinction as to when action should be taken and deferment to the magistrate's courts.<br><br>Have our boys in blue started to 'outsource' their direct responsibility? Does assault and battery now fall under a re-structuring plan that prevents our shameless law enforcement officers from performing their role?<br><br>There appears to be no consequences for street bullies and thugs who can openly and violently assault others with impunity.<br><br>What's next?<br><br>No wonder the assailant made the audacious claim that he <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>wasn't scared of the authorities</strong></span></span>.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To think that I was at my cousin's PNSF passing-out parade yesterday, where they recited this pledge: <blockquote>We pledge to be loyal and true to the Police service and the Republic of Singapore.<br><br>We pledge to uphold the law, to protect life and property, to prevent and detect crime.<br><br>We pledge to discharge our responsibilities without fear or favour, regardless of race, language or religion.<br><br>We pledge to strive for excellence, to be proactive and to exercise initiative in our duties.<br><br>We pledge to serve our community and our country and to be courteous and humane in our dealings with every fellowman.</blockquote>Perhaps it's time to amend it to include upholding KPIs?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the problem is.. that not a lot of people know that there are so many procedures involved.. BEFORE the police can carry out investigations..<br><br>that's why when the victims actually know, most of them might withdraw their charges .... no wonder so many bullies out there..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
