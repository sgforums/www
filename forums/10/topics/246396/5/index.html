It was tied to a fence so tightly that it looked as if it was having difficulty breathing so I decided to try to release it. Suddenly, a man shouted at me, claiming I was trying to steal his kitten.<br>Before I could utter a word, he punched me in the face. As I staggered backwards I tried to explain but he punched me a second time. Fearing for my life, I picked myself up and ran. The man chased after me, hurling abuse along the way.<br><br>I ran into a nearby shop to seek refuge as well as to call the police. The man followed me in, proclaiming that he wasn't scared of the authorities. He grabbed my bag and used it to strike me.<br><br>The shopkeeper told the man to back off as he did not want trouble inside his shop.<br><br>After calling the police a few times, two officers finally arrived about 20 minutes later. One took down my particulars as well as my account of what had happened while the other appeared to do the same with my assailant.<br><br>An ambulance was called and I was taken to hospital for a checkup. Upon being discharged, I immediately filed a police report.<br><br>Three days later, when I managed to speak to the officer-in-charge on the phone, I was told that the police would not be taking any action as it was a 'civil case'. I was told to file a magistrate's complaint, which I did.<br><br>What is the role of the police in such cases, where hurt has been caused?<br><br>What kind of message is the police sending to people such as the individual who assaulted me?<br><br>Kong Lai Meng (Ms) </span></div></blockquote>Next time, punch the guy a few times then call the police</div>

[/b]</blockquote>while i agree that what we had was a hypothetical discussion, i do have to bring about a point: it takes a very substantial amount of force to crack a windscreen, let alone to shatter it. Flying pebbles won't even cause a scratch on the windscreen, for the glass has a very high value of impact strength, as well as surface hardness. And if you didn't know, even in fatal accidents when people get tossed onto the windscreen, it still stays intact. It takes a very, very high amount of force to break a windscreen, and a very high speed of travel before an accident to shatter it from within.<br><br>while under normal  circumstances it would be word against word, like I said, the windscreen will be enough grounds to believe that something has taken place. this will then lead to the checks, and subsequent arrest.<br><br>while as we both have stressed, the discussion has been purely hypothetical, I just thought to bring the fact that it takes a substantial amount of force to crack the windscreen, let alone break it, to light.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
