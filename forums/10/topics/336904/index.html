              <p>What Is The Federal Reserve? <br>A History of The US Central Banking System<br><br>© Rebecca Turner<br><br>Jan 28, 2008<br> <br>What is the Federal Reserve? It's a privately-owned organization that controls America's money supply.<br><br>What The Federal Reserve Does<br><br>As the central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve has three key functions which revolve around managing the money supply:<br>To adjust base interest rates<br>To print and release new bank notes<br>To remove existing notes from circulation<br><br>By controlling the amount of money in circulation, the Federal Reserve can make US currency either more or less valuable, thereby influencing the country’s economy on a multitude of levels.<br>How The Federal Reserve Was Founded<br><br>In 1907, rumours emerged that caused the latest of a string of large-scale bank runs. Fears of an economic depression shattered the confidence of the American people, who soon called for bank reforms.<br><br>A group of wealthy businessmen – led by J P Morgan, Paul Warburg and John D Rockefeller – intervened to pave the way for the establishment of a private central bank. With their connections, they soon put a banker-controlled plan to President Woodrow Wilson.<br><br>In a decision that would later come to haunt him, President Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act into law. In doing so, he effectively placed control of the US economy squarely in the hands of the private bankers, who would go on to create massive amounts of credit – backed by absolutely nothing.<br><br>They did this by printing new bank notes and lending them with added interest to the Government for redistribution. This means that every single dollar in circulation has a debt attached, payable to the creators of the Federal Reserve. Today the national debt is over $9.2 trillion.<br><br>In 1919, President Wilson expressed his profound regret over his decision, stating:<br><br>“I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men.” ¹<br>The Federal Income Tax<br><br>In order to obtain repayments on this debt system, Morgan and his crew created a Federal Income Tax. This new tax was unconstitutional, because it was not apportioned (ie, equal for every person) and in fact was fraudulently passed in Congress.<br><br>This means that there is no law in place that dictates the average American working for a private business must pay Income Tax. This was even cited in a recent court case:<br><br>“If you… examined [The 16th Amendment] carefully, you would find that a sufficient number of states never ratified that amendment.” ²<br><br>US District Court Judge, James C Fox, 2003<br><br>In fact, in 1985, President Ronald Reagan created the Grace Commission to investigate where Income Tax money was spent by the Government each year. It found that 100% was absorbed by interest on Federal debt.³<br><br>That means that not a single penny collected from Federal Income Tax is spent on services provided by the Government. Such services have always arisen from other direct taxes, such as gasoline tax which pays for new roads.³<br><br>In the fiscal 2005 year, the Federal Income Tax on Americans’ labour came to $927.2 billion.³ That is more than three times the legal Corporate Income Tax collected that same year.<br><br>Today, as reported in the Federal Reserve's annual audit, there are now trillions of dollars missing – which it describes as “undocumentable adjustments”. Otherwise seen as a way of redistributing the wealth.<br><br>The Internal Revenue Service is yet to provide an explanation for the missing law of Federal Income Tax. Some Americans have already stopped paying what appears to be a fraudulent tax – and with rising awareness it is only a matter of time before a formal explanation will be demanded by the people.</p>

                  or iron: It was easier to carry around and the copper and iron could be
                  saved for use in everyday objects. Names and seals were printed
                  and written on paper money by the government officials who issued it...</p>
              <p>...Flying cash" was not meant to be currency and its circulation was rather limited.
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Real paper currency was not introduced until early in the Song (960-1279) dynasty, when it
                  was utilitzed by a group of rich merchants and financiers in Szechuan, the

              <p>Yes, it is true.</p>
              <p>I found evidence of New World Order in China, according to this source:</p>

              <p><span class="text">
              </span></p><p class="defaultfont"><strong>Establishment of New Order</strong></p>
              <p class="defaultfont">In the early 1990s, Deng put forward to
              establish a new, just and reasonable world political and economic order
              for peace, on the basis of Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.</p>
              <p class="defaultfont">The proposal coincides with his judgment that peace and development are
              the two main themes of the current world. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He noted that to establish
              such <strong>a new world order</strong>, all countries should jointly break the old
              order, oppose hegemonism and any interferences in internal affairs of
              others, strengthen and expand international economic cooperation based
              on equality and abandon all discriminatory policies and practices.</span></p>
              <p class="defaultfont">The core of a new political order is mutual
              respect for sovereignty and non-interference in others' internal
              affairs. The essence of a new economic order is to seek equality and
              mutual benefits and compliment each other.</p>
              <p class="defaultfont">To achieve these objectives,
              all countries should abide by the principles of sovereign equality and
              non-interference in the internal affairs of others, cooperate with each
              other to create a secured, stable and peaceful international
              environment, establish a new model of international relations for
              common development and foster a climate in which each member of the
              international community, big or small, can independently choose their
              development paths and carry out cooperation in harmony through
              expanding common grounds and setting aside differences...</p>

              <p><strong>Exactly. It defies logic when a government would rather borrow their currency instead of printing it themself. Which brings us to the 1913 coup by international bankers when the Federal Reserve Act was passed in Congress. The concept of a central bank isn't new to the US. The American Revolution in 1776 was attributed to the desire of the colonies to escape the interest-trap of the European Central bankers.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"The refusal of King George III to allow the colonies to operate an
                      honest money system, which freed the ordinary man from the clutches of
                      the money manipulators was probably the prime cause of the revolution." -Benjamin Franklin</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Since privately-owned central banks are profit-making corporations, they loan governments currency at interest, enslaving the nation. For only the principle is created, while the interest doesn't exist. It doesnt take a genius to figure out that this is absurb. </strong></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;" lang="EN-GB">The modern banking system manufactures
                      money out of nothing. The process is perhaps the most astounding piece of
                      sleight of hand that was ever invented. Banking is conceived in iniquity and
                      born in sin. Bankers own the earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the
                      power to create money and control credit, and with the flick of a pen they will
                      create enough money to buy it back again. Take this great power away from the
                      bankers and all great fortunes like mine will disappear, and they ought to
                      disappear, for this would be a better and happier world to live in. But if you
                      want to continue the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery,

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Anyway, since the early 19th Century, the US has fought to rid themselves of the economic enslavement of central bankers.

              <p>Perhaps you lack the faculties of inference and deduction. When the Fed creates money, from nothing, it loans it to the US Government at interest. Naturally, the only outcome is debt because the interest amount does not exist; only the principle does. Milton Friedman knew what he was saying when he blamed the Fed for the Great Depression because from 1921-1929, they expanded the money supply by almost 100% then contracted it severely in 1929, fuelling the Great Depression, allowing insider banks (Warburg, Rockefeller and Morgan interests) take over corporations with pennies on the dollar; ergo economic warfare. Are you saying that you know more economics than a Nobel Prize-winning economist? Are you calling him a "crackpot"?</p>
              <p>"Whoever controls the volume of money in our country is <strong>absolute master of all industry and commerce</strong>... and when you realise that the <em><strong>entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top</strong></em>, you will not have to be hold how periods of inflation and depression originate." (emphasis added) -President James Garfield, assassinated for challenging the money powers.</p>
              <p>Here's another "crackpot":</p>
              <p>"I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous than standing armies... If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation and then deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all their property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered."</p>

              <p>Even if its hard for anyone to believe that there is so much evil out there, it does not change the fact that is exists. Using preconceived ideas to judge the world will only lead to erroneous conclusions. Of course, everyone is biased but the key is to try to be objective. If you've read the history of the Federal Reserve, the legislation for it was crafted on Jekyll Island by a <em>group</em> of bankers. Why try to "topple each other" when all benefit from a system that exploits the average person?</p>

              <p>I understand what you mean but it is easy to tell a group of people that working together this one time will create so and so wealth.</p>
              <p>But i feel it is a whole different thing when you call this group of people to coordinate over such a long period of time, especially when each of them are powerful men by their own right. Plus, they themselves might be ambitious and extremely intelligent men, but such abilities do not neccessarily pass on to their descendants.</p>
              <p>The idea of NWO and illumanti suggests a sustained effort to bend the world's system over a period of around 2 centuries. And that is suggesting every major event that happens so far is part of a greater plan for world dominance. </p>
              <p>I recognize that all major wars fought so far since 1776 has been fanned by such bankers. But i feel that they are mainly opportunistic events rather than a sinister conspiracy. Besides, there is no windfall profit to be obtained through a N.W.O.</p>
              <p>We blame the bankers, but ultimately it is the human society that created them. And is the thing that sustains them. Rather than find someone to blame, perhaps we should reflect on our own collective flaws as humans.</p>

              <p><strong>True, it may very well be the result of opportunistic behaviour. I don't know for sure, doubt anyone knows either. Thats why its a conspiracy. But the fact which we acknowledge is that the ruling establishment is working against the interests of the common people; the idea that the people that possesses and who creates the real wealth of this world is subject to the people that create the money to represent that wealth is just disgusting. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Discussion about history purely for history's sake is pointless. There has to be a humane approach to society. And that's the flaw that we got to correct. Throughout the globalisation years, the gap between the world's richest and the world's poorest has doubled. 35,000 children die every day while Exxon Mobil makes $122,000 in profits (likely more) per minute. Whether or not there is a NWO conspiracy or not is besides the point, corporate-political interests are putting profits/power above human and environmental concerns. Can we transcend this human weakness called greed? Probably not (in my opinion), but there is a way to improve the human condition. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>As an age-old institution, money has been used to represent value in a society shaped by scarcity. Because something is scarce, some value is placed on it, and that is, in crude terms, how our society works. There isn't a need to charge abundant commodities like air because there is simply too much of it. Similarly, in a technological age, there is a way to transcend scarcity and therein lies a more humane society. Take energy for instance. Its because of the lack of it or the willingness of corporate interests to supply it to poor people from whom they cannot make a profit off. Whether or not you believe in Peak Oil or not is irrelevant. The point is that fossil fuels are limited and hence are priced leading to an inequitable distribution of energy. In 2006, MIT released a report on geothermal energy that calculated that with present technology, 4,000 years worth of energy can be extracted (<a href="http://geothermal.inel.gov/publications/future_of_geothermal_energy.pdf">http://geothermal.inel.gov/publications/future_of_geothermal_energy.pdf</a>). 4,000 YEARS! Wouldn't that put Big Energy out of business? With energy problems gone, providing clean water and a comfortable standard of living no longer presents a problem. As to food, in 2006 the FAO admitted that the world has a surplus food supply and could produce much more (</strong><a href="ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0750e/a0750e00a.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0750e/a0750e00a.pdf</span></a>)<strong>. The reason why there is still hunger in the world? Corporate profits. You don't earn money by giving food to hungry people. You see, it is the placing of profits above human concerns that is the basis of our society. How can we call ourselves human then? And how do we abolish the profits that are hindering social progress? Abolish its parent, the monetary system. While it was justified in a technology-less world, our technology allows an age of abundance that has no need for money. With that gone and the social neurosis that profit-driven activity creates, a humane society can emerge. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Is this communistic? No, communism still preserved the monetary system and political leadership. In a world where there is abundance, made possible by technology, there is no need for political leadership. And there is also no need for manual labour with automation. With our level of computing power, a humanely-driven technological society will only need supercomputers to keep society functioning. Of course, this is an overly simplification of the idea presented in <a href="http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com">www.thezeitgeistmovement.com</a>. No doubt idealistic, but as far as social progress is concerned, its the only way Humanity can substantially reduce poverty and suffering. That is the only why in which a billion people does not have to go hungry everyday and when the other half of the world can enjoy electricity. Its time to end the exploitation and suffering caused by fascistic bastards in thousand-dollar suits. Fascism doesnt only come with jackboots but also in Armani suits. <br></strong></p>
