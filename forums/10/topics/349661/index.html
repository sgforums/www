              <div id="articleBody" class="artText"><span> FOR someone who describes himself as a “simple and straightforward”
              man, Mr Chiam See Tong revealed that politics has “changed me a lot ...
              for the worse”.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Said Mr Chiam: “Now, I can’t treat anyone I meet as a friend ... I step back and ask myself: ‘What are you up to?’”
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              But isn’t that the price of joining politics?
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “I didn’t know before... now I’m learning,” he said.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Anyone who follows Mr Chiam’s political career would understand his disdain for the darker side of politics.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Fresh from leading the
              Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) to three parliamentary seats in the
              1991 General Election, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mr Chiam soon found himself ousted from the very

              <p>Friday, 27 February 2009</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/postersI/deception.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="250" align="right"><em>Singapore Democrats</em><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> Mr Chiam See Tong has asked  the</strong> </span><em><strong>Today</strong> </em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>newspaper to stop publication on his interview.</strong></span> Mr Chiam told <em>Today's</em> senior reporter, Mr Loh Chee Kong, that his remarks about the SDP were
              "off the cuff". Mr Chiam had told Mr Loh -- twice -- not to publish
              anything he said about Dr Chee Soon Juan and the Singapore Democrats.</p>
              <p>Yet, the reporter emailed Dr Chee and quoted Mr Chiam's remarks,
              wanting a response from the SDP secretary-general. Dr Chee replied to
              Mr Loh and refused to respond, saying that the intended report is a PAP
              ploy to put SDP in a bad light. (See <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/1998-today-wants-to-know-sdps-response-to-chiams-criticisms">here</a>)<br><br>Dr Chee subsequently wrote to Mr Chiam asking the Potong Pasir MP to address the situation with <em>Today</em>.
              Dr Chee wrote in his letter which was faxed to the Potong Pasir Town
              Council, "We bear no ill-will towards you and we wish only the best for
              you, your family and the Singapore Peoples' Party. We seek cooperation,
              not confrontation, with our fellow opposition parties."<br><br>But Dr
              Chee pointed out the SDP rejected Mr Chiam's characterisation of the
              party, saying that the comment was "inaccurate and uncalled for."<br><br> But he also called on the SPP leader to put aside the differences: "We
              accept that there were differences, perhaps even irreconcilable ones.
              But we see no merit in dredging them up again."<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This latest
              incident is the clearest demonstration yet of the media's agenda
              against the Singapore Democrats. Taking the cue from the PAP, the
              newspapers target the SDP and either black out news about us or report
              them in the most negative manner possible. </strong></span><br><br><em>Today's</em> tactics in using comments made in confidence to bait the other party is
              as low-down as it gets. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Now that the ploy has been exposed, what will
              the newspaper do?</strong></span><br><br>Is there no line below which the media won't go? Then again, we are talking about the Peoples' Action Party.</p>

              <h1>A blatant LIE by TODAY to split the opposition and smear Dr Chee</h1>
              <p><strong>By Eugene Yeo</strong></p>
              <p>In a previous article, I wrote about how the Singapore’s media had
              the uncanny ability to sugarcoat the truth to make bad news sound good.
              Now let me showcase another classic example of the unique “Asian
              spectacles” of Mediacorp to distort reality and perpetuate an outright
              blatant lie in order to serve the partisan interests of the PAP.</p>
              <p>TODAY published an article by Loh Chee Kong entitled “A politician
              who hates politics” in which the gist of it is to provoke disgust and
              repungance against the “betrayal” of his mentor Mr Chiam by Dr Chee:</p>
              <p>“Fresh from leading the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) to three parliamentary seats in the 1991 General Election, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr Chiam soon found himself ousted from the very party he had founded in 1980.</span></strong></strong></span></p>
              <p>The long-drawn saga — set in motion after <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Mr Chiam brought his one-time protege Dr Chee Soon Juan into the party — had obviously scarred him</strong></span>. </strong></span>Said his wife Lina: “He would have nightmares and wake up suddenly … he
              doesn’t talk about it but it’s hurting him inside.” (Read full article <a href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=2309">here</a>)</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>An unsuspecting reader who do not know the full facts behind this
              episode will have the misperception that Mr Chiam has been traumatized
              by his “ouster” from SDP which was “engineered” by Dr Chee. Nothing can
              be further from the truth. Chiam was never “ousted” by Dr Chee. He
              resigned on his own accord.</strong></span></p>
              <p>For over 15 years, the PAP and the state media have been propagating
              the myth of Mr Chiam See Tong’s “ouster” from SDP by Dr Chee Soon Juan
              to drive a wedge between the two and to smear the character of Dr Chee.</p>
              <p>They are well aware of the fact that Mr Chiam is an established
              opposition icon who has won the respect and love of many Singaporeans
              even from those not living in Potong Pasir. By spinning a tale on how
              the popular Chiam is forced out of SDP by his protege Dr Chee, it would
              deal a mortal blow to the image and standing of the latter.</p>
              <p>For those of you who are aware of the truth, what exactly transpired
              between Mr Chiam and Dr Chee in 1993 was elucidated clearly on the SDP
              website <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/the-party/faqs">here</a>.</p>
              <p>In summary, Chiam was not “ousted” by Dr Chee. He first resigned as
              SDP’s Secretary-General after failing to obtain the CEC’s support to
              censure Dr Chee for his hungry strike. In fact, Dr Chee had tried in
              vain to persuade Mr Chiam to stay on. Mr Chiam subsequently resigned
              from SDP and form the Singapore’s People Party in 1997.</p>
              <p>It is not for us to judge who is in the right or wrong. The
              pertinent question to ask is: why is TODAY dredging out the saga now
              again after so many years ? After all, it has already achieved its
              insidious motive of misleading the majority of Singaporeans about Dr
              Chee’s moral character.</p>
              <p>What does this irrelevant article serve really when we have more
              pressing concerns such as the investment losses incurred by our SWFs ?
              Mas Selamat Kasteri is still missing after a year and there is no
              mention of it.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is likely that the PAP internet brigade has detected an increase
              in support for SDP and Dr Chee amongst young IT-savvy Singaporeans who
              may not know about the saga in 1993 and therefore TODAY find it timely
              to drag the “dirt” out again to smear Dr Chee.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Loh Chee Kong of TODAY even has the temerity to write to Dr Chee
              asking for his response to Mr Chiam See Tong’s criticisms about the
              SDP. He said that he had interviewed Mr Chiam on Wednesday in which Mr
              Chiam said that the Singapore Democrats had engaged in “conspiratorial
              and destructive politics.” (Read Dr Chee’s reply to him <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/1998-today-wants-to-know-sdps-response-to-chiams-criticisms">here</a>)</p>
              <p>It is so obvious that Loh is trying to sow discord between the two
              men and to stir a hornet’s nest. A journalist is supposed to be
              neutral, balanced and objective in his reporting. What is Loh trying to
              do ? Why didn’t he include SDP’s explanation of the saga to allow
              readers to judge for themselves ?</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam See Tong had asked the <em>Today</em> newspaper to stop publication on his interview. Mr Chiam told <em>Today’s</em> senior reporter, Mr Loh Chee Kong, that his remarks about the SDP were
              “off the cuff”. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mr Chiam had told Mr Loh — twice — not to publish
              anything he said about Dr Chee Soon Juan and the Singapore Democrats.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yet, the reporter emailed Dr Chee and quoted Mr Chiam’s remarks,
              wanting a response from the SDP secretary-general. Dr Chee replied to
              Mr Loh and refused to respond, saying that the intended report is a PAP
              ploy to put SDP in a bad light.</strong></span> As expected, Loh went ahead and publish
              the interview anyway though he did not quote directly from Mr Chiam,
              his intention was clear.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I would suggest Mr Loh spend his time more productively on other
              important issues such as finding out the extent of losses incurred by
              Temasek and GIC NOW instead of regurgitating a stale grandmother story
              that few Singaporeans are interested about. Or if he is really so keen
              to write up on the “dark” side of politics, perhaps he should interview
              the old associates of Lim Chin Siong to find out how he was fixed by
              his own trusted comrade in 1963.</strong></span></p>
