            <div class='col-md body'>An Open Letter from Ms Sylvia Lim, Chairman of the Workers Party, to all Singaporeans.<br><br>Read the letter, and ask yourselves, are Singapore's opposition members not "credible", or is it because the government controlled media who has a monopoly on news here, say they are not?<br><br>------------------------------------<br><br><a href="http://www.wp.org.sg/news/hammer_online/06_The%20WP_Romance_Reality_Revival.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wp.org.sg/news/hammer_online/06_The%20WP_Romance_Reality_Revival.htm</a><br><br><strong>The Workers' Party: Romance, Reality, Revival?</strong><br><br>By Sylvia Lim<br><br>Sylvia Lim, 38, law lecturer, former Police Inspector and lawyer, is the Chairman of the Workers' Party.<br><br>In late June 2003, I received an email from a school student. He said:<br><br>"I am secondary four student currentlyÂ…Â….Though I am still below the legal age to vote, I guess people of my age group would [be] the target group for votes in the near future.<br><br>[O]ne thing I realise about people of my age group is that they have the impression that PAP = Government and Opposition Party = Anti-Government. I believe that each individual party should be known as it is. But currently, any other parties other then the PAP is known as the opposition party. Not many people of my age know what constitutes "opposition party". They know nothing about the WP or SDP or any other party.<br><br>If they do not know the opposition party now, I don' think they will in the future. I believe that being known as WP and not the Opposition Party is the first step to reach out to people. This will help to eliminate hopefully the feeling that any other party other than the PAP is anti-government.<br><br>These are just some of my views and I hope they can be of some help to you."<br><br>On June 1, 2003, the Workers' Party cadres voted for a "mega" Party renewal at our biennial Conference of Organisers. Eight out of the 14 Central Council members were not even Party members at the time of the previous Conference in May 2001. Since the announcement of those results in the press, we have had renewed interest from Singaporeans including those overseas. While I believe the 2003 Conference will historically be seen as a watershed for the Party, we have still a long road ahead. We, as a Party, must earn the people's trust as an organisation of committed Singaporeans who are not anti-government but have our own brand of constructive politics, as so well-advised by the student above. However, we have yet to reach the critical mass which is necessary for us to be a significant force in advancing the welfare of Singaporeans.<br><br>Singapore claims to be first world, but, in the field of politics, it does not seem to be so. The ruling People's Action Party, the Opposition Parties and the People have all played a part in creating this state of affairs. If we are to mature politically, we must remake ourselves.<br><br>WP has since 1957 not flinched from the challenge of opposition politics in Singapore. In our next phase, it makes sense for us to concentrate on building our organisational capabilities and not rely on individual heroes. To this end, there are 3 key areas we would want to enhance:<br><br>First, our intellectual capability and resource pool so as to provide constructive, timely and relevant input on public policy (in short, brainpower);<br><br>Second, our work on the ground, so as to convince Singaporeans of our sincerity and to canvass their support ahead of the next General Election (in short, manpower);<br><br>Third, our pool of funds, so that we can acquire resources and expertise to broaden our public outreach (in short, money).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brainpower</span><br><br>Our world has become very complex, and the continued economic and political survival of Singapore is no longer the "napshot" it was 20 years ago. The PAP government is now facing unprecedented challenges in an uncertain world and seems to be dependent on the USA to stimulate our economy and supplement our national defence.<br><br>The country needs to have input from varied sources in moving the country forward, and even the PAP admits this by having many committees of "outsiders" debating the remaking of everything in Singapore (except remaking the PAP, which Prime Minister Goh says is not necessary).<br><br>Any government, however apparently benign, must be effectively checked. The omnipresence of the PAP government in business and the media has already weakened the nation in its capacity for independent thought. This needs to be urgently corrected by getting experienced and/or qualified Singaporeans to participate in politics in opposition parties.<br><br>We are often asked questions like: "How will voting for the opposition help the country to solve problems?" Well, two answers: First, it will pressurise the government to work harder and keep its promises / obligations to the people, and secondly, with adequate brainpower, we can consistently go into the details and offer alternative policies across many areas of public policy.<br><br>I recently had an informal chat with some Nominated MPs, and shared with them that WP is not so much concerned with making political capital per se from the PAP's mistakes, but with the larger question of how to solve the pressing problems facing Singapore.<br><br>In order to be able to constructively question the PAP, we need to address challenges such as:<br><br>Information Access. Due to official information often being classified, we need alternative sources of information and people who know how to search for it. Unlike PAP ministers, we are unable to get civil servants to spend sleepless nights providing us with data and analyses within a short turn-around time. We do all the work ourselves from scratch through copious reading of materials, searching web-sites and consulting. If resources improve, we could have dedicated teams looking into specific areas.<br><br>Analyses and Positions. Each of us is limited by our own knowledge and life experiences, and will not individually have the necessary multi-disciplinary knowledge or experience to propose solutions from a macro-perspective. Teamwork is essential for this.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manpower</span><br><br>In order that we may reach our potential voters in preparation for the next General Election and beyond, here are some realities.<br><br>A Group Representation Constituency currently consists of about 120,000 voters. Assuming each household has between 2 to 4 voters, this could easily work out to between 30,000 to 60,000 households. Would anyone like to place bets as to whether the PAP will further expand the GRCs by amending the Constitution to allow for 10, 20 member GRCs at the next General Election?<br><br>The PAP has successfully entrenched its grassroots mechanisms through the formation of Residents' Committees and the use of the People's Association e.g. through Mayors and the Community Development Councils. You only need to look around you in your neighbourhood, at your workplace, or among your friends to suss out people with PAP connections. Breaking through these mechanisms to win the people's votes is possible, provided that we have a team of people with the "can-do" spirit.<br><br>Moreover, only the "relevant few" would know how the electoral boundaries will be re-drawn ahead of the public announcement. At the last Election in Nov 2001, the report of the Electoral Boundaries Committee was released ONE DAY before Parliament was dissolved and the election called. In a Parliamentary sitting in May 2002, Minister Wong Kan Seng told the House that the PAP would "try not to do it again". Note that it was not phrased as a promise! Hence, working with the real possibility of a sudden re-drawing of boundaries, we will need people to work with us on large areas.<br><br></div>

This view was held by our Government since independence, as the political turmoil in the Philippines, Indonesia, India and in Europe, have always been led by Political Thinkers with University Education.<br><br>Since the economy crashed in 2002, with massive retrenchment by MNCs relocating to China and other cheaper labor areas, the Government has embarked on a belated drive to encourage Local Enterprise and create Singaporean interests in ENTREPRENEURSHIP.<br><br>There has been talk (so far talk only) of Government Linked Companies being dismantled, so as to allow local enterprise to thrive. Unfortunately, the dismantling seems to see the GLCs going into the hands of approved individuals, who seem to be acting as proxy for the Government again. Wayang Kulit at work.<br><br>Quietly, the Government has adopted policies that they have publicly abhorred to assist the lower income group and poorer sector of the Singapore population - as they begin to default and pay for their daily needs of having a roof over their head, utilities and essential services on a daily basis.<br><br>The Government has to subsidised and provide social welfare on a larger scale as a larger number of Singaporeans begin to qualify for assistance as their economic capacity lowered as a result of the present economic situation; and this the Government does so only grudgingly, with requirements attached that 'rub salt into wounds' suffered by the economic downfallen.<br><br>Up till this day, Government direct assistance towards the welfare to the aged has been practically zero, with only the paltry tax deduction towards a single individual income tax from each household.<br><br>No direct Government grant is given to any Welfare Home that look after the aged, and this policy is adopted in a moralistic tone that it will require the young to continue to look after their aged parents.<br><br>With the economic hardship that has been felt since the first economic fallout in 1985, made worse in 1997, and double whammed in 2003, the young can hardly cope with their double jobs to maintain their own needs, let alone looking after their aged parents with high medical fees.<br><br>Without Government grants to Welfare Homes to look after Senior Citizens, the Welfare Homes are dependent on charity and contributions; and have to charge a high monthly fees to take care of the aged that are left in their care.<br><br>The contradictory demands made by the Government towards Singaporeans only serves to put more unnecessary pressures.<br><br>They need Singaporeans to be productive, to be entrepreneurial, to contribute to the economy. Meanwhile for the employed, they work for a reduced salary and CPF, while the Government charges higher rate for essential services and also increase the GST.<br><br>They expect Singaporeans to look after the aged parents, but they expect Singaporeans to be gainfully employed too. To be gainfully employed, Singaporeans will need to employ a foreign domestic help to look the aged left at home. Meanwhile, the Government will impose a Foreign Worker's Levy that is more then double the wage paid to the foreign domestic help.<br><br>Do we need to suffer another cycle of hardship as had experience repeatedly since independence in 1965 ?<br><br>Without any strong Opposition presence in Parliament to provide a serious challenge to the Ruling Party that form the Government, it can only result in the continued high handed, arrogant, and condescending attitude that has been displayed by the Ruling Party towards alternative views.<br><br>It is only with a credible presence in Parliament that will signal to the Ruling Party that Singaporeans are willing to take a risk for CHANGES to be made to the status quo.<br><br>Business cannot continue in the usual manner all the time.<br><br></div>
