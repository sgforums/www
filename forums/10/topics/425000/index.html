              <p>....if the japanese cant make it....i suppose some spore idjit generals or politicians would force all the reservist to die for their  lack of foresight to put out a nuclear plant accident.</p>
              <p>and funniest thing is i din see any politician in PAP side make a debate over it!!!!all the pap politicians must be close to useless then!!!!!i wonder if 200 pap politicians kept quiet n not make a squeak when their boss wanted to bake A CAKE ON THEIR HEAD......THEN I SUPPOSE sporeans would have much hard times ahead.luckily the earthquake in japan showed world n pap that nuclear plants are still unsafe despite them being modern.right now everyone within 20km radius is evacuated from a single blown up nuclear power station which is roughly the size of spore!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>*please note im using nuclear power stations and not simply nuclear stations because to some politicians nuclear stations are some kinda radio stations to them.</p>

              <p>Nuclear power stations should be built as soon as possible. If we have the right people to maintain the nuclear plants, there is no problem.</p>
              <p>It's more worrying when our neighbours have nuclear power stations. I think their nuclear plants will sure explode.</p>

              <p>If PAP don't build something, where can they find more money for their own pockets?</p>
              <p>It will just be another excuse to import foreigners anyway.</p>
              <p>If they build or don't build, locals will die of inflation and the lack of jobs anyway.</p>

Existing power generating plants are sufficient as long as the govt take the initiatives to prevent wastage of electricity.

              <p><br>you are damn right, i was just talking to my buddies in coffeeshop just days ago and criticing singapore govt initiatives in going clean energy is all show and no action.</p>
              <p>Look at the LPG or CNG price for car and compare it to thailand. you will know how much govt tax it. <br>there was not one estate in HDB using energy saving LED instead of FL tube. yes price is higher but it save on the energy. the town council save so much on sinking fund sooner or later, the money gonna sink with singapore.</p>
