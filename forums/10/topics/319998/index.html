              <div style="font-style: italic;">Talking
              about selfish existence? Read the article below especially the last
              paragraph.This is what true leadership is all about, and what is meant
              by 'lead by example'. It is the selfless spirit of giving up one's
              comfort position of authority for the benefit of the people under their
              domain. Instead, in times of crisis, some gahmen continues to plunder
              her citizens by taking million dollars salaries causing more hardship
              through high cost of living! It is like living for themselves and their
              interests only. Even private sectors though taking top dollars, at
              least, know how to give back to society and 'rise and sink' with their
              employees. Sorry but not some gahmen. If you are sinking, they make
              sure you sink deeper! Ever heard any minister say they will decline
              their million dollar salaries in recognition of the crisis and its
              effect on their citizens? Never!<br> <br> <br> WASHINGTON: US carrier Continental Airlines said Thursday it will cut
              3,000 jobs and 67 less fuel-efficient planes from its fleet and reduce
              services to cope with soaring energy costs. <br> <br> "The airline industry is in a crisis. Its business model does not work
              with the current price of fuel and the existing level of capacity in
              the marketplace. We need to make changes in response," the company said
              in a letter to its more than 45,000 workers from chairman and chief
              executive Larry Kellner and president Jeff Smisek. <br> <br> "We will need to reduce our capacity to match the reduced demand ...
              Although these changes will be painful, we must adapt to the reality of
              today's market to successfully navigate these difficult times," the
              letter added. <br> <br> Continental said the industry was facing the "worst crisis" since the
              September 11, 2001 terror attacks that caused a severe slump in air
              travel. <br> <br> <strong>Kellner and Smisek will decline their salaries for the rest of the
              year and any payment under the annual incentive program for 2008, "in
              recognition of the crisis and its effect on their co-workers." </strong></div>

              <p>Kellner and Smisek remind us of Iaccoca who gave up his
              own million-dollar salaries during the crisis of recession and with that
              leadership he turned around Chrysler years ago. <br> <br> Do we have such qualities among our leaders. So far we only see "yes men" who only care about their own career preferring not to get into problems to preserve their own position or trying to curry favor to advance their own interest with the power that be as seen by lack of responses from all MPs when I last wrote to them about wrongful government policies like HDB over-charging and calling it subsidy.</p>
              <p>Our leaders only push
              all blames in any failures of government policies like NFK, Mas Selamat
              and rising costs or recessions to others and people using hypocrisy and
              media to persist in their wrongs hoping to get away from all their
              errors and lack of qualities,</p>
