              <p class="intro"><strong>A
                  TEACHERS' guide to grammar circulated by the English Teachers
                  Association of Queensland is riddled with basic errors, leading an
                  internationally respected linguistics professor to describe it as "the
                  worst published material on English grammar" he has seen.</strong></p>
              <p>A
                  series of articles on grammar published in the ETAQ's journal intended
                  as a teaching resource is striking for its confusion of the parts of
                  speech, incorrectly labelling nouns as adjectives, verbs as adverbs and
                  phrases as verbs.</p>
              <p>University of Queensland <span style="color: #ff0000;">emeritus professor Rodney Huddleston, one
                  of the principal authors of The Cambridge Grammar of the English
                  Language,</span> said it took the association about one year to correct the
                  errors, and even then it confined most of the corrections <span style="color: #ff0000;">to its
                  website rather than in the journal </span>and did not republish the guide.</p>
              <p>"These articles contain a huge amount of error, inconsistency and
                  confusion," he said.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> "They constitute, without question, the worst
                  published material on English grammar by a native speaker that I have
                  come across.</span></p>
              <p>"(The author) clearly does not know enough about English grammar in general to take on work of this kind.</p>
              <p>"Anyone who analyses 'won't' and 'capable of' as adverbs, 'a pair'
                  and 'set of' as adjectives, or 'Sam's' as a possessive pronoun has no
                  business to be preparing a resource on English grammar for teachers."</p>
              <p>The articles, published with the general title <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Grammar at the
                  Coalface</strong></em></span>, were prepared by Lenore Ferguson, the editor of the ETAQ
                  journal Words'Worth and published over a series of months last year.</p>
              <p>Dr Ferguson printed three examples of the errors in the March
                  edition, saying they were "the result of the usual mishaps with work
                  that undergoes several drafts and is proofed and edited by the original
                  writer".</p>
              <p>Last night, she told The Australian the points Professor Huddleston
                  identified were differences of opinion rather than mistakes. "They
                  weren't all mistakes as he described but differences of opinion and
                  that's the way of the world," she said. Dr Ferguson said Professor
                  Huddleston did not follow traditional grammar but had invented his own
                  type, called the Cambridge grammar, which was unique and had
                  reclassified terms, such as calling prepositions conjunctions.</p>
              <p>"It's a totally different perspective and a totally different way of organising and thinking about language," she said.</p>
              <p>Dr Ferguson is an education consultant, a former president of the
                  association and has worked as a senior education officer for English in
                  the Queensland Education Department.</p>
              <p>A CV included with a paper presented at a conference by Dr Ferguson
                  says she has taught in primary, secondary and tertiary institutions and
                  has a long history of involvement in curriculum development and
                  professional development at state and national levels.</p>
              <p>ETAQ president Garry Collins said the mistakes were "relatively
                  minor" and the association had published an article on grammar by
                  Professor Huddleston in the journal and alerted readers through a
                  newsletter to his longer critiques published on the website.</p>
              <p>"Ideally the errors wouldn't have been there but these things occur in the best-regulated households," he said.</p>
              <p>"If coming upon these couple of minor inaccuracies caused teachers
                  to be having conversations about grammar in staff rooms then I would
                  see that as not a bad thing."</p>
              <p>Mr Collins accused The Australian of reporting educational issues
                  with a particular slant, representing minority views, and said
                  highlighting the Words'Worth articles would hamper teachers' engagement
                  with grammar.</p>
              <p>"It would be useful if the paper didn't seize on minority views but
                  try to report in ways which are relevant to what really does happen in
                  classrooms," he said.</p>
              <p>Professor Huddleston provided <span style="color: #ff0000;">The Australian with a list of 20
                  defects that summarised the errors in the ETAQ teachers' guide, which
                  take 10 pages of explanation in his reply article on the ETAQ website.
                  "A lot of them are very elementary," he said.</span></p>
              <p>In Dr Ferguson's first article, The Structural Basics, published in
                  March last year, she says "won't" in the sentence "The small boy won't
                  eat his lunch" is an adverb when, in fact, it is a verb. "Sam's" in
                  "Sam's folder" is classified as a possessive pronoun when it is the
                  possessive form of a proper noun; "what" in "They saw what lay before
                  them" was called a conjunction but it is a pronoun; and "a pair" is
                  classified as an adjective instead of a noun group comprising a
                  determiner "a" and a noun "pair". In the sentence, "The small boy is
                  capable of eating his lunch", the term "capable of" is called an adverb
                  when it is not a grammatical unit of any kind but an adjective followed
                  by a preposition.</p>
              <p>Similarly, in "a set of bowls", Dr Ferguson calls "set of" an
                  adjective when it consists of the noun "set" and preposition "of".</p>
              <p>Syntactic constructions such as "have a peep" are classified as
                  verbs, while "something" is classified as a pronoun and "everything" as
                  a noun.</p>
              <p>Professor Huddleston said he believed teachers would be discouraged
                  from reading his corrections because it was described in the journal as
                  being "complex, requiring readers to have extensive knowledge of
                  traditional, structural and functional grammars". It also repeatedly
                  refers to traditional grammar as "his grammar".</p>

              <p>Is this in line with what our prime ministers had told us?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>In his 1999 National Day Rally Speech on 22 August 1999,Â Goh Chok Tong,Â Prime Minister,Â highlighted the necessity for Singaporeans to speak good English. He emphasised that Singaporeans learnt English in order to communicate with the world, and therefore, they should speak a form of English that is understood by the British, Americans, Australians and people around the world. Thus, he claimed that for Singapore to become global and a first-world economy, it was essential that Singaporeans speak good English. Previously on 14 August 1999,Â Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Senior Minister,Â had also highlighted the importance of speaking good English, saying that Singaporeams ought to speak good English "so that we can understand the world and the world can understand us". He noted that Singlish was a "handicap" he did not wish on Singaporeans. The government felt that something had to be done to promote English and hence, the speak good English campaign came about.</p>
