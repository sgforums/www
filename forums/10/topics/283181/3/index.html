Not Saying that it's bad but imagine life without him, it would be totally diff, our sg may be like modern day Sri Lanka, Fighting Wars With The Tamils or being ruled by the communist, we should all be thankful of what he did, although some actions that the gov do might not seem right to us now, but hey when Als (olden day erp) was released, the people were furious, but then they slowly get to realise and are thankful of it, vehicle numbers dropped from 32500 to 7700 perday.<br><br></div></blockquote>i agree with you totally.<br><br>why do people only see his intentions as evil and him being a dictator? in fact, if we were to reflect what happened after the post-war period, we ought to be thankful that we've got him, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
