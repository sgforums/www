All of them cited one reason for living in the condo, security. They felt that the security in condos were adequate, like having security guards, smart cards, etc. When asked if they (condo owners) would like in HDB flats, they give a flat NO. They say the security is very bad, anybody could just leave anything on the ground floor and if it happens to be a bomb, the whole building would have gone.<br><br>I was surprised at the results, I thought they choose to live in condos because they were nicer, and of course the facilities. Never did I expect security to come out tops. Even the maids working in the condos say they would rather clean a condo than a HDB flat, because of security reason.</div>

And mind you, some of them has as many as 30 storeys. Assuming that during daytime students and adults go to work, bombing in daytime doesn't cause too much destruction. However, if the bombing is to happen at night time, say 8pm, won't the damages inflicted be great? Most of us would have be home by then. Just by destroying a block of flat you destroy quite a lot of lives. Some companies may not function due to the loss of one of their important employees. They may be on closing a contract soon, and the death could cost them a contract. That's what I think.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Work will be affected, public services will be overloaded, and the rest I can leave it to imaginations.</div></blockquote>I wouldn't say MRT stations are really well guarded. To cite an example, City Hall MRT Station. That station security is really very poor. There was no security guard during lunch time, and when the guard came, he was reading the newspapers. I was shocked. It is during lunch time when the human traffic is the heaviest, and terrorists would be harder to detect. They could easily plant a bomb in the midst of so many people.</div>
