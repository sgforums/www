Even the UN has trouble finding a single common definition for "terrorism" !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Fact is terrorism has been part of history.<br><br>The difference is today's terrorists have the means, access and ability to deliver large-scale destruction on civilian targets never seen before.<br><br>The 9/11 act is one example and it is  just an evolution of terrorism with modern technology.<br><br>It was organised, well funded and executed with precision.<br>It took advantage of Internet, computers, travel, banking system, cell phones and jet planes.  All employed to destroy another symbol of modern trade &amp; commerce.<br><br>Which is why Al-Qaeda has become a 'brand-name' amongst modern NGO 'terrorist' groupings. It is a private organisation with clearly defined agenda and the ability to influence goverments and societies via effective delivery of a concept into reality.</span><br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_terrorism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_terrorism</a><br><a href="http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/definition-terrorism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/definition-terrorism.htm</a><br><a href="http://cfrterrorism.org/groups/alqaeda.html" rel="nofollow">http://cfrterrorism.org/groups/alqaeda.html</a><br><br></div>

There has to be some room for negotiation.<br><br>The Americans gave us no choice but to follow their lead, or risk being put in the same league as the terrorists.
