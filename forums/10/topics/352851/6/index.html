              <p>I cant tell u now.But dunt forget the interest rate is as important as the ratio.</p>
              <p>Can u get a 2.6% pa in oz?U guys just tell me how high of salary in oz,</p>
              <p>good welfare.But dunt forget the higher interest rate in oz will off set</p>
              <p>part,if not majority of the higher salary.</p>
              <p>A A$200,000 loan for 30 years,in sg HDB rate,it is abt A$790 pm.</p>
              <p>In oz say interest rate is 5.5%,it is 1134pm.</p>
              <p>I think the rate is much higher than i quote.</p>
              <p>3.<span style="color: #ff0000;">crime rates---a matter of probabilty</span></p>
              <p>Like gambling or insurance,it is a number game.</p>
              <p>If u stay in a city of high crime rate,some one have to be the victims</p>
              <p>to make up the figures.</p>
              <p>I must admit some unluck guys in singapore also share the crime</p>
              <p>not according to the figures.Some car owners i know just get their cars</p>
              <p>broken into twice in a month.</p>
              <p>4.<span style="color: #ff0000;">Oz banks still very generous to grant near 100% loan,with the protection</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">of mortgage insurance.</span></p>
              <p>If the insurer can pay the banks when the lender default,then the banks</p>
              <p>are ok in the future.Wat if the insurers face systematic failure,like AIG,</p>
              <p>then can insurers compensate the banks?</p>
              <p>we have to bear in mind the down payments</p>
              <p>in oz traditionally is very low,even in 2009!!read carefully.</p>

              <p>So you're telling now that <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you're not 100% sure if the SG Grant was meant to be a temp boost when it is first introduced</span></strong></span>? And you're telling me that the <span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>OZ grant is 100% for GDP boost? </strong></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear <a href="/users/247101">Worldlybusinessman</a> can you please feed us with the avg salary in OZ? less tax</p>
              <p>and the housing price for the sub-urb areas with the land area inclusive. Thanks!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear lionnoisy, as your arguement is based on assumption and bias against the subject. i hope that you'll stop feeding us with your assumption and negative thoughts which de-rail us from the truth.</p>

              <p>I know that you're trying to promote singapore and devalue OZ. Your intention maybe good, but your approach is wrong. We all love sg and appreciate what the government has done for us, but somewhere, somehow, there's some black sheep in the government that don't appreciate singaporean and is taxing us all out.</p>
              <p>I hope this message will get across your mind and hopefully you'll change your approach towards your promotion of singapore. And please, don't devalue another country just because you've been rejected. It is not fair to that country.</p>

              <p>some things i find from lion noisy is correct...some not.</p>
              <p>singapores manufacturing industrial technology is state of the art. Mostly due to the fact that their manufacturing sector had technology transfer from japan and usa.Most of the current production lines in singapore with high tech side dont even need poduction operator to ram up and are able to start producing millions of products in a matter of days.All of them have robotics and do all the money making using computer programes.</p>
              <p>australia isnt so fortunate due to the fact that they are afraid of technology.their schooling and technology transfer from other countries are zero!and above all......they have no interests and dreams of a better tomorrow.if u walk into an australian production line in australia,,,,u will find  that they have more humans than hi tech robots.everything is in manual mode.their manufacturing ...the most they have seen is making and welding windows by hand.australians are only interested in making fencing,windows and some unimportant object,,,,,,ahnd when utell thyem about manufacturing,,,they always picture hundreds of people slaving in some sweatshop making shirts the austrlian way.</p>
              <p>no offence,,,,,,but that was my view from the past....maybe they have changed theur attitude and are much different today.</p>

              <p>australia is just like any other country...people get conned or forced out or else.in fact the bikies are like any gangsters u see in singapore....it is the normal people that have decent jobs in real estate ,trades and others that are worse than gangsters at times.they all want plenty money without werkin fer it...werse are the real estate side.you also will get this in china,india and those imperfect countries well known for not being fair to their fellow humans.</p>
              <p>u also get this in singapore as well in the form of job agencies going for the higgest bidder from foreign professionals against singaporean professionals.the gangsters look less of a hazard as compared to these lot.</p>

              <p class="intro"><em><strong>QUEENSLAND plans to sell $15 billion worth of assets as it moves to plug a revenue hole caused by the global financial crisis.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em> In a sales program to be carried out over the next 3-5 years,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> the
              Government plans to sell Queensland Motorways, the Port of Brisbane,
              Forest Plantations Queensland, Queensland Rail's coal haulage business
              and the Abbott Point Coal Terminal. <br></span><br>Queensland
              Premier Anna Bligh said the economic meltdown had punched a $14 billion
              hole in the state's revenues and the Government was faced with the
              choice of cutting jobs, paring back its $17 billion infrastructure
              program or selling assets. <br><br>"The need to respond to the biggest
              economic challenge in decades is very real, very confronting and
              requires some very tough decisions to be made," she said. <br><br>The
              premier said the sales were expected to deliver about $15 billion and
              to save the Government a further $12 billion in required capital
              investment over the next five years. <br><br>The state will be
              forgoing annual returns of about $280 million as a result of the sales,
              but the $12 billion in avoided capital expenditure will save about $750
              million a year in interest. <br><br>Queensland recently lost its triple-A credit raring. <br><br>The premier said the Government was determined to regain the rating in the medium term.''</em></p>

              Point Coal Terminal.<br></span><br> Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said the economic meltdown had
              punched a $14 billion hole in the state's revenues and the
              Government was faced with the choice of cutting jobs, paring back
              its $17 billion infrastructure program or selling assets.<br> <br> "The need to respond to the biggest economic challenge in decades
              is very real, very confronting and requires some very tough
              decisions to be made," she said.<br> <br> The premier said the sales were expected to deliver about $15
              billion and to save the Government a further $12 billion in
              required capital investment over the next five years.<br> <br> The state will be forgoing annual returns of about $280 million as
              a result of the sales, but the $12 billion in avoided capital
              expenditure will save about $750 million a year in interest.<br> <br> Queensland recently lost its triple-A credit raring.<br> <br> The premier said the Government was determined to regain the rating

              <div class="post-body">
              <p> </p>
              <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/SehhOJoYv3I/AAAAAAAAAy4/cv5HfQE4UWQ/s1600-h/loanshark.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5325613455096987506" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 320px; cursor: hand; height: 156px; text-align: center;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/SehhOJoYv3I/AAAAAAAAAy4/cv5HfQE4UWQ/s320/loanshark.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> Times are bad and the number of loanshark harassment cases has climbed sharply. Police had to deal a total of 4000 cases in the first 3 months of this year. But don't worry our Home Affairs Minister has come up with a brilliant solution to reduce the number of cases our police have to handle:<br><br>
              <div><em>"The ministry will also consider <strong>making</strong> <strong>borrowing from loansharks an offence</strong>."</em></div>
              <div><em>- DPM Wong Kan Seng.[<a href="http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Crime/Story/A1Story20090417-135750.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Link</span></span></a>]</em></div>
              <div><em><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></em></div>
              <div><em>"This would be good news for us. If the police arrest those who borrow, they won't dare to report us when we harass them," - Loanshark who welcomes the move[<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/print/Free/Story/STIStory_214945.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Link</span></span></a>]</em></div>
              <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">,</span></div>
              <div><em></em></div>
              <div>If you still don't understand how brilliant this solution is, let me explain. The police has to handle so many cases of loansharking because the victims go to the police for help. By criminalising borrowing from loansharks, the victims of loanshark harassment now cannot go to the police for help because they themselves will be arrested for borrowing from the loansharks. The police will see a sharp drop in the number of cases and the govt can say the problem is solved! Briliant! Bravo! Now victims of loansharks have to suffer quietly. This will free up vast amounts of resources - there will be more police to handle those pesky opposition members and peaceful protestors who break our new our public order laws. I thought sending our old folks to JB was the best idea for the year -I was wrong.... this one is a lot more brilliant!</div>

              <p>hmm... filming an illegal event is criminalized, borrowing money from illegal loansharks may be made a criminal offense.. What's next? Maybe they'll penalize victims from rape, theft, murder.. etc in future.</p>

              <p>Why not extend this superb idea to all cases?<br><br>Make everyone who makes a police report post a bond of $10k. It will be returned to the victim only when the perpetrator has been found guilty by the courts.<br><br>A more brilliant solution is to charge a fee for using law enforcement services. Want that robber caught? Pay $3k to the police. Want loanshark caught? Pay $5k. Can pay by CPF and installments also.<br><br>These solutions will reduce the official crime rates and make Singapore the safest city in the world!</p>

              <p>Dr Ong Seh Hong who borrowed 60K (the equivalent of an annual pay of an ordinary Singaporean) from Ming Yi. He probably delayed the payment to the hospital until he knew he has been exposed by Ming Yi. <br><br>Bravo of Ming Yi to drag this greedy PAP MP into the dirt. He knew that the PAP wants to take over his hospital organization to service the lucrative healthcare tourism (same reason for Khaw to want to kick old Singaporeans out to JB).<br><br>Ming Yi should do the next best thing: to declare himself as a loanshark who cannot say 'NO' and kill this greedy MP Ong once and for all.</p>

              <p>Making borrowing from loanshark illegal, I see.<br><br>What a clever way to free PAP from its responsibility to the society without finding out why more and more are resorting to this type of credit.<br><br>Better solution for Wong Kan Seng is since loansharks are doing a roaring business, lets beat them to it ... just like PAP beats illegal 4D operators hands down. <br><br>Well if you don't remember, in the 70's illegal 4D operators were rampant and PAP constantly raided them. Then a brilliant idea came to PAP, lets create state-run 4Ds betting franchises. <br><br>Now you can see them all around. And PAP and some critics are worried the IRs will bring a gambling scourge to Singapore. <br><br>Open ya eyes! For that matter, these 4D outlets partly or even largely explain why loanshark business is booming in Singapore.<br><br>So you see that's how PAP "resolved" the betting problem by making it legal, hehe. No wonder it is praised around the world for being such a great government. <br><br>So I am sure PAP with its brilliant advisers will come up with something like that. <br><br>The news already reported that permits have been issued to high interest money lenders when formerly such permits were refused. <br><br>PAP just have to impose a high licence fee or even get DBS into the same act to reap from this business and thus PAP will also have "resolved" this loanshark problem.<br><br>Hey in the US it was such high-interest loans through credit cards that did their economy in; here PAP might well think otherwise.</p>

              <p>Simple but yet brilliant analysis by lucky ! lol<br><br>And perhaps PM,MM and SM should pool their wealth and start a scheme that provides loans to PAP MPs and grass-roots supporters. Their combined wealth should be more than 200M $ ! The other multi Million $ ministers can also contribute to make loans available to all PAP members. Such loans should be interest-free, repayable over 20 to 30 years and of course whilst serving party interests. <br>This is a lot better than having PAP members borrowing from monks or loansharks which is not good for PAP's image and it is perfectly LEEgal. lol</p>

              <p>Whether or not it is a good idea depends on the composition of borrowers. Are they mostly irresponsible spenders/gamblers or genuinely needy people?<br><br>If it is the former, then I support criminalizing borrowers. As for the needy, once they borrow from loan sharks, it is very unlikely they will be able to repay. In fact, I would imagine the debt will grow because of the ridiculous interest rates (correct me if I am wrong). So, this source of borrowing should not be encouraged in order to prevent them from falling further into the pit.<br><br>However, for the needy, criminalizing them is no fair because loan sharks are probably their last resort.<br><br>So, if there is a way to separate the irresponsible ones from the needy, it would be great. Also, more thought has to go into how to prevent the needy from borrowing from loan sharks or helping them repay the sum.<br><br>As for existing borrowers, if it is possible, maybe they can decide on a cutting-off date, so only those who borrow after the implementation will be charged.<br><br>The only concern I have is that loan sharks may resort to trickery to trap people into borrowing because they have to keep their income channel alive.</p>

              <p>Maybe MHA did not do enough research before releasing this news. <br><br>Drawing a decision tree will help to know possible decision that will be made by the people who is directly or indirectly involved. <br><br>This policy, I think it will make matter worse.<br>For example, if I am in deep shit and need money, what would I do? Borrow first then decide what to do next. <br><br>Next, if I do not report my ”crime”, there won’t be any case on me. I believe my family will not report loan sharks cases to the police because I will get into trouble. What’s next? Suffer in silence.(Just think that most families won’t want their members to put in jail.) <br><br>Lucky, by now the loan sharks must be celebrating!! There is no way or hardly a way the police can track them down without the borrower's family reporting it. <br>The loan sharks will just have to pick on the right family. I think this is obvious.<br><br>Lesser number of loan sharks case might just be an illusion. The number of loan sharks might increase. The only difference is, the cases are not recorded.<br>Nail down the loan sharks and eliminate them should be the only way to solve the problem.<br>Agree totally agree with lucky's post.</p>

              <p>this reminds me of another recent law from MHA.<br><br>There's been a rise in contraband cigarettes in singapore. So instead of better policing at the borders, they decided to mark every single cigarette in Singapore with the duty paid logo.<br><br>Citizens, well smoking ones, get punished, instead of working harder to to catch the smugglers.<br><br>Now we'll likely go into a slippery slope argument.. if borrowing money from loansharks is illegal, then we should then make everything that leads to debts illegal too eg addictive gamblers should be fined or jailed. <br><br>or every form of vice in our society should also be made illegal like alcoholism. <br><br>it must be the MHA - the same people who say that ONE person gathering can be deemed an illegal gathering.<br><br>absurd, absolutely absurd.</p>

Might be better for you to be stopped from falling into the pit.<br><br>"...if I do not report my ”crime”, there won’t be any case on me."<br><br>The loan sharks will use it to blackmail you to extort more until you tak boleh tahan and report yourself.<br><br>"Nail down the loan sharks and eliminate them should be the only way to solve the problem."<br><br>Definitely, this should be the priority. I believe making borrowing a criminal act in meant to be supplementary.</p>

              <p>the way i see it: the main reason is to protect innocent pple who are harassed by the loansharks when real borrowers clear out of the old place. however even with the new law, the loan sharks will still continue to harass the new owners what.<br><br>the question is why polic cannot catch these loan sharks - why are they so elusive even when security cameras are installed by the new owners? the police shld tell us.<br><br>the other angle we can do, is for hdb or relevant authorities to keep new owners advised of the new hdb address of the real borrowers. this transparency is only fair, not just in the case of loan shark harrassment. it also helps if there is a hidden defect in the unit for which the previous owner is accountable for.<br><br>if you ask me, the real reason why wks wants this is because of the coming ir. they anticipate a lot of social problems, and they simply want to wash their hands of it. this is "you die, you business" - the same strategy in healthcare, housing and law and order.</p>

              <p>Actually I don't see what's wrong with making borrowing from loansharks an offense. If providing an illegal loan is an offense, why shouldn't taking the illegal loan be an offense as well? For those people afraid of this new law, here's a simple solution: Don't take money from loansharks.</p>

              climbed sharply. Police had to deal a total of 4000 cases in the
              first 3 months of this year. But don't worry our Home Affairs
              Minister has come up with a brilliant solution to reduce the number
              of cases our police have to handle:<br> <br>
              <div><em>"The ministry will also consider <strong>making</strong> <strong>borrowing from loansharks an offence</strong>."</em></div>
              <div><em>- DPM Wong Kan Seng.[<a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Crime/Story/A1Story20090417-135750.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Link</span></span></a>]</em></div>
              <div><em><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></em></div>
              <div><em>"This would be good news for us. If the police arrest
              those who borrow, they won't dare to report us when we harass
              them," - Loanshark who welcomes the move[<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/print/Free/Story/STIStory_214945.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Link</span></span></a>]</em></div>
              <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">,</span></div>
              <div>If you still don't understand how brilliant this solution is,
              let me explain. The police has to handle so many cases of
              loansharking because the victims go to the police for help. By
              criminalising borrowing from loansharks, the victims of loanshark
              harassment now cannot go to the police for help because they
              themselves will be arrested for borrowing from the loansharks. The
              police will see a sharp drop in the number of cases and the govt
              can say the problem is solved! Briliant! Bravo! Now victims of
              loansharks have to suffer quietly. This will free up vast amounts
              of resources - there will be more police to handle those pesky
              opposition members and peaceful protestors who break our new our
              public order laws. I thought sending our old folks to JB was the
              best idea for the year -I was wrong.... this one is a lot more
              brilliant!</div>

              <p>hmm... filming an illegal event is criminalized, borrowing money
              from illegal loansharks may be made a criminal offense.. What's
              next? Maybe they'll penalize victims from rape, theft, murder.. etc
              in future.</p>

              enough so they don't get into trouble with the laws they have
              brilliantly carved on stones for ....lesser imortals<br> <br> just beat people up with laws and everything solved?<br> <br> brilliant</p>

              <p>Why not extend this superb idea to all cases?<br> <br> Make everyone who makes a police report post a bond of $10k. It
              will be returned to the victim only when the perpetrator has been
              found guilty by the courts.<br> <br> A more brilliant solution is to charge a fee for using law
              enforcement services. Want that robber caught? Pay $3k to the
              police. Want loanshark caught? Pay $5k. Can pay by CPF and
              installments also.<br> <br> These solutions will reduce the official crime rates and make
              Singapore the safest city in the world!</p>

              <p>Dr Ong Seh Hong who borrowed 60K (the equivalent of an annual
              pay of an ordinary Singaporean) from Ming Yi. He probably delayed
              the payment to the hospital until he knew he has been exposed by
              Ming Yi.<br> <br> Bravo of Ming Yi to drag this greedy PAP MP into the dirt. He knew
              that the PAP wants to take over his hospital organization to
              service the lucrative healthcare tourism (same reason for Khaw to
              want to kick old Singaporeans out to JB).<br> <br> Ming Yi should do the next best thing: to declare himself as a
              loanshark who cannot say 'NO' and kill this greedy MP Ong once and
              for all.</p>

              <p>i have a good idea.<br> <br> reduce the workload and most importantly make big money by imposing
              a service fee for calling the police. they can then employ more
              staffs to collect the fees; a brillant win-win idea, yes?</p>

              <p>Making borrowing from loanshark illegal, I see.<br> <br> What a clever way to free PAP from its responsibility to the
              society without finding out why more and more are resorting to this
              type of credit.<br> <br> Better solution for Wong Kan Seng is since loansharks are doing a
              roaring business, lets beat them to it ... just like PAP beats
              illegal 4D operators hands down.<br> <br> Well if you don't remember, in the 70's illegal 4D operators were
              rampant and PAP constantly raided them. Then a brilliant idea came
              to PAP, lets create state-run 4Ds betting franchises.<br> <br> Now you can see them all around. And PAP and some critics are
              worried the IRs will bring a gambling scourge to Singapore.<br> <br> Open ya eyes! For that matter, these 4D outlets partly or even
              largely explain why loanshark business is booming in
              Singapore.<br> <br> So you see that's how PAP "resolved" the betting problem by making
              it legal, hehe. No wonder it is praised around the world for being
              such a great government.<br> <br> So I am sure PAP with its brilliant advisers will come up with
              something like that.<br> <br> The news already reported that permits have been issued to high
              interest money lenders when formerly such permits were
              refused.<br> <br> PAP just have to impose a high licence fee or even get DBS into the
              same act to reap from this business and thus PAP will also have
              "resolved" this loanshark problem.<br> <br> Hey in the US it was such high-interest loans through credit cards
              that did their economy in; here PAP might well think otherwise.</p>

              <p>Simple but yet brilliant analysis by lucky ! lol<br> <br> And perhaps PM,MM and SM should pool their wealth and start a
              scheme that provides loans to PAP MPs and grass-roots supporters.
              Their combined wealth should be more than 200M $ ! The other multi
              Million $ ministers can also contribute to make loans available to
              all PAP members. Such loans should be interest-free, repayable over
              20 to 30 years and of course whilst serving party interests.<br> This is a lot better than having PAP members borrowing from monks
              or loansharks which is not good for PAP's image and it is perfectly
              LEEgal. lol</p>

              <p>Whether or not it is a good idea depends on the composition of
              borrowers. Are they mostly irresponsible spenders/gamblers or
              genuinely needy people?<br> <br> If it is the former, then I support criminalizing borrowers. As for
              the needy, once they borrow from loan sharks, it is very unlikely
              they will be able to repay. In fact, I would imagine the debt will
              grow because of the ridiculous interest rates (correct me if I am
              wrong). So, this source of borrowing should not be encouraged in
              order to prevent them from falling further into the pit.<br> <br> However, for the needy, criminalizing them is no fair because loan
              sharks are probably their last resort.<br> <br> So, if there is a way to separate the irresponsible ones from the
              needy, it would be great. Also, more thought has to go into how to
              prevent the needy from borrowing from loan sharks or helping them
              repay the sum.<br> <br> As for existing borrowers, if it is possible, maybe they can decide
              on a cutting-off date, so only those who borrow after the
              implementation will be charged.<br> <br> The only concern I have is that loan sharks may resort to trickery
              to trap people into borrowing because they have to keep their
              income channel alive.</p>

              <p><strong>I actually support the idea of making borrowing from
              loansharks an offense</strong>Just recently, a neighbour of mine
              had his window poured with red paint. He claimed he lost his IC and
              it was used to make an illegal loan with the loansharks.<br> <br> What have we here in this senario?<br> <br> 1. Vandalism<br> 2. People not relating to the borrower suffering from the
              consequences<br> 3. People related to the borrower suffering from the
              consequences<br> <br> If I'm in charge of passing this law, I'll pass it instantly
              without blinking an eye.<br> <br> About people suffering in silence? They are already suffering
              whether or not they report to the police.<br> <br> How about preventing more people in the future suffering in
              silence?</p>

              <p>there must be plenty of money to be made in the loansharking
              business.<br> <br> then it is more reason for this greedy govt to catch these

              <p>In the US, there's all kind of money lending/borrowing business,
              such as payday loan. Just that in Singapore, the credit market's so
              tightly controlled that avenues for credit do not flourish
              aboveground, and you have to go underground sometimes, in times of
              need.<br> <br> Parka wants to criminalize PAP MP Dr Ong Seh Hong without blinking
              his eye. He's on the same boat as me.</p>

              <p>Maybe MHA did not do enough research before releasing this
              news.<br> <br> Drawing a decision tree will help to know possible decision that
              will be made by the people who is directly or indirectly
              involved.<br> <br> This policy, I think it will make matter worse.<br> For example, if I am in deep shit and need money, what would I do?
              Borrow first then decide what to do next.<br> <br> Next, if I do not report my ”crime”, there won’t be any case on me.
              I believe my family will not report loan sharks cases to the police
              because I will get into trouble. What’s next? Suffer in
              silence.(Just think that most families won’t want their members to
              put in jail.)<br> <br> Lucky, by now the loan sharks must be celebrating!! There is no way
              or hardly a way the police can track them down without the
              borrower's family reporting it.<br> The loan sharks will just have to pick on the right family. I think
              this is obvious.<br> <br> Lesser number of loan sharks case might just be an illusion. The
              number of loan sharks might increase. The only difference is, the
              cases are not recorded.<br> Nail down the loan sharks and eliminate them should be the only way

              <p>Tiredman said "Maybe MHA did not do enough research before
              releasing this news."<br> <br> I am wondering if any research was carried out at all by the
              incompentent MHA ! PAP policies have time and time again proved
              they lack due diligence, and we are paying millions to these elite
              for doing what morons also can do !</p>

              <p>similarly. set up casinos as stumbling blocks for people who
              want to bet for instant riches. but then, how do you deal with
              social problems that may arise from gambling?<br> <br> the authorities have to decide...how to make more money and avoid
              being blamed for social problems<br> <br> make money is still the government chief priority than social well
              being.<br> <br> so same tactics. let people walk into these places of temptations.
              enact laws to punish people who failed to contain themselves and
              become social liabilities than use laws to slam them<br> <br> in other words, for money, they'll tempt the people within the
              legal boundaries.<br> <br> what they are saying is: i want to stroke your cock for money. but
              if you cock stand up, i am going to use the laws to cut off your
              cock.</p>

              <p>this reminds me of another recent law from MHA.<br> <br> There's been a rise in contraband cigarettes in singapore. So
              instead of better policing at the borders, they decided to mark
              every single cigarette in Singapore with the duty paid logo.<br> <br> Citizens, well smoking ones, get punished, instead of working
              harder to to catch the smugglers.<br> <br> Now we'll likely go into a slippery slope argument.. if borrowing
              money from loansharks is illegal, then we should then make
              everything that leads to debts illegal too eg addictive gamblers
              should be fined or jailed.<br> <br> or every form of vice in our society should also be made illegal
              like alcoholism.<br> <br> it must be the MHA - the same people who say that ONE person
              gathering can be deemed an illegal gathering.<br> <br> absurd, absolutely absurd.</p>

              <p>Wow, now I can sabotage anyone by scribbling their unit no. on
              the wall "O$P$ #-----", and then call the police saying that this
              person has borrowed from loansharks.<br> <br> So instead of using their precious resources to catch real
              criminals i.e. loansharks, police now have to waste resources
              investigating innocent victims.<br> <br> Maybe this is what they want because sitting ducks borrowers are
              easier to catch than elusive loansharks. They can justify their
              hefty salaries and bonuses by increasing the number of "solved
              cases".</p>

              <p>"...if I am in deep shit and need money, what would I do? Borrow
              first then decide what to do next."<br> <br> That is the most vulnerable state (desperation and panic) for the
              loan sharks to exploit and after that you might regret. Might be
              better for you to be stopped from falling into the pit.<br> <br> "...if I do not report my ”crime”, there won’t be any case on
              me."<br> <br> The loan sharks will use it to blackmail you to extort more until
              you tak boleh tahan and report yourself.<br> <br> "Nail down the loan sharks and eliminate them should be the only
              way to solve the problem."<br> <br> Definitely, this should be the priority. I believe making borrowing
              a criminal act in meant to be supplementary.</p>

              <p>LUCKY,<br> <br> This has been happening for a very long time;<br> <br> Under the Act, if the Ministries send you a bill for $XXXXXXXXX
              dollars, you have to prove to them why you didn't owe the money.
              HOW TO?<br> <br> If the Income Tax Department revalue your property, or claim you
              made a few millions last year when you did not, you have to pay
              first and argue later. You have stashed funds?<br> <br> Where to get the money to pay first? borrow from the
              loanshark?<br> <br> If you do not want your organs and skin remove from your temporary
              diabled body, you better opt out.<br> Criteria for confirming brain dead,<br> 1. your pupil does not response to light (temporary lose of
              eyesight pengsa).<br> 2. your fingers does not response to needle pricking (temporary
              paralysis pengsa).<br> 3. 2 doctors confirms you are brain dead (pengsa if some
              politician/millionaire has matching requirements).<br> <br> Where are all the modern equpments?<br> <br> The passport of the Pathetic Singaporean is the only valuable and
              useful object of being a Pathetic Singaporean!!</p>

              (including being victims of ah long's debt collection tactics when

              <p>the way i see it: the main reason is to protect innocent pple
              who are harassed by the loansharks when real borrowers clear out of
              the old place. however even with the new law, the loan sharks will
              still continue to harass the new owners what.<br> <br> the question is why polic cannot catch these loan sharks - why are
              they so elusive even when security cameras are installed by the new
              owners? the police shld tell us.<br> <br> the other angle we can do, is for hdb or relevant authorities to
              keep new owners advised of the new hdb address of the real
              borrowers. this transparency is only fair, not just in the case of
              loan shark harrassment. it also helps if there is a hidden defect
              in the unit for which the previous owner is accountable for.<br> <br> if you ask me, the real reason why wks wants this is because of the
              coming ir. they anticipate a lot of social problems, and they
              simply want to wash their hands of it. this is "you die, you
              business" - the same strategy in healthcare, housing and law and
              order.</p>

              <p>I got a better solution lah.<br> <br> Death penalty for loan sharks.<br> <br> Guarantee all the wannabes will be shocked out of the business. The
              die-hards maybe will switch to smuggling drugs since they figure
              both will get death anyway. Pronto, problem solved.</p>

              <p>Actually I don't see what's wrong with making borrowing from
              loansharks an offense. If providing an illegal loan is an offense,
              why shouldn't taking the illegal loan be an offense as well? For
              those people afraid of this new law, here's a simple solution:
              Don't take money from loansharks.</p>
