              <p>i think its not much. but u want cheap deals depends on what state u are living in and try to get one in a secluded area with no ameninities will get u a good price, that is if got a car and dont mind shopping for necessitites in bulk. usually 200K onwards. It also depends on which plan u take.</p>

              <p>If it falls , it will just be a gimmick to get more people to buy and be trapped. When more people buy the prices will increase and market will recover, then HDB earns more money too,</p>

              a decisive Rudd Government initiative designed to stimulate housing
              activity and give first home buyers a better chance in the housing
              market.</em></p>
              <p><em>More than 150,000 first home buyers are estimated to benefit from the time-limited scheme.</em></p>
              <p><em>Under the First Home Owners Boost:</em></p>
              <ul>
              <li><em>First home buyers who purchase <span style="color: #ff0000;">established homes</span> will

              <p>many frens here buy oz $$ for high interest rate.But it is the bad news for</p>
              <p>loan borrowers.They have to pay higher rate ,compared with SG HDB or private</p>
              <p>home buyers.HDB rate is 2.6% and below 3% for private houses.</p>
              <p>Oz is much higher.Sit down can calculate the rate and the inflation etc</p>
              <p>Think if the so called higher gross salary,higher tax and interest rate,</p>
              <p>worth better welfare and the name of big country!</p>
              <p>a 2% point of rate for A$200,000 loan make u pay $333 extra per month</p>
              <p>in interest.</p>
              <p>a 3 % is $500 pm etc.</p>
              <p>Can the higher salary cover the tax and the extra interest rate.</p>
              <p>Of course,in life,u cant juts calcualte dollar and cents so details.</p>
              <p>But i think u have to know the details before u jump ship.</p>
              <p>a 8 to 9 % interest rate,which just happened in 2008,</p>
              <p>is no joke.</p>
              <p>http://www.loanmarket.com.au/ratewatch.htm</p>
              <p>just in additional interest,compared with lower rate in SG!!</p>
              <p>http://www.loanmarket.com.au/ratewatch.htm</p>
              <p>the 100% loan worry me very much.</p>

              <p>lionnoisy, HDb may be cheaper in the long run but u do not own the home. It is only for 99 years.</p>
              <p>Of cos it is cheaper. cos no value. + low sg wages, no welfare will make it the same thing as OZ.</p>
              <p>I say they even out but OZ is better as u own the home.</p>

              <p>u singaporeans, always look in the short term. Pls understand that the way things work in Australia is not the same in Singapore. The govt collects the Taxes for income but does have a min wage. Effectively this money is from the rich and wealthy too  but everything else is a free market over there. And it is not the 10th expensive country in the world like Singapore. With 10% GST, somethings like raw food and electronic goods are still cheaper than here. For 400K -700K ( the price of HDBs and condos in Sg) , u can own a home with a garage and backyard for life and for yr children. Cars are cheaper and u dont pay as much as conservancy charges, charges for Tv licence and such over there. The country is not bankrupt, it has raw and natural resources to feed its people. There is farming and agriculture.produces copper but also uranium, gold and silver</p>
              <p> The Australian mining industry has already exported more than $370 billion worth of metals, fuels and minerals during the past 20 years</p>

                  expensive than here. We are expensive becos of our land price, do u
                  know what is a little red dot or not? and even with our high std of
                  living, we are among the top 2 most wanted places that expatriats
                  are willing to come here to build there family, the second being
                  sydney. The Oz are lucky to hv so much natural resources and
                  British support all the way, if not, long long gone case liao, u
                  know how lazy are Ozies or not, same same like lionnoisy, very
                  lazy.</p>

              <p>Ozzies buying electronic stuffs here? U must be kidding.</p>
              <p>Look at the prices of laptops in ebay oz and they are much cheaper than what u find in singapore sucky Sim Lim square.</p>
              <p>No beggars in singapore?. I see lots of them collecting cans and cardboards with no aid being received. The beggars in Oz still receive money from their govt but they beg because they spent it all on alcohol, cigs and drugs. U are really pissing me off little girl. U lack expereince in travelling and still live in school mentality.</p>
