              <h3>Loansharking : PAP govt's brilliant solution</h3>
              <div>

Police had to deal a total of 4000 cases in the first 3 months of this year. But don't worry our Home Affairs Minister has come up with a brilliant solution to reduce the number of cases our police have to handle:<br><br>
              <div><em>"The ministry will also consider <strong>making</strong> <strong>borrowing from loansharks an offence</strong>."</em></div>
              <div><em>- DPM Wong Kan Seng.[<a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Crime/Story/A1Story20090417-135750.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Link</span></span></a>]</em></div>
              <div><em><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></em></div>
              <div><em>"This would be good news for us. If the police arrest those who borrow, they won't dare to report us when we harass them," - Loanshark who welcomes the move[<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/print/Free/Story/STIStory_214945.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Link</span></span></a>]</em></div>
              <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">,</span></div>
              <div>If you still don't understand how brilliant this solution is, let me explain. The police has to handle so many cases of loansharking because the victims go to the police for help. By criminalising borrowing from loansharks, the victims of loanshark harassment now cannot go to the police for help because they themselves will be arrested for borrowing from the loansharks. The police will see a sharp drop in the number of cases and the govt can say the problem is solved! Briliant! Bravo! Now victims of loansharks have to suffer quietly. This will free up vast amounts of resources - there will be more police to handle those pesky opposition members and peaceful protestors who break our new our public order laws. I thought sending our old folks to JB was the best idea for the year -I was wrong.... this one is a lot more brilliant!</div>

              <p>hmm... filming an illegal event is criminalized, borrowing money from illegal loansharks may be made a criminal offense.. What's next? Maybe they'll penalize victims from rape, theft, murder.. etc in future.</p>

              <p>Why not extend this superb idea to all cases?<br><br>Make everyone who makes a police report post a bond of $10k. It will be returned to the victim only when the perpetrator has been found guilty by the courts.<br><br>A more brilliant solution is to charge a fee for using law enforcement services. Want that robber caught? Pay $3k to the police. Want loanshark caught? Pay $5k. Can pay by CPF and installments also.<br><br>These solutions will reduce the official crime rates and make Singapore the safest city in the world!</p>

              <p>Dr Ong Seh Hong who borrowed 60K (the equivalent of an annual pay of an ordinary Singaporean) from Ming Yi. He probably delayed the payment to the hospital until he knew he has been exposed by Ming Yi.<br><br>Bravo of Ming Yi to drag this greedy PAP MP into the dirt. He knew that the PAP wants to take over his hospital organization to service the lucrative healthcare tourism (same reason for Khaw to want to kick old Singaporeans out to JB).<br><br>Ming Yi should do the next best thing: to declare himself as a loanshark who cannot say 'NO' and kill this greedy MP Ong once and for all.</p>

              <p>Making borrowing from loanshark illegal, I see.<br><br>What a clever way to free PAP from its responsibility to the society without finding out why more and more are resorting to this type of credit.<br><br>Better solution for Wong Kan Seng is since loansharks are doing a roaring business, lets beat them to it ... just like PAP beats illegal 4D operators hands down.<br><br>Well if you don't remember, in the 70's illegal 4D operators were rampant and PAP constantly raided them. Then a brilliant idea came to PAP, lets create state-run 4Ds betting franchises.<br><br>Now you can see them all around. And PAP and some critics are worried the IRs will bring a gambling scourge to Singapore.<br><br>Open ya eyes! For that matter, these 4D outlets partly or even largely explain why loanshark business is booming in Singapore.<br><br>So you see that's how PAP "resolved" the betting problem by making it legal, hehe. No wonder it is praised around the world for being such a great government.<br><br>So I am sure PAP with its brilliant advisers will come up with something like that.<br><br>The news already reported that permits have been issued to high interest money lenders when formerly such permits were refused.<br><br>PAP just have to impose a high licence fee or even get DBS into the same act to reap from this business and thus PAP will also have "resolved" this loanshark problem.<br><br>Hey in the US it was such high-interest loans through credit cards that did their economy in; here PAP might well think otherwise.</p>

              <p>Simple but yet brilliant analysis by lucky ! lol<br><br>And perhaps PM,MM and SM should pool their wealth and start a scheme that provides loans to PAP MPs and grass-roots supporters. Their combined wealth should be more than 200M $ ! The other multi Million $ ministers can also contribute to make loans available to all PAP members. Such loans should be interest-free, repayable over 20 to 30 years and of course whilst serving party interests.<br>This is a lot better than having PAP members borrowing from monks or loansharks which is not good for PAP's image and it is perfectly LEEgal. lol</p>

              <p>Whether or not it is a good idea depends on the composition of borrowers. Are they mostly irresponsible spenders/gamblers or genuinely needy people?<br><br>If it is the former, then I support criminalizing borrowers. As for the needy, once they borrow from loan sharks, it is very unlikely they will be able to repay. In fact, I would imagine the debt will grow because of the ridiculous interest rates (correct me if I am wrong). So, this source of borrowing should not be encouraged in order to prevent them from falling further into the pit.<br><br>However, for the needy, criminalizing them is no fair because loan sharks are probably their last resort.<br><br>So, if there is a way to separate the irresponsible ones from the needy, it would be great. Also, more thought has to go into how to prevent the needy from borrowing from loan sharks or helping them repay the sum.<br><br>As for existing borrowers, if it is possible, maybe they can decide on a cutting-off date, so only those who borrow after the implementation will be charged.<br><br>The only concern I have is that loan sharks may resort to trickery to trap people into borrowing because they have to keep their income channel alive.</p>

People not relating to the borrower suffering from the consequences<br>3. People related to the borrower suffering from the consequences<br><br>If I'm in charge of passing this law, I'll pass it instantly without blinking an eye.<br><br>About people suffering in silence?

              <p>In the US, there's all kind of money lending/borrowing business, such as payday loan. Just that in Singapore, the credit market's so tightly controlled that avenues for credit do not flourish aboveground, and you have to go underground sometimes, in times of need.<br><br>Parka wants to criminalize PAP MP Dr Ong Seh Hong without blinking his eye.

              <p>Maybe MHA did not do enough research before releasing this news.<br><br>Drawing a decision tree will help to know possible decision that will be made by the people who is directly or indirectly involved.<br><br>This policy, I think it will make matter worse.<br>For example, if I am in deep shit and need money, what would I do? Borrow first then decide what to do next.<br><br>Next, if I do not report my ”crime”, there won’t be any case on me. I believe my family will not report loan sharks cases to the police because I will get into trouble. What’s next? Suffer in silence.(Just think that most families won’t want their members to put in jail.)<br><br>Lucky, by now the loan sharks must be celebrating!! There is no way or hardly a way the police can track them down without the borrower's family reporting it.<br>The loan sharks will just have to pick on the right family. I think this is obvious.<br><br>Lesser number of loan sharks case might just be an illusion. The number of loan sharks might increase. The only difference is, the cases are not recorded.<br>Nail down the loan sharks and eliminate them should be the only way to solve the problem.<br>Agree totally agree with lucky's post.</p>

              <p>similarly. set up casinos as stumbling blocks for people who want to bet for instant riches. but then, how do you deal with social problems that may arise from gambling?<br><br>the authorities have to decide...how to make more money and avoid being blamed for social problems<br><br>make money is still the government chief priority than social well being.<br><br>so same tactics. let people walk into these places of temptations. enact laws to punish people who failed to contain themselves and become social liabilities than use laws to slam them<br><br>in other words, for money, they'll tempt the people within the legal boundaries.<br><br>what they are saying is: i want to stroke your cock for money. but if you cock stand up, i am going to use the laws to cut off your cock.</p>

              <p>this reminds me of another recent law from MHA.<br><br>There's been a rise in contraband cigarettes in singapore. So instead of better policing at the borders, they decided to mark every single cigarette in Singapore with the duty paid logo.<br><br>Citizens, well smoking ones, get punished, instead of working harder to to catch the smugglers.<br><br>Now we'll likely go into a slippery slope argument.. if borrowing money from loansharks is illegal, then we should then make everything that leads to debts illegal too eg addictive gamblers should be fined or jailed.<br><br>or every form of vice in our society should also be made illegal like alcoholism.<br><br>it must be the MHA - the same people who say that ONE person gathering can be deemed an illegal gathering.<br><br>absurd, absolutely absurd.</p>

              <p>the way i see it: the main reason is to protect innocent pple who are harassed by the loansharks when real borrowers clear out of the old place. however even with the new law, the loan sharks will still continue to harass the new owners what.<br><br>the question is why polic cannot catch these loan sharks - why are they so elusive even when security cameras are installed by the new owners? the police shld tell us.<br><br>the other angle we can do, is for hdb or relevant authorities to keep new owners advised of the new hdb address of the real borrowers. this transparency is only fair, not just in the case of loan shark harrassment. it also helps if there is a hidden defect in the unit for which the previous owner is accountable for.<br><br>if you ask me, the real reason why wks wants this is because of the coming ir. they anticipate a lot of social problems, and they simply want to wash their hands of it. this is "you die, you business" - the same strategy in healthcare, housing and law and order.</p>

              <p>Actually I don't see what's wrong with making borrowing from loansharks an offense. If providing an illegal loan is an offense, why shouldn't taking the illegal loan be an offense as well? For those people afraid of this new law, here's a simple solution: Don't take money from loansharks.</p>

              <p>PM Rudd rolls out different housing grants to new and second hand  house.</p>
              <p>But I am not sure if  PM Rudd cared more abt the GDP growth or  helping</p>

                                      70's.</p>
              <p>In a very difficult text,Ah Sing 's score <span style="color: #ff0000;">drops 10 marks</span></p>
              <p>from his average,while Ah Oz <span style="color: #ff0000;">drops
                                      5 marks</span> from his average.</p>
              <p>So,the innocent aunites and uncles in the neighbourhood say</p>
              <p>Ah Oz is better than Ah Sing!!</p>

              <p>1) FT provide jobs for Singaporeans? Stop regurgitating MIW crap and start using your mane, oops I meant your brain. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>If your logic is correct, then USA would probably encourage more foreign labours. If your logic was correct, then perhaps Singapore should let in more foreign labours so that they can reduce the unemployment to 0%. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>So is your logic sound? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>And you believe that Singapore has long term domestic demand? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The U.S. Senate voted on February 6 to limit the number of high-skilled foreign workers to be hired by recipients of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Many TARP recipients had hoped to use <a href="http://economyincrisis.org/articles/issues?i=Government+Bailout"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">bailout money</span></span></a> to hire cheap foreign labor and bring them to the United States via H-1B visas. Seeing this potential problem, the Senate has put restrictions on the amount of overseas labor which can be employed.</p>
              <p>Well <a href="http://economyincrisis.org/articles/show/2434"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">over 600,000 employees</span></span></a> were laid off in January 2009 and 2.6 million people lost their jobs in 2008 nationwide. To stem the tide of rising job losses, the Senate chose a course of action which it hopes will encourage the hiring of American workers. This provision is in essence a “buy American” clause for corporate America. Congress holds the purse-strings for the remaining bailout funding, and is likely to put more restrictions on it in the future.</p>
              <p><a href="http://economyincrisis.org/articles/show/2431"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The amendment</span></span></a> requires that any company hiring foreign workers gives a substantial reason for not hiring an American for that position. It also protects American workers from being replaced by cheap foreign imports.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.economyincrisis.org/articles/show/2451">http://www.economyincrisis.org/articles/show/2451</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Domestic demand means spending in the domestic market moron, it does not mean government coming out money to bail out. Singapore's market is predominantly export oriented. Why you may ask? This is because the majority of Singaporeans lack the funds to spend, the majority of funds is with the government. When government has the funds, means no funds for your multiplier effect. What is multiplier effect? When a hawker makes $5,000, he needs to spend maybe $3,000 to pay off his workers, perishable goods, rental and electricity. The money circulates within the economy.</p>
              <p>Why do you think that other countries are less affected by the global recession? It's because they have their own domestic demand unlike Singapore which predominantly relies on export markets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. You have problems understanding then get an English teacher to explain to you.</p>
              <p>Artificial means to increase Singapore's GDP through assimilation of foreign talents has brought about more adverse effects in the GDP. Singapore's GDP dropped 10.1% for the 1st quarter of 2009, whereas Australia's GDP dropped only 0.1% for that quarter (or increased 0.3% on an annual basis). Singapore has little domestic demand as compared to Australia, because most of it's funds are in the hands of the goverment. The government then uses these funds to make retarded investments overseas losing SG$ 100 billion.</p>
              <p>What we have built up for 12 years, we lost half of the GDP over Australia in 3 months. All because of the economic machinations of a little dictator. <img src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Believe me when I say, Singapore is still not out of the woods yet, with US unemployment rate at 9.4%, the global demand is going to remain sluggish for years to come.</p>
              <p>SG$ 100 billion can buy Singaporeans 40 billion packs of economical rice, based on  say a population size of 3 million, this means that 3 million citizens can get food (2 meals a day) without work for 18 years.</p>

              <p>3. So you telling me Singapore is on the recovery phase? Since you say Singapore is out of the woods. You must have one big mane! FYI, current US unemployment stands at 9.4%.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. It is normally better to have higher GDP, since you say that Singapore has GDP of US$40,000 per capita (by purchasing power parity) {approximate}. If you understand the term GDP per capita (which means the total production of the whole economy divided by the labour force), then tell me this. Do average Singaporeans make the average US$40,000? Japanese have a lower GDP per capita (PPP). Tell me how much does the average Japanese make?</p>
