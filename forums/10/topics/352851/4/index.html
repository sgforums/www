              <p><br>I agreed on your part that foreign professional contribute to this country but at the end of the day, if they go back to their countries of birth, then the countries of birt will</p>
              <p>be the main beneficiaries. Just imagine if a PR decided to go back, the amount of money remiited back to their countries, ten years back during the 1997 Asian Financial crisis, if not wrong, the Malaysian govt was angry with the Spore govt for not releasing the CPF of Malaysian employees. Somehow it is quite surprising to see locals deciding to put their aged parents in neighbouring Malaysia.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Foreign professional can bring back money to their own countries for his own family usage, but not the mass, what they contributed in other countries is much much worthy if they had contributed to their own country. Due to their own countries lack of good infrastructure, govt, system etc etc, the adopted countries they work in gain from them is much more than what they bring home. And because of their money instability, most of them still prefer to keep their money in foreign banks rather than converting in their own country currency and banks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please remember that CPF is not a saving bank, it is a provident funds that both employers and employees contributed, and the employers are bound to contribute due to the law of Singapore requirement, so if the malaysians are really to withdraw back their CPF, they can take their 20% contribution and not the employers contribution. Most Malaysians working here are Malaysian Chinese and Indians, personally, they also dun wan the money to be transfer into malaysia, at that moment, the ringgits is falling like hell whereas the sing dollars was still stable and strong, and the malaysia govt needed these funds to help themselves rather than the peoples who worked here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, CPF is a personal beholden, if a Malaysian wish to withdraw all his/her CPF, no problem, but of course, he/she will not be allow to work in Singapore in a permanent basis.</p>

              <p><br>Foreign professional can bring back money to their own countries for his own family usage, but not the mass, what they contributed in other countries is much much worthy if they had contributed to their own country. Due to their own countries lack of good infrastructure, govt, system etc etc, the adopted countries they work in gain from them is much more than what they bring home. And because of their money instability, most of them still prefer to keep their money in foreign banks rather than converting in their own country currency and banks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please remember that CPF is not a saving bank, it is a provident funds that both employers and employees contributed, and the employers are bound to contribute due to the law of Singapore requirement, so if the malaysians are really to withdraw back their CPF, they can take their 20% contribution and not the employers contribution. Most Malaysians working here are Malaysian Chinese and Indians, personally, they also dun wan the money to be transfer into malaysia, at that moment, the ringgits is falling like hell whereas the sing dollars was still stable and strong, and the malaysia govt needed these funds to help themselves rather than the peoples who worked here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, CPF is a personal beholden, if a Malaysian wish to withdraw all his/her CPF, no problem, but of course, he/she will not be allow to work in Singapore in a permanent basis.</p>

              <p><br>of course people will refused lah, who wants to be a citizen here, if they changed to local citizen, they had to give up their citizenship of their parent countries. So better stick to PR. No doubt EPF provide a better rate of 5%, cos this is due to ringgit being lower in value. And let me tell u the truth, most of the companies in malaysia dun even need to give EPF, they will tell the workers that they provide them higher paid, and most of them accepted, their system is not as clearly define as ours, allowing turning and twisting all the time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why should i buy landed property in malaysia, why no singapore, more valuable and price will surge in no time whereas malaysia housing is alway on the depreciation due to plenty of land. I better think of thailand or Oz, then taking up a residency in Malaysia</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><em>In the past fortnight,
              Commonwealth Bank, Bankwest, ING, Challenger, Citibank and Suncorp have
              all cut their maximum loans from 95 per cent to 90 per cent of the
              property value - and may cut further. ANZ cut its maximum loan to 90
              per cent last November. </em></p>
              <p><em>The move is designed to ensure the bank can recover the loan value, if the house has to be sold in the event of a loan default. </em></p>
              <p><em>"There is a lot of talk about where house prices are headed and the
              possibility of price falls," Peter Hayward, of Citibank Mortgages,
              said. </em></p>
              <p><em>"By reducing the maximum loan to 90 per cent, we are giving
              ourselves, and our borrowers, more of a buffer to ensure that if prices
              do fall, there is less risk of going into negative equity." </em></p>
              <p><em>Challenger likened the move to when stockbrokers increased loan/valuation ratios on margin loans, when share prices fell. </em></p>

              <p>There is big differences between Singapore CPF public housing grant</p>

              <p>is just to boost short term GDP rate for a nice report card!!</p>
              <p>Good time or bad time,SG is still afford to give CPF grant to buy HDB.</p>
              <p>This is risky for buyers,banks and whole country if any buyer cannot</p>

              <p>Hello? Do you know what you're posting?</p>
              <p>you're making a assumption here. So you know that 15 years ago when SG introduced the grand it is not a temp GDP boost measure? And that Aust first time</p>
              <p>grant is a GDP boost measure? How smart are you huh?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what is the ration of HDB (15 years ago) vs avg salary (15 years ago)</p>
              <p>                   ration of HDB (current)  vs avg salary (current)</p>
              <p> </p>
