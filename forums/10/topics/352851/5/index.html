              <p>Talking to him is a chore. All he wants to do is mud-sling Australia, and he's totally shut off from whatever you guys say.</p>
              <p>Even in the other thread, he just dumped a Budget deficit and budget surplus comparison as an example of why our leaders should be highly paid, but he exposed his complete ignorance on budget policies.</p>

              <p>Fully agree with the world businessman.</p>
              <p>Singapore is VERY vulnerable. Diversification only can do so much. When we diversify, we are STILL in the export market. Thus when some big mess happens like this, we are completely vulnerable.</p>
              <p>The larger countries have internal markets to work as another factor of diversification. Australia, China, Russia, and other big countries can maintain some form of stability when the global market collapses. This is very much unlike Singapore. Even LHL has admitted that the govt may have focused too much on the export market.</p>
              <p>Before posting all sorts of stupid postings, I advise the noisy lion to educate himself more, otherwise he will be making himself a laughing stock.</p>

              <p>you don't even dare to answer me on budget surplus and budget deficit policies, so don't change the topic until you do. Otherwise you are just a coward hiding behind the comp.</p>
              <p>Did you read my posting properly. Our govt has conceded that they may have focused too much on exports.</p>
              <p>Silly? You are totally stupid. Anyway, I don't like to talk to cowards. Cowards bring our intelligence down. Arguing with a coward is like talking to a cow. Anything u ask them that they cannot answer, they pretend and avoid the topic. Talking to a stupid coward is even worse. Don't know what he is posting up, just regurgitating information without processing.</p>

              <p>Fully agree with the world businessman.</p>
              <p>Singapore is VERY vulnerable. Diversification only can do so much. When we diversify, we are STILL in the export market. Thus when some big mess happens like this, we are completely vulnerable.</p>
              <p>The larger countries have internal markets to work as another factor of diversification. Australia, China, Russia, and other big countries can maintain some form of stability when the global market collapses. This is very much unlike Singapore. Even LHL has admitted that the govt may have focused too much on the export market.</p>

              <p>I doubt so. The Govt will be smart enough to maintain a balance btw its previous core strength in manufacturing, versus the more high-educated sectors of finance, entertainment, education.</p>
              <p>After all, manufacturing contributes quite a lot to our exports. My guess is that, while the low level jobs (production operators, etc) move out to Malaysia, the high-end jobs, such as analysts, finance, procurement functions of manufacturing companies will still stay in Singapore.</p>
              <p>They might move more towards the new focuses, but it would take several years at least.</p>

              <p>grant is a GDP boost measure? How smart are you huh?</p>
              <p>what is the ration of HDB (15 years ago) vs avg salary (15 years

              <blockquote>The loan offers were made on the proviso the borrower paid mortgage insurance, which is a one-off cost as high as $10,000. <br> <br> The ANZ's loan criteria was much tighter, requiring a<span style="color: #ff0000;"> 10 per cent deposit</span> for a loan, as well as mortgage insurance. <br> <br> The
                      other three banks have recently tightened loan criteria to first-home
                      buyers, requiring a minimum deposit <span style="color: #ff0000;">of 5 per cent, incl</span>uding a minimum
                      of 3 per cent saved over several months, and mortgage insurance.<br> But the survey's findings defy the general belief that banks have
                      become stricter on first-home-buyer lending due to the global financial
