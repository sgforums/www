              <p>home buyers.HDB rate is 2.6% and below 3% for private houses.</p>
              <p>Oz is much higher.Sit down can calculate the rate and the inflation etc</p>

              <p>a 3 % is $500 pm etc.</p>
              <p>Can the higher salary cover the tax and the extra interest rate.</p>

              <p>But seems like Singapore is the place with inflated cost,
              because you make 3 times less wages, yet the price of necessities
              cost the same when compared to Australia.<br> <br> Compare the prices of necessitites sold in supermarkets of
              Australia and Singapore. Prices are more or less the same.
              Sometimes it's cheaper in Australia because the products (e.g.
              milk, pork, beef, lamb, rice, vegetables) we consume are local
              produce there, so it does not incur shipping and freight charges,
              which adds to the price of product.<br> <br> Woolworths Supermarket (Australia)<br> Sunrice Sunwhite Calrose Rice 5kg: AU$ 9.53<br> <br> Australian Pork Roast Shoulder Boned &amp; Rolled Min 1.5kg =
              AU$8.99<br> <br> Cold Storage Supermarket (Singapore)<br> Calrose Australian Calrose Rice 5kg = SG$9.50 (Enter: Start
              Shopping, Grocery + Rice)<br> <br> Rolled Pork Loin Rind On 1kg = SG$26.90 (Enter: Start Shopping,
              Meat + Pork)<br> <br> You can maybe do the other comparisons and tell me which product is
              more expensive in Australia as compared to Singapore.<br> <br> As for mobile charges, I compared Optus and Singtel the last time,
              they are more or less similar. <span style="color: #ff0000;">*note:
              there is skype service in Australia which lets u talk for 4000 mins
              free, basically u get a better deal in australia with the phone
              free , around $29-49 monthly charges and $150  upwards worth
              of free calls)</span><br> <br> So your speculation that prices in Australia would cost 3 times as
              more when compared to Singapore does not hold.<br> <br> Singapore affordable??? The stuff you using must be damn
              good.<br>   <br> <br> Lower taxes does not imply affordability when your wages are 3
              times lower than an equivalent GDP per capita country.</p>

              <p>Research shows that what is important for a country to thrive is its social policies and and its dependencies like Security, economy, laws and education. Australia has this magic link. There are lots more migrants of multi cultural ethnic origins who come there to make a living. And the country is still moving... Unlike Singapore, i have heard from some people (FT ) who had a stay in singapore and gained a PR in Australia . Apart from government policies, they stated reasons such as lack of rights, rude workplace behaviour, lack of foresight among managements, and most importantly lack of maturity,awareness and persistent selfishness among workers in singapore.</p>
              <p>A country like singapore can excel in administrative , management and implementation but it lacks the drive in social policies, workplace culture, maturity and awareness.  lionnoisy, there are lots more people living in Australia and they have shortage of workers. So such administrative lapse can be understood.</p>

              <p>ah.. but from what i see here, that you post a barrage of -ve oz postings. i'm really confident to say that u are the one at the suffering end. poor lionnoisy, you did mention before that you HAVE OZ immigration forms in your drawer!</p>
              <p>ah, so what happen?</p>
              <p>i have afew friends back in SG who are in the 50s, out of work in their professions. All lacked the capabilities and capacities to make the move so when they hear others are emigrating, they went on a "patriotic" campaign to laud how good SG/PAP is and how bad the place Oz is. but they know that they are deceiving themselves. Eventually when the others have left, these older and failed emigrants have to look for low paying jobs to make ends meet. While i empathize with their predicaments, there is nothing much that i can do to help them.</p>
              <p>The only, only option that they have is to increase their delusion and depth of their self-deception voluntarily. it is a matter of staying sane in the seas of ever changing social fabric in SG, which is at this moment, very unfavourable to the local singaporeans.</p>
