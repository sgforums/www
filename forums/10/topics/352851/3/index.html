              <p>i might sound a bit like a Buddhist now.  To live is to suffer.  Where-ever you are, to live is to suffer.  whoever you are, you have sins and you suffer.</p>
              <p>so dont say how good or how bad your living is now.  we all have own problems and we all suffer.</p>
              <p>if you think you live better than others, you probably have not discovered the truth about your own surroundings.</p>
              <p>Human beings are not able to create a economic system which sustain our own planet.  That means, where-ever you are, as long as it is within the current global economic system, it makes little difference.</p>

Just imagine if a PR decided to go back, the amount of money remiited back to their countries, ten years back during the 1997 Asian Financial crisis, if not wrong, the Malaysian govt was angry with the Spore govt for not releasing the CPF of Malaysian employees. Somehow it is quite surprising to see locals deciding to put their aged parents in neighbouring Malaysia.</p>

              <p>suffering in sg?! u got to be kidding. stressful yes, but suffering? absolutely no.</p>
              <p>when i hear how some of the viet chinese that had escaped from wars, persecution and famine, our stressful life in SG holds no weight in comparison with the magnitude of their own sufferings.</p>
              <p> everything boils down to your state of mind and your ability to handle or manage your stress. how happy u are depend on how good yourmental outlook is. u can have plain porridge in a dump and yet you can feel bliss. or u can be a multi-millionare with a -ve outlook to everything, even shark fin soup will taste like craps in your mouth.</p>

              <p>Research shows that what is important for a country to thrive is
                  its social policies and and its dependencies like Security,
                  economy, laws and education. Australia has this magic link. There
                  are lots more migrants of multi cultural ethnic origins who come
                  there to make a living. And the country is still moving... Unlike
                  Singapore, i have heard from some people (FT ) who had a stay in
                  singapore and gained a PR in Australia . Apart from government
                  policies, they stated reasons such as lack of rights, rude
                  workplace behaviour, lack of foresight among managements, and most
                  importantly lack of maturity,awareness and persistent selfishness
                  among workers in singapore.</p>
              <p>A country like singapore can excel in administrative ,
                  management and implementation but it lacks the drive in social
                  policies, workplace culture, maturity and awareness.
                   lionnoisy, there are lots more people living in Australia and
                  they have shortage of workers. So such administrative lapse can be
                  understood.</p>
              <p>and F$ck u lionnoisy, U wan to diss something be fair.</p>

              <p>How come from  1996 to 2008,SG GDP grew more than 80 %</p>
              <p>while oz just about 55%?</p>
              <p>How come while 4 persons migrate to oz,there are another</p>
              <p>2 persons who have been staying in oz for sometimes are leaving oz?</p>
              <p>Out of the 2 leaving,one was born in oz?</p>
              <p>u say oz administrative lapse can be

              <p>growing population.I cant buy this reason.</p>

              <p><em>First home buyers will be eligible for grants of up to
                  $21,000 under a decisive Rudd Government initiative designed to
                  stimulate housing activity and give first home buyers a better
                  chance in the housing market.</em></p>
              <p><em>More than 150,000 first home buyers are estimated to benefit
                  from the time-limited scheme.</em></p>

              <p>many frens here buy oz $$ for high interest rate.But it is the
                  bad news for</p>
              <p>loan borrowers.They have to pay higher rate ,compared with SG
                  HDB or private</p>
              <p>home buyers.HDB rate is 2.6% and below 3% for private
                  houses.</p>
              <p>Oz is much higher.Sit down can calculate the rate and the
                  inflation etc</p>
              <p>Think if the so called higher gross salary,higher tax and
                  interest rate,</p>
              <p>worth better welfare and the name of big country!</p>
              <p>a 2% point of rate for A$200,000 loan make u pay $333 extra per
                  month</p>
              <p>in interest.</p>
              <p>a 3 % is $500 pm etc.</p>
              <p>Can the higher salary cover the tax and the extra interest
                  rate.</p>
              <p>Of course,in life,u cant juts calcualte dollar and cents so
                  details.</p>
              <p>But i think u have to know the details before u jump ship.</p>
              <p>a 8 to 9 % interest rate,which just happened in 2008,</p>

              <p>''M<em>ORE than 100 Mackay people are expected to face fallout after riding high with Storm Financial.</em></p>
              <p><em>Clients
              of Storm Financial, which is known for highly gearing investments,
              could have lost up to $2 billion, much of it borrowed from banks.</em></p>
              <p><em>An
              industry insider explained how Storm clients often borrowed money
              against their homes to buy shares, then borrowed more money against
              those shares, which was again ploughed into Storm-managed funds.</em></p>
              <p><em>When the stock market value dropped by more than half in the past 12 months, their homes were put at risk.</em></p>
              <p><em>The insider also said he expected there would be “very deep damage” for many Storm clients.</em></p>
              <p><em>“When you take more debt on, there's a point that you lose all your equity and they (banks) say, 'Pay now',” he said.</em></p>
              <p><em>“For
              the ones with their income and property that's encumbered, they're
              going to be hanging on by the skin of their teeth, if they're hanging
              on at all.”....''</em></p>

              <p>There is big differences between Singapore CPF public housing grant</p>
              <p>and oz first time grant.The former is a long time policy,while the latter</p>
              <p>is just to boost short term GDP rate for a nice report card!!</p>
              <p>Good time or bad time,SG is still afford to give CPF grant to buy HDB.</p>
              <p>This is risky for buyers,banks and whole country if any buyer cannot</p>
              <p>come out with 20 % down.This show they lack of ability,willingness</p>
              <p>and discipline to set aside a lump sum for housing EVERY MONTH for</p>
              <p>20 years.</p>
