We are 40+ years old with a population based just over 2m to start with and most are uneducated immigrant such as farmers and fisherman.<br><br>3) I am in no illusions to be living in Singapore because Singapore is one of the best place in the world to work and live. Pussieland? I think they are too far away from the action in Asia and with the effect of global warming, the country's primary industry is going to take a big hit and green land is turning into desert.
