Idyllic SOL? I dun think so. Just take a look at their income and gst taxes and you might have a different opinion. Also, their people have difficulty qualifying for rebates as well.<br><br>The problem of crammed trains is a global issue, not just in Singapore. SMRT can improve the situation by extending the platforms to accomodate another carriage. (6 increase to 7 carriages) But again that will simply alleviate the problem, not solve it. Face it, rush hour is rush hour.<br><br>And the $5/- card (ezlink i presume) was not forced upon you. You can of course pay cash everytime, not as convenient i imagine though.<br><br>I do agree though that to meet the target of a 'world class transportation'  system which our transport minister has harped on so may times, drivers need to meet their schedules (better yet develop a real time system for evey bus stop so commuters actually know the impending arrival of each bus or their ETA enroute).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the first place SMRT and SBS are not losing money, they just earn a little less than last year. Earning more or a little bit less is part of the business cycle which every normal and healthy listed company will face, so what are the big deals when they earn a little less than last year? Who are they trying to impress even if the company earn much more? Is'nt it their own pocket which are their main concern but how many millions more poor Singaporeans suffer because of their greeds?<br><br>Mr. Sim Wong Woo could turn around his Creative from huge losses by new innovative products and creative cost cutting methods to save costs and enhance profit. What have our transport company done into this direction?<br><br>ComfortDelgro has made huge profit in Singapore but splash it in the loss making companies in China. So far how many cents they have made in their venture in China? They just follow the blinds in venturing into China, invest for the sake of investment and now they are trying to recoup the losses and pass the burden to the poor Singaporeans who are trying to keep their heads above water esp in this kind of harsh economic climate!</div>
