            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking about HongKong and Tung Chee Hwa, here's my 2 cents.<br><br>One cannot be simplistic in comparing Hong Kong before and after China took over. Bear in mind that when China took over in 1997, the same year financial crisis struck Asia and HK was hit in no way lighter than any other country.<br><br>In my humble opinion HK has actually done very well. What they were facing were much worse than Singapore:<br>1.Properties prices went down. Shenzhen and other Chinese southern cities grew stronger and really threaten their position. Many HK people now go to these places for properties.<br>2.Ports in Guangzhou, Zhuhai etc are taking away HK business.<br>3.Taiwanese can now go into China via Macau, hence reduce reliance on HK airport.<br>4.HK have to continue to depend on trade, services and finance, without manufacturing.<br>5.Shanghai threatening their financial center position.<br><br>With so much against them, they have done well. Tung Chee Hwa has really done his best.  What is interesting to see is that the people of Hong Kong are moving a step further, pushing for more political freedom. Under more than 150 years of British colonialism, Britain has never allowed HongKongers to choose their own governer. We see year after year ppl take to the streets. They are evolving!<br>In Singapore, the ruling government is still afraid that any strong opposition will jeopardise our political stability and their position in Singapore, any political rally will frighten away investors. Hate to say this but the PAP just refuses to evolve with the times.<br><br></div>

Infact, China has been helping to boost HK economy. Beijing bought some of the excess properties and has been sending her ppl to visit and shop in HK.<br><br>Hong Kongers' political rights didn't shrink as they never had the rights to vote for their own leaders. Though under communist rule, they enjoy greater political freedom and rights than us. They were able to rally agst the proposed amendement to the Sedition Act by the central govt while the democratic citizens of Singapore were not allowed to stage a peaceful demonstration agst the Iraq War.</div>

If that's the case, I really don't understand why so many people from all over the world chose to emigrate to China. The number of foreigners migrating to China is frightening!!!!!!! China is already better than Taiwan. What do I mean by this? China is still a one-party nation while Taiwan is a democracy but yet there are lots of Taiwanese who actually prefer to live in the mainland. In fact China has already become the 4th favourite destination for emigrating Taiwanese. Take a look at the links below:<br><br>http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A14284-2001Apr27?language=printer<br><br>http://english.people.com.cn/200207/07/eng20020707_99237.shtml<br><br>Look at the HongKongers themselves..... They are also emigrating back to China in large numbers. Look at this:<br><br>http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200405/14/0514131.htm<br><br>There is also a growing trend of japanese who prefer to live and work in China and in fact more and more japanese see China as a good place to work in and perhaps even settle down. Here's an article about Japanese migration to China:<br><br>http://www.muninn.net/blog/archives/000229.html<br><br>There are also more and more Americans who prefer to work and live in China. Take a look at the below link:<br><br>http://www.bjreview.com.cn/200440/Nation-200440(C).htm<br><br>http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-09/22/content_376656.htm<br><br>Lastly I strongly recommend you all to read the below blog of an young American lady who is living in China. Very nice.<br><br>http://www.speakingofchina.com/journal/archives/000112.html<br><br>In the 19th century, many people from european, asian countries migrated to the United States in large numbers. What is happening in China right now is exactly what had occured to the USA 100 years ago.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the main reason for some Taiwanese n other country ppl n even Singaporeans to migrate to mainland China is becoz of the low-cost of living there in comparison to their own country.Plus the China economy boom are also another reason that attract foreigners to migrate there.But still,i dont think "communism" can bring China into a really powerful nation,as "socialism" has already proven a big failure in other countries......But nevertheless,mainland China is still one of the ideal place for foreigners n especially Sinaporeans to migrate there.One reason is of coz the low cost of living,another reason is becoz China was a big nation,even those communist want to take control of everything they will find it hard to implement their ideas.Unlike Singapore,we are like a half-dead fish living in a small pond.</div>
