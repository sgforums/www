            <div class='col-md body'>My stranger friend told me, its not about getting rid of them. Thats virtually impossible.<br><br>He said he thinks its necessary to have a strong integrity opposition have more say and power in parli to help the 2nd majority more than they have been able to do so due to their constraints .  He considers Low and Sylvia and Chiam very super decent and credible and capable Opps that singapore has the good fortune to have them. Thus, he thinks that he feels safe to allow them to play a bigger role. These good people are hard to come by. Dun believe? Ask around who dares do what they doing? Who ? How many? Talk is easy, do like them is tougher than anything. Just think waht it takes to be left standing tall like JBJ. Not many even dare to voice out , in the name of the People. In fact, other than these, I should say NO ONE else.<br><br>He said, the PAP can target 1 group to help and Opposition can target another group to help. Thus Balanced system.  Everyone gets the flavor of their choice. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So, he thinks in a wholistic way and for the good of the whole nation , not just for those who support them.<br>Afterall , singapore belongs to and is built by all who have 'gong lao' and also 'ku lao'.<br><br>We must also not forget to embrace the 2nd Majority. To do so, he thinks, giving a few more seats to Opps is the only way forward.  By the way, he claims that he always votes  for the not-black.<br><br>I replied my stranger friend, I no no . I always anything also no no wan.  whatever they say, I do.  Tell me to jump, I ask how high?  Tell me to sit I say where?<br><br></div>

Not an easy task given our lack of resources and instability after our independence.<br><br>But of course, the present is a separate issue altogether.  I think every Singaporean screams for more welfare without realizing the tax levels of welfare states.  The CPF is a rather smart way of ensuring we pay for our own welfare without raising tax levels.  CPF is not a tax cos <span style="text-decoration: underline;">eventually</span>, you still get your money back. The annuity is supposed to ensure that you don't have to go to the streets to collect cardboard boxes when you get old.<br><br>My only complaint is that they've not given us a voice to speak up against what we feel unhappy about.
