              <p><br>Yes, granted that Papist are wary of foreign interventions, if ever voting becomes one of the priviledges being granted, but foreigners, to the Papist could bring businesses more easily to our shores, and if they find that their health care services are better in their homeland, they could easily go back to retire, thus saving the Papist government of more money.</p>
              <p>As long as Papist remain in power, to me, it does not matter who are their subjects, and they can form more alliances with other countries, behaving more like a big corporate monster than before.</p>
              <p>They already have control of all army and police, they could just include them into their lists of oligarchy commitments, to feed them better.</p>
