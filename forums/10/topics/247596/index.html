She works as a cleaner in a commercial office building and earns $900 a month.<br><br>Madam Jin takes the MRT to and from work every day. That's about $1.50 x 2 x 24 days = $72 a month. She pays about $60 for her water and electricity bills at home. She eats three meals a day, each costing an average of $3.00. That's $3.00 x 3 meals x 30 days = $270 a month on food. Let's say Madam Jin falls sick once in a while and needs to see the doctor. We'll put it at $20 a month. She rents a flat from the HDB. Let's say it's $250 a month (I don't know how much it costs - it's just my guesstimate).<br><br>That's $672 on basic stuff like transportation, water, electricity, food, medical care and accommodation. After deducting $672 from Madam Jin's monthly salary of $900, she's left with $228.<br><br>Now, a foreign domestic maid gets about $300 a month. However, the maid does not need to spend money on public transport to get to work each day. Her employer pays the electricity and water bills and provides three meals a day. The maid's accommodation is essentially free. If the maid falls ill, the employer is, by law, responsible for her medical expenses.<br><br>So when the maid gets $300 a month, the maid really earns $300 a month.<br><br>However, when Madam Jin gets $900, she's really earning just $228 a month.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thus, we can say that one in five Singaporeans is no better off than a foreign maid. If we use Lee Kuan Yew's suggested methodology, we would begin to develop strong suspicions that our PAP ministers are not very competent, after all.<br><br>However, the relevant statistic - that the bottom 20% of wage earners in Singapore earn less than $1,200 a month - is an old one, from 2005. Perhaps things have improved since then? After all, our PAP ministers can't be that incompetent, can they?<br><br>Alas. According to this Straits Times report in 2007, things seem to have only become worse. Not only has the average income of the bottom 20% of Singaporeans not risen, the average income of the bottom 30% has actually fallen.<br><br>Now, if we should once again adopt Mr Lee's methodology, we cannot help but be struck by the aptness of his words. All these years, our ministers have already been receiving the world's highest ministerial salaries. <strong>Yet all these years, Singaporeans seem to have indeed been suffering from a "strong dose of incompetent government".</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Is Singapore today similar to the final Chapters of the Animal Farm ?<br><br>Read the follow extracts :</span><br><br><blockquote><br><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/5.html" rel="nofollow">Chapter VI</a><br>All that year the animals worked like slaves. But they were happy in their work; they grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that everything that they did was for the benefit of themselves and those of their kind who would come after them, and not for a pack of idle, thieving human beings<br><br><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/6.html" rel="nofollow">Chapter VII</a><br>It was a bitter winter. The stormy weather was followed by sleet and snow, and then by a hard frost which did not break till well into February. The animals carried on as best they could with the rebuilding of the windmill, well knowing that the outside world was watching them and that the envious<br>human beings would rejoice and triumph if the mill were not finished on time.<br><br><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/7.html" rel="nofollow">Chapter VIII</a><br>Throughout the year the animals worked even harder than they had worked in the previous year. To rebuild the windmill, with walls twice as thick as before, and to finish it by the appointed date, together with the regular work of the farm, was a tremendous labour.<br><br>There were times when it seemed to the animals that they worked longer hours and fed no better than they had done in Jones's day. On Sunday mornings Squealer, holding down a long strip of paper with his trotter, would read out to them lists of figures proving that the production of every class of foodstuff had increased by two hundred per cent, three hundred per cent, or five hundred per cent, as the case might be. The animals saw no reason to disbelieve him, especially as they could no longer remember very clearly what conditions had been like before the Rebellion. All the same, there were days when they felt that they would sooner have had less figures and more food.<br><br><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/8.html" rel="nofollow">Chapter IX</a><br>At the beginning, when the laws of Animal Farm were first formulated, the retiring age had been fixed for horses and pigs at twelve, for cows at fourteen, for dogs at nine, for sheep at seven, and for hens and geese at five. Liberal old-age pensions had been agreed upon.<br><br>As yet no animal had actually retired on pension, but of late the subject had been discussed more and more. Now that the small field beyond the orchard had been set aside for barley, it was rumoured that a corner of the large pasture was to be fenced off and turned into a grazing-ground for superannuated animals. For a horse, it was said, the pension would be five pounds of corn a day and, in winter, fifteen pounds of hay, with a carrot or possibly an apple on public holidays.<br><br>Boxer's twelfth birthday was due in the late summer of the following year.<br><br>Meanwhile life was hard. The winter was as cold as the last one had been, and food was even shorter. Once again all rations were reduced, except those of the pigs and the dogs. A too rigid equality in rations, Squealer explained, would have been contrary to the principles of Animalism.<br><br>In any case he had no difficulty in proving to the other animals that they were<br>NOT in reality short of food, whatever the appearances might be. For the time being, certainly, it had been found necessary to make a readjustment of rations (Squealer always spoke of it as a "readjustment," never as a "reduction" ), but in comparison with the days of Jones, the improvement was enormous.<br><br><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/9.html" rel="nofollow">Chapter X of the Animal Farm</a><br>The farm was more prosperous now, and better organised: it had even been enlarged by two fields which had been bought from Mr. Pilkington.<br><br>The windmill had been successfully completed at last, and the farm possessed a threshing machine and a hay elevator of its own, and various new buildings had been added to it. Whymper had bought himself a dogcart.<br><br>The windmill, however, had not after all been used for generating electrical power. It was used for milling corn, and brought in a handsome money profit.<br><br>The animals were hard at work building yet another windmill; when that one was finished, so it was said, the dynamos would be installed.<br><br><strong>But the luxuries of which Snowball had once taught the animals to dream, the stalls with electric light and hot and cold water, and the three-day week, were no longer talked about</strong>.<br><br>Napoleon had denounced such ideas as contrary to the spirit of Animalism. <strong><span style="color: red;">The truest happiness, he said, lay in working hard and living frugally</span></strong>.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the animals themselves any richer-except, of course, for the pigs and the dogs.[/</span></strong><br><br>Perhaps this was partly because there were so many pigs and so many dogs. It was not that these creatures did not work, after their fashion. There was, as Squealer was never tired of explaining, endless work in the supervision and organisation of the farm.<br><br>Much of this work was of a kind that the other animals were too ignorant to understand. For example, Squealer told them that the pigs had to expend enormous labours every day upon mysterious things called "files," "reports," "minutes," and "memoranda."<br><br>As for the others, their life, so far as they knew, was as it had always been.<br><br>They were generally hungry, they slept on straw, they drank from the pool, they laboured in the fields; in winter they were troubled by the cold, and in summer by the flies.<br><br>Sometimes the older ones among them racked their dim memories and tried to determine whether in the early days of the Rebellion, when Jones's expulsion was still recent, things had been better or worse than now. They could not remember.<br><br></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">continue below</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">continuation from above</span><br><br><blockquote><br><br>There was nothing with which they could compare their present lives: they had nothing to go upon except Squealer's lists of figures, which invariably demonstrated that everything was getting better and better.<br><br>The animals found the problem insoluble; in any case, they had little time for speculating on such things now. <strong>Only old Benjamin professed to remember every detail of his long life and to know that things never had been, nor ever could be much better or much worse-hunger, hardship, and disappointment being, so he said, the unalterable law of life.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">And yet the animals never gave up hope. More, they never lost, even for an instant, their sense of honour and privilege in being members of Animal Farm.</span></strong><br><br><strong>They were still the only farm in the whole county-in all England!-owned and operated by animals</strong>.<br><br>Not one of them, not even the youngest, not even the newcomers who had been brought from farms ten or twenty miles away, ever ceased to marvel at that. And when they heard the gun booming and saw the green flag fluttering at the masthead, their hearts swelled with imperishable pride, and the talk turned always towards the old heroic days, the expulsion of Jones, the writing of the Seven Commandments, the great battles in which the human invaders had been defeated.<br><br>None of the old dreams had been abandoned. The Republic of the Animals which Major had foretold, when the green fields of England should be untrodden by human feet, was still believed in.<br><br>It might be that their lives were hard and that not all of their hopes had been fulfilled; but they were conscious that they were not as other animals. If they went hungry, it was not from feeding tyrannical human beings; if they worked hard, at least they worked for themselves.<br><br><strong>No creature among them went upon two legs.<br><br>No creature called any other creature "Master." All animals were equal.</strong><br><br>One day in early summer Squealer ordered the sheep to follow him, and led them out to a piece of waste ground at the other end of the farm, which had become overgrown with birch saplings. The sheep spent the whole day there browsing at the leaves under Squealer's supervision. In the evening he returned to the farmhouse himself, but, as it was warm weather, told the sheep to stay where they were. It ended by their remaining there for a whole week, during which time the other animals saw nothing of them. Squealer was with them for the greater part of every day. He was, he said, teaching them to sing a new song, for which privacy was needed.<br><br>It was just after the sheep had returned, on a pleasant evening when the animals had finished work and were making their way back to the farm buildings, that the terrified neighing of a horse sounded from the yard. Startled, the animals stopped in their tracks. It was Clover's voice. She neighed again, and all the animals broke into a gallop and rushed into the yard. Then they saw what Clover had seen.<br><br><strong>It was a pig walking on his hind legs.</strong><br><br>Yes, it was Squealer. A little awkwardly, as though not quite used to supporting his considerable bulk in that position, but with perfect balance, he was strolling across the yard. And a moment later, out from the door of the farmhouse came a long file of pigs, all walking on their hind legs. Some did it better than others, one or two were even a trifle unsteady and looked as though they would have liked the support of a stick, but every one of them made his way right round the yard successfully. And finally there was a tremendous baying of dogs and a shrill crowing from the black cockerel, and out came Napoleon himself, majestically upright, casting haughty glances from side to side, and with his dogs gambolling round him.<br><br><strong>He carried a whip in his trotter.</strong><br><br>There was a deadly silence. Amazed, terrified, huddling together, the animals watched the long line of pigs march slowly round the yard. It was as though the world had turned upside-down. Then there came a moment when the first shock had worn off and when, in spite of everything-in spite of their terror of the dogs, and of the habit, developed through long years, of never complaining, never criticising, no matter what happened-they might have uttered some word of protest. But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of-<br><br><strong>"Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!" </strong><br><br>It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse.<br><br>Benjamin felt a nose nuzzling at his shoulder. He looked round. It was Clover. Her old eyes looked dimmer than ever. Without saying anything, she tugged gently at his mane and led him round to the end of the big barn, where the Seven Commandments were written. For a minute or two they stood gazing at the tatted wall with its white lettering.<br><br>"My sight is failing," she said finally. "Even when I was young I could not have read what was written there. But it appears to me that that wall looks different. Are the Seven Commandments the same as they used to be, Benjamin?"<br><br>For once Benjamin consented to break his rule, and he read out to her what was written on the wall. There was nothing there now except a single Commandment. It ran:<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL<br>BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS </span></strong><br><br>After that it did not seem strange when next day the pigs who were supervising the work of the farm all carried whips in their trotters.<br><br>It did not seem strange to learn that the pigs had bought themselves a wireless set, were arranging to install a telephone, and had taken out subscriptions to John Bull, TitBits, and the Daily Mirror.<br><br>It did not seem strange when Napoleon was seen strolling in the farmhouse garden with a pipe in his mouth-no, not even when the pigs took Mr. Jones's clothes out of the wardrobes and put them on, Napoleon himself appearing in a black coat, ratcatcher breeches, and leather leggings, while his favourite sow appeared in the watered silk dress which Mrs. Jones had been used to wear on Sundays.<br><br>That evening loud laughter and bursts of singing came from the farmhouse. And suddenly, at the sound of the mingled voices, the animals were stricken with curiosity. What could be happening in there, now that for the first time animals and human beings were meeting on terms of equality? With one accord they began to creep as quietly as possible into the farmhouse garden.<br><br>At the gate they paused, half frightened to go on but Clover led the way in. They tiptoed up to the house, and such animals as were tall enough peered in at the dining-room window.<br><br>There, round the long table, sat half a dozen farmers and half a dozen of the more eminent pigs, Napoleon himself occupying the seat of honour at the head of the table.<br><br>The pigs appeared completely at ease in their chairs.<br><br>The company had been enjoying a game of cards but had broken off for the moment, evidently in order to drink a toast. A large jug was circulating, and the mugs were being refilled with beer. No one noticed the wondering faces of the animals that gazed in at the window.<br><br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><span style="color: darkred;">continuation from above</span><br><br><blockquote><br><br>There was enthusiastic cheering and stamping of feet. Napoleon was so gratified that he left his place and came round the table to clink his mug against Mr. Pilkington's before emptying it. When the cheering had died down, Napoleon, who had remained on his feet, intimated that he too had a few words to say.<br><br>Like all of Napoleon's speeches, it was short and to the point. He too, he said, was happy that the period of misunderstanding was at an end.<br><br>For a long time there had been rumours-circulated, he had reason to think, by some malignant enemy-that there was something subversive and even revolutionary in the outlook of himself and his colleagues.<br><br>They had been credited with attempting to stir up rebellion among the animals on neighbouring farms. Nothing could be further from the truth! Their sole wish, now and in the past, was to live at peace and in normal business relations with their neighbours.<br><br>This farm which he had the honour to control, he added, was a co-operative enterprise. The title-deeds, which were in his own possession, were owned by the pigs jointly.<br><br>He did not believe, he said, that any of the old suspicions still lingered, but certain changes had been made recently in the routine of the farm which should have the effect of promoting confidence stiff further.<br><br>Hitherto the animals on the farm had had a rather foolish custom of addressing one another as "Comrade." This was to be suppressed.<br><br>There had also been a very strange custom, whose origin was unknown, of marching every Sunday morning past a boar's skull which was nailed to a post in the garden.<br><br>This, too, would be suppressed, and the skull had already been buried.<br><br>His visitors might have observed, too, the green flag which flew from the masthead. If so, they would perhaps have noted that the white hoof and horn with which it had previously been marked had now been removed.<br><br>It would be a plain green flag from now onwards.<br><br>He had only one criticism, he said, to make of Mr. Pilkington's excellent and neighbourly speech. Mr. Pilkington had referred throughout to "Animal Farm."<br><br>He could not of course know-for he, Napoleon, was only now for the first time announcing it-that the name <strong>"Animal Farm" had been abolished.</strong><br><br>Henceforward the farm was to be known as "The Manor Farm"-which, he believed, was its correct and original name.<br><br>"Gentlemen," concluded Napoleon, "I will give you the same toast as before, but in a different form. Fill your glasses to the brim. Gentlemen, here is my toast: <strong>To the prosperity of The Manor Farm!</strong> "<br><br>There was the same hearty cheering as before, and the mugs were emptied to the dregs.<br><br>But as the animals outside gazed at the scene, it seemed to them that some strange thing was happening.<br><br>What was it that had altered in the faces of the pigs? Clover's old dim eyes flitted from one face to another. Some of them had five chins, some had four, some had three. But what was it that seemed to be melting and changing?<br><br>Then, the applause having come to an end, the company took up their cards and continued the game that had been interrupted, and the animals crept silently away.<br><br>But they had not gone twenty yards when they stopped short.<br><br>An uproar of voices was coming from the farmhouse. They rushed back and looked through the window again. Yes, a violent quarrel was in progress.<br><br>There were shoutings, bangings on the table, sharp suspicious glances, furious denials.<br><br>The source of the trouble appeared to be that Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington had each played an ace of spades simultaneously.<br><br>Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike.<br><br>No question, now, <strong>what had happened to the faces of the pigs</strong>.<br><br>The creatures outside looked <strong>from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which</strong>.<br><br></blockquote></div>
