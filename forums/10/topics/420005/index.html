              <p>I believe that whilst the Minister (MBT) committed no incursion against <strong>Sect24B</strong>, <a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_retrieve.pl?&amp;actno=Reved-329A&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part">Town Council Act (Cap.329A)</a>,
               as according statute he is only required to "by order published in the 
              Gazette,  declare any housing estate of the Board ... to be a precinct 
              ...carrying out any lift upgrading works in buildings..."<br> The issue of concern however involves the question of whether the said 
              Minister 'leaked confidential govt data' of his decision to benefit his 
              friend Mr Eric Low prior to the officially embargoed release timing of 
              such government announcement in <a href="http://www.egazette.com.sg/gazetteViewDetail.aspx?ct=gg&amp;subscriber=0">The Gazette</a>. <br> <br> If so, the leak of such 'government data' to 'interested but unqualified
               3rd parties' due to the 3rd parties having  'personal relations' with 
              political title holders ought not be condoned as that would indicate the
               lack of integrity of political office bearers in safeguarding official 
              secret government information.<br> <br> If this is so proven, then the best thing for the official concerned to 
              do is to resign as a sign of remorse having leaked sensitive information
               that should have been embargoed till release at a stated time through 
              the proper government channel of the '<a href="http://www.egazette.com.sg/gazetteViewDetail.aspx?ct=gg&amp;subscriber=0">Gazette</a>'. <br> <br> How could Mr MBT assume that he had the authority to release such info to Mr E Low?<br> <br> That said, I find Mr MBT's decision to name Mr Eric Low as Hougang 
              constituency's 'grassroots adviser' most petty, unconstitutional, a 
              betrayal to the interest of Hougang residents and a behavior unbecoming 
              of a Cabinet Minister.<br> <br> This is because section <strong>24B, C</strong> (excerpts) of the <a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_retrieve.pl?&amp;actno=Reved-329A&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part">Town Council Act (Cap.329A)</a> states that:</p>

              <p>As clear as crystal is the fact that by statute, Mr MBT in 
              arriving at his decision about an LUP award, would  have considered 
              primarily the input the Board(HDB) and the relevant Town Council, the 
              latter of which Mr Low TK is , by statute, Chairman. Any accessory 
              contribution from Mr E Low would have remained just as accessory as Mr E
               Low remains- the loosing candidate in GE2006. <br> <br> By law, Mr MBT's leak to Mr E Low simply ends at Mr E Low making the 
              announcement of the LUP: something of little consequence except to tell 
              us that Mr MBT is a good friend of Mr E Low, to whom he leaks important 
              govt data abt 'LUP', such that by possibly making a preempted 
              announcement of the upgrading notice as should ordinarily appear in the '<a href="http://www.egazette.com.sg/gazetteViewDetail.aspx?ct=gg&amp;subscriber=0">Gazette</a>',
               Mr E Low might usurp the authority of the incumbent MP of Hougang 
              constituency- a rather unethical and unprofessional act considering that
               such information should have been embargoed for official released in 
              the govt  <a href="http://www.egazette.com.sg/gazetteViewDetail.aspx?ct=gg&amp;subscriber=0">'Gazette'</a> and ought to be, like so is the case in PAP led constituencies, the 
              purview of the relevant Town Council Chairman to disclose to his 
              constituency.<br> Perhaps Minister MBT might have misinterpreted the statutes of the <a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_retrieve.pl?&amp;actno=Reved-329A&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part">Town Council Act (Cap.329A)</a>? As such, Mr MBT's explanation probably holds no water and in fact, might be in contravention of the <a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_retrieve.pl?&amp;actno=Reved-213&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part">Official Secrets Act Cap 213</a>.<br> <br> Could Mr E Low still be involved with the LUP?<br> Mr Low's involvement with Hougang's LUP however, should end just as 
              quickly as it began. In not operating through the Hougang Town Council 
              but in suspicious rivalry with, Mr E Low seems only  intent on 
              obfuscating the proper procedure by which LUP must be conducted- that 
              is, under the chairmanship and direction of elected constituency/ town 
              council MP Mr Low Thia Kiang (the statutorily designated person/ 
              organisation), who/which would statutorily conduct and complete the 
              requirements under section <strong>24C</strong> of the <a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_retrieve.pl?&amp;actno=Reved-329A&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part">Town Council Act (Cap.329A)</a> (polls, commencement of construction etc). Leaving Mr E Low little to 
              do except to now officially offer to assist at this juncture.<br> By this discourse, Mr MBT has 'unwittingly'  sewn confusion and dissent 
              amongst the residents of Hougang constituency as to whom the town 
              council is and should be- an act most unbecoming of a Cabinet Minister 
              and most destructive to the sense of community, dignity and democracy 
              amongst the residents of Hougang constituency or any other constituency 
              in Singapore for that matter.<br> <br> On a related note, Mr MBT is also very wrong to compare the LUP with "<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">other government programmes such as the  building of roads and schools</span>", this is because</p>
              <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
              <li>According to<strong> 24D(1)</strong>:
               "...the Town Council (TC) concerned shall carry out the lift upgrading 
              works in the precinct in such manner as the Town Council thinks fit." 
              LUP is thus unlike new schools where the MOE not only builds the school 
              but also runs it totally, nor roads which are planned, built, maintained
               and policed by the LTA if not the T.Police.</li>
              <li>The lifts unlike 
              schools and roads are neither built nor maintained by the relevant govt 
              Ministries but by the town councils themselves. i.e.the $ for 
              maintaining lifts come from Town Council funds and not the HDB. (HDB 
              only provides the funds for building- the quantum being up to 90% of the
               costs- residents and the TC bearing the rest of it).</li>
              </ol>
              <p>For the 
              sake of government integrity, someone should investigate the presence 
              and significance of this leak of confidential information to interested 
              but unqualified 3rd persons such as Mr Eric Low who opportunistically 
              attempted to capitalize on this leak of government data by way of 
              possibly making a premature disclosure which ordinarily would have been 
              revealed through the government <a href="http://www.egazette.com.sg/gazetteViewDetail.aspx?ct=gg&amp;subscriber=0">Gazette</a>.<br> <br> For the sake of the integrity of the executive, someone please 
              investigate if any rules have been contravened this probably premature 
              disclosure of a Ministerial decision in a manner contrary to the usual 
              procedure of publication in the government  <a href="http://www.egazette.com.sg/gazetteViewDetail.aspx?ct=gg&amp;subscriber=0">Gazette</a>.<br> <br> Rgds,<br> B.C.<br> Comments?<br> <br> Reference(s):<br> - <strong>'A rebuttal to MND: Why Mah Bow Tan is wrong on upgrading'</strong>: [<a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/10/14/a-rebuttal-to-mnd-why-mah-bow-tan-is-wrong-on-upgrading/">TR, 14Oct2009</a>]<br> - <strong>'‘Adviser over MP’ raises many questions'</strong>:<em> "PAP MPs are
