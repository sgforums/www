Only he never got up again.<br><br>According to Apple Daily, Wu came around after a few minutes to find her boyfriend unconscious beside her, and quickly called for help.<br><br>But Mr Huang was declared dead on arrival at the hospital. It is not clear what the extent of Wu's injuries were.<br><br>When his mother rushed to the hospital and saw her son, she was so distraught that she could only ask Wu to cover Mr Huang's chest injuries with a shirt.<br><br>Apple Daily quoted the power authorities as saying that they had received earlier complaints of an electric leakage from the apartment.<br><br>But they found that the water heater in question was working fine and suspect a power leakage from one of the electrical cables may have caused the accident.<br><br>Police are still investigating the matter.<br><br></div>
