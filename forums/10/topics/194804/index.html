            <div class='col-md body'>If you call yourself some name like Chief of National Trade Union Congress what must be your passions and objectives? Which ones of the following will be your objectives:-<br><br>(1) Represent interests of bosses or employers to lower their costs ?<br><br>(2) Fight for the right of employees and workers to get a good deal ?<br><br>(3) Work for the government to implement government's policies ?<br><br>To me, the answer is clear. It is unequivocally (2) because the name of my organization is called NTUC or National Employers Association or Government of Singapore.<br><br>NTUC has been headed by the wrong guy? He should be someone with the passion to serve the interest of the employees and workers.<br><br>If he wants to work for balance of the workers versus the employers versus the government called Tripartism he should resign and hand over the job to some Head of Union who has proven skilful in negotiating and representing workers' rights and join the government to be a minister in charge of manpower.<br><br>It is as simple as A, B, C that workers' rights are subjected to market forces and market forces will determine whether employees and workers will get what they want and sustainable.<br><br>Why for years we are given all the indoctrination that we must desist from representing workers for their rights and entitlements.<br><br>Try to talk to any employers today. They have no respect for employees at all. They can sack anyone by giving contractual notice without giving any reason.<br><br>An employer can hold back any 13th month bonus without giving any reason when ministers and civil servants are getting 7th and 13th months plus all the best deals they want without any similar constraints or interpretation of the Employment Act?<br><br>Why? Because of Tripartism as Minister Lim used to tell the workers in Singapore - our workers' high wages have caused our loss of economic competitiveness.<br><br>Look at the bigger picture and fact clearly and objectively and we will find that it is not the workers' wages which have caused many companies to lose monies or economic competitivenss.<br><br>It it (1) Double Charge on Land Costs by the government (2) Triple charge of vehicular transportation (after COE and ERP, excise on vehicle is still charged at 130% of OMV) and CEO/Talents salaries ($600,000 pa is too commonly paid to executives in GLCs without even contributing to higher value-added job creation and new technology start-usp).<br><br>Workers' wages have dropped to $800.00 - $1,000.00 pm while CEO/GMs in many ironricebowl GLCs which can employ much cheaper managers are being made at peanut salaries ($600,000.00) to do routine maintenance jobs requiring hardly any efforts.<br><br>Why must we employ Comfort or Taxi chief at million dollar salaries when their predecessors with entrepreneurial abilities to show were paid at 1/3 of less.<br><br>Singapore is getting overly self-centred with a few top elites measuring their own worths and over-paying themselves while workers and employees are sacrificed like pawns.<br><br>If they MOM wants to make the low wages of workers even lower by making it flexible and variable to allow employers to use it as excuse to lower them, it is the saddest day in Singapore history. NTUC chief Lim Boon Heng can easily pick up the phone to tell MOM that it would be inhuman to do so. If CPF was to be permanently withdrawn from workers let there be a provision to be restored in some flexible scheme like "varaible reward of workers for non-restoration of past CPF cut".<br><br>NTUC chief has been largely responsible for today's anti-worker employment culture because of the dirty word tripartism in the whole episode.</div>
