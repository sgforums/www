            <div class='col-md body'>The threads in here are kinda boring, so I'll start my own. And I know their is one in the chit chat forum but I think the people here are smarter.<br><br>Okay, let's clear some things up first:<br><br>Capitalism: An ECONOMIC system<br><br>Democracy: A POLITICAL system<br><br>Communism: A POLITICAL system.<br><br>Socialism: An ECONOMIC system.<br><br>Communism, by the Engels and Marx's Communist Manifesto, called for the overthrow of capitalism. (I realize communism doesn't imply Marxism, but this is how I'm backing what I'm about to say.)<br><br>Karl Marx believed that the capitalist system, which produced the Industrial Revolution, would eventually destroy itself in the following way.<br><br>Factories would drive small artistans out of business, leaving a small number of manufacturers to control all the wealth. The large proleteriat would revolt, seize the factories and mills from the capitalists, and produce what society needed. Workers would control the government in a "dictatorship of the proletariat", as Marx termed it. After a period of cooperative living and education, the state or government would wither away as a classless society developed.<br><br>This final, classless phase is what Karl Marx called pure communism. It's what communist communist governments should work towards.<br><br>Marx's phase order.<br><br>1. feudalism and/or absolutism<br>2. capitalsim<br>3. socialism<br>4. communism/complete socialism<br><br>A reason some believe communism never worked is because every nation that had ever experienced communism didn't follow through Marx's phases correctly. Though Russia was a bit industrialized, it was for the most part still a feudal monarchy. There were serfs in Russia up until the beginning of the 20th century and far too many farmers for Russia to the move right on to the "step" of communism. Many believe communism would work, provided you industrialize beforehand.<br><br>Still, I can see how a communist system wouldn't work because it's contrary to human nature. The entire "people are lazy" is a rather clichÃ©d argument against communism, so I'm not even about to go into it.<br><br>One theoretical perspective in sociology is the conflict perspective, which follows in the tradition of Karl Marx. People who employ this perspective focus on those forces in society that promote competition and change.<br><br>According to Marx, it is capitalistm that is contrary to human nature, and communism, if done correctly, is in keeping with human nature. Marx believed that no human would choose to work, if they could do otherwise, and thus the capitalist is going against human nature by forcing the worker to work to survive. Since that capitalist controls the means of production, the completely dehumanize the worker by making him perform labour against his own desires and wishes to produce something to make the capitalist richer. Thus the worker is reduced to being only as valuable as what he can produce. So the worker is doing something dehumanizing to produce something that is not human to make someone who is not the worker richer. This is how it is against human nature.<br><br>I've been reading a lot of Marx recently, and it's very fascinating reading. I won't do a very good job conveying what Marx was saying, since Marx was a genius and a very good writer, and I am neither. And please post your comments and tell me what you think.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Socialism can be defined, well, in a rigid sort of way as an economic system in which the workers own the means of production and distribution of goods.<br><br>A more laxed definition would be simply that the workers maintain political control over the production and distribution of goods.<br><br>An ideal system of government for the people, except we'll always be human. With different people comes different ideas, different political / economical agendas, sooner or later it will spell internal chaos and a breakdown of national interests.<br><br>I couldn't give an example or anything relevant in real life since you are right about communist governments in history never ran as a complete socialist entity in it's purest form. Although George Orwell couldn't have illustrate this better with Animal Farm.<br><br>An interesting thing to note is that socialism and communism with it's affinity to the working class, had often times been used as a cover for a more vicious totalitarian political goal than an actual govt itself.<br><br>Nazi Germany was the manifestation of the National Socialist Party, which by itself was nothing more than a masquerade for Fascism.<br><br>So beware govt bodies with a *national socialist* construct in their names  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

This, most probably is the cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe.<br>I'm not a very good writer, and probably never will be. However, I am really very interested on Russia and Communism.<br>Please email me if you want to talk about these topics in future.<br>Thanks.<br><br>------------------<br>::firefoX:::<br>firefox@acnova.com</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NewBWithACause:</div><div class="quote_body"> To the people who say that communism doesn't work, well it doesn't work in our rich modern world, but it works much better than capitalism in a world where there is little capital, i.e. the world 100 years ago and back. And its principles works excellently in miniature (tribal) societies and families. Of course you may call your family "capitalism", but do you think it will be fun?.<br><br>And for communism to work they must follow marx phrase of order and everyone mush be communist.</div></blockquote>Not exactly true. Consider Cambodia under the rule of Pol Pot. He tried to revert it back to an agrian form of communist society, but it just did not work out. Communisim is against the human nature to strive for a better life and a belief for a "what you reap is what is sow" concept. Any system without the support of its people and which opposes the base human nature is doomed to fail.<br><br>For tribal societies, as you siad the tribe is small and such a system could prevail, but even then, consider the fact that every tribe will have someone leading it nad he would be in the words of Owell, "more equal than the others". This by itself will be a death knell to any forms of commuisum. A correct word to describe such a system would be communal living.</div>
