              <div id="story_content"><br>
              <p><strong>A
              high-ranking civil servant’s account about spending RM110,124 for him,
              his wife and son to learn fine French cooking has blown up in his face.</strong></p>
              <p>A
              GOVERNMENT elite has stirred ripples by talking of his expensive
              cooking lessons in France, revealing how hard times are deepening class
              differences in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Inadvertently creating controversy was
              the permanent secretary at the Environment and Water Resources
              Ministry, one of the highest ranking civil servants.</p>
              <p>Tan Yong
              Soon had related how he had spent S$46,000 (RM110,124) for himself, his
              wife and son for a five-day trip to learn fine French cooking.</p>
              <p>In
              ordinary times, this leisurely – but rather insensitive – account would
              not have amounted to anything much but these days are, of course, far
              from normal.</p>
              <p>Two factors invited criticism to flare.</p>
              <p>First,
              he was seen as flaunting wealth, obtained from his high pay, at a time
              when Singapore is suffering one of its worst slumps in history.</p>
              <p>Many thousands of workers are still losing jobs or suffering wage cuts.</p>
              <p>And,
              secondly, government leaders are accused of being hugely overpaid, as a
              result of which some are no longer able to relate to the common people.</p>
              <p>Tan
              was also accused of “boasting” about his elitist background when he
              wrote that his wife was “a senior investment counsellor at a bank” and
              his son, a soon-to-be student at America’s prestigious Brown University.</p>
              <p>“Taking five weeks’ leave from work is not as difficult as one thinks,” Tan said.</p>
              <p>“Most
              times, when you are at the top, you think you are indispensable. But if
              you are a good leader who has built up a good team, it is possible to
              go away for five weeks or even longer.”</p>
              <p>Singaporeans were
              largely unimpressed. Some were angry. His fling at France’s prestigious
              Le Cordon Bleu in the face of rising poverty is the latest example of
              how out of tune some of Singapore’s well-paid elites are with heartland
              realities.</p>
              <p>About 20% of affluent Singapore’s population lives in
              poverty with welfare payout to the poorest of the lot limited to a mere
              S$290 (RM694) a month.</p>
              <p>When a government backbencher wanted to have it increased, a Cabinet minister refused, demanding: “How much do you want?”</p>
              <p>Many
              Singaporeans were already unhappy with the multi-million dollar
              salaries paid to Cabinet ministers and top civil servants even in
              happier times.</p>
              <p>(Despite a recent cut of up to 19%, the government here remains, by far, the highest paid in the world.)</p>
              <p>The
              pay issue remains very controversial and contributes to the class
              division in society, a them-verses-us mentality that has apparently
              sharpened as a result of the economic crisis.</p>
              <p>The whole episode has shown how the class – and social – divide is widening in high-tech Singapore.</p>
              <p>The
              controversy over Tan’s trip has political implications for a government
              that is pondering over whether or not to call for a snap general
              election, which is not due until 2010-11.</p>
              <p>In other developed
              countries from Britain to Japan, it would not have any impact since it
              involves a civil servant, not a political leader.</p>
              <p>But the system is very different in Singapore, where the line separating the two hardly exists.</p>
              <p>The Chinese characters “zeng fu” are used to describe the political leadership as well as the civil service.</p>
              <p>Some questioned why Tan’s choice of spending his own wealth should be the public’s business – but not many are buying into it.</p>
              <p>Established
              blogger Redbean articulated: “Tan is no ordinary, rich Singaporean. He
              is a senior civil servant ... and part of the governing elite.</p>
              <p>“(He)
              should be seen as one who would be able to empathise with ordinary
              Singaporeans who are going through tough times ... (when) the Prime
              Minister is preparing the people for some belt-tightening and ‘bitter
              medicine’.”</p>
              <p>Besides, if Tan had wished he should have spent his
              money at home to help the troubled economy rather than abroad, some
              believed.</p>
              <p>Tan’s is by no means the only example of elitist snobbery, nor the worse.</p>
              <p>A
              bigger controversy flared up four years ago when Wee Shu Min, the
              teenage daughter of a Member of Parliament, came across the blog of a
              Singaporean who wrote that he was worried about losing his job.</p>
              <p>She called Derek Wee “one of many wretched, under-motivated, over-assuming leeches in our country.</p>
              <p>“If
              you’re not good enough, life will kick you in the b***s ... Our society
              is, I quote, ‘far too survival of fittest’,” said Shu Min, who hailed
              from the elite Raffles Junior College.</p>
              <p>“... Unless you are an
              arm-twisting commie bully, which, given your whiny, middle-class,
              under-educated penchant, I doubt,” she added before signing off with
              “please, get out of my elite uncaring face”.</p>
              <p>The girl was flamed
              by hundreds of Singaporeans, but when her father Wee Siew Kim – an MP
              in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s constituency – told a newspaper
              that “her basic point is reasonable”, the row moved well beyond
              blogosphere.</p>
              <p>A news agency, in reporting this, said: “The
              episode highlighted a deep rift in Singapore society and was an
              embarrassment for the ruling People’s Action Party and PM Lee.”</p>
              <p>Raffles JC, which has produced several state leaders, had another brush with student snobbishness.</p>
              <p>When
              a student found that a Raffles girl was dating a boy from a
              lower-achieving neighbourhood school, he hit out at him and had a
              message for lower-ranking students everywhere.</p>
              <p>“Quit trying to climb the social ladder by dating students from top schools.”</p>
              <p>There are signs the class distinction is getting into some young minds.</p>
              <p>A
              reporter recounted how her friend was shaken when her young daughter
              came home one day and mentioned in passing that poor people were
              “stupid, obviously”.</p>

              <p>when i read this, my take was it is one of the propaganda piece of work by the state media to tell people it is ok to spend, especially when you got the dough. otherwise, there will not be so many other articles on how people are still spending big of late, and pointers on where to buy what, etc.</p>
              <p>obviously, the ordinary folks here in singapore are out of touch with the reality there; i.e. singapore is no longer a place for them.</p>
              <p>the new singapore train have left the station.</p>

              <p>Hey, if he wants to spend the money, fine, but let's not compartmentalise the issue to the extent where it loses meaning.  If he kept it to himself, frankly, who gives a fuck?</p>
              <p>On the other hand, when people are in fear of losing their jobs (if they're lucky enough to not already be unemployed), telling the world about how much money you can afford to spend is simply rubbing people's faces in it.</p>
              <p>Regardless of the economic situation, I'm willing to wager that for any private businessman, the almost-guaranteed first response to one of his employees saying that he can take five weeks' leave off and not be missed is, "You're not doing enough work".  With his spending fifty grand learning to cook liver during that time, the boss would be thinking, "I've paid this bugger too much".  Considering this civil <strong>servant</strong> is being paid too much for not doing enough work, why should there not be outrage about how the public's coffers are being squandered?</p>
              <p>Considering this guy's supposed to be part of the system whose mandate is to ensure that people are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not</strong></span> in fear of losing their jobs simply grinds salt into gaping wounds.</p>
              <p>It simply flies in the face of good old common sense that this leech should be able to tell everyone how much he earns for what little he does, and expect to not attract comment, much less outrage.</p>
