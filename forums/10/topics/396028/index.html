              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Conversation with Jiang Mei, a PRC freelance prostitute given Singapore PR by the PAP</span></strong></p>
              <p>During a NUS ministerial forum early this week, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean proclaimed that the PAP has been very “strict” with immigration and they accept only foreign “talents” who can “contribute” to Singapore.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="content">
              <div id="contentleft">
              <div class="postarea">
              <p>Due to the PAP’s liberal immigration and pro-foreigner policies, foreigners now make up 36 percent of Singapore’s population, up from 14 percent in 1990.</p>
              <p>Unlike other developed nations, prospective immigrants do not have to pass a mandatory International English test such as IELTS to work, study or live in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, it is amazingly easy for foreigners to obtain Singapore PR which does not require a minimum period of residency and approved in double quick-time.</p>
              <p>The state media reported last year on one China National Zhang Yuanyuan who obtained Singapore PR within two months of application.</p>
              <p>According to the Home Affairs Ministry, two out of every three PR applicants are successful, some of whom are construction workers, cleaners, masseurs and even freelance prostitutes.</p>
              <p>How these “professionals” can be considered as “talents” by DPM Teo and his other PAP colleagues is anybody’s guess. Some readers have feedbacked to us to provide proof that freelance prostitutes are given Singapore PR by the PAP.</p>
              <p>Let us share with you an encounter by one of our readers Nick with a Singapore PR from China who is currently working as a <strong>freelance prostitute in a massage parlor in Chinatown</strong> which took place last year December.</p>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong><em> The names are fictitious, the venue is a massage parlor at Chinatown, exact location not given for obvious reasons. Readers who do not believe the story can explore the place to find out yourself.</em></p>
              <p><strong>Translated from Chinese:</strong></p>
              <p>Nick is a frequent “cheongster” (patron) of massage parlors and KTV lounges. He is amazed that <strong>quite a number of the masseurs and KTV hostesses from China are Singapore PRs.</strong> Brothers who “cheong” frequently will be able to corroborate his claims.</p>
              <p>Below is a conversation that Nick had with Jiang Mei, a masseur working as a freelance prostitute in Chinatown:</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei</strong> (standing outside the parlor soliciting customers):</p>
              <p>“<span id="result_box"><span style="background-color: #fff;" title="handsome guy">å¸…å“¥ </span></span>(handsome guy), do you want some <span id="result_box"><span style="background-color: #fff;" title="massage">æŒ‰æ‘© (</span></span>massage)?”</p>
              <p><strong>Nick</strong> (entering the parlor):</p>
              <p>“Hmm….is Ying Zi around?”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“She went for course sponsored by the government.”</p>
              <p><strong>Nick:</strong></p>
              <p>“What course?”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“Some skill upgrading course to be a beautician, try me, I promise to give you excellent service.”</p>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Nick subsequently found out that the course is sponsored by SPUR for a diploma to become a beautician. Our beloved PAP government has been spending taxpayers’ monies to sponsor these freelance PRC prostitutes for “upgrading”. </em></p>
              <p>Nick stripped to his birthday suit and the massage session began.</p>
              <p><strong>Nick:</strong></p>
              <p>“Where are you from, first time here?”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“China, have been here for a few months already.”</p>
              <p><strong>Nick:</strong></p>
              <p>“Which part of China?”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“<span id="result_box"><span style="background-color: #fff;" title="jiangxi">æ±Ÿè¥¿ (</span></span>Jiangxi province), heard of it before?”</p>
              <p><strong>Nick:</strong></p>
              <p>“Not really, how many years have you been in Singapore?”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“Five years already.”</p>
              <p><strong>Nick:</strong></p>
              <p>“PR already?”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“Yeah, worked as a factory worker in the first year, my company helped me applied for Singapore PR.”</p>
              <p><strong>Nick:</strong></p>
              <p>“so fast?”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“Got my PR within six months. It is very easy to get, some of my colleagues got theirs in two months only. Just fill up the application form and our company will do the rest for us.”</p>
              <p><strong>Nick:</strong></p>
              <p>“So what did you do later?”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“Providing special massage? haha…”</p>
              <p><strong>Nick:</strong></p>
              <p>“Not thinking of going back to China?”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“Must earn money first. Not easy in China nowadays, I earned only RMB2,000 back home as a beautician, can earn more here. Why, you thinking of “åŒ…” me?” (åŒ… = to be mistress)</p>
              <p><strong>Nick:</strong></p>
              <p>“Haha….I am too poor to “åŒ…” you.”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“So……do you want to try my<strong> </strong><span id="result_box"><span style="background-color: #fff;" title="special service"><strong>ç‰¹åˆ«æœ�åŠ¡</strong> (</span></span>special service)? (hands moving down to massage Nick’s crotch)”</p>
              <p><strong>Nick (acting blurred):</strong></p>
              <p>“Oh…what special service?”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“è®¨åŽŒ (naughty), you are not the first time here, don’t pretend!”</p>
              <p><strong>Nick:</strong></p>
              <p>“If you don’t tell me, how I know?”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“Standard - <span id="result_box"><span style="background-color: #fff;" title="beat aeroplane"><strong>æ‰“é£žæœº</strong></span></span> (”beat aeroplane”) – $50, <span id="result_box"><span style="background-color: #fff;" title="blow flute"><strong>å�¹ç¬›</strong></span></span>(”blow flute”) – $70,  <span id="result_box"><span style="background-color: #fff;" title="whole body service"><strong>å…¨èº«æœ�åŠ¡</strong> (</span></span>whole body service) – $100″</p>
              <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>These are terms for some sexual services. Readers who are interested to know what they mean exactly are advised to find out more themselves on the internet.</em></p>
              <p><strong>Nick:</strong></p>
              <p>“Hmmm….a bit ex, let me consider.”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“Ahh…don’t be like this, since you are here already, æ�¥çˆ½ä¸€çˆ½, I will make you happy, you are my first customer of the day.”</p>
              <p><strong>Nick:</strong></p>
              <p>“Inclusive of massage?”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“Massage is $30 goes to the boss, I earn only through the special service. Try my whole body package, everything included, guarantee you will be extremely satisfied!”</p>
              <p><strong>Nick:</strong></p>
              <p>“hmm…..didn’t bring enough money.”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“Don’t bluff me, how  much money do you have now in your wallet?”</p>
              <p><strong>Nick:</strong></p>
              <p>“$100 only, not enough for the whole body package.”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“Then try my blowing skills, æ�¥å•¦! time is running out, “happy times” are precious, don’t waste it, you are not short of money anyway right.”</p>
              <p><strong>Nick:</strong></p>
              <p>“You have å¥— (cap)?”</p>
              <p><strong>Jiang Mei:</strong></p>
              <p>“Of course! (strips!)”</p>
              <p><strong>END OF CONVERSATION</strong></p>
              <p>The above dialogue between Nick and Jiang Mei is REAL and is published here NOT to promote any promiscuous activities but simply to <strong>DEBUNK the PAP’s blatant LIES that it has been STRICT on immigration</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>Is there any other country in the world which gives PRs to prostitutes? </strong>And somemore Singapore taxpayers have to sponsor them for “upgrading”! The PAP is indeed making a fool out of itself and making Singapore a laughing stock in the eyes of the world.</p>
              <p>In a recent interview with the National Geographic magazine, PAP strongman Lee Kuan Yew said that <strong>it is a “good thing” that Singapore has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants (from mainland China) as they are more “hard-driving” and “hard-striving” than locals.</strong></p>
              <p>He forgot to add that new immigrants like Jiang Mei are more “hard-thrusting” too. (no pun intended)</p>

              <p>I agreed that singapore immigration should do a better screen thru before admitting a person into PR status and also CET or WDA should step up to identify potential PRCs for training. However having said that, pros are also human, can't they be trained to change, be good, be educated to turn over a new leaf??</p>
              <p>First and foremost, with a deterioting birthrate and aging population here, tell me, what are you going to do?? are you going to let we, the younger ones suffer later with shortage of manpower leading to economy collapse and back to village houses again or are you responsible adults who knows how to make a better future for the youngs/decendent of yours, just like what your forefather in the earlier years did to let you be what you are today??? so today, you are going to stop people migrating here and end up your younger generation getting poorer and poorer??</p>

              <p><br>I agreed that the govt had been wrong in pumping peoples in at a fast pace, fail to do a proper screening and failed to filter out the bad ones prematurely. But we still needs foreigners to help us, infact in the earlier industrialisation, we are already shortage of manpower, and we took in Malaysian to helps us, mostly chinese and indian malaysians, because at that space of time, our situation cannot much attract other foreigners or talents, so malaysians become our Traditional source, they raided the wave of prosperity with us. But as we expand, we needs more people to help us, and it is of our good country blessing that provide a better image to attract peoples, we have to do it fast, with a low birthrate of 20 to 30k local babies being born comparing to 60s, 100k babies and 70s to 80s, 65k babies, we are in bad shape if we dun attract immigrant in, and with those in the 50s and 60s going older, our population will slowly downsize. Do you have an answer to it??</p>
              <p>Please, everyone hv their opinon and the right to be here, calling your mama mod is like a crying baby.</p>

              <p>The PAP has always defended its much maligned immigration policies on the grounds that Singapore needs to compete with other countries for talents in an increasing globalized world.</p>
              <p>Immigrant nations such as United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada are often quoted as examples for Singapore to emulate.</p>
              <p>The common argument is that these countries have grown and prospered largely as a result of maintaining an open-door policy to immigrants and that Singapore will lose out if it does not follow suit.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>There is a clear difference between growing one’s population via immigration and replacing one’s native population by importation</strong></span> which the PAP seems unable or unwilling to understand.</p>
              <p>Let us compare the PAP’s immigration policy with that of the United States and Australia.</p>
              <p>Though the United States and Australia have been accepting immigrants from Europe, Asia and elsewhere over the years, they have not lost their core national characteristic: they are mainly white protestant societies with English as their lingua franca.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, foreigners constitute only 12 percent of United States’ population and 25 pecent of Australia’s according to their census last year.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Foreigners now constitute 36 percent of Singapore’s population.</strong></span> The exact percentage of citizens born overseas remains a mystery. It will not be a surprise if more than 40 percent of the people living in Singapore now are born overseas.</p>
              <p>With such a significant proportion of foreigners in Singapore,<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong> it is inevitable that Singaporeans are finding themselves strangers in their own countries which is exacerbated by the island’s small size.</strong></span></p>
              <p>United States and Australia both have large landmass to accommodate immigrants from all over the world as they are sufficient localities for them to congregate without disturbing the racial composition on a national scale.</p>
              <p>For example, Melbourne itself has suburbs for the Vietnamese, Malaysians and Koreans, but the rest of the city remains largely white.</p>
              <p>While the United States is cosmopolitan in major cities like New York and Los Angeles, it retains its defining national traits in the mid-western and central states such as Utah, Colorado and Nevada.</p>
              <p>This is not possible in Singapore simply because we are too small and when too many people are crammed together in a constrained space, the demographic changes will become none the more obvious.</p>
              <p>As English is a common language used by the three major races in Singapore, common sense dictates that the immigrants should have some basic command of the language in order to interact with native Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>In fact, prospective migrants have to pass an international English test such as IELTS before they can work in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
              <p>Over the years, Singapore has accepted many China immigrants who cannot speak the English language at all. How can we hope to integrate them into the rest of society?</p>
              <p>Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said in a NUS ministerial forum last week that there are so many foreigners in Singapore lately “simply that there are many more people who want to live and work here.” (Straits Times, 6 April 2010)</p>
              <p>He cannot be more wrong.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>First class world talents are not flocking to take up Singapore citizenship. It is Singapore who is giving out its citizenships like toilet papers to undeserving foreigners who cannot make it in their own countries.</strong></span></p>
              <p>In a Gallup poll done in July last year among college students in China, their top three emigration destinations are United States, South Korea and France. Singapore is not even featured in the top three despite the cosy ties it enjoys with China.</p>
              <p>What we are getting are economic migrants from China and not their top brains which is hardly surprising.</p>
              <p>Top-notch global talents move for various reasons such as a higher quality of life, better career opportunities and political liberties. Economic considerations are of less importance.</p>
              <p>Singapore is definitely not an ideal place for immigrants to settle in judging from its dismal ranking of 70th on the quality of life scale conducted yearly by respected Irish magazine Living International.</p>
              <p>The Economist Unit ranked Singapore as the 53th best place in the world to live in, way behind Australia, Canada and New Zealand.</p>
              <p>In the 1990s, Singapore has seen an influx of immigrants from Taiwan and Hong Kong especially before the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, but the flow of migrants has dried up from these two places now, prompting the PAP to turn its sight to China instead.</p>
              <p>Based on anecdotal evidence, the Taiwanese, Hong Kongers as well as mainland Chinese from the affluent cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou preferred to emigrate to Australia, Canada and New Zealand rather than Singapore.</p>
              <p>There are hardly any China nationals from Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai in Singapore compared to the large number of non-English speaking immigrants from the poorer inland provinces like Henan, Hubei, Liaoning and Shanxi.</p>
              <p>Australia and New Zealand have strict labor laws which restrict the inflow of foreign migrant workers to only sectors where there is a chronic shortage of native workers.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Due to Singapore’s inability to attract first world talents to its shores, the PAP has no choice but to open the floodgates to second class and even third class foreigners who are struggling to make a living back home.</strong></span></p>
              <p>These foreigners are allowed to come to Singapore on work, S, E and EPEC passes to find work after which they are invited to take up Singapore PR and eventually citizenship.</p>
              <p>The ridiculous part is there is no minimal period of residency required unlike in other developed countries.</p>
              <p>Foreigners are able to obtain Singapore PRs in as short a period as two months and citizenship within a year.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Home Affairs Ministry admitted that two out of every three PR applicants are successful some of whom are construction workers, masseurs, cleaners and even freelance prostitutes.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Does the PAP consider these new immigrants as “talents” too?</p>
              <p>To put it bluntly, the PAP has no immigration policy to speak of. It is basically taking the easy way out by opening the floodgates to foreigners without any proper screening or control.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are already feeling the negative repercussions of the PAP’s recklessness: they have to compete with foreigners for jobs, the place is becoming more congested and certain parts of Singapore resemble more like China and India.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>A recent Wall Street Journal editorial revealed that the relentless influx of foreigners into Singapore has depressed the wages of ordinary Singaporeans, increased the cost of living and led to an overall decline in the standard of living.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The Labor Report 2009 released by the Manpower Ministry shows that the real earnings of Singaporeans has decreased by as much as 8.2 percent last year even as inflation rate continues to increase.</p>
              <p>No governments in any democratic states in the world will survive such a disastrous, ill-conceived and misguided policy to increase population by mass relocating and importing foreigners from elsewhere at the expense of the natives.</p>
              <p>Only in a one-party totalitarian state like Singapore can the ruling party afford to cling on to power and still earns millions of dollars in salaries in spite of the damage it has done.</p>
              <p>In fact, PAP ministers are expected to receive a hefty 8.8 percent pay hike this year when the rest of Singapore is suffering from their economic mismanagement of the nation.</p>
              <p>What has the PAP ministers done to deserve a pay rise? On the contrary, they should have their pay cut by 90 percent for their abject failure to uplift the lives of ordinary Singaporeans! </p>
              <p>It is high time that Singaporeans exercise their rights as citizens of Singapore by voting the pro-foreigner PAP or FAP (Foreigner Action Party) out of office. We are voting for a government to take care of our interests first and NOT the foreigners!</p>

              <p>What screw up??? You know the laws or not???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember Prositution in Singapore is not an offence, only soliciting is an offence, the interpretation here is any kind of soliciting is consider an offence, meaning on the public, even peoples asking you to buy durian or cheap underwears etc etc is an offence, however once you are in the store and start buying, it is no more an offence, many peoples do not realize this rule.</p>
              <p>If you look at geyland or my place in joo chiat, we are doing the soliciiting??? the local pimps or the mamasan or some desperate bosses who had brought gals from overseas on social pass and is desperate to recover their expenses in bringing them in. The Gals are just doing prosituition, the police cannot charge them anything, just ask some question and release them. And some of this police men even end up having sex affair with them in return for protection.</p>
              <p>IT is those looking afraid and do not know the laws are send home, but the chinese pros are clever pros ya. Me go ICA take my gals back many times liao...but i send them back myself, because they are suppose to work in my pub only, but during daytime, some of them go out and do some extra income, which violate our rules and regulations of Angel's Pubs </p>
