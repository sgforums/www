Further more, he is an opposition figure, not some ah pek ranting at the kopitiam while drinking his morning coffee, so just like any other politicians, incumbent or otherwise, he should expect to be held accountable to a different standards than a member of the general public<br><br>In anycase, no one here is getting dragged off in the middle of the night for being in the opposition, isn't not like "big brother" is watching us ... (heck, just look at some of the posts on this forum) ... chaps in the opposition who harbour delusions of "martyrdom" and "granduer" are kidding themselves ... and alienating the voters in my opinion .... they are certainly no "Ghandis" ... I said it before in another post and I say it again, a certain decorum must always exist in politics, to prevent a slide into sensationalism and a scandal driven, cheap shots ridden political circus ....

People do not only sue because the other party has acted illegally (though in Singapore, legality can be a very nuanced and uncertain concept). People sometimes use law suits as a tactic.<br><br>One, defamation trials can be very very expensive to defend because ofthen there are many complex technical and evidentiary issues to deal with. To illustrate, England's longest trial, lasting about TEN years, was a defamation trial. Look up "McLibel".<br><br>Two, the damages awarded in Singapore fro defamation is, imo, out of all proportion to whatever harm the words concerned has caused. Look up mr Tang's case.<br><br>So the fact that someone has decided to sue does not neccessarily mean that he thinks he has a good case. It could mean that he thinks he can scare the other party into submission because maybe he has more resources to throw around.<br><br>Further, you seem to confuse having a good cause of action as somehow meaining that he is 'right' to sue. Surely you cannot be so naive? Again, I would suggest you look up Mr tang's case.<br><br>TBH, I am not surprised that LKY is still up to his nonsense.</div>

This seems very much like defamation to me. You are in Singapore aren't you?<br><br>But I agree with you to an extent Re the opposition. The problem with the opposition, imo is that there is simply not enough of them around. Those that are around seem to have a very socialist ideal. But, of course, the lack of variety here is, imo, due to the Singapore government and the judiciary. The soln to that is to vote more opposition members in, and bring some accountability to government. Remember, it is almost imnpossible for the opposition to take power in this elections. So this election isn't really about deciding who will form a government.<br><br>By putting more oppotion into parliament, what will happen is that the seeds of a vibrant, political scene where voters have a realistic choice will be planted. parliament will become an altogether healthier institution where tough questions and issues are raised and there is thorough debate before any important decisions are made. I think that is worth voting for.</div>

You seem to imply that he has been found guilty of lieing about PAP leaders in a criminal trial, that is, Beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>I thought, and I might be wrong so correct me If iam wrong, he was merely 'proved' to have lied in a civil court where the burden of proof is merely on the balance of probabilites! Again, a lesser man might take offence and decide that you have harmed his reputation and hence, defamed him.<br><br>In any case, that seems irrelevent really. The Sting here is the implication that he is lying in this instance.</div>

I read it on the SDP newspaper and was amazed that I could not find anything defamatory at all in the articles regarding NKF and there was almost no mention of Lee Kuan yew except for 1 sentence and zero mention of Lee hsien Loong so how could these 2 have been defamed...?????Really ridiculous.<br><br>You can also read these 2 articles at this USA website:<br><a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages" rel="nofollow">http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages </a>Check under the coffee shop talk under the topic:the NKF articles defamatory</span></span>????<br><br>_________________<br>LEARN ABOUT THE EVILS OF FEMINISM AT :<br><br><a href="http://www.angryharry.com&lt;br%20/&gt;&lt;br%20/&gt;http://www.hisside.com/&lt;br%20/&gt;&lt;br%20/&gt;http://www.mens-network.org/" rel="nofollow">www.angryharry.com<br><br>http://www.hisside.com/<br><br>http://www.mens-network.org/ </a>[http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: green;">In the end I came to the conclusion that perhaps the Pap just want to put Chee in a bad light so they say they want to sue him for this and for that but in the end after reading it myself,my impression of Chee Soon Juan instead improved dramatically .All that he said in the articles were what many of us Singaporeans had wanted to ask the Pap and they were matters of public interest.And the fact that the pap so desperately wanted to stop him from speaking up and even told people not to pass around the newspapers to others after reading just show how frightened the pap is about Singaporeans reading the article.If the Pap has done nothing wrong then they should not get excited or frightened but just let the people read what they ought to read.Don't censor.This is a matter of great public concern</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: brown;">I believe most Singapore citizens like the SDP want the Pap to be transparent and to keep them informed of matters directly affecting them and their future and so they want the Pap to:<br><br>1)Tell us how the Government investment Corporation uses our savings for investment<br><br>2)Disclose the details regarding the costs and profits of building HDB flats and how the profits are being used.<br><br>3)Disclose the salaries of the top executives of Temasek Holdings and other GLCs.<br><br>4)Declare the assets and incomes of all the Ministers.<br><br>5)Reform the election system to ensure it is free and fair.<br><br>All these are very reasonable and fair questions.If the pap is frightened by such questions and resort to sueing for defamation it means that something is really wrong so please, for the good of the nation stop all these nonsense defamation suits and answer to the people</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;">See the parallels or similarities between Durai's initial lawsuits against the 2 ex-employees of NKF and this new pap lawsuit against the SDP.<br>In the NKF cases, the ex employees of NKF both lost because they were denied access to information and evidence, not because they were wrong. They were eventually proved right. In fact they did not even lose but just settled out of court due to lack of financial resources.<br><br>Durai was able to win due to a lack of transparency and accountability which prevented access to information and also because of his strong financial strength..<br><br>Durai also employed the tactics of silencing and intimidation through defamation lawsuits.And now we see the Pap doing exactly the same thing as Durai,ie using defamation lawsuits to try to silence the opposition.<br><br>Clearly, justice was denied in the NKF case due to the lack of transparency and accountability. Without this, how can the public be sure that the suing party is right even if they win in court?<br><br>A victory in court doesn't imply that the truth and justice has prevailed. Only transparency and accountability can do that.<br><br>And how does the SDP get the evidence when the accounts of Temasek are so secretive and evasive...????????Why does the pap not open the account book of Temasek wide open to prove that there are really no hanky panky...??????Why so afraid....?????Who is playing the cat and mouse game here in this case..???????And by the way,the SDP did not say that Temasek is corrupted but they only ask that the Pap be more transparent regarding the accounts of Temasek so as not to follow the bad example of NKF.Anything wrong with that request...???</span></span></div>
