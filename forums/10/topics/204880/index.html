Also, people with more money in their pockets spent more, so that boosted GST and other revenue.<br><br>The jump in overall tax revenue was a handsome 15.8 per cent or $1.42 billion over the first half of last year.<br><br>This came as last year's robust 6.4 per cent economic expansion spill over into this year's tax revenues - and the red-hot 9.4 per cent economic growth in the first half of this year spurred things on even faster, say economists.<br><br>And as this surge in tax revenue is projected to continue, with the amount collected by Iras set to exceed $20 billion for this year.<br><br>Economists note that the 15.8 per cent surge in the taxman's collection in the first half is more than double the 6.8 per cent increase last year over 2004's collections.<br><br>And the $1.42 billion increase in money collected as taxes in first half of this year exceeds even the $1.25 billion rise posted for all of last year over the previous year.<br><br>Looked at another way, Iras' projected $20 billion revenue this year will mean a near doubling of its collections over the past 13 years. Last year's total amounted to $19.2 billion.<br><br>Iras is the state's most important money collection agency as it contributes 65 cents of every dollar that goes into the Treasury as government operating revenue every year.<br><br>As usual, income tax was the big money spinner, with collections shooting up by $650 million from a year earlier to hit $5.79 billion.<br><br>Rising incomes are in fact a double bonanza for the taxman as people with more money in their pockets tend to spend more.<br><br>As a result of the feel-good-economic factor, GST collections shot up nearly 25 per cent in the first half, adding a cool $400 million.<br><br>This took GST revenue past the $2 billion mark at half-time.<br><br>The conomic buoyancy also resulted in a spurt in property and stock market activity, bringing further cheer to the taxman.<br><br>Stamp duty collections shot up 63 per cent, bringing in an additional $233 million to Revenue House, the Iras headquarters.<br><br>Property tax collections rose 12.6 per cent, moving past the $1 billion mark at half-time for the first time.<br><br>Duties on private lotteries rose 5 per cent, while betting duties fell 3 per cent.<br><br>Even the dead did their bit for the nation in their final act. Estate duty, though a small contributor overall, rose 50 per cent.<br><br>Estate duty, payable on the assets left behind by the dead, is currently being reviewed by the Ministry of Finance.

How do they cope ?<br><br>The repeated stories of abandoned old folks, who languish alone in their old age is the sad evidence of the struggles that the less fortunate Singapore families are actually facing to make ends meet.<br><br>Abandoning their love ones was a difficult option, or voluntarily leaving the family - so as not to be a burden - is the only choice left.<br><br>What has the Government done to alleviate this known social problem in Singapore that has been existing since Singapore's independence ?<br><br>The Government response has been largely hands-off, only giving on the basis of a <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"dollar-for-dollar"</strong></span> support to any charity raised from the public.<br><br>Unfortunately, for every dollar accumulated from charity, going by the exposed NKF computation, 40 cents from every dollar is spent on the cost of raising the charity.<br><br>In actual fact this cost of 40 cents is even higher, if we see that the other half of the accumulated charity was cost-free as it was a direct contribution from the government <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"dollar-for-dollar"</strong></span> funding.<br><br>The amount that actually serves the charity is far less then the total contributed by Singaporeans and the Government, as costs becomes a serious factor when based on high cost infrastructure caused by indirect Government imposed costs - and the vicious cycle continues, with the Government being the main beneficiary.<br><br>With such huge tax surplus, the Government should have a direct responsibility of meeting its obligations to Singaporeans, especially in providing more attention to medical costs and quality of life during old age.<br><br>Unfortunately, the Government has declined this responsibility.<br><br>Although Singaporeans pay lower Income Tax than Sweden, the actual amount collected by the Singapore Government is far larger than the Swedish Government - considering that Sweden has a larger population of NINE MILLION and an advanced economy.<br><br>For Year 2005, <a href="http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:e31AlIv04NwJ:www.sweden.gov.se/content/1/c6/06/38/81/b5dd0621.pdf+sweden+annual+tax+revenue&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-style: italic;">Sweden Budget Report</span></a> reflected a total Tax Revenue of SEK15 Billion - at an exchange rate of SEK 1.00 to S$0.35 - this amount to S$5.25 Billion.<br><br>In Year 2005, (see opening post), Singapore had collected S$6.786 Billion only from Income Tax and GST collections.<br><br>Yet, Sweden provides for her Swedish Citizen from cradle to grave.<br><br>Are we asking for such similar treatment ?<br><br>Hardly, we are asking for the Government to be less greedy - in sucking every cent from the pockets of Singaporeans - (when we cannot even afford to have wallets).<br><br>As far as is known, any unused surplus will be transferred to the GIC, who will disburse it to Temasek Holdings, and both will merrily invest in all local and overseas projects that sucks up our funds; and with returns that boost the National Reserves further - and paying themselves the <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Million Dollar Annual Ministerial Salaries</strong></span>, while Singaporeans are left with the <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"crumbs from the table"</strong></span>.<br><br></span><br><br></div>
