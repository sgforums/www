            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like it is always good to read from various sources. From littlespeck:<br><br>SIA<br>Half full or half empty<br>ST proves there are different ways to present a story. By Seah Chiang New.<br>Feb 4, 2006<br><br>Singapore Airlines has just announced its latest quarter result, and the foreign media covers it as follows: -<br><br>Bloomberg<br>Singapore Airlines' 3rd-Qtr Profit Falls 15% on Fuel<br>Singapore Airlines Ltd., the world's second-largest carrier by market value, said profit fell for a fourth straight quarter because of an increase in fuel prices.<br>Net income dropped 15 percent to S$397 million ($243 million), or 32.5 cents a share, in the third quarter ended Dec 31, from a restated S$465 million, or 38.1 cents a share, a year earlier, Singapore Airlines said todayÂ…<br>Chief Executive Chew Choon Seng, whose term has been extended for three more years, raised surcharges and hedged the airline's oil needs to protect it from a 25 percent rise in the price of jet fuel, its single-biggest expense.<br>The carrier, which has been cutting costs, faces competition by Emirates, Qantas Airways Ltd. and budget airlines including AirAsia Bhd.<br><br>Dow Jones<br>Singapore Airlines Ltd Thursday said high fuel costs offset rising revenue for a 14.6% decline in net profit for the fiscal third quarter.<br>SIA, the world's second biggest airline by market capitalisation after US discount carrier Southwest Airlines, recorded net profit of S$396.6 million for the three months ended Dec 31, compared with S$464.6 million a year earlier.<br>Revenue rose 11.1% to S$3.56 billion from S$3.2 billion a year earlier, on strong passenger traffic during the year-end holiday period.<br>But increases in expenditure, due mostly to a sharp rise in jet fuel prices, outpaced revenue growth. Expenditure in the third quarter grew 14.1% to S$3.18 billion from S$2.79 billion a year earlier.<br><br>But the Strait Times angles it quite differently: -<br><br>Feb 3, 2006<br>SIA soars on the back of record 4 billion passengers<br>Quarterly results beat expectations, despite sky-high jet fuel prices<br>SINGAPORE Airlines (SIA) has soared above market expectations with its latest quarterly profit results.<br>The airline also carried a record number of 4.36 billion passengers and posted its highest ever turnover for any quarter in the three months to Dec 31 last year, its financial third quarter.<br>This strong showing by one of Singapore's most important blue chip companies came despite jet fuel prices hitting sky-high levels.<br><br>Then finally on the 5th paragraph, the crux emerges...<br><br>Â“These fuel prices dramatically increased SIA's costs, dragging net profits down by 14.6 per cent to $397 million compared to the same period a year earlier, its fourth straight quarterly fall.Â”<br><br>The contrast between the foreign and local coverage is quite stark. What are holders of SIA shares to make of it? Are the results are good or bad.<br><br>Is the paper trying to paper the quarter profit decline behind a Â“RA..RA..Â” angle? Sure looks that way!<br><br>Nothing wrong in the ST report, but it has to be careful not to come across as a newspaper that reports only the good and avoids Â– or plays down Â– the bad.<br><br>ItÂ’s important for the media to hold or regain credibility of its readers, without which it cannot help sweeten the ground for the government.<br><br>About the time another Straits Times headline proclaimed, Â“Jobless rate down to 2.5% - the lowest in four year.Â”<br><br>If readers believe this, then well and good, if not, theyÂ’ll start looking for Bloomberg and Dow Jones versions to find out what they may have missed.</div>
