            <div class='col-md body'>hmm not sure abt other countries, but for australia you will need to complete ur degree b4 you can apply for PR. but currently, the requirement for PR is pretty high, for example, engineering cannot qualify for PR automatically. And it hard to find a job in Australia if you are not a PR. Those friends of mine are jobless while waiting for their PR to be approved. So they can only do part time or shake leg at home  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>So it best to check out what the rules are in ur final semester becos PR regulation always change, at least for Australia  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it shouldn't be a problem. As long as you DO NOT take up the CITIZENSHIP of that country because it is an offence to any Singaporean to hold dual nationality. But i suppose you can apply for the Citizenship of that country and keep it a secret. Singapore does not tolerate dual nationality because of the NS issue and to me that is a shame. If a person loves Singapore, i am sure he would stay on and fight for Singapore even though he might have other Citizenship(s)... If he doesnt love Singapore, no matter how you force him to serve NS and fight for Singapore, he wouldnt do it whole-heartedly...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it is not about serving NS whole-heartedly. the point is national defense is crucial and given our small population, singapore lacks the manpower to have sufficient regular defense force. it is a matter of "need", not "want".<br><br>What's wrong if a Singaporean apply for an overseas citizenship? Singapore's stand against dual-citizenship merely means the Singaporen must drop his Singaporean citizenship if his application for an overseas citizenship is approved.</div>
