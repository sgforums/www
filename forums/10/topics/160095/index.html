You turn to your CPF only to be told that you need to wait till your medical condition worsens and you are unable to be employed because of it, only then are you allowed a certain amount of your money to pay for your medical condition/s. Otherwise, wait till you're 62 years old to be entitled to a monthly sum of about $300.<br><br>What or how will you feel?<br><br></div>

WHY?<br><br>like the thread starter said we slogged all our lives but what do we get.  just do the calculation.<br><br>the minimum sum is $120000.  the amount you can get at age 55 is your total cpf minus $120000.  how high can that be? (unless you make a lot and dont buy a HDB flat) and they will allow you to withdraw $762 per month at age 62 onwards.<br><br>knn, the worst thing is i might not even live to that age.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually CPF was doing well up to 1980s. Many could have retired comfortably but sad, but true, the government in order to push up their own land banks finally let people use CPF to buy property and invest in shares to get better values.<br><br>From that year when government allowed people to use CPF to buy property and shares till today, people have lost billions. Their property prices today are at 60% of their original purchase price not to mention the high interest charges paid.<br><br>They now are struggling for a living by working in all kinds of odd jobs to pay for their outstanding mortgages.<br><br>However our leaders will not admit such mistakes and are seen to be trying to say that they have been successful in building so many flats etc.<br><br>The greatest failure so far of the government is the so-called asset-enhancement policies and what not. Now they will talk about GDP and Temasek overseas investments to avoid the subject of property disasters in Singapore.<br><br>That is why CPF is another NKF where problems will be denied until disasters strike.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when has our govt ever used the reserves to help us in times of need.  what is the purpose of temasek holdings and its investment arm?  i always see reports saying that we have a hell lot of reserves.  but what good are the reserves when it is not used at all to help?<br><br>cpf cannot touch as explained in my earlier post.<br><br>contribution rates cut to attract investors due to poor economy.  but take donkey years to go back up, or wont go back to old rate anymore.  thus less cpf, equalling to less income.<br><br>high interest rate for housing loans.<br><br>less and less jobs.  have to tighten belt and accept lower paying job.  retrenchments. outsourcing and whatnot leading to more unemployment.<br><br>higher transport cost, utilities and whatnot.<br><br>all in all it is obvious.  people generally end up in more debts, less income, higher living cost and no job/job security.<br><br></div>

Since when has it ever been about helping the unwashed masses?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
