WHY?<br></div></blockquote>yes it is, WHY are they HOLDING onto OUR money? because it's $114.9 billion that's why. many people of the baby boomer age are retiring already and I believe their CPF totals up to 3 quarter of the $114.9 billion. That's a lot of money. Just imagine, within 3-5 years about $80 billion is withdrawn from the governments gold-lined coffers by ordinary citizens like you and me but older and possibly our parents - if they didn't implement this STUPID STUPID STUPID @#$@#$@#$@$ rule of Minimum SUM.<br><br>They will MAKE SURE that nobody touches that $80 billion, because they have claimed it as theirs. Even if you have a nominee, it goes into that Nominee's CPF right? thus the cycle of CPF continues to fund their great monetary adventures. As long as the word is CPF, that means it's no longer YOUR money. Remember that. CPF is now not superannuation - it's a deceiving sneaky form of "tax".<br><br>Now consider this - "tax" in Australia is used to pay of the nation's debt, help the elderly, benefits for the disabled, power the physical infrastructure, most of the time.<br><br>whereas in singapore govt "income" (many forms - ERP, CPF, Insurance, COE, car inspections, road tax, petrol tax, public transport price hikes, car tax (PARF), SP bill, Starhub bill (revenue goes to government somehow GLC), Singtel bill (compulsory phonebill), Education fees, Income tax, land tax, HDB conservancy fees, stamp duty, GST, TV &amp; radio licenses, parking fees, parking coupons), serves and helps nobody but themselves get richer and richer and richer, and a portion (not large portion but substantial amt because the pie is already so gigantic) goes to funding the military. Great isn't it?<br><br>I really hate it when I tell people about this and some idiots give me the ultimate bullshit about the how the Minimum Sum rule protects the old from spending the money too fast. They're just mouthing out words from their puny little brainwashed brains brainwashed by the media that only shows them blinded fools the "symptom" and not the true root of the issue - which again is really to protect that $80 billion from leaving the govt coffers in a period of 3-5 years. That's the TRUE reason everybody. listen, I'm not kidding you.<br></div>

Not too sure if that 4 % is a net or gross value - meaning 4% gain before expenses (salaries and other expenses) or 4% gain after netting off the expenses.<br><br>Whichever the case, as loyal and humble citizens, we must understand that today's economy is ever changing and hard to master. Thus it is already very impressive that our scholaristic, super intelligent leaders can squeeze 4% gain. Please give them more time (like 10 or 20 years), more money (like all our CPF) and double their salaries so that hopefully in the future, the gain can be 8%.</div>
