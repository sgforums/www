Only part of Sabah, specifically Sulu is the area in dispute (or more, which I don't know)<br><br>Singapore as an example, was taken by British in almost a similar situation. Singapore, at 1819, was part of the Johore Empire (Consist of Singapore, Mainland Johor, Pahang, Rhio-Lingga Islands). Because Johore Sultanate was originally under Bugis influence, in which under Dutch influence, in which recognised the passing Sultan of Johore's younger son, Tengku Abdul Rahman as the Sultan(but the eldest normally take the throne). The eldest was Hussein. Then blah, blah, blah (check your history books, quite complicated, no time to explain). Who became "Sultan of Singapore", the original Sultan Tengku Abdul Rahman headquatered at the Rhio-Lingga Islands, so he became Sultan of Rhio-Lingga. A Chief ruled Pahang, the Temenggong Abdul Rahman became Sultanm of Johor.<br><br>?????????????????????????????<br><br>Messy?<br><br>It is that screwed up.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
