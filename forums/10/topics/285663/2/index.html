Because his PR visa is on the passport of country B he is a citizen of . If the passport is revoked, every single visa on that passport becomes invalidated.

Then they give you an exit interview form to fill up. Whether or not you want to be politically correct in your answers or not is up to you.

It's not like we are treated like 1st class citizens here anyway.

Have you not heard of the many who emigrated and were treated like 2nd-class citizens?  Your question is best answered by defining what a second-class citizen is:<br>1) never fully accepted as the original son of soil<br>2) face social and employment prejudice and bias<br>3) treated as being in their adopted country bcos they can't make it in their own country, or compete with their fellow countrymen, or just want to enjoy the good things and privileges, or running away from .....<br><br>Of course, whether the above is experienced or not by an emmigrant is besides the point.

Nope. Some ang moh salesgirl prefer to serve me because I am asian - to them means more likely to buy things than browse.<br><br>1. I never expect to be accepted as the original son of the soil. I have a label of migrant on me. So what? It is a fact . Why should I be sensitive to it?<br><br>2. Face social and employment prejudice and bias - so far I heard insensitive remarks from individuals but as for employment , I got a skill and whether they want me or not is their problem.There is always a higher bidder out there in the job market for me. The employment prejudice is when you don't have a skill at all which is pretty much the same as Singapore and other parts of the world.<br><br>3. Your statement is laughable.  I do not expect to be treated as though I am born and bred in Australia because I am not.  The thing I hear about <span style="font-style: italic;">"cannot make it in Singapore"</span> are actually from Singaporeans which I blame the elitist system for encouraging that behaviour. The Australians  know that we can compete with them and asians tend to have the reputation of being very efficient in work related matters.<br><br>Let me tell you something funny when I was interviewed.<br>The Australian interviewer made a remark to me  " You asians are pretty good in math and statistics" .  I don't know but<strong> I got the job </strong>. After that , I find out that there are tons of asian statisticians around in my section. So tell me - is that bias or praise?</div>
