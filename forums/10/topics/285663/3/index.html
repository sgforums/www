Why is a Canadian so interested in SG?  I think few SGreans are interested in Canada unless they want to emigrate there!<br>Personally, I don't care a damn if anyone wants to emigrate to another country. They have legs and so can move. I think SG gahmen also doesn't stop anyone from emigrating. But once you emigrated - you are no longer SGrean and I will treat with like a foreigner who has little interest or no part to play in the future of SG.  The future of SG is for SGreans to decide even if some SGreans are less righteous than the foreign Canadian!</div>
