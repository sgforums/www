Allow me to clarify. I meant what was written, really. So, its not what you assume, that I apply for citizenship of the  PR country.  I meant drop your original default citizenship and continue being a PR in country of your PR , assuming you already a PR before you drop your citizenship. Hope this is not too cheem or confusing. How can this situation be? Why would anyone want to drop it? For instance, a person TT dulan liao and see no point continuing as citizen, and he is enjoying life in PR land and found a career and life there and needs all the cpf money.  Like this, he might want to drop it.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by reyes:<br><strong>2.
