            <div class='col-md body'>I'm disgusted by the manner in which the so called 'Budget Goodies" laid out by the prime minister in his 2006 Budget. My entire family will roughly be entitiled to $1500 among us family members. What is $1500 this days. It barely covers two months mortgage on our HDB flat and other endless bloody government expenses. None of the ministers or  MPs know what it is like to live in a 3 room flat. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  My dad brings home $1400 and we have to live on that. I graduated last year and still looking for job.<br><br>the government has thrown us a few pieces of meat to feast on and in return they want us to vote the freaking PAP government back. we dont owe the government a living u know.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> ministers and MPs have no idea what it feels like to be poor. I dont recall ever seeing my PAP MP of last 10 years at our door step asking how my family is coping financially and now the same MP wants us to vote him in. vote him back for what i ask? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

Ministers with their types of pay they will not play TOTO or buy 4D, so those 45% lowly paid workers will use the windfall to "tikam" much more, hoping that they will get more out of it and the money is back in the govt's coffer sooner than you thought! You have seen more Singapore Turf clubs and more TOTO 4D outlets in your vicinity lately as the economic downturn has rendered the govt more opportunity to make more money because more Singaporeans would want to try their luck!<br><br>To be frank, the ruling party is generous in giving everyone something to cerebrate, it is great that they provide those who work with some bonus incentives but they should look into why Singapore employers are still paying Singaporeans $200,$400, to $800 per month and they paid themselves 5-6 figured salary? Few Singaporeans could earn a peanut of $600,000 in their whole life time! This budget will bring some joy to those who know how to treasure it, and it may be short live to many! Whether it can prop up the retail sectors or not is something yet to be seen.<br><br>The govt should lower some utility charges for the general public instead of giving   subsidies every year! Just imagine Singaporeans are paying a series of taxes the minute they step down from his bed! Water has water conservancy tax, GST, and water borne fee! Do not tell Singaporeans that we have not enough water as of now, we are the educated lot and we have the eyes to see the potentials of our new reservoirs! That fear factor of the past that we need to import water is a thing of the past! May be we need time to pipe it from the many new reservoirs dotting the island. Singaporeans work hard to build the new  reservoirs and should enjoy the fruit of that clean and affordable water coming from our own reservoirs!<br><br></div>

Ministers with their types of pay they will not play TOTO or buy 4D, so those 45% lowly paid workers will use the windfall to "tikam" much more, hoping that they will get more out of it and the money is back in the govt's coffer sooner than you thought! You have seen more Singapore Turf clubs and more TOTO 4D outlets in your vicinity lately as the economic downturn has rendered the govt more opportunity to make more money because more Singaporeans would want to try their luck!<br></blockquote>Few billions no sweat? Peanuts you mean?<br><br><blockquote><br>To be frank, the ruling party is generous in giving everyone something to cerebrate, it is great that they provide those who work with some bonus incentives but they should look into why Singapore employers are still paying Singaporeans $200,$400, to $800 per month and they paid themselves 5-6 figured salary? Few Singaporeans could earn a peanut of $600,000 in their whole life time! This budget will bring some joy to those who know how to treasure it, and it may be short live to many! Whether it can prop up the retail sectors or not is something yet to be seen.  </blockquote>throwing out a billion will stimulate retail.<br><br><blockquote><br>The govt should lower some utility charges for the general public instead of giving   subsidies every year! Just imagine Singaporeans are paying a series of taxes the minute they step down from his bed! Water has water conservancy tax, GST, and water borne fee! Do not tell Singaporeans that we have not enough water as of now, we are the educated lot and we have the eyes to see the potentials of our new reservoirs! That fear factor of the past that we need to import water is a thing of the past! May be we need time to pipe it from the many new reservoirs dotting the island. Singaporeans work hard to build the new  reservoirs and should enjoy the fruit of that clean and affordable water coming from our own reservoirs!</blockquote>Water and electricity don't cost?
