            <div class='col-md body'>Just to share this with you this article, as we seldom get such critical analyses of Sgp politics in our local media. Malaysiakini is M'sia's most prominent internet-media-website that serves as a watchdog via-a-vis the govt-owned media.<br><br>THE SINGAPORE DILEMMA, by Josh Hong<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s Minister Mentor is at it again. Last week, Lee Kuan Yew reminded his people of the island stateÂ’s vulnerable position given the hostile elements within Malaysia and Indonesia. That he did so through Berita Harian, SingaporeÂ’s sole Malay daily, was telling.<br><br>Still, LeeÂ’s sharp comments came at a time when many honestly believed Singapore had made some significant progress in its relations with the two immediate neighbours.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has secured some diplomatic successes recently. Last April, Singapore conferred an honorary doctorate on Sultan Iskandar Ismail of Johor as a goodwill gesture. It signifies the PeopleÂ’s Action Party governmentÂ’s determination to maintain a cordial relationship with the southernmost state of West Malaysia.<br><br>One month later, the prime minister and his cabinet colleagues gave their blessings to the Iskandar Development Region (IDR) by agreeing to the formation of the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC), a consultative body, with their Malaysian counterparts. To avoid arousing unnecessary ill feelings, the Singapore leaders were shrewd enough to emphasise the consultative nature of the committee.<br><br>The IDR, a brainchild of Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, is now touted as an epitome of the strategic partnership between Malaysia and Singapore, and it is for the two governments to prove to other countries if it could be a positive response to the rise of China and India as regional economic powers breathing down AseanÂ’s neck.<br><br>Churlish sentiments<br><br>Unfortunately, sentiments among the Malays in Malaysia remain churlish. This is especially so when Abdullah is fighting an uphill battle to establish his own authority vis Ã  vis his charismatic predecessor. Those close to Dr Mahathir Mohamad have lost no time in cashing in on the issue, the latest being criticisms by Kadir Jasin that the JMC might have grave implications for MalaysiaÂ’s sovereignty.<br><br>It is not sure if the JMC has hit a snag. What is certain is Singapore is still awaiting an official notice from Malaysia.<br><br>Another diplomatic achievement of Prime Minister Lee seems more astounding.<br><br>Late May, the Indonesian government, after much contemplation, finally reached agreement on two areas where Jakarta would work closely with Singapore.<br><br>As far as Singapore is concerned, the signing of the landmark extradition treaty with Indonesia sends a clear message that the island state is ready to ditch the negative image of its being a safe haven for corrupt Indonesians, an impression that has stuck with the Muslim masses in Malaysia and Indonesia for years.<br><br>More important is the Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA), which is crucial to SingaporeÂ’s position as a middle power in the strategically vital Southeast Asia.<br><br>Malaysia closed its air space to SingaporeÂ’s Air Force in the late 1990s following a plethora of bilateral disputes, and the suspicious, almost paranoid, minds of Umno grassroots rule out any reopening for sometime to come.<br><br>As such, JakartaÂ’s willingness to sign the DCA in exchange for the extradition treaty is revealing.<br><br>Despite numerous assurances by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY), certain quarters within Indonesian society remain sceptical, who were weary that the presence of foreign troops could undermine Indonesia as an independent nation, and threaten its territorial integrity.<br><br>For instance, some retired army officers have expressed their reservations over the DCA and called on the House of Representatives Commission to reject it.<br><br>Close US ally<br><br>Needless to say, the fact that Singapore is a close ally of the United States in the region has not escaped the criticsÂ’ attention. Under a 1990 Memorandum of Understanding, Washington has access to Singapore military facilities, and the US Navy logistics unit was set up in Singapore in 1992 following the loss of Subic Bay Naval Station in the Philippines. Naval exchanges between Singapore and the US are among the most intense in the region.<br><br>Major General Benny Mandalika, a former military attachÃ© in the US, openly conjectured that Washington turned to Singapore for a military logistics depot after its failure to get one from Indonesia.<br><br>The signing of the DCA raises the eyebrow of the Indonesians also because SBY is well received by the Bush administration, which believes the US should give its full support to a president who Â“wants to do the right thingÂ” in the worldÂ’s largest Muslim country. With the DCA now a reality, some are worried the US will soon establish a strong foothold in Southeast Asia in addition to its existing military prowess.<br><br>The minister mentor, quite clearly, is not bemused by all these negative sentiments that continue to abound in both Malaysia and Singapore.<br><br>And this is precisely the dilemma of a small, prosperous state that happens to be in the Â“wrongÂ” corner of the world. On one hand, Singapore is determined more than ever to make the country global by forging close ties with major powers the world over, while seeking to convince its weary and jealous neighbours of its sense of destiny and solidarity with the region of Southeast Asia. No easy task indeed.<br><br>In light of all this, LeeÂ’s frustrations are only understandable. As he ages, Lee is also showing exasperations and strains that do not befit a statesman.<br><br>But again, didnÂ’t Lee himself once reveal that the Singapore leadership had been advised by some Malaysian politicians not to react to the fiery remarks that were merely for MalaysiaÂ’s domestic consumption?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I largely agree with the article, that S'pore foreign relations led by a 'Chinese' administration set amidst the Malay world is fraught with landmines. How can a tiny island of 4million, led by a hard-headed modern-day Chinese Mandarin, be friendly and at the same time firm with a bumiputra-policy-led neighbour to her north, and the largest Muslim-populated nation to the south? Perhaps that's why our armed forces gets an ever-increasing budget year on year.<br><br>I don't think our neighbours want us to kow-tow to them. I think they want us to acknowledge that we are an anomaly in the Malay world. I think above all, our neighbours want us to be humble, and treat our relationships with sensitivity. But with S'pore's wealth as a discarded nation who rose up from the ashes, S'pore is sometimes too quick to assert our independence (and economic success) in a rub-it-in-their-faces attitude.<br><br>Perhaps when our paramount Mandarin passes away, and the legacy of our recent past is somewhat severed, then perhaps our younger leaders can take their diplomatic cues from common sense and equality, rather than always walking around with a gigantic chip on their shoulders when dealing with our poorer neighbours.</div>

Malaysian and Indonesian alike - who are intolerant of the Chinese success that is projected beyond their national boundaries.<br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">'Politics of Envy'</span> has resulted in a hardening attitude that <span style="font-style: italic;">''what I do not possess, you should not; and if you have it, I shall limit your ability to use what you have''</span>.<br><br>This attitude can be seen from the purposeful restriction of air space that impose limits onto the Singapore Air Force; and also the various attempts to slow down our development to the extent of breaking established and negotiated contracts for water, sand and granite.<br><br>Singapore predominantly Chinese population has the characteristic energy and organisational skills to maximise capital and human resources to achieve success by leaps and bounds beyond the imagination of both Malaysia and Indonesia - leaving both bigger neighbors behind even when they have more human and natural resources.<br><br>Is the current resentment towards Singapore due to our <span style="font-style: italic;">'boorish'</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">'rub-it-in-their-faces attitude'</span> of our success onto Malaysia and Indonesia ?<br><br>I do not think that Singapore is capable of being so <span style="font-style: italic;">'unsophisticated'</span> - with the likes of capable <span style="font-style: italic;">'Singaporean Thinkers'</span>  to guide our foreign policies - personalities like Prof Tommy Koh, Prof Chan Heng Chee, Simon Tay, and some more others in the background.<br><br>The current status is largely due to the Malay politicians in both Malaysia and Indonesia with their individual agenda of gaining political mileage by using Singapore as a <span style="font-style: italic;">'Whipping Boy'</span>.<br><br>This mind set is perhaps a reflection of a deep rooted <span style="font-style: italic;">'inferiority complex'</span> after centuries of serving others more economically and industrially powerful and advance than the Malays.<br><br>It is not uncommon to have a Malaysian Malay or Indonesian Malay to sing praises of Singapore, when they are in Singapore on an all expense paid visit, but will sing a different tune on their return home.<br><br>Even if we do not judge their character on such superficial basis, we should at least judge their character in the manner that they conduct themselves with their own Electorate.<br><br>A snap shot of Malaysia's future hope in UMNO's Youth Leader - the current Education Minister Hishammuddin bin Tun Hussein Onn - will reveal the typical character of a Malay politician.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hishamuddin_Hussein" rel="nofollow">Hishammuddin Hussein</a> is the son of Malaysia's third Prime Minister <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.my/website/webdb.nsf/vALLDOC/012A9B7AB8D2695A48256D52001B0BE4" rel="nofollow">Tun Hussein Onn</a>, and the grandson of <a href="http://thecicak.com/?p=59" rel="nofollow">Onn Jaafar</a> - a founding member of UMNO.<br><br>With his illustrous line, he is seen as the future leader of Malaysia and being groomed as such. and had shown hopeful beginnings with well thought out political statements : </span><br><br><span style="color: darkgreen;"><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>''"Young leaders who make racial and religious statements to be popular with a particular community will not go far in a multiracial and multicultural Malaysia,"<br><br>"They must be far-sighted because when it is time for them to be selected as ministers or party presidents, they must not only be smart, they have to be wise too."<br><br>"The top leadership will not forget Â– and in a multiracial Malaysia the people will also not forget Â– those who have taken advantage to be popular for short-term gains,"<br><br>"Their future will be tainted, and that applies to all young leaders who have aspirations to be national leaders,"<br></span></blockquote></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">It was simply ironical that just as when Hishammuddin was seen in the light of his father - Tun Hussein Onn - as a fair and wise leader by the multi-ethnic Malaysians, he had to be embroiled by succumbing to the <span style="font-style: italic;">''rousing red-necked''</span> instigation of waving an <span style="font-style: italic;">''unsheathed kris''</span> as he spoke about <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketuanan_Melayu" rel="nofollow">''Ketuanan Melayu''</a></span> - or the <span style="font-style: italic;">''Rights of the Malays to be the Masters''</span>.<br><br>The waving of an unsheathed Malay knife - <span style="font-style: italic;">''the Kris''</span> - is a call to war, and it offended the other <span style="font-style: italic;">''non-Malay''</span> Malaysians, and is an ominous sign for their Country as well as for Singapore.<br><br>Hishammuddin Hussein will probably regret his <span style="font-style: italic;">'kris waving and Malay dominance antics'</span> that is totally against the spirit of moderation and racial harmony promoted by his grand-father and father.<br><br>In Indonesia, where the people can so easily succumb to wealth, and seemingly overlooked the political, economical, social and judicial transgressions of the likes of ex-President Suharto, his son Tommy Suharto and the entire family - what does it speak of the value system of the Indonesian politicians and citizens ?<br><br>Singapore has spent millions in support of Indonesia after the tsunami hit the communities on the west coast of Java, even when Indonesians were positive about this aid from the Little Red Dot.<br><br>It was revealing that <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2005/01/wwwh50119.htm" rel="nofollow">Malay nationalists in Indonesia and Malaysia</a> view it with scepticism and rejected it with false Malay nationalistic and religious pride.<br><br>How should Singapore conduct its business and relationship with Indonesia and Malaysia - given the mercurial nature of the Malay leadership in both of these Malay dominated countries ? </span><br><br></div>
