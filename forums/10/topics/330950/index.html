              <p><strong>Malaysia Detains Blogger For Alleged Sedition</strong></p>
              <p>KUALA LUMPUR: A Malaysian human rights group criticized the
              government Thursday (18 Sept) for detaining a well-known political
              blogger for alleged sedition after he posted a picture of the country's
              flag upside down and urged other online writers to do the same.</p>
              <p>Syed Azidi Syed Aziz, who runs the popular "Kickdefella" blog, was
              arrested Wednesday (17 Sept) at his home in northern Malaysia. He
              sparked a controversy last month when he marked his country's national
              day with an upside-down Malaysian flag as a form of protest against the
              government.</p>
              <p>Yap Swee Seng, director of local human rights group Suaram, said
              Syed Azidi's detention was "unjustifiable" and aimed to curtail dissent.</p>
              <p>"It's part of the attempt by the government to control the bloggers,
              to send warning signals to bloggers, to writers that they can face
              action if their statements or their views are threatening to the
              government," Yap said.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman who declined to be identified citing protocol
              declined to say when Syed Azidi would be charged. "It's still under
              investigation," he said.</p>
              <p>Sedition in Malaysia is punishable by up to three years in prison.</p>
              <p>Syed Azidi's arrest comes amid a climate of political uncertainty as
              a resurgent opposition threatens to take over a government weakened by
              dissent and dissatisfaction against Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad
              Badawi's leadership.</p>
              <p>Another political blogger, a journalist and an opposition politician
              were arrested last week under the Internal Security Act, a law that
              allows for indefinite detention without trial. The journalist was
              released a day later after widespread anger, including by the law
              minister, who resigned in protest.</p>
              <p>Last month, Abdullah said Syed Azidi should be investigated, and
              called his protest "a malicious act." But Syed Azidi said he would
              continue his campaign to highlight Malaysia's political and economic
              problems.</p>
              <p>The government has repeatedly accused bloggers of spreading false
              information and lies to incite hatred. Unlike the mainstream media,
              which is controlled by ruling political parties, bloggers often write
              highly critical, anti-government commentaries.</p>
              <p>Nathaniel Tan, a political blogger who has also been briefly
              detained in the past, wrote that the arrest was "an attempt to strike
              fear into the hearts of Malaysians who speak out. ... Enough is
              enough." <em>(By JULIA ZAPPEI/ AP)</em></p>

              <p>FORMER Singaporean lawyer Gopalan Nair was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>sentenced to three months </strong></span>jail on Wednesday after he was found guilty of insulting a High Court
                                      judge in a posting on his blog.</p>
              <p>Justice Kan Ting Chiu delivered his verdict after a seven-day hearing at the High court.</p>
              <p>Nair, 58, now an American citizen, asked for and was given three days to settle his affairs.</p>
              <p>He will present himself at the High Court at noon on Saturday to begin his sentence.</p>
              <p>He was charged with insulting Justice Belinda Ang in a blog
                                      posting on May 29. It was posted online shortly after he attended a
                                      three-day court hearing over which she had presided.</p>
              <p>That hearing was to assess damages in a defamation suit that
                                      Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew won
                                      against the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), its chief Chee Soon Juan
                                      and his sister Chee Siok Chin.</p>
              <p>Nair had, in his blog posting, written that 'the judge
                                      Belinda Ang was throughout prostituting herself during the entire
                                      proceedings, by being nothing more than an employee of Mr Lee Kuan Yew
                                      and his son and carrying out their orders.'</p>
              <p>Nair, who represented himself at the hearing and was charged
                                      under Section 228 of the Penal Code, declined to comment after the
                                      sentencing. He told reporters outside the court: 'I don't have anything
                                      to say.'</p>

Historical and current events are seen as steps in an on-going plot to rule the world primarily through a combination of political finance, social engineering, mind control, and fear-based propaganda.[1][2][3][4][5]</p></div>
