He projects a father figure. However, he is far too much of a nice guy to stand up to the government and wear his other hat of defending the national reserves. Ong Teng Cheong came up from the PAP but he has the guts to stand up to the government. He certainly took his job very seriously, which irritated the PAP...they wanted yes men for presidents. I choose Ong Teng Cheong as the better president although I really prefer Wee Kim Wee as a person.</div></blockquote>I agree with what u said and we can see clearly PAP doesn't really like Ong Teng Cheong..When he passed away, his funeral is not as grand as Wee Kim Wee one..But no matter what, this two ex president had done a good job for singaporeans and they will be stay in our hearts for a very long time..</div>
