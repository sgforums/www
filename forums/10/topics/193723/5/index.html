Look at USA now; you can't really say that USA is undergoing an economic crisis. Even less so for China. And yet, there are groups in both countries trying to push for radical change. HK wants self-government democratic-style; Taiwan wants independence. The anti-war lobby want an end to the war and the Open-Closet Movement is fighting for the legalization of gay-marriage; soem of them want to overturn the Supreme Court Justice board. China is a better example, of course... not to mention Egypt and Saudi Arabia.<br><br>2) Name-calling certainly shouldn't be done. Then, both sides call each otehr names. Even the government has its own collection of "nicknames" such as "the impetuous ones", "softies", "quitters", "Westernised anarchists" etc. So, teh government, being the paradigm of Singaporean civilization, should not resort to such name-calling either. That aside, believing in things is insufficient sometimes; you have to do certain things to achieve those goals. Getting the government to change its attitudes and open up is a slow process, especially for a government that has been entrenched in power for so long that it takes its precedents as a "mandate" and as an unbreakable law-code. Dr Tony Tan himself observed, on the Discovery Channel Documentary that "the danger is that after having such a successful model for so many years, the leadership is unwilling to remake it to suit new times." And this is worsened by teh our impressive economic growth record that simply blinds out other areas in which we haven't grown very well. We have had a lopsided development pattern. Most of the developed countries had their cultural flourishings before the Industrial Revolution in the 19th C. Britain had hers during the Elizabethan Era, France's was in the era bfore the Crusades. On the other hand, Singapore hasn't had much cultural flourishing despite the phenomenal growth. And matters are not improved by how our development rapidly erases old buildings from the landscape befroe they can even be gazetted for conservation; of coruse, I suppose, part of this is due to land shortage, bit still ... THe "good job" is only in economy; look beyond that and there isn't a very rosy picture. We are beginning to become like Japan, with its pehnomenal stress-rates and suicide-rates. We definitely need a supplied catalyst to bring about political change.<br><br>Crisis does not need to be economic. We are in a crisis indeed- a social crisis. Income gaps are widening, people are getting more stressed and depressed, what more evidence do we need? And worst of all, apathy rates are rising. Corruption? What does NKF tell you? WHy did our government choose to maintain that it was running deficits when all the while in the 1990s it had massive budget surpluses? Why are the government's salaries the only wages that tend to rise. Sure, it's not illegal, and that makes it ever more devious. The PAP also seems to be becoming far too interested to perform character assassinations. If it is so confident of its "strong mandate", why does it have to care about James Gomez? And notice the ST wording; they want to change their "image". THey are not looking to change the core functionings; they are just doing Real Politick. THere is no more sincerity left in the Party as an institution, even if there is in some of its members. The organization needs a bad whitewash, unfortunately its higher-level members are entranced by the ideals it suppsoedly possesses. This government has no more idealism left in reality; it is ruling by pure pragmatism.<br><br>the (increasingly despondent) pikamaster</div>
