Not all of us are ignorant about it, some of us do read up and are more well-informed about the state of things in this land than the others.<br><br>Sometimes, the biggest danger is apathy and ignorance. And the tactics and influence of certain group should be turfed out and dismissed by the common man asap, it's not getting us anywhere, and contributes in great deal to the silence and lack of real verve today.<br><br>There is no such thing as selective openness, only a false dream of superiority.</div>

Believe we can achieve that by the next 3 elections, yr 2021.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> by then LKY and probable GCT would be gone, at least from politics, LHL would be 69 and probable stepping down. It would be a different world.....<br><br>If we couldn't make any changes by 2026, with another election, and had not been able to migrate for good,  I don't want to talk politics anymore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>2050? if I could survive that long here, then this place is not that bad a place for me afterall. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
