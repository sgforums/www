As long as those executed received fair trials,  and before laws are changed for better control of traffickers and murderers, highest execution rate means there are more murderers and drug traffickers are prevented from commiting the crimes again. don't see anything reprehensible about that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Singapore scores highly on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index: it is ranked No. 5 of 158 countries. The Global Competitiveness Report ranks Singapore No. 6 of 117 economies.<br><br>The Government likes to broadcast these figures. But it doesn't broadcast that it executes more people per head a year than almost anywhere else. Reporters Without Borders has Singapore No. 140 of 167 countries for media freedom.</span><br><br>if such figures are widely broadcasts, the people would be inclined to go online to search for a second opinion, instead of relying on the papers. The govenment would never allow that to happen.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;">Increasingly, people around the world are beginning to laugh at Singapore</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">; they laugh at its Government's petty and self-serving restrictions on what people can and cannot do. But in Singapore, many people are unaware of this because the government-controlled media feed them a diet of only good news stories.</span><br><br>I cannot agree more with this paragraph. An example. Whenever we make a good investment, or GDP rises, it never fails to hit the headlines. When projects such as the suzhou investment fails, whatever reports on it, if any, is restricted to a small section in the newspapers.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Race relations are often used as an excuse for restrictions. But Singapore has one of the most homogeneous race profiles in the world: 77 per cent are Chinese, the rest comprise Malays and Indians. Singapore does not have the racial complexities of many countries.</span><br><br>this is just one example on the excuses the govt gives. Another example. PM Lee mentioned during the election campaign that having opposition in parliment would decrease its efficiency as he had to spend time to "fix" the opposition.<br>Now tell me, which first world government in the world does not have a strong opposition? Please, we are out of nationbuilding stage. We need a strong opposition not only to serve as checks, but also to catch us should our government one day fall apart.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">No viable opposition has been allowed to form, and without robust national debate Singaporeans are becoming politically de-skilled. Accordingly, the Government comprises plenty of ministers but few politicians, and there is little elegance to their art. They know only how to clobber: too often alternative viewpoints are responded to with public humiliation, threats, defamation writs and detention. Business should consider these aspects and not just competitiveness when assessing Singapore as a place for investment.</span><br><br>The government does not decide if the opposition makes or breaks. I repeat, the government DOES NOT decide if the opposition makes or breaks. It is the people who are casting the votes, and deciding whether the opposition is able to grow.<br><br>However, the government can sway the minds of the people through the media, which it controls, and the laws introduced to handicap the opposition. It already controls the local media, however, it is unable to control globalisation and the internet. Hence, when more people start using the internet to source for alternative views, the government responds by banning podcasts and political blogs, leaving the only alternative source of news to the global watchdogs who are monitering our political scene here. Since the govt cannot control these overseas reporters, they issue statements telling foreigners to stop interfering in our country's issues.<br><br>Does this sound like a democratic society to you?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">He says Singapore has a good legal system. That is true, but only compared with Indonesia, the Philippines, China and Thailand. Laws that have not had the benefit of open public debate and passage through a robust parliament are not really laws but decrees.</span><br><br>Good legal system? I want to know why the ISD are able to detain political activists for an indefinate amount of time when there is no trial, no evidence, and they have no chance to defend themselves.<br><br>I want to know why our esteemed, highly educated leaders of the judicary are unable to detect the unfairness in the recent GE when many ordinary singaporeans are able to do so.<br><br>Here is the pledge which students have recited daily, from young:<br><br>We, the citizens of singapore, pledge ourselves as one united people. Regardless of race, language or religion. <span style="color: blue;">To build a democratic society, based on justice and equality</span>. <span style="color: blue;">So as to achieve happiness, prosperity, and progress for our nation.</span><br><br>Ask your conscience. How many of the traits in the pledge have we fufilled, or even ATTEMPTED to fufill?<br><br>happiness? yes. my friends and family.<br>prosperity? progress? I'm not so certain about that since jobs are being given to foriegners while singaporeans fend for themselves.<br><br>democratic. justice. equality. I think its obvious enough whether we have these 3.</div>
