The other day i was at the airport queuing up at the ticketing counter to book my seat. Before i even reached the front, i alrdy noticed this "hell of a stunner" gal seated behind the booth. Guess what, when we spoke, i realised from her accent that she's from China. I wondered, "why is this job not given to a local?!?!?!"<br><br>If FTs come in because they can pass on a certain expertise or do dirty jobs eg construction and cleaning, so be it. But a job like this?<br><br>Another eg is my experience when i worked in Metro retail once. At that time in 2002, there were abt 20+ supervisors who were from China. They were distributed over all the Metro retail stores. Guess their salary a mth? $2,000. (Very high salary in the local retail scene)<br><br>Gdness! Why are FTs imported to do jobs which pay them so well? Are they gonna pass on some super skill? Why can't a S'porean auntie or uncle do the same job?<br><br>If Metro functions this way, i can't imagine the myriads of other companies in S'pore.</div>

So no matter how u try to angle it, singapore is not a great place even if u're smart and knowledgeable, because the privileged have a stranglehold on exploitation of the stupid.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
