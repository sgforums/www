            <div class='col-md body'>A bit of info for those who want to know more about her. More info on the  Officials of the Executive Council avilable here : <a href="http://www.wp.org.sg/party/officials.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wp.org.sg/party/officials.htm</a><br><br>Sylvia Lim Swee Lian<br>Age 39<br><br>Posts in WPS:<br>Â· Chairman, The Workers' Party of Singapore<br>Â· Chairman, GRC Area Committee<br><br>Background:<br>Sylvia Lim is currently a Lecturer at Temasek Polytechnic, which she joined in 1998. She is now Manager of Continuing Education &amp; Training at the Polytechnic's Business School. Her main areas of teaching and research are in civil and criminal procedure, criminal justice and private security.<br><br>Sylvia contributed to the volume on Criminal Procedure for Halsbury's Laws of Singapore (2003), a legal practitioners' reference series, and has also collected and published primary research on private security in Singapore.<br><br>She holds a Bachelor of Laws (Hons) degree from the National University of Singapore and obtained a Master of Laws degree in 1989 from the University of London. She was called to the Singapore Bar in 1991.<br><br>During her undergraduate and postgraduate studies, she did volunteer work with the Spastic Children's Association, Salvation Army Home for the Aged and the University College Hospital (London). She thereafter did editorial work on a voluntary basis for the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme of the Law Society.<br><br>In 1991 she joined the Singapore Police Force as a Police Inspector where she served for 3 years; she was active in investigation work (including supervision) at the Central Police Div HQ and thereafter was staff officer to the Director of the Criminal Investigation Department.<br><br>In 1994 she returned to practise law in the private sector, with M/s Lim &amp; Lim. From 1994 to 1998, she was active in both civil and criminal litigation and handled a variety of cases in the High Court, Subordinate Courts and Juvenile Court.<br><br>Philosophy:<br>With the ruling party securing 75% of votes at the General Election 2001, Sylvia is concerned that unless credible people come forward, the fate of alternative parties in Singapore hangs in the balance. Alternative parties have a role in scrutinising government policy constructively and asking for justifications for any laws which will affect the people.<br><br>Sylvia loves running outdoors but, due to injury, has also turned to swimming. She also enjoys music in many genres from classical to jazz, and is a supporter of the local arts scene.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would give the Think Centre as a whole greater credibility than CSJ by himself.He seems to be more concerned with promoting democracy around the region, which in itself is a laudable goal.But he needs to realise without any success on his hometurf, he will only be seen as a paper tiger by those who have fought long and hard for the democratization of Asia, e.g Aung San Suu Kyi and Martin Lim of HK's Democratic Party.If he can acheive reverse democratization of Singapore through international pressure, it would be good.That is not called foreign intervention, it's called international consensus that your government has not done something correctly.The former is a label used by the incumbents to stir up specious nationalism in order to hoodwink the unversed and those illiterate in international affairs, current affairs and social politics.<br><br>However, to do well in the opposition, you need to be professional, guarded with your mouth because anything you shoot off can be used as ammo against you.Almost every male in SG has served NS, you all know the importance of keeping your ammo safe, and every single round must be recorded carefully.Read up more, do indepth analysis.Rebut forcefully and with your facts.Verify any facts and figures with independant think tanks and academics.Rope them in if you can.But remember that your party must be reputable and have good substance.Leave no loose ends for the MIW to seize and burn.Be truthful to the public, feel as they feel.People nowadays want the personal touch and they can feel whether it's genuine or contrived, like a show put on before a crowd.</div>
