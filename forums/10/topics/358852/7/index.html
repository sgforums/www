              <p> "We must encourage those who earn less than $200 per month and cannot
              afford to nurture and educate many children never to have more than
              two... We will regret the time lost if we do not now take the first
              tentative steps towards correcting a trend which can leave our society
              with a large number of the physically, intellecually and culturally

              <p>  "The Bell curve is a fact of life. The blacks on average score 85 per cent on IQ and it is accurate, nothing to do with culture. The whites score on average 100. Asians score more ... the Bell curve authors put it at least 10 points higher. These are realities that, if you do not accept, will lead to frustration because you will be spending money on wrong assumptions and the results cannot follow." - Lee Kuan Yew, The Man &amp; His Ideas, 1997</p>
              <p>"I started off believing all men were equal. I now know that's the most unlikely thing ever to have been, because millions of years have passed over evolution, people have scattered across the face of this earth, been isolated from each other, developed independently, had different intermixtures between races, peoples, climates, soils... I didn't start off with that knowledge. But by observation, reading, watching, arguing, asking, that is the conclusion I've come to." - Lee Kuan Yew, The Man &amp; His Ideas, 1997</p>

              you may not simply know about people with low IQ at all. Low IQ people can hardly express their injustice or anger through proper words or speech. It is very hard for them to express this verbally or to take it down.
              
              How do you judge that the boy is at fault as he may not even be educated up to pri6 or secondary school? The fact is that mentally challenged people tend to express their disappointment and helplessness through actions. Just look at TV programmes or read books on mentally challenged people you would know. 
              
              AND I can boldy state that the boy at NO TIME, ever intended to cause harm to the MP. Period, just his expression of helplessness in the situation that his family is in. And lol and behold, the MP although may sign their forms, may implicitly look down on them or imply that this could be the last time she would be helping the family.
              
              The bottom line is the MP is insensitive, non-emphathetic, and judgemental. So, she refuses an simply scripted apology by the boyâ€™s mother? Hello, the boyâ€™s mother may not even be well educated, maybe even uneducated, so she want some flowerly apologies of chim words to show sincerity? 
              
              Think about it, everyone!
