              <p>People will go on and on to criticise the PAP and point out their misdoings, their selfishness.  If you are so irks by these, this is not a place for you.</p>

              <p>FYI. Ah Phua don't need your sympathy ok ? If you threaten her.. you get the police knocking at your door. She has all the power she needs to make your life misrable if she so wants.</p>
              <p>And no, MP no need to be psychic.. but it was her choice to BE a MP.. and what exactly is a MP's job ?All glamour and money ?</p>
              <p>U think MP like these Meet the Peasant sessions ? No, but it's part of their job requirements. They have no choice but to face the peasants and their mortal problems.</p>
              <p>If given a choice.. the first thing they want to strike off their job scopes will be " Meet the Peasants" sessions.</p>

              <p>Or he , like many young kids lives in a bubble.</p>
              <p>We all know it's hard to come to grips with reality. It took me a while to see the true colors of our ruling party. And it feels like a slap in my face, a stab into my heart.</p>
              <p>We don't have an independent media which can keep gahmen honest.</p>
              <p>Our parents don't discuss politics with us because they think we are too young.</p>
              <p>At that age , our own friends don't know nuts about politics.</p>
              <p>And then there comes SGforum speaker's corner...</p>
              <p>It's like when you have to tell kids Santa Claus is not real... you'd see some of them go into protests and denial mode. Sky is probably in this phase right now.</p>
              <p>So, I'd rather think the better of him and cut him some slack..</p>

              <p>jo, he behaves the same in other threads in sgforums.    It is as if what we say gotta be approved by him.  He is just too spoilt to expect people to say things to please him.     If you notice he is also ever very fast  to subtlely defend the PAP be it if the PAP is accused or not.   </p>
              <p>He is using the questioning way to trap people into argument with him.   When he first join I fell into his trap.     </p>
