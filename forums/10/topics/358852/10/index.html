              <p><br>Not all but majority are.   Many care only for themselves, some very materialistic too.  Those times when I first started out I had my good friends laughing at me for not having any credit cards.    Commented I have little savings and something wrong with this.     I have dumped these friends.    These people belong to the rubbish bin, not fit to be friends with.   These are not nice people, don't need to treat them nice.  </p>

              <p>hi midz, depends on how one manage it.   i do use credit cards now but i spend within my means and set limit on the usage of the card.  Must not let greed take control.  in fact certain times is more cost saving to use card to pay.   Sometimes there are promotion -  use credit card pay get discount</p>

              <p>Credit cards makes little sense to me, why should i spend money that i haven't got when i already have savings of my own.</p>
              <p>It's kinda dangerous though, since nothing physically leaves your hand to give to another there's no feeling that you're actually spending anything.</p>
