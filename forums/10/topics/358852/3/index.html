              <p>Things haven't change  bit.</p>
              <p>I remember in the late 70's when I was a school boy. My father
              was diagnosed with stomach cancer and was given 6 months or less to
              live. As we were from a big family and my father had already
              retired due to his poor health, my mother had to work. She was
              working in a ministry as a cleaner.</p>
              <p>As my elder sister had started to work, she suggested that my
              mother applied for 6 months no pay leave to look after my father
              remaining days.  My mother's boss could not make the
              decision of giving my mother the long leave and still keep her job
              after the 6 months so he suggested to see the MP and asked for
              help.</p>
              <p>As my mother was illiterate, she was afraid to go to see the MP
              alone, so I had to accompany her to see the MP (and I being equally
              afraid). The MP at that time was also the Minister of the portfolio
              my mother was working.</p>
              <p>I remembered when we saw the MP, the first thing he said was why
              we were so troublesome. This frightened both my mother and me. And
              for this I remembered it till this day.  Anyway, we did
              finally get his letter for the no pay leave recommendation. But my
              father didn't last the 6 months.</p>

              <p>MP Cynthia Phua should pay attention to how she treats people around her. By questioning the identity of a person, the qualification of a person and why is a person not working in such a manner, MP Phua disregards the person as a human being and treats the person as a robot or android. A person of low IQ will regard such a questioning as an insult and will react in a violent manner.</p>
              <p>A person who goes to a MP to seek help has a lower self-esteem and abased themselves to the sympathy of government system, there is no need to enquire whether the person is himself or herself, what the person is presently doing and why the person is not working in such a slip-short fashion.</p>
              <p>I pity the young man with the low IQ and thalessaemia as well as MP Cynthia Phua. There is nothing the young man can do to better his circumstances at the moment but MP Phua can surely choose to quit her post as an MP and let a better claimnant take over the post.</p>

              <p>That is the way they work.  Even in the community centre is the same thing.  I was in the office waiting to enquire on some info when I heard the lady working there interrogating a resident who went there to apply for transport voucher very loud and clear.  The lady was interrogating the resident and she repeated her questions a number of times and that resident so patiently kept giving her the same answers and did not make a fuss to her.  </p>
              <p>Her questions to her were "why are you not working"  -  "do you stay alone" and two other questions which I can't recall now.    This lady kept saying to her "you are so young and yet not working" a number of times.  Finally, a nice aunty could not take it told the lady off.    "You no need to ask so many questions.  Nobody wants to be out of job.   People have their problem and they don't feel free to tell.  She is just here to apply for transport voucher, no need to make things difficult for her".    The resident heard that was so happy and thanked the aunty.</p>
              <p>Crap, crap!   I wonder people working in CCs and those PAP members are trained to interrogate people the same way.   Bloody shit, treat us citizens like dirt when we are feeding them.    They are worse than beasts.</p>
