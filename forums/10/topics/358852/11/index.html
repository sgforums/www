              <p>sometimes it's not so easy to rent out a room ok ?</p>
              <p>If they live in a 3 room flat with only one bathroom... not a lot of people wants to rent because there's already 2 person living in one flat.</p>
              <p>Let say they live in 4 room flat.. ya think many people will want to live with a mentally handicapped kiddo ?</p>

              <p>I am a visually handicapped person and there was a time when I had difficulties finding a job. I went to one MP from the Ayer Rajah area.</p>
              <p>He is useless asked me my age and name and why I couldn't find a job. I told him that the jobs that people were willing to give me only paid $50.00 a month. Its true that was about 4 years back now they pay $200 plus or minus. He and all the volunteer working for him said its better than nothing.</p>
              <p>They don't understand the suffering of the people the income difference between us is way too big.</p>

              <p>Though i am really concerned about this mother-son pair (i know them personally and have been trying to help them on many occasions), 'Superlady' is right about their spending behaviour. They certainly need some credit counseling as they spend on items that are way beyond their means (they have been spotted at Starbucks, movies, cabs besides the hair salon)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also think everything has been a little dramatised. Though he has slight low IQ (only slightly - if you talk to him you'd realise how rational his thoughts are) he had the opportunity to learn skills in one of our schools for lower IQ children but refuses to go. My friends and I personally offered to bring him to school but  his mother refuses the offer. And yes - she does gets defensive when one brings up the matter about work. She is  overly protective and refuses to even allow the teen to learn how to boil water. He is quite fit by the way and not as sickly as it is made out to be.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is a very sad case indeed, as though many people has been trying to help them not just through financial  means(by the way, she gets<strong> MUCH</strong> more financial aid then reported), but through advise, counseling, job recommendations etc. they constantly reject the latter and yes - gets very touchy when those topics arises.  However, they have no qualms about asking for money usually giving the excuse that they are starving. My friends were fooled once as thinking they were really starving, bought tons of food to their place only to notice that they do have food in their kitchen pantry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So whereas i understand the angst some of the speakers here has displayed, there's always 2 sides to a coin. Yes i agree they need help, but the help they need is not just financial. We need to help them be independent, we need to help them to fish.</p>
