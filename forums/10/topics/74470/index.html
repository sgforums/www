You have to sacrifice one. You cannot have the best of both worlds," she said.<br><br>Another parent said it would be a waste of taxpayers' money if a majority of the arts school graduates eventually pursued non Arts-related degrees.<br><br>"If you take very bright students who are very good at arts as well, how many of the bright students, who could do other things, would want to do the arts?<br><br>"I have friends trained as lawyers, bankers and successful accountants who are very good at the arts. If they had wanted to, they could have made a career out of it. But the fact is they just do it for fun. They would rather do what they are doing because it pays better."<br><br>While the arts school proposal calls for consideration of non Express stream students on a case-by-case basis, parents said it is skewed towards those who excel academically. The proposed arts school will offer a six-year academically demanding programme leading to the International Baccalaureate. Â— NewsRadio 93.8</div>

PSLE 200 points is about 66 per subject. If a student cant understand the basic concepts of science, math and, language(whether its english or a second language) i doubt they will be able to understand the other stuff and they wouldnt be able to excel in whatever art field they are in. and history is actually imporant coz to be able to understand why an artist or musicians composed or designed what they did, the student must understand what that time period was like and major events during that time and so on.<br><br>the basics are not helpful, they are necessary. how can one observe something properly without knowing what it is and how can that person know what it is unless they learn about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>being from an arts school, i can tell you that, no, they are NOT necessary. in some ways it would help, but it is barely necessary.<br><br>having come from an engineering background, i found it easier to understand the concepts of 3 dimensions, multiple views and perspectives. but i've had classmates who either had no math background (ie. foreign students) or those with a poor foundation, but that doesn't mean they had it any harder than me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm sorry then. like i said, i dont really know much about art.<br><br>for me personally, subjects like math and history has helped me alot. I have studied music for 6 years, but on music history and improvisation starting two years ago. And i found that i understood it much easier because i had prior knowledge from other classes in school.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think i agree in MOE only accepting Express stream students and allowing case-by-case basis for those who are lower. There must be some standard in accepting students into sports or arts school. Like it or not, nowadays pupiles in Normal academic or norman tech stream are really slow in the academic field and also not creative at all. And don't forget, arts isn't all about being good in drawing or painting skills, it's more then that. If you'd experiment more with ideas, maths and science have a lot of do with how art is presented so if they don't have a least a through understanding in these subjects, how you expect them to excel in an Arts school?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And to add on to my previous post. As history would have it, accomplised artists were all deep thinkers. That's hardly what i see in pupils in NA or NT nowadays. Don't get me wrong, i'm not implying that there are many in Express stream, but there must be some sort of fixed criteria. If they change it now and view all applicants in a case-by-case basis into an arts school, again, people will question why some could go in and some couldn't.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is why I believe, that locals who CAN afford to send their childresn abroad for studies - be it in the arts or others - WILL continue to do so. So what, if there are not enough local talents in SIngapore? That's because the Education System in SIngapore. Not that we lack, it's just the filering policies that stands in the way.<br><br>I think, as with all govbernment related issues, no amount of complain or grumbling  will change the way they want to do things. It only takes consequences to open their eyes.<br><br>If they think they can acquire the best of both worlds, then let them find out the hard way.<br><br>Carry on with the elitist's way of doing things, and Singapore will continue to bleed talent to other countries.<br><br>Personally, I'd rather send my kid abroad for arts. Arts here especially in music, is all about copying styles. Nothing orginal. Look at our local programs; they follow whatever America produces. Apart from PCK Pte Ltd, the rest are simply PATHETIC.<br><br>The recent Incredible Stories about ghosts and true stories; the acting is so MISERABLE!!!! Though the story line seems ok, where did the actors get their training from????<br><br>Only person I salute, is Gurmit Singh.<br><br>So if Art Schools wanna be elitist, let them be. Things will eventually change.<br></div>
