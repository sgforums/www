Any wrong thing done by chinese communists to the tibetan does not justify the japanese committing atrocities against the chinese. In fact, it should be the other way round, the atrocities done by japanese against chinese between 1937 to 1945 do not justify the chinese doing similar things to the tibetan in the 50's.<br><br>I do agree with you that the Chinese should not get violence in their protests and should exercise some self control.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The commemoration ceremony on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration camp of Sachsenhausen in Oranienburg, eastern Germany, has just been carried out on Sunday, April 17, 2005. There is no lack of gory details about the atrocities committed by the german in this concentration camp. Was this done to incite hatred against the German???<br><br>Those who are interested in genocide and hatred will find countless gory details in pictures and in written books about the atrocities done by the Germans during WW2,  on the net, libraries, museum...... surely these are not the instruments to incite hatred agains the Germans!!<br><br>European civilization has moved on from WW2, cold war, to a new EU. Where is Asian civilization? move on and forget about the atrocities during WW2? European civilization did not progress that way!!! Historical facts must be respected, atrocities against fellow human must be condemned, or human civilization will not progress.<br><br>8 threads with numerous postings relating to the whitewashing of history by japan apparently have not changed minds. May be words alone are not enough, hopefully gory details could bring the focus to where the problem is. A picture is clearer more than a thousand words (hopefully).<br><br>If our focus continue to be on how rotten the PRC protestors are, we may be just staring at our own rotten toes.  We need to lift up our heads and look at Japan.</div>

They have also justified their invasion of Singapore stating that it was necessary to liberate the locals from the brits colonial power. don't think we can expect some "complaining"? Singaporeans apparently don't care about history or what their grandfathers did. Our education problem?<br><br></div>
