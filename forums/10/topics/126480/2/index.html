            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by LazerLordz:<br>Precisely.Blood is indeed thicker than water, so if the PRC fellas never even realised that there are worse perps out there in their own nation. Take a moment and think,<br><br>On the very same day of the Anti-Japanese riots in China, a protest in the south by a few thousand villagers was suppressed violently resulting in the deaths of two elderly women.What's up with your claim that they have the freedom to riot?It's all a staged and crafted act for the world to see.That's the problem with many people today, they can't look beyond economic ideals and see the PRC for her own ruthless nature which is still around.<br></blockquote>Are we on the same page about "blood is thicker than water"? Family relations are more important than relations with outsiders. Family members may fight with one another, but when they perceive external threats, they stick together and defend the family.<br><br>If Japan were to become a U.N. Security Council permanent member, and the Chinese citizens were to protest -- a la Tiananmen -- against their own Politburo for their corruption and incompetence, could you possibly imagine what will happen? The whole world would roll on the floor laughing their heads off at the Chinese who are perhaps the only race that enjoys "zi ji ren da zi ji ren" (right hand fight left hand). One Taiwanese pan-green/pan-blue fiasco is embarrassing enough.<br><br>Every country in this world has its own internal problems, and these problems would always exist. Corruption and wealth disparity is not a problem that could be solved overnight, especially for a huge country like China. Whatever the people want to protest is indeed up to them, as long as they are willing to accept the consequences. If they want to protest against their own government, then they must be prepared to face their own law enforcement troops -- it's the same in every country. However, there is no international law that states a country should solve its own problems first before protests could be lodged against its neighbours.<br><br>This topic brings to mind a historical figure -- Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. If Chinese historical texts were to be believed, the Japanese wouldn't have overrun so much land and spilt so much blood if he didn't insist the internal problems within China, namely the Communists, be purged first before his troops could be divided to deal with the Japanese invaders. If there is anything to be learned from history, perhaps the first lesson is not to share his sentiments.<br><br>Flames are indeed uncontrollable, so it is best to put them out first before they grow too big, especially if they are started by the neighbour.</div>

I am not condoning them. Let's take a look at US and India. The former is known as the world's no. 1 democracy and the latter is known as the world's largest democracy. Yet these kind of things can happen in US and India too!! During the Vietnam War, american soldiers shot dead many students protesting the war. This kind of thing can also happen in the world's no.1 democracy.  Even until now, exploitation of  Native Americans and other minorities in the US still very common.
