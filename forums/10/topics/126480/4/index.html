            <div class='col-md body'>[i was taught all that in secondary school. It is not so much about the history books, but rather, whether you teacher bothers to teach you all that or not. But even so, we were taught in a very factual manner, and not in a biased form as in hate the japanese.]<br><br>did you happen to come from one of those SAP schools?  and i'm talking about 20 years ago.  all the rest of government schools read standard texts and as a matter of fact i still have them and really there isn't much other than the water treatment.<br><br>about facts.  facts they are no doubt but if you read them and aren't moved by them then could there be something extraordinarily hard inside?<br><br>[And fyi, the rape of nanking was a reccomended text in quite a few schools. And not to mention those natonal education messages that they always drill into our heads.]<br><br>again here we're talking about teaching history at the national level, the books that are read in a few schools don't count.  what counts is what the rest of the nation's students read.<br><br>[So if you talk about knowledge , a hell lot of us have it. We knew it happened. But we chose not to bother.]<br><br>there is a difference between not bothering, being apathetic and being downright insensitive to the past sufferings of our fellows human beings.<br><br>i would say i'm not bothered.  why?  coz i didn't bother to start a thread about it.  why did i reply?  cos there were apathetic people who just aren't sensitive enough about the sufferings of others.  the least they could do really is like what you say don't bother.<br><br>[cos simply it is so darn distant and remote from us. Right now they are denying the rape of nanking. And thats china's buisness. And unless they start denying the obvious about SEA, you won't see many people complaining.]<br><br>sometimes you wonder why the british are so bothered by US prerogatives that they are willing to risk the lives of their own people for them?  you see, distant and remote as they are, they are not completely irrelevant.  no i don't hope or even wish that people here complain or go beserk and start ransaking rahmen and sake sushi shops.  i expect them to like you said, don't bother ... at the very least.</div>
