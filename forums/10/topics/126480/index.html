Singaporeans were stepped all over by the malaysian, national flags burned by the indonesian and the philippino, go to court over a small island..... but singaporean will not or cannot even make a noise. Is that surprising that we do not understand why others react, even if it might hurt them economically? no, because singaporean will continue to buy cheap cheap things from Johore even if they step on our heads.<br><br>America reacted against the attack on Pearl Harbor by dropping two atomic bombs on Japan and its forces are still on Japanese soil, from where they continue to influence asia. do they need to react any further?<br><br>What were Singaporean taught in schools about what happened? I bet you more singaporean come to know about attack on Pearl Harbour by watching the movie, not from history books!! and what do we know about the history books in China and Korea to call it hatred books?<br><br>Sigh.... with singaporean who think that "Even if the japanese soldiers did raped so many chinese women.... isn't it too late to regret now?" he probably does not care even if he were born of a comfort woman with the Japanese when her husband were slaughtered, afterall, it is too late to do anything?

The Japanese were the aggressors in China, the Americans were defenders. We all knew what the Japanese did to the Americans, but what did the Chinese do to incur the wrath of the Japanese that they had to pay the debt with blood of more than 20 million people, more than 5 times the population of Singapore?<br><br>Yes, I remembered the Cultural Revolution and that it was brought up in other threads as well. It was avoided (not just by myself) because it was beside the point. The topic was on why the Chinese hated the Japanese, not on why the Chinese should direct their hatred towards their rulers instead. Not saying you are wrong that they should hate their own rulers instead of the Japanese, because nobody can possibly speak for 1.2 billion people -- but here's a possible reason for you to mull over:<br><br>The Japanese were invaders. Invaders are outsiders, and comparing outsiders with fellow countrymen and family members is like comparing water with blood. That is if you still haven't realised that blood is thicker than water.</div>

However, when they alter history textbooks, teach their young history distorted to suit their political purposes, and these young grow up to be the next generations of Japan leaders, it becomes our concern.<br><br>In short, when <span style="font-style: italic;">their</span> past has possible effects on <span style="font-style: italic;">our</span> future, it is no longer an internal affair.</div>
