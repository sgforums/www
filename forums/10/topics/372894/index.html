              <p><strong>Network.nationalpost.com, 21 Aug 2009, Diane Francis<br> </strong> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Swiss banking secrecy crackdown: Singapore next</strong></span></span><br> <br> <strong>The Swiss sting</strong><br> The Swiss have been surrounded for decades by mountains of snow and dirty money.<br> That’s why it is indeed welcome news that Washington has been able to
              pry open Switzerland’s bank secrecy laws this week. UBS will hand over
              information on the accounts of 4,450 wealthy Americans.<br> But <span style="color: red;"><strong>this should be just the beginning and the next big target should be Singapore, according to Washington-based attorney Jack Blum.</strong></span><br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>“As a result of the pressure on Switzerland, a lot of the client bank accounts have been shifted off to Singapore</strong>. </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>UBS said [last year] it will cooperate in giving up the names, so billions fled and it all appears to be heading to Singapore,”</strong></span> he said in a recent telephone interview.<br> Singapore is the “preferred destination” for Wall Street denizens,
              according to Singaporean opposition politicians. Who knows? Maybe some
              of Madoff’s billions are there. <br> <br> <strong>Bankers are accessories</strong><br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Singapore maintains that it has weeded out criminals. But that’s what the Swiss said too.</strong></span> <strong><span style="color: red;">There is no way a bank can determine who is behind the person or entity with the numbered bank account.</span></strong> It’s an excuse trying to mask the fact that secrecy havens are willing accessories to crimes.<br> “Crooks set up offshore corporations in the British Virgin Islands, get
              a bank account in Singapore or in the Pacific islands or in a trust in
              the Isle of Man and there’s no way to crack through all of that at the
              moment,” said Blum.<br> This is why the UBS deal must be only the beginning of a global
              crackdown. Governments worldwide have incurred enormous debts to pull
              the world back from its economic brink, due to banking malpractice, and
              tax evaders must be pursued to help ease the burden on all taxpayers.<br> <br> <strong>Secrecy invented in 1934</strong><br> The Swiss invented the secret, numbered bank account to help Jews and
              others hide money from the Nazis. But the Nazis used this service too
              because secrecy enables despots, drug cartels and tax evaders of every
              race, religion and nationality to evade taxes and detection.<br> Swiss bank accounts have facilitated corruption worldwide and involved
              high-profile cases in Pakistan, Africa and South America. The late
              Yasser Arafat stashed $300 million safely away in Switzerland, and
              safely out of the reach of the Palestinian people to whom it belonged.
              Likewise, every tinpot dictator, terrorist organization, kickback
              artist, tax cheat and drug dealer in the world likely has a Swiss gnome
              protecting his money from police, other crooks, tax authorities and
              ex-wives.<br> <br> <strong>UBS nickname: used to be smart</strong><br> This UBS precedent was the result of investigations which followed
              revelations from a UBS whistleblower about the bank’s “offshore”
              marketing techniques such as smuggling diamonds in toothpaste tubes for
              clients.<br> But UBS is only the tip of the iceberg.<br> Last week, allegations were made in an Italian court by the daughter of
              the late Gianni Agnelli, whose family owns Fiat which is Italy’s
              largest industrial empire, that there was US$1 billion hidden in Lugano
              banks that her mother was hiding from her.<br> This dirty money business has gone on for years and there are trillions
              sloshing around in dozens of countries from Liechtenstein to the
              Channel Islands, Cayman Island, Vanuatu, Austria plus others.<br> The Swiss must now also force Credit Suisse and other financial
              intermediaries to cooperate with foreign tax and police authorities.
              This bank also came under fire in the 1990s when the World Jewish
              Congress discovered that there was no effort to help find the heirs to
              accounts of Jews who were murdered or who disappeared in the Second
              World War. The money was being used by the bank.<br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The Swiss have been targeted for some time and now Singapore plus others must become the focus.</strong></span> Ending bank secrecy will reap many benefits for the world such as
              finding out if public officials and politicans are on the take.<br> <br> ---------------------------------<br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Latest @ <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong></span><br> <br> 1.
