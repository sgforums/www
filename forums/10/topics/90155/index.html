Your complaints are so trite and rhetorical that it is standard operating procedure for any opposition party wannabes. But obviously, at every general elections..the people don't buy it...at least in the constituencies that are contested.<br>Your arguments are not based on facts but irrational perceptions. Let me try to deconstruct your bullshit:<br><br>1. Government is not social service. That's the trouble with you lot...you think the best and brightest will serve when they can do better elsewhere in a booming economy that was brought about by the correct government policies in the first place ? Yes there will be many incompetent and clowns who will be happy to be a Minister or MP for far less money..in fact for free even...since they can then go and raid the state coffers. Why do you think our government and system is consistently among the least corrupt in the world ? You are also wrong in saying the Ministers and top civil servants demand as much pay as top CEOs....check your facts again and learn how the gahmen determines it's top pay structure. Only small minded underachieving people will begrudge the money paid to the small group of people who determines whether this country progress and prospers...or goes down the drain.<br><br>2. Singapore is small, and it's achievements cannot be taken in absolute terms with far larger countries such as the USA and China. However in relative terms, in per capita terms, and in the short space of time since independence....Singapore has, in the judgement of many independent international experts..achieved what no other country has given the odds it has to overcome. Comparing us with China and USA is silly...we are not even in the same ball park. But in relative terms we have achieved so much more.<br><br>3. You are always comparing Singapore ministers' salaries with those of China and the US...and inferring that it is far more difficult to run such big countries therefore Singapore's ministers are overpaid. That's being grossly simplistic and ignorant of the responsibility of government. The US and China, for example..are far larger and diverse countries and as such present more complex challenges to run it than a compact state like Singapore. However, these countries also have huge resources and human talents on tap, and there is far more room for error and experimentation. China survived the ravages of nature and political diasters over the milleniums that would have long obliterated a tiny red dot like Singapore. The challenges are very different..and so are the problems. It's not a matter of which countries are more difficult to run..but whether their respective governments, over time, have made their country the best that they can be. In this regard, I feel Singapore has come up tops. Do not compare the essence of government to a simplistic analogy of which is more difficult or easier...is badminton more difficult than squash ?<br><br>4. Tell me, fool..which government in the world volunteers to share power with their opponents ? Those that do cannot invariably help it...they do not have the overwhelming majority of popular support to demand it. The fact that Singapore has a weak opposition cannot be simply blamed on government manipulation... that's the opposition's chronic excuse for their own mediocrity. Ask yourself, why have opposition candidates (and many do stand for elections) routinely rejected by the electorate ? Are Singaporeans plain stupid ? Come come...give credit when it's due.<br><br>5. The ISA is a bogey that our opposition uses as another of its many excuses for not performing. FACT: No opposition party member is or have been detained under the ISA for almost 2 decades now. The ISA is directed against subversives with violent intent, avowed communists, and terrorists elements. I challenge you to show which opposition member is under ISA detention ? Don't say Chia Thye Poh because that fellow is a hardcore communist that refused to renounce violent revolution...a dinosaur that has to be confined on Sentosa.<br><br>6. Wat tokking you ? Terrorist are and have targetted the countries you mention. No place on earth is exempt..not even the heart of Islam in Saudi Arabia. Yet have you ever wondered why Singapore has not had any terrorist attacks even though we are a strong supporter of the US in the region, with the US Navy frequently visiting our naval facilities in Changi ? You have our gahmen and its agencies to thank for that.<br><br>7. Government's duty to provide jobs..yes..but do you think our spoilt Singaporeans will take the jobs that are provided ? If they prefer to live under mum and dad's charity than go and sweat it out in the sun, issit the gahmen's fault ? The gahmen can only provide the fishing rods and the bait..you have to go catch your own fish...figuratively speaking that is. People not happy..how do you prove it ? Is there forment in the streets ? Do people throw rotten eggs at their ministers ? Or is it only just you and your many sympathisers on this forum ? You hide behind your anonymity and bitch about everything but do you have the guts to show your face and fight your cause ? Nahh..actually you dickheads are just too comfortable..Hokkien saying..chiak pah bo tai chi chor (full stomach with fuck all to do).<br><br>8. A Happiness survey..on this forum ? You are being stupid. besides there have benn numerous surveys conducted by independent organisations that gauges the contentment levels of various socities..we already know that Singapreans are far happier than many societies in the world.<br><br>9. Mao Tse Tung ? That man set China's economy back decades with his infamous Cultural revolution. Deng Xiao Peng ? He had the right ideas but he died before he can put them into practice, leaving behind a younger and more enlightened team to bring China forward. Remember, he was also the one who ordered the Tiananmen slaughter that though widely condemned at the time, nevertheless restored order in a troubled China that enabled it's rapid economic progress we see today. LKY was one of the few who supported the Tiananmen decision at the time...and he was, as usual absolutely right. Know your recent Chinese history before you flash names around.<br><br>10. A government serves the people..but the people also empowers the government. So if you are unhappy then come out in the open and help disempower this government....not hide behind your nick and take potshots. If you are not prepared to pay the price of change, then stop talking about it. Accept and be content. You will be happier for that.<br><br>11. You keep using the word brainwashed. That's a convenient excuse to deny reality. Can I also say you are brainwashed by populist opposition ideals, mindlessly rejecting all the positive aspects of our gahmen and society ? It is not brainwashing, dickhead...it's facing up to the facts.<br><br>Bottom line : you are probably young and frustrated by your own inadequacies...envious at the success of others..and looking for something to blame for your own lack of achievement. You have one finger up your ass and the other hand covering your eyes..and the only smell you are getting is that of your own ...[Message truncated]<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Edited 18/08/2004 23:17 ET ET by Swingstar46<br>View Full Message<br><br>Options  Reply<br><br>From:  woe_betide   00:47<br>To:  Swingstar46   46 of 56<br><br>53160.46 in reply to 53160.28<br><br>I'm leaving to explore opportunities outside Singapore. Of course, if I find Singapore still has some milk and honey that's ripe for the picking, I'm going to be there. However, like yourself, I'm also hedging my bets by maintaining the means to live in another country should things in Singapore take a turn for the worse. I don't find fault with your arguments about how the govt has turned Singapore to what it is today in spite of little resources, but I feel every Singaporean would do well to take a leaf out of the fineprint that appears on those flashy unit trust brochures: "Past performance is not an indication of future returns".<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'll give credit to Harry for making Sg wat it is today. But I believe that the ministars mindsets must move with the times. Once upon a time, we were a poor struggling nation, fighting for survival in the most basic form. We had no enuff educated people, etc. Harry did what he needed to do.<br><br>Now, many educators overseas consider Sg population highly educated, albeit expensive. We have a lot of knowledge and can do a wide variety of work (tho not all, we dun have enuff marine engineers). The country has developed to be advanced and the population is much smarter now. The gahmen should cater to this new thinking breed of singaporeans, the way Uncle Goh did. Now I'm just waiting to see how Barry responses to people who question him...<br><br>I think Barry might not be able to cater to the new breed of singaporeans. He follows his father's mentality that wuold have worked against the commies and for a third world country, not present day sg.<br><br>The opposition is sadly lacking. The gahmen is not totally to be blamed. We do have an active opposition in Australia, but they are not allowed to meddle with sg politics, so they remain a voice in the dark.<br><br>When I was in the army, the person I reported to was so stupid, i fear leaving the security of the nation in his hands. He has a pri 6 education (whether he passed his PSLE is another matter). He is so fat he can't run to save his life, yet he never fails to tell us to keep fit. Our Generals are all scholars that spent their lives studying. They have excellent paperwork of course. Do they understand the grunts? Have they gone thru wat the grunts like you and i have gone thru? Or did they breeze their way thru a white horse company, straight to Scholar Coy in OCS, passed out from ocs to disrupt to study overseas and come back as a captain to serve?<br><br>To me, anyone who wants to be at the top has to go thru the bottom first, like Harry and uncle goh did. The rest that went straight to the top, I have no respect for them.</div>

Clearly stating why they need to do so, how they come up with the COE quota figure (I heard it is base on number of scrap vehicle + x% increase a year, but this is not publish I think) etc etc... the publication does not mean they cannot do what they think is right, but just making it clear why it is done that way. Let the people decide if they agree with those logic later during election.<br><br>More importantly, it is only when things are transparent, then we can discuss if it is good and the public can point out flaws and suggest perhaps something better. Without the transparency, there is no way to judge if those decisions are made out of stupidity, lack of touch to the society at large or if there are great wisdoms in those decisions. We can only guess or just believe in the rumours, since there is a lack of transparency.<br><br>The only things they need to be secretive about are only those that threatens national security (both military and perhaps some economically (like GIC)). Other than that, I see no reason for the secretive manner in which information is being handled.</div>

Your complaints are so trite and rhetorical that it is standard operating procedure for any opposition party wannabes. But obviously, at every general elections..the people don't buy it...at least in the constituencies that are contested. </strong></blockquote>As much as there are rabid and misguided anti-establishment types in any forum (Sammyboy's Alfresco Coffee Shop being referred in the quoted article), there are also the types who behave as "carpet beggars" and "condescending arch angels ", who will turn a blind eye to injustice, inconsistencies, incompetence of the Ruling Party that forms the Singapore Government.<br><blockquote>Originally posted by cooleo:<strong><br>Your arguments are not based on facts but irrational perceptions. Let me try to deconstruct your bullshit:<br><br>1. Government is not social service. That's the trouble with you lot...you think the best and brightest will serve when they can do better elsewhere in a booming economy that was brought about by the correct government policies in the first place ? Yes there will be many incompetent and clowns who will be happy to be a Minister or MP for far less money..in fact for free even...since they can then go and raid the state coffers. Why do you think our government and system is consistently among the least corrupt in the world ? You are also wrong in saying the Ministers and top civil servants demand as much pay as top CEOs....check your facts again and learn how the gahmen determines it's top pay structure. Only small minded underachieving people will begrudge the money paid to the small group of people who determines whether this country progress and prospers...or goes down the drain. </strong></blockquote>Several issues have been pieced together to form a mixed bag of answers that seem to undercut the debating opponent but only to those who are unaware of the political history of Singapore.<br><br>Firstly, the problem with the Ruling Party is their firm belief that Social Service is a "DIRTY TERM", and which explains for the wide gap in the Standard of Living (which equates with the QUALITY of LIFE) that exist between the Lower Income, and the Higher Income Group.<br><br>Meanwhile, the line is slowly blurring between the Lower and Middle Income Groups, as more households in the Middle Income Group struggle to make ends meet, when the bread winners are retrenched in their late 40's or 50's, and have to readjust their lifestyle - from that of the Ruling Party widely promoted SWISS Standard of Living that fizzled out quietly to one of any uncertain future that require continuous change.<br><br>The SWISS somehow remains confidently able to continue to cope with their SWISS Standard of Living, with High Pay, High Tax, and High STANDARDS of Social Services - all achieved with a LESSER PAID GOVERNMENT that is OPEN to all kinds of REFERENDUM that affects the future of the Swiss Citizens.<br><br>Secondly, it is quite tiring for the constant repetition by the Ruling Party and their lackeys, to treat the Singapore Citizens as IDIOTS, unable to discern the supposedly MANY incompetent persons and / or clowns and will NOT TRUST the Singapore Citizens to exercise their vote "correctly".<br><br>Yet, the Singapore Government that is supposedly corrupt free has seen one Minister committing suicide and one Minister of State jailed for corruption, several other ministers had quietly stepped down from office to take on the role of Ambassadors (exiled), one Member of Parliament took flight from Singapore - with the Singapore Government refusing to spend a single cent to track him down, but willingly spend several hundred thousand dollars to track the credit expenses and movement of an Opposition Candidate across the USA.<br><br>Thirdly, it did not take only incompetent persons or clowns to be in office to raid the coffers, as Singaporeans had elected a brilliant Lawyer to be the first Chief Minister of Singapore, and left office with the Government Treasury broke.<br><br>What makes you think that the present Ruling Party is not already "raiding" the Singapore Reserve ? Why is the GIC and Temasek Holdings not subjecting themselves to open accounting ? Why was it necessary to amend the Constitution that allowed the Elected President to have and to exercise some authority or power in overseeing the National Reserves ?<br><br>Fourthly, the Singapore Government has cleverly explained the need for the Ministers' remuneration to be comparable to "a basket of the top Corporate CEOs" - yet it was not announced that some of these CEOs are looking after Corporations with business turnover that are larger than the size of the Singapore Economy.<br><br>It would have been more appropriate for the Ruling Party forming the Singapore Government, to compare the salaries of the Ministers of Government of the top economies in the world, or of countries of similar economic size, or population size, or along such comparative lines.<br><br>We could have compared the remunerations paid to Government Ministers of Switzerland, Belgium, Ireland, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Israel, Hongkong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina, Egypt, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Mexico, Austria, Greece, and any countries with near similar characteristics in physical size or economic performance.<br><br>Is it true that "Only small minded underachieving people will begrudge the money paid to the small group of people who determines whether this country progress and prospers...or goes down the drain." ?<br><br>Or would it be more accurate that only a small group of greedy and over achieving people will never be satisfied with the authority and privileges that they have been given by the larger group of people to rule over them, and have decided to enrich themselves by way of 'LEGISLATION' ?<br><blockquote>Originally posted by cooleo:<strong><br>2.

However in relative terms, in per capita terms, and in the short space of time since independence....Singapore has, in the judgement of many independent international experts..achieved what no other country has given the odds it has to overcome. Comparing us with China and USA is silly...we are not even in the same ball park. But in relative terms we have achieved so much more. </strong></blockquote>YES, in the circumstance that Singapore had found itself in, the matrix of talented leadership, an obedient and diligent population, having emerged from and with memories of the hardship of the Second World War, Singapore was able to achieve far more than other countries in Asia, Africa, and South America.<br><br>However, Switzerland is often cited as a role model for Singapore to emulate, with the SWISS Standard of Living being lauded as a goal for Singapore to achieve. Unfortunately, the Singapore Citizens missed out on the fact that the Ruling Party was only talking about the dream of achieving that SWISS Standard of Living, WITHOUT the SWISS Social and Political Liberties.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>continuing post:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by cooleo:<strong><br>3. You are always comparing Singapore ministers' salaries with those of China and the US...and inferring that it is far more difficult to run such big countries therefore Singapore's ministers are overpaid. That's being grossly simplistic and ignorant of the responsibility of government. The US and China, for example..are far larger and diverse countries and as such present more complex challenges to run it than a compact state like Singapore. However, these countries also have huge resources and human talents on tap, and there is far more room for error and experimentation. China survived the ravages of nature and political diasters over the milleniums that would have long obliterated a tiny red dot like Singapore. The challenges are very different..and so are the problems. It's not a matter of which countries are more difficult to run..but whether their respective governments, over time, have made their country the best that they can be. In this regard, I feel Singapore has come up tops. Do not compare the essence of government to a simplistic analogy of which is more difficult or easier...is badminton more difficult than squash ? </strong></blockquote>Unfortunately, in the argument that ensued with so many directions being taken out, the fact remains that LKY had said that it is NOT CORRECT that the Singapore Ministers have created an environment for businesses to make profit, resulting in the Executives being paid remunerations far higher than the Ministers.<br><br>Hence, with such attractive remunerations in the Private Sector, it will present difficulties for the Ruling Party and / or the incumbent Government to attract talents from the Private Sector into Politics, and with the talented being groomed for higher office.<br><br>While the ORIGINAL concern brought up by LKY maybe valid, is it necessary to formulate the Singapore Ministers' remuneration package, using the benchmark of the remunerations paid to the Top Executives of several large corporations with turnover similar to Singapore ?<br><br>As was mentioned, some of the US Companies selected, have turnover that is far bigger then the Singapore economy.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by cooleo:<strong><br>4. Tell me, fool..which government in the world volunteers to share power with their opponents ? Those that do cannot invariably help it...they do not have the overwhelming majority of popular support to demand it. The fact that Singapore has a weak opposition cannot be simply blamed on government manipulation... that's the opposition's chronic excuse for their own mediocrity. Ask yourself, why have opposition candidates (and many do stand for elections) routinely rejected by the electorate ? Are Singaporeans plain stupid ? Come come...give credit when it's due. </strong></blockquote>While no Government or Political Party in Power will volunteer to share power, it is NOT UNCOMMON too, especially in a situation to stay in power, and to save their own butt by forming coalition Government - as is happening in Israel, with the Likud Party VOLUNTARILY inviting the Labor Party into Government.<br><br>The attitude displayed by the writer is typical arrogance displayed by the Ruling Party towards the Opposition.<br><br>The fact that the Singapore Government allow and avail themselves of total control of all medias, the use of the law, and all public facilities and amenities to perpetuate their own political interests have become so pervasive that this is no longer subtle any longer.<br><br>The Ruling Party conducts walk-about without Police Permits, while the Opposition Parties will be required to obtain Police Permits for similar walk-about activities; and with such applications requiring the final approval from the Minister - who is the Political Opponent to the Opposition Members.<br><br>The Asian mind remains cloistered in traditional and cultural hang-ups of petty pride, insecurity in power, and with little experience in the kind of democratic process of fair and unfettered adverserial politics with certain magnamity.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by cooleo:<strong><br>5. The ISA is a bogey that our opposition uses as another of its many excuses for not performing. FACT: No opposition party member is or have been detained under the ISA for almost 2 decades now. The ISA is directed against subversives with violent intent, avowed communists, and terrorists elements. I challenge you to show which opposition member is under ISA detention ? Don't say Chia Thye Poh because that fellow is a hardcore communist that refused to renounce violent revolution...a dinosaur that has to be confined on Sentosa. </strong></blockquote>Wrong. The ISA was invoked during and afte the 1990 election against the Opposition candidate Francis Seow.<br><br>Who did you hear from that Chia Thye Poh is a hardcore communist ?<br><br>Just because LKY said so ?<br><br>For the entire period of incarceration, Chia Thye Poh has been demanding a fair and open trial, with all evidence and proof that he is such a communist threat to Singapore. Yet, no trial was ever given. Every two years, the incarceration of this poor soul is brought up for review by the Minister, who is from the Ruling Party - a competing politician of this poor soul.<br><br>Meanwhile, throughout his incarceration, Chia Thye Poh was encouraged to renounce his Communism, given the incentive of freedom by making a public statement to the effect of his mistake in being a Communist and advocating the armed revolution of the people to overthrow the legitimate government of Singapore. Surprisingly, Chia Thye Poh had steadfastly refused to make such a simple statement - that would have incriminate him - and decided that it was unfair to be accused as such, and preferred to remain in prison for over two decades.<br><br>Yet, despite the constant reminder of Chia being a threat to Public Security, and without receving any declaration of renouncement of his Communist beliefs, the Internal Security Department, and the Minister of Home Affairs have found him to be no longer a threat to Singapore, and over a period of five years granted him from some limited freedom to the present day CONDITIONAL Freedom.<br><br>Should the remaining pieces of immature, vulgar, inaccurate and incoherent writing by your idolised writer be addressed ?<br></div>
