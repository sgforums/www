              <p>this aside,</p>
              <p>an increase in global temperature will bring about increased evaporation of seawater, and in turn increased rainfall. wouldn't that solve drought problems, as can be seen even in tropical countries like malaysia</p>

              <p>EH EH excuse me... I am half South Korean, and two of my aunties are involved in farming activities(though not hands-on, more like market regulators for pricing and etc.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do find your last sentence particularly offensive. Don't generalise. Not all farmers in ROK oppose free trade. I find that protecting local markets is important. I mean, why wouldn't you want your product from your country to be second-tier in your own country compared to one that is imported from another country?!</p>

They can go on and on saying this and that, and that this must reduce and that must take care, but who actually do it??? CHina??? US??? or the RUssian?? From the Doha to the Copenhagan, what have they achieved?? And more important, how much have they spent??</p>
              <p>Any big conglomorates or organisation can alway paid off a few  reputable scientists to shown that climate change is not due to industrialisation, and when someone said that Glacier is melting, someone would said that new Glacier are form???? so where do we go from here?? The best job in the world is a job that give no solution but problems</p>

              <p>They
                  are both developing countries and are highly dependant on cheap coal
                  energy to power their economies. If they have to give that up, they
                  give up the economy growth and accompanying social stability. The
                  number of the lower classes that would be affected from the carbon cuts
                  probably outnumber the whole of America.</p>
              <p>And see here, unlike
                  America and India China's leadership comprises mostly of trained
                  engineers so they would probably understand the hard Maths of global
                  warming personally far more than the politicans of any country. Whether
                  they respect human rights or not is a different can of worms.</p>
              <p>They,
                  who are so dependant on coal fired power plants are willing to commit
                  to 40-45 cuts on carbon intensity (based on 2005 levels).</p>
              <p>Europe, short of the UK are also committed to emission cuts. It seems the biggest portions of global warming unbelievers reside in America and the UK. Now, i wonder why ?</p>

              <p>global warming and rising sea-level is a farce.</p>
              <p>IMO, the earth is only slightly warming up, with the bulk of the
              "global warming" cause by the urban heat island effect.</p>
              <p>and as for the story about rising sea level, it does not make
              sense.</p>
              <p>We all know that the polar cap is melting, and so? the sea is
              not going to overflow even if the polar ice melts away.</p>
              <p>Lets do a simple experiment:</p>
              <p>fill a glass of water  with ice. although ice is lighter
              than water, and can thus float on top of the water, lets not forget
              that its mass is already displaced for in the water. so when this
              surface ice melts, the water will not overflow. same theory applies
              to the sea.</p>
              <p>this aside,</p>
              <p>an increase in global temperature will bring about increased
              evaporation of seawater, and in turn increased rainfall. wouldn't
              that solve drought problems, as can be seen even in tropical
              countries like malaysia</p>
              <p>http://www.nahrim.gov.my/pdf/drought%20in%20malaysia.pdf</p>

              <p>Just to point out something, with increased rainfall also comes increased drought (Where do you think the water for the increased rainfall's going to come from?)</p>

              <p>Carbon Trading is becoming more and more a big thing in the developed countries,</p>
              <p>This is by far a practical approach to managing carbon emissions. Of course, there will always be politics involved, but it's a realistic approach that can be implemented successfully.</p>

              <p>I do find your last sentence particularly offensive. Don't generalise. Not all farmers in ROK oppose free trade. I find that protecting local markets is important.
