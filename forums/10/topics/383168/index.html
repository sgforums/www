              <p><strong>Paul Joseph Watson</strong><br> <a href="http://prisonplanet.com/">Prison Planet.com</a><br> Tuesday, November 24, 2009</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.infowars.com/climate-alarmists-finally-admit-the-debate-is-not-over/">http://www.infowars.com/climate-alarmists-finally-admit-the-debate-is-not-over/</a></p>
              <p>Top climate alarmists have conceded that the
              climategate scandal represents a huge blow to the global warming
              movement and that the debate is not over, and yet establishment media
              organs are still invoking South Park’s Officer Barbrady in downplaying
              the story despite the fact that it clearly illustrates how evidence
              which directly disproves global warming is being censored by
              agenda-driven scientists.</p>
              <p>The Guardian’s George Monbiot, a climate change zealot
              and a staunch defender of the faith, concedes that the science now
              needs “reanalyising” and that CRU Director Phil Jones should resign.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“It’s no use pretending that this isn’t a major blow.
              The emails extracted by a hacker from the climatic research unit at the
              University of East Anglia could scarcely be more damaging. I am now
              convinced that they are genuine, and I’m dismayed and deeply shaken by
              them,” <a href="http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2009/11/23/the-knights-carbonic/">writes  Monbiot.</a></p>
              <p>“Yes, the messages were obtained illegally. Yes, all of
              us say things in emails that would be excruciating if made public. Yes,
              some of the comments have been taken out of context. But there are some
              messages that require no spin to make them look bad. There appears to
              be evidence here of attempts to prevent scientific data from being
              released, and even to destroy material that was subject to a freedom of
              information request.”</p>
              <p>“Worse still, some of the emails suggest efforts to
              prevent the publication of work by climate sceptics, or to keep it out
              of a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. I believe
              that the head of the unit, Phil Jones, should now resign. Some of the
              data discussed in the emails should be re-analysed.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Another prominent global warming alarmist, Tim  Flannery, now admits that there are holes in the “science is settled”  mantra.</p>
              <p>“We’re dealing with an incomplete understanding of the
              way the earth system works… When we come to the last few years when we
              haven’t seen a continuation of that (warming) trend we don’t understand
              all of the factors that create earth’s climate…We just don’t understand
              the way the whole system works… See, these people work with models,
              computer modelling. So when the computer modelling and the real world
              data disagree you’ve got a very interesting problem… Sure for the last
              10 years we’ve gone through a slight cooling trend,” said Flannery.</p>
              <p>“And on these now-admitted uncertainties we must scrap
              all coal-fired generators, impose massive new taxes, shut entire
              industries, hand billions to the UN and change the way we live?” <a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/">asks Andrew Bolt.</a></p>
              <p>However, while some alarmists have embarked on a course
              of damage control, the establishment has closed ranks and, after
              failing in their efforts to float the hoax that the emails were
              manufactured, are now ludicrously invoking South Park’s Officer
              Barbrady and crying in unison, “Move along, nothing to see here!”</p>
              <p>In an article entitled, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-GreenBusiness/idUSTRE5AM4AH20091123?sp=true"><em>Hacked  climate e-mails awkward, not game changer</em></a>,
              Reuters’ Timothy Gardner writes, “Revelation of a series of
              embarrassing e-mails by climate scientists provides fodder for critics,
              but experts believe the issue will not hurt the U.S. climate bill’s
              chance for passage or efforts to forge a global climate change deal.”</p>
              <p>Oh really? With numerous influential individuals
              calling for criminal investigations, and with climate alarmists
              themselves admitting that scientists closely affiliated with the UN
              IPCC exposed by the hacked emails should resign, only the wilfully
              naive could believe that this will not hamper the Copenhagen agenda for
              a global carbon tax, which was already being derailed before the
              scandal broke.</p>
              <p>The latest to weigh in on the controversy was prominent
              skeptic Lord Monkton, who labeled the CRU scientists crooks who should
              be criminally prosecuted. “They are not merely bad scientists — they
              are crooks. And crooks who have perpetrated their crimes at the expense
              of British and U.S. taxpayers,” writes Monckton. “With Professor Fred
              Singer, who founded the U.S. Satellite Weather Service, I have reported
              them to the UK’s Information Commissioner, with a request that he
              investigate their offenses and, if thought fit, prosecute.”</p>
              <p>The Reuters story quotes Anthony Leiserowitz, the
              director of the Yale Project on Climate Change, who claims there is no
              smoking gun contained in the emails, despite the fact that they expose
              how scientists used “tricks” to “hide the decline” in global
              temperatures.</p>
              <p>In another email, a scientist talks about changing
              temperature data on a graph in order to disguise evidence of global
              cooling that has been in play for the last few years.</p>
              <p>“I’ll maybe cut the last few points off the filtered
              curve before I give the talk again as that’s trending down as a result
              of the end effects and the recent cold-ish years.”</p>
              <p>To Leiserowitz, this isn’t evidence of conspiracy,
              merely “embarrassment” which would “provide fodder for the 2 to 3
              percent of the general public that are hard-core climate change
              doubters.”</p>
              <p>In reality, polls show that a huge and growing  number of both Americans and Brits are “climate change doubters.” <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1222510/Poll-U-S-belief-global-warming-cooling-down.html">A  recent Pew Research Center survey</a> showed that only 36 per cent of Americans  believe man is to blame for climate change, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5izHlKRky9T8K12vU_jRfQuR0UxTQ">whereas  in Britain</a>, “Only 41 percent accept as an established scientific fact that  global warming is taking place and is largely man-made.”</p>
              <p>Far from being a tiny minority, as Leiserowitz claims,
              climate change skeptics are now in the majority, as belief in global
              warming alarmism whittles away increasingly to the fringe.</p>
              <p>The Reuters story also quotes Kevin Book, an analyst at
              ClearView Energy Partners, LLC, who characterizes the scandal as
              “scientists behaving badly.”</p>
              <p>“This does nothing to the U.S. climate bill, which will
              be decided mostly by economic forces, not environmental ones,” said
              Book.</p>
              <p>Precisely – this has nothing to do with the environment
              and everything to do with companies like ClearView getting fat off the
              spoils of the climate fraud that they are intimately invested in.
              Obviously, to the scientists at the CRU, it has little to do with the
              environment either, since they are more than willing to block FOIA
              requests, change data and hide evidence of global cooling in order to
              make the science fit their agenda.</p>
              <p>To dismiss this as “behaving badly” shows unparalleled
              ignorance of what science is supposed to be all about, namely
              empiricism, not bias and fraud, which is exactly what the global
              warming movement has now come to represent.</p>

              <p>Nope I haven't. On the other hand, have you read all 1000+ emails and 150 MB worth of documents relating to this scandal?</p>
              <p>Yeah,
                      I'm sure Paul Joseph Watson doesn't believe in Anthropogenic Global
                      Warming (AGW) and that certainly would skew his opinion on it. But this
                      isn't an opinion. This is coverage of probably the biggest scientific
                      scandal in recent years.</p>
              <p>While I have not read every email that
                      was posted online, reading just a fraction of them serves as
                      confirmation of the fraud taking place.</p>
              <p><a href="http://bishophill.squarespace.com/blog/2009/11/20/climate-cuttings-33.html">This blog</a> provides a good summary of the findings with links to the various
                      emails. With statements like these quoted below, its hard to try to
                      brush them off without seeming biased.</p>

                      similar act in the US force you to respond to enquiries within 20 days? - our does ! The UK works on precedents, so the first request

              <p>There's
                      much more to be said about the vested interest in pushing this

[PDF]<br> &gt;<br> &gt; (A PDF of the published version can be obtained from the author.)<br> &gt;<br> &gt; The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment<br> &gt; and it is a travesty that we can't. The CERES data published in the<br> &gt; August BAMS 09 supplement on 2008 shows there should be even more<br> &gt; warming: but the data are surely wrong. Our observing system is inadequate.</p>

              <p>The first part is meant to be a sarcastic joke, because it is often that the fact of heavy snow been used as the reasoning to debunk global warming.  The more accurate and more used term now is Climate Change because there are too many idiots that take global warming as a literal term.</p>
              <p>The travesty is the inadequate observation system, not the lack of warming. It's always amazing how the message could change when you reveal the full extent of it.</p>
              <p>And do you know there is little to no information on the credentials on the blog you've linked? The only thing we know is that the man lives in rural Scotland, there is little to no information on whether he has actually any format education in fields relating to climate change. He just links *<strong>excerpts</strong>* of articles that means little and supply his own conclusions at the end of it.</p>
              <p>It's not even funny how easy it would be to take a portion of what is said to mean something totally different. Richard Dawkins have faced the same problems with Creationism as well.</p>
              <p>You have always complained about how the big corporations and banks are controlling our lives, yet you are here stupidly protecting their interests and making sure things stay status quo.</p>
              <p>Use some common sense, if we're wrong about global warming the most that is going to happen is that we're going to end up a little poorer and a bruised ego but we get more access to renewable energy, more efficient building codes and technology as well as less dependance on fossil fuels.</p>
              <p>What happens if we're right? You're nuts for thinking we can even tolerate the reprecussions of being right.</p>
              <p>You can't take it into your thick skull the full impact of what happens if we're right. You're just believing anything as long as it's anti establishment and parroting the words of Americans who just don't like the idea of an organistation able to tell them what to do.</p>

              <p>First of all, the authors of those emails were scientists with significant influence to affect the dissemination of scientific information, which they did. They can't be compared to the insignificant forumers on this board.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I'm not advocating anything just because they are anti-estalishment or anti-government. This matter merely confirms my previous belief that the theory of AGW is not science-driven. Moreover, it seems curious why this is being glossed over by the MSM. A "scandal" by a celebrity would have generated news coverage many times over.</p>
              <p>With regard to the email about the lack of warming data, it seems to me that its the politics that is leading the science. Rather than admit that the environmental data collected revealed how flawed the theory of AGW is, they blamed the "inadequency" of the observation system.</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter of the owner of that blog has no so-called "credentials". It isn't a scientific paper we're discussing here. He merely summarises and links to the significant emails that point to fraud, probably with information taken from elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Then what about the others damning statements that talk about "redefin[ing] what peer review literature is" or about attempts to evade FOI requests?<em> </em></p>
              <p>Of course, it is always wise to be cautious when it comes to a dynamic study like atmospheric science. But on glance at who benefits from AGW 'solutions' raises the question whether those 'solutions' are aimed at preserving the environment. <a href="http://www.infowars.com/al-gore-admits-co2-does-not-cause-majority-of-global-warming/">The same Al Gore who now admits that CO2 doesn't cause  majority of global warming</a> is now set to <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/al-gore-set-to-become-first-carbon-billionaire.html">rake in billions from carbon trading</a>. Similarly, it is <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/oil-companies-support-global-warming-alarmists-not-skeptics.html">big players from the finance and energy industry that support the measures supposedly aimed at reducing carbon emission through a cap and trade policy that are going to benefit</a>; industry giants like Goldman Sachs and ExxonMobil.</p>
              <p>It is a huge misconception to think that AGW and 'solutions' to combat it is anti-establishment when clearly, it serves the establishment's interest to see that they are implemented. This seems like the so-called "pincer" strategy where a problem is created and then pressure is put on the government through corporate special interests and the "masses" stirred up by NGOs, funded by the corporatocracy, to get the desired solution.</p>
              <p>It's not that I'm not for protecting the environment, but the solution that is being put forward is nothing less than a sign that its business as usual for the corporatocracy that is only interested in monetary acquisition and political monopoly. <a href="http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=27614">Any environmental concern is just superficial as the main pushers of AGW theory have already admitted.</a></p>
              <p>Finally, "climate change" is a meaningless phrase because the climate is always changing. There's too many things we don't know about the atmosphere, the planet and cosmic influences and their inter-relation with each other to come to a conclusion that any change is due to Man.</p>
              <p>But as I've told you before, its not the desire to create a more environmentally sound world, but the fake "solutions" which doesn't solve what they claim to. If you're so passionate about saving the Earth, all the more you should oppose the pro-corporate nature of mainstream AGW discussion and maybe look more into The Venus Project and The Zeitgeist Movement.</p>

              <p>This seems like a "If it be of Man, it will fail. If it be of God, nothing you do will be able to affect it" mentality. Perhaps it shows how some scientific beliefs are still religiously protected, like when Geolileo supported the idea of a heliocentric universe and was persecuted.</p>
              <p>Too much faith is being put into words like "peer review" and "scientific method" that the notions of corruption are totally ignored.</p>

              <p>it was a wall of text.. a good wall of text to read through.. it comes from someone who is cynical, angry, and most of all <em><strong>disinterested</strong></em>...</p>
              <p>but this part of the whole wall of text says a lot:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As for me, I’ll follow the blogs with interest and see how this all shakes out. But even if someone, somewhere, proves that a handful of climatologists deliberately fudged their findings — well, I’ll be there with everyone else calling to have the bastards run out of town, but it won’t matter much in terms of the overall weight of the data.  I went running through Toronto the other day on a 17°C November afternoon. Canada’s west coast is currently underwater. Sea level continues its 3mm/yr creep up the coasts of the world, the western Siberian permafrost turns to slush. Swathes of California and Australia are pretty much permanent firestorm zones these days. The glaciers retreat, the Arctic ice cap shrinks, a myriad migratory species still show up at their northern destinations weeks before they’re supposed to. The pine beetle furthers its westward invasion, leaving dead forests in its wake— the winters, you see, are no longer cold enough to hit that lethal reset button that once kept their numbers in check.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I could go on, but you get my drift. And if the Climate-Change Hoax Machine is powerful enough to do all <em>that</em>, you know what?</span></p>

              <p>It's not that I'm not for protecting the environment, but the solution that is being put forward is nothing less than a sign that its business as usual for the corporatocracy that is only interested in monetary acquisition and political monopoly. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=27614">Any environmental concern is just superficial as the main pushers of AGW theory have already admitted.</a></p>

              <p>But as I've told you before, its not the desire to create a more environmentally sound world, but the fake "solutions" which doesn't solve what they claim to.

              <p>That is correct, manmade carbon dioxide is not the main cause for global warming. I can agree on it.</p>
              <p> But major disasters are rarely driven by just one cause. Like the Three Mile Island incident and the recent Financial Crisis it takes a "perfect storm" of happenstances and coincidences in order to create a major disaster.</p>
              <p>Yes, global warming has happened in prehistoric times and as recent as the 1400s in Greenland. But we have a new factor that has never happened before in Earth's history. We have a 7 billion sized population, burning fossil fuels and cutting down the jungles/forests that were supposed to recycle those carbon dioxides.</p>
              <p>We do not know the full consequences of what this new factor may bring but we know if this new factors nudge the temperature just 1-2 degrees it's more than enough to make the warming become from "mildly uncomfortable" to full blown droughts and floods.</p>
              <p>Yes, man made carbon dioxide alone is not capable of making major drastic changes to global warming. But all it takes is just a slight and miniscule contribution to the warming to completely disrupt our food and water supply.</p>
              <p>We <strong>may</strong>, in fact be recovering from the Little Ice Age but we have no idea how much more the warming's going to be and whether our current crops and glacial levels could still be maintained to support 7 billion people which is continuing to rise.</p>

              <p>First of all, the authors of those emails were scientists with significant influence to affect the dissemination of scientific information, which they did. They can't be compared to the insignificant forumers on this board.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I'm not advocating anything just because they are anti-estalishment or anti-government. This matter merely confirms my previous belief that the theory of AGW is not science-driven. Moreover, it seems curious why this is being glossed over by the MSM. A "scandal" by a celebrity would have generated news coverage many times over.</p>
              <p>With regard to the email about the lack of warming data, it seems to me that its the politics that is leading the science. Rather than admit that the environmental data collected revealed how flawed the theory of AGW is, they blamed the "inadequency" of the observation system.</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter of the owner of that blog has no so-called "credentials". It isn't a scientific paper we're discussing here. He merely summarises and links to the significant emails that point to fraud, probably with information taken from elsewhere.</p>

              <p>The ING Group is a Netherlands bank so probably would profit by providing the services for carbon trading.</p>
              <p>Walmart is a retail conglomerate which is heavily dependant on the transport of its good among its supermarkets so it would be badly hurt by the increased taxes on gasoline and carbon emissions.</p>
              <p>I don't think i need to elaborate on Toyota. They seemed to be quite capable of producing the zero emission vehicles that we want made.</p>
              <p>The rest of the 7 are all oil corporations. And part of the intiative to cut down on carbon dioxide emissions would have to include the shifting away from oil/coal/NG as our primary source of energy.</p>
              <p>So you are telling me, that 7 of the top 10 fortune 500 are conspiring to back an intiative that would eventually shoot their own foot so to speak?</p>
              <p>I see any efforts towards environmentalism requiring the efforts of coordinating hundreds of thousands of people, a scale only governments and corporations could support.</p>
              <p>Someone is bound to profit from it, trying to make sure no one's going to benefit from it is just as ridiculous as saying parasites are unnatural.</p>
              <p>Again, you continue to behave like i lack knowledge of the Venus Project and Zeigeist movements. I made the effort to read and understand it, thus i also know what needs to happen in order for it to become reality.</p>
              <p>It would involve violence and a lot of shedding of blood. Whether by nature or by the hands of Man i don't know. That is not what i think we need right now, though of course by sabotaging the efforts to combat global warming you might actually have the chance of getting it to happen.</p>

              <p> But major disasters are rarely driven by just one
                  cause. Like the Three Mile Island incident and the recent Financial
                  Crisis it takes a "perfect storm" of happenstances and coincidences
                  in order to create a major disaster.</p>
              <p>Yes, global warming has happened in prehistoric times and
                  as recent as the 1400s in Greenland. But we have a new factor
                  that has never happened before in Earth's history. We have a 7
                  billion sized population, burning fossil fuels and cutting
                  down the jungles/forests that were supposed to recycle those carbon
                  dioxides.</p>
              <p>We do not know the full consequences of what this new
                  factor may bring but we know if this new factors nudge the
                  temperature just 1-2 degrees it's more than enough to make the
                  warming become from "mildly uncomfortable" to full blown droughts
                  and floods.</p>
              <p>Yes, man made carbon dioxide alone is not capable of making
                  major drastic changes to global warming. But all it takes is just a
                  slight and miniscule contribution to the warming to completely
                  disrupt our food and water supply.</p>
              <p>We <strong>may</strong>, in fact be recovering from the Little
                  Ice Age but we have no idea how much more the warming's going to be
                  and whether our current crops and glacial levels could still be
                  maintained to support 7 billion people which is continuing to
                  rise.</p>

              <p>I know, there absolutely can't be a conspiracy involving thousands
                  of climate scientists, corporate figures and politicians scheming to
                  deceive us for whatever purposes. There just can't be right?</p>
              <p>Its simply the kind of behaviour which our social system produces via the profit-survival mechanism. Just like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg-52mHIjhs">how Bayer deliberately sold HIV-contaminated vaccines</a>,
                  once there is a vested interest attached to a particular outcome, the
                  groups that have the power will naturally gravitate towards it; even if
                  it goes against the facts or human concern.</p>
              <p>4 points as to why this is so important, which I took <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100018696/climategate-which-part-of-over-dont-these-people-understand/">from a Telegraph article</a>:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>1. A bunch of climate scientists at the Climatic Research Unit at
                  the University of East Anglia have been caught out cheating. They
                  distorted evidence, hid or lost inconvenient raw data, manipulated the
                  science towards a particular end, and set out to silence hard-working,
                  decent, honest scientists who disagreed with them.</em></p>
              <p><em>2. Those climate scientists aren’t just any old bunch of scientists.
                  They work at the very heart of the IPCC process. They – and their
                  friends: for this is a small and tight cabal, comprising around 43
                  scientists – are the ‘lead authors’ on the IPCC’s reports. They also
                  supply the most important of the four data records used by the IPCC.
                  They are the people telling our political leaders that the world is
                  suffering from catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming – caused
                  largely by the growth in CO2 emissions – and that urgent action needs
                  to be taken to prevent it.</em></p>
              <p><em>3. According to one estimate – by the International Energy Agency –
                  the global cost of dealing with AGW will be $45 trillion (that’s 2/3 of
                  the world’s current entire economic). This will mean our energy bills
                  will rise by perhaps a factor of ten; that we will be subject to more
                  and more pettifogging rules on what kind of lightbulbs we use and how
                  we dispose of our trash – perhaps even how often we’re allowed to fly;
                  it will mean governance by unelected “experts” and technocrats from the
                  UN; it will cripple industry; it will mean higher taxes; it will take
                  money from the middle classes in the Western world and hand them over
                  in the form of “compensation” to kleptocrat dictators in the Third
                  World; it will almost certainly send the global economy diving into a
                  double dip depression. We are, in other words, about to be presented
                  with the biggest bill in the history of mankind.</em></p>
              <p><em>4. Given what we now know about the reliability of 2 and the basis
                  of 1, are we really sure that with 3 we’re getting our money’s worth?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On
                  the issue of taking statements out of context etc, it seems like you're
                  trying to defend the indefensible. Without calling masscres
                  pacification, torture enhanced interrogation techniques or the War on
                  Terror overseas contingency operations, let's just call them as they
                  are. Manipulation of data and efforts to silence skeptics by pressuring
                  scientific journals among others.</p>
              <p>And more so after <a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/climategate_mann_now_turns_on_jones">Michael Mann has attempted to distance himself from the released emails.</a> Granted this may an effort to make the best of a mess, but if there was nothing devious about them, why the flip flop?</p>
              <p>As prominent geologist Dr. Don Easterbrook commented:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.climatedepot.com/a/4140/Geologist-appalled-at-NYTs-Krugman-Legitimate-scientists-do-not-doctor-datahijack-peerreviewsend-fraudulent-data-to-UN-that-is-used-to-perpetuate-greatest-hoax-in-the-history-of-science"><em>"Legitimate

                  they don't want seen, hijack the peer review process, personally attack
                  other scientists whose views differ from theirs, send fraudulent data
                  to the IPCC that is used to perpetuate the greatest hoax in the history
                  of science, provide false data to further legislation on climate change
                  that will result in huge profits for corrupt lobbyists and politicians,
                  and tell outright lies about scientific data."</em></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its not like the science is unsettled. <a href="http://www.livescience.com/environment/070312_solarsys_warming.html">We know that the Sun is causing warming on Earth as well as on other planets</a>. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3624242/There-IS-a-problem-with-global-warming...-it-stopped-in-1998.html">We know that global temperatures (whatever that means) has been falling (ironically from CRU data).</a></p>
              <p>But because of the vested interest associated with climate change solutions, <a href="http://www.infowars.com/climategate-the-silence-is-deafening-from-the-corporate-media/">the corporate media has largely taken a one-sided point of view</a>.
                  Why else would the BBC delay the release of the story despite knowing
                  of it a month before the emails were leaked? Why would CNN waited 6
                  days after the emails were released before reporting on it? Moreover,
                  the first reports by the MSM focused largely on data theft or omitted
                  the implications of scientific fraud. Given the MSM's history of
                  reporting skewd information over the last decade, its surprising there
                  is still so much trust in such a failed institution.</p>
              <p>As I have
                  said again and again, even if the science for a warming is concrete,
                  the solutions being pushed are completely a scam.  By all means, I'm
                  for environmental protection and the full utilisation of renewable
                  energy methods. Even the prominent pro-climate change scientist James
                  Hansen has voiced opposition to such a scheme. Not only did he called
                  for the failure of the Copenhagen Summit:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>I<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/02/copenhagen-climate-change-james-hansen">t would be better for the planet and for future generations if next week's Copenhagen climate change summit ended in collapse.</a></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but he also recognised that the cap-and-trade scheme would just be business as usual for the corporatocracy:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-james-hansen/g-8-failure-reflects-us-f_b_228597.html">[Phasing out coal emissions would] <em>require nothing less than an energy revolution based on
                  efficiency and carbon-free energy sources. Alas, we won't get there
                  with the Waxman-Markey bill, a monstrous absurdity hatched in
                  Washington after energetic insemination by special interests. </em></a></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-james-hansen/g-8-failure-reflects-us-f_b_228597.html"><em>For all its "green" aura, [the] Waxman-Markey [climate bill] locks in fossil fuel

                  scheme. </em></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No
                  offence, but I think you're being extremely naive to believe that a
                  concerted effort by governments and the corporatocracy to regulate
                  carbon emissions would also threaten their own interest for the sake of
                  environmental concern.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.grist.org/article/griscom-little5/"><em>The Energy and Natural Resources Committee heard statements from
                  leaders representing eight big energy companies, including General
                  Electric, Shell, and the two largest owners of utilities in the U.S.,
                  Exelon and Duke Energy. Six of the eight said they would either welcome
                  or accept mandatory caps on their greenhouse-gas emissions. Wal-Mart
                  too spoke in favor of carbon caps. The two outliers from the energy
                  sector, Southern Company and American Electric Power, delivered pro
                  forma bids for a voluntary rather than mandatory program, but they,
                  too, broke with tradition by implicitly acknowledging that regulations
                  may be coming, and offering detailed advice on how they should be
                  designed.</em></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And
                  of course, don't forget Goldman Sachs, which has both hands in Obama's
                  pants, and especially Al Gore, are all set to profit immensely from a
                  carbon derivative market (Who says the bankers have learnt their
                  lesson?). Rather than "shoot their own foot", its going to be the
                  middle and lower classes that will be bearing the <br>financial and
                  social costs of such a policy. Do we really need this to teach us about
                  elite double standards when history is full of it?</p>
              <p>That's the
                  sickness with society. Problems only get 'solved' when its profitable
                  to do so while getting mixed up with all kinds of vested interests,
                  just like the present situation. As George Carlin put it:</p>

              <p>I don't get whether you're trying to be sarcastic or trying to say something smart. You need to present it a lit better. But unless i'm positive of what you're trying to say i think i'd avoid commenting on it.</p>
              <p>Regarding your 4 points.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em><strong>1. A bunch of climate scientists at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia have been caught out cheating.

              </blockquote>
              <p>Up till now, there are no concrete evidence <strong>none</strong> that shows that these scientists have doctored their evidence. There are questionable quotes in their emails but no climate scientists have ever stepped up to say their numbers were fudged in any way.</p>
              <p>The IPPC depends on the data from thousands of scientists and institutions spanning the globe and all agreed there is global warming and there is a connection between man made greenhouse gases and temperature rises.</p>
              <p>Where is the evidence that there is an attempt to silence "hard-working, decent, honest scientists"? That is how scientific peer review work, if your numbers and evidences don't hold up to scrutiny then it is not valid. Just as simple as that.</p>

              <p>Wait,  this is a complete distortion of what happened.</p>
              <p>We are talking about the hacked CRU emails. This point attempts to imply that all the lead authors of the IPCC are implicated into the emails.</p>
              <p>THIS is fudging up the facts.</p>
              <blockquote>

              </blockquote>
              <p>No arguments from me on the first portion of part 3.</p>
              <p>The Western world had their party, and now they expect the Third World to just foot the bill? They created the conditions for the "kleptocrat" dictators in the first bloody place. How about Bangladesh and the Maldives though? They aren't dictatorships last i've heard.</p>
              <p>For part 4, we're not buying a bloody car here. We're gambling on the possibility on whether our children would have to suffer for our indecisiveness.</p>

              <p>No we don't. It's just a theory brought forth.</p>
              <p>If you have bothered to read furthur down your link you would have read that there is no connection between recent solar activity and global warming. <strong>NONE. </strong></p>
              <p>You know what the funny thing about your link on global temperatures is ? Written in 2006,  It says that global temperature stopped between 1998-2005. Yet 2006 was the hottest year on record in the US.</p>
              <p>The five warmest years since the late 1880s, according to NASA scientists, are in descending order 2005, 1998, 2002, 2003 and 2006.</p>
              <p>So do you know what's the funniest thing about the falling global temperature link you've sent? The writer basically took the period where the earth was actually experiencing the hottest periods since 1880s and took it to mean temperature isn't rising.</p>

But then I realised it was much bigger than that. Entire villages could be wiped out if one of the glacial lakes burst."<br><br>In China, studies have shown that the rapid melting of the glaciers will result in an increase in flooding in the short term, state news agency Xinhua has reported.<br><br>In the longer term, it said, the continued retreat of glaciers would lead to a gradual decrease in river flows, severely affecting large parts of western China.<br><br>Experts say the resulting water shortages could hit the economic development of China and India, with potentially dire consequences for development in two of the world's most populated countries.<br><br>Even in low-lying Bangladesh, prone to severe floods, the IPCC has said rivers could run dry by the end of the century.<br><br>But research on the impact of global warming on the rugged and inaccessible Himalayas remains sparse, with the IPCC describing the region as a "blank spot" due to a lack of scientific data.<br><br>Even the experts disagree on the issue, with some arguing that some of the Himalayan glaciers are actually advancing.<br><br>India's Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh recently came under fire for denying that climate change was causing Himalayan glaciers to melt, citing research by the Indian geologist Vijay Kumar Raina.<br><br>The Nepal-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) has studied the Himalayan region for more than three decades and warns of an "urgent need" for more research on the impact of climate change.<br><br>"There are so many uncertainties surrounding where, how and to what extent the Himalayan region will be affected by climate change," ICIMOD climate change expert Arun Shrestha told AFP.<br><br>"But most experts accept that temperatures are changing, and this is happening more rapidly at altitude."<br><br>ICIMOD has warned that the current trends in glacial melt suggest flows in major Asian rivers including the Ganges, Indus and Yellow Rivers will be "substantially reduced" in the coming decades.<br><br>"The situation may appear to be normal in the region for several decades to come, and even with increased amounts of water available to satisfy dry season demands," it said in a recent report on the Himalayas.<br><br>"However, when the shortage arrives, it may happen abruptly, with water systems going from plenty to scarce in perhaps a few decades or less."<br><br>Shrestha added: "When the glaciers get hotter, you get more water, but there comes a point when the water will run out.<br><br>"It's like a bank balance, if you're not putting money in, you can't take it out."</div>
