            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has again refuted charges of apartheid against the two million plus population of Hindu immigrants, saying that half his cabinet comprised non-Muslims.<br><br>With a half the ministers in his cabinet being non-Malays and non-Muslims, how could they be expected to support a policy of apartheid, he asked the media during a tour of Penang, The Star newspaper said Friday.<br><br>He was responding to a front-page article in a foreign newspaper -- that he did not name - alleging discrimination and apartheid against the Hindu population.<br><br>Badawi said that based on his experience as former foreign minister, he found that the international community did not understand the political situation in Malaysia and often had a wrong perception of Malaysian politics.<br><br>'They don't really understand the power-sharing concept practised by the Barisan Nasional (the ruling coalition) government because such cooperation of political parties has never worked and existed in their countries,' he said.<br><br>'You think they (the cabinet) would go with the government and allow themselves to be associated with it? Tak masuk akal (This does not make sense),' he said.<br><br>He lambasted the Hindu Rights Action Force (Hindraf) that organised a rally on Nov 15 to highlight its grievances. The rally was declared illegal and 31 leaders have been detained.<br><br>'When Hindraf said we carried out genocide, its allegation was a sign of evil. Please think about the cabinet. Half of it is non-Malays, non-Umno members and non-Muslims,' he said.<br><br>The prime minister also expressed concern over the slew of rumours via SMS that could bring discord to the country.<br><br>'When the country gets into trouble, who will win or benefit? Nobody,' he said.<br><br>Badawi said that instead it would affect the economy and 'that is why we need to consciously guard the peace in the country.'<br><br>'We must always ensure that our relationship (between each other) is well and we must always be united,' he emphasised.</div>
