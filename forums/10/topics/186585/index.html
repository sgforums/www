You ought never have one without the other. Mr Plate might be forgiven for his cynicism, but yet he fails to consider his own country and other established democracies like Switzerland and Finland. Corrupt leaders do not emerge from democracy i.e. democracy does not produce corruption. ANd anyway, heard the phrase "legalized corruption" before? That is what we may call our overly-inflated ministerial salaries. Also, being a foreigner, Mr Plate clearly misunderstands the role of MM, ascribing it to a mere "mentoring" of ministers.<br><br>No doubt clean governance is necessary, but equally essential is the political development of multiparty democracy.<br><br>Sorry, too late, no time to write more...<br><br>the pikamaster (on hiatus)</div>
