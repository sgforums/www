              <p>The government is worried that Singaporeans are not getting hitched - there are increasing number of singles in Singapore. The government is offering a slew of incentives, and even advice on how to date, how to get married, but I doubt it will work. The problem I think is because these measures target the symptoms and not the cause of the problem; in my opinion, the root of the problem lies in the minds of peasantboys and peasantgirls.<br><br>Singaporean peasantboys are one of the most boring members of the adult male species - dating them is often a somniferous experience. Ever notice that the only topic of conversation that excites them, other than their jobs, is National Service? Yes we really want to hear about your days in the army, crawling through mud, or gory tales of training accidents - that really gets our loins burning. The added irony is that despite their macho tales, most peasantboys are mummy's boys - what self-respecting man would continue staying with his parents till the late 20's and even early 30's , letting his mum cook, clean and wash for him? Real women want to date grown up men, not little boys staying at home.<br><br>Peasantboys are also wimps - they let peasantgirls walk all over them. They act as their chauffer, their ATM machine and chaperone all rolled into one. Yet, in another ironic twist, they are also male chauvinists, hanging on to anachronistic notions of submissve virginal women who would do as they are told and go off looking for Vietnamese village brides when they don't get what they want here. A message for you peasantboys: most women would love to defer to their men, but strong men who know what they want, who have strength of character. We are not going to submit ourselves to wimpy mummy's boys.<br><br>Peasantgirls are not any better - they suffer from the 'I want the cake and eat it syndrome'. Singaporean women want the rights of Western Women and none of the obligations. They also want all the rights of Eastern Women and none of their obligations either.<br><br>If you want to be treated as an equal - behave like an equal. Don't expect your man to pay for everything and not even thank them for it. Go dutch sometimes. Take a taxi to the place that you are going to meet your peasantboy and not expect to be driven around like an invalid all the time. If you want to be an equal in marriage, contribute equally to the family accounts - in what world do you think it's fair that you get to spend your husband's money whilst keeping your salary for yourselves?<br><br>On the other hand, if you want to be treated like an Eastern Woman, for the husband to take care of you financially, materially, drive you around, do things for you then be prepared to take on the obligations of an Eastern Woman. Go learn how to cook - and not just instant noodels and fried eggs. Learn how to sew. Defer to your husband as the head of the household, and learn how to care for him as the primary caregiver (whilst he is the primary breadwinner).<br><br>Neither Western or Eastern Woman is superior; however the Singapore Peasantwoman who wants the best of both worlds is definitely inferior. Make up your mind - choose one or the other. Even Peasantboys wake up one day when they have been screwed over in a bad deal for too long.<br><br>So the problem as I see it is that the Peasantboy and the Peasantgirl are fudamentally a bad match, to the extent that they probably hate the sight of each other. Peasantboys complain about Peasantgirls all the time, Peasantgirls whinge about Peasantboys, and neither the twain shall meet.<br><br>Therefore, until the mindsets of peasantboys and peasantgirls are changed, no amount of economic incentives or nagging by the government will turn things around.<br><br>The illnesses of the peasant are of the mind, and unless it's cured, it's probably better they don't get together and procreate.</p>

                                tales of training accidents - that really gets our loins burning.
                                The added irony is that despite their macho tales, most peasantboys
                                are mummy's boys - what self-respecting man would continue staying
                                with his parents till the late 20's and even early 30's , letting
                                his mum cook, clean and wash for him? Real women want to date grown
                                up men, not little boys staying at home.<br>
                                <br>
                                Peasantboys are also wimps - they let peasantgirls walk all over
                                them. They act as their chauffer, their ATM machine and chaperone
                                all rolled into one. Yet, in another ironic twist, they are also
                                male chauvinists, hanging on to anachronistic notions of submissve
                                virginal women who would do as they are told and go off looking for
                                Vietnamese village brides when they don't get what they want here.
                                A message for you peasantboys: most women would love to defer to
                                their men, but strong men who know what they want, who have
                                strength of character. We are not going to submit ourselves to
                                wimpy mummy's boys.<br>
                                <br>
                                Peasantgirls are not any better - they suffer from the 'I want the
                                cake and eat it syndrome'. Singaporean women want the rights of
                                Western Women and none of the obligations. They also want all the
                                rights of Eastern Women and none of their obligations either.<br>
                                <br>
                                If you want to be treated as an equal - behave like an equal. Don't
                                expect your man to pay for everything and not even thank them for
                                it. Go dutch sometimes. Take a taxi to the place that you are going
                                to meet your peasantboy and not expect to be driven around like an
                                invalid all the time. If you want to be an equal in marriage,
                                contribute equally to the family accounts - in what world do you
                                think it's fair that you get to spend your husband's money whilst
                                keeping your salary for yourselves?<br>
                                <br>
                                On the other hand, if you want to be treated like an Eastern Woman,
                                for the husband to take care of you financially, materially, drive
                                you around, do things for you then be prepared to take on the
                                obligations of an Eastern Woman. Go learn how to cook - and not
                                just instant noodels and fried eggs. Learn how to sew. Defer to
                                your husband as the head of the household, and learn how to care
                                for him as the primary caregiver (whilst he is the primary
                                breadwinner).<br>
                                <br>
                                Neither Western or Eastern Woman is superior; however the Singapore
                                Peasantwoman who wants the best of both worlds is definitely
                                inferior. Make up your mind - choose one or the other. Even
                                Peasantboys wake up one day when they have been screwed over in a
                                bad deal for too long.<br>
                                <br>
                                So the problem as I see it is that the Peasantboy and the
                                Peasantgirl are fudamentally a bad match, to the extent that they
                                probably hate the sight of each other. Peasantboys complain about
                                Peasantgirls all the time, Peasantgirls whinge about Peasantboys,
                                and neither the twain shall meet.<br>
                                <br>
                                Therefore, until the mindsets of peasantboys and peasantgirls are
                                changed, no amount of economic incentives or nagging by the
                                government will turn things around.<br>
                                <br>
                                The illnesses of the peasant are of the mind, and unless it's
                                cured, it's probably better they don't get together and
                                procreate.</p>

              So?
              If there is a real shortage of good men (local) in Singapore, maybe it's time to be more open minded.
