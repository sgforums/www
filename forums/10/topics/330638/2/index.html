              <p>I wonder what gives the thread starter the right to degrade singaporean guys and singapore ladies. Secondly, I wonder what gives the thread starter the right to segregate/degrade the singapore guys/ladies into so called peasant groups. Thirdly, what gives a person the right to define the guys and ladies from singapore into a single narrow band or over simplified view of society. And also, I wonder what gives a person the right to judge others and criticize their "peasant" mindsets as to how a single person (the thread starter) thinks the sg guys/ladies should be under his/her own judgemental mindsets.</p>
              <p>And finally, for the thread starter, here's a quote from Mother Teresa.</p>
              <p>“If you judge people, you have no time to love them.”</p>
              <p>And a few others that I think is helpful to regain some humility for the thread starter.</p>
              <p> “Judgements prevent us from seeing the good that lies beyond appearances.”</p>
              <p>“We can never judge the lives of others, because each person knows only their own pain and renunciation. It's one thing to feel that you are on the right path, but it's another to think that yours is the only path.”</p>
              <p>“It is just as cowardly to judge an absent person as it is wicked to strike a defenseless one. Only the ignorant and narrow-minded gossip, for they speak of persons instead of things.”</p>
              <p> </p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>The government is worried that Singaporeans are not getting
              hitched - there are increasing number of singles in Singapore. The
              government is offering a slew of incentives, and even advice on how
              to date, how to get married, but I doubt it will work. The problem
              I think is because these measures target the symptoms and not the
              cause of the problem; in my opinion, the root of the problem lies
              in the minds of peasantboys and peasantgirls.<br> <br> Singaporean peasantboys are one of the most boring members of the
              adult male species - dating them is often a somniferous experience.
              Ever notice that the only topic of conversation that excites them,
              other than their jobs, is National Service? Yes we really want to
              hear about your days in the army, crawling through mud, or gory
              tales of training accidents - that really gets our loins burning.
              The added irony is that despite their macho tales, most peasantboys
              are mummy's boys - what self-respecting man would continue staying
              with his parents till the late 20's and even early 30's , letting
              his mum cook, clean and wash for him? Real women want to date grown
              up men, not little boys staying at home.<br> <br> Peasantboys are also wimps - they let peasantgirls walk all over
              them. They act as their chauffer, their ATM machine and chaperone
              all rolled into one. Yet, in another ironic twist, they are also
              male chauvinists, hanging on to anachronistic notions of submissve
              virginal women who would do as they are told and go off looking for
              Vietnamese village brides when they don't get what they want here.
              A message for you peasantboys: most women would love to defer to
              their men, but strong men who know what they want, who have
              strength of character. We are not going to submit ourselves to
              wimpy mummy's boys.<br> <br> Peasantgirls are not any better - they suffer from the 'I want the
              cake and eat it syndrome'. Singaporean women want the rights of
              Western Women and none of the obligations. They also want all the
              rights of Eastern Women and none of their obligations either.<br> <br> If you want to be treated as an equal - behave like an equal. Don't
              expect your man to pay for everything and not even thank them for
              it. Go dutch sometimes. Take a taxi to the place that you are going
              to meet your peasantboy and not expect to be driven around like an
              invalid all the time. If you want to be an equal in marriage,
              contribute equally to the family accounts - in what world do you
              think it's fair that you get to spend your husband's money whilst
              keeping your salary for yourselves?<br> <br> On the other hand, if you want to be treated like an Eastern Woman,
              for the husband to take care of you financially, materially, drive
              you around, do things for you then be prepared to take on the
              obligations of an Eastern Woman. Go learn how to cook - and not
              just instant noodels and fried eggs. Learn how to sew. Defer to
              your husband as the head of the household, and learn how to care
              for him as the primary caregiver (whilst he is the primary
              breadwinner).<br> <br> Neither Western or Eastern Woman is superior; however the Singapore
              Peasantwoman who wants the best of both worlds is definitely
              inferior. Make up your mind - choose one or the other. Even
              Peasantboys wake up one day when they have been screwed over in a
              bad deal for too long.<br> <br> So the problem as I see it is that the Peasantboy and the
              Peasantgirl are fudamentally a bad match, to the extent that they
              probably hate the sight of each other. Peasantboys complain about
              Peasantgirls all the time, Peasantgirls whinge about Peasantboys,
              and neither the twain shall meet.<br> <br> Therefore, until the mindsets of peasantboys and peasantgirls are
              changed, no amount of economic incentives or nagging by the
              government will turn things around.<br> <br> The illnesses of the peasant are of the mind, and unless it's
              cured, it's probably better they don't get together and
              procreate.</p>
