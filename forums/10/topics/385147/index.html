Correct me if I'm wrong, but in order for a constituency to be even be able to vote, it needs to be contested. The past couple of elections have seen many many that have had walkovers, and only a few are contested at a time.

Even if the opposition wins in the few constituencies that are contested, it is not enough to win enough seats in Parliament to form a new Cabinet. The PAP will still be the governing body after the next election.<br><br>If Singapore is to truly see a change in government, the opposition must be able to challenge all constituencies, if not majority of them, such that if they do win their contested constituencies they would have a bigger stake in the Cabinet.<br><br>That said and done, while I have no love for the PAP, I wouldn't want to see voters vote the opposition simply out of spite. The reason for this? We don't have a singular opposition force. Our opposition is made up of several parties, namely SDP, WP etc. Each will field their own candidates to contest a constituency. Let's say that they do manage to win enough seats in the Parliament to create a new Cabinet, each. What we have now is a mish-mash of several political parties in one coalition government. Remember the last time that happened? An army general by the name of Suharto had to step in and 'fix' the government because nothing was being accomplished. <br><br>Do correct me if I'm wrong about how the election works though.

              <p>Although I dislike the current PAP, I must say I have no faith in Opp. parties at all (not that I have faith in PAP). I mean look at Dr. CSJ and you will know what I mean.</p>
              <p>Currently, I don't see there is any way to pull PAP down. The only way to is for all the opp. party to come together and form 1 big united group but I guess that's impossible.</p>
              <p>One thing I'm wondering though, if in any case any one of the Opp. party were to win and take charge, do you really think they will dismantle the previous set system or do you think they will make use of the chance to enjoy what PAP had previously enjoyed (e.g. the millions dollar minister salary)?</p>
              <p>In any case, I doubt they will cut the salary down, its a big sum of money, who wouldn't want it? Maybe they might cut it down but guaranteed it won't be a significant difference.</p>
              <p>My current perspective is both group (PAP and Opp. Parties) currently have no real abilities in governing Singapore. Personally, I don't care whether is it PAP or the Opp. parties but someone with real abilities to govern Singapore as a leader in the right direction got to step up before its too late.</p>
              <p>The current PAP have done nothing but increasing our difficulties surviving in Singapore. Look at the absurb HDB prices. Look at the never-ending rise in cost of living (e.g. GST increment). Look at our stagnant salary despite the increase in cost of living. Oh wait, stagnant the wrong word, there will be changes to our salary, change for the worst due to influx of cheap foreign 'talents'. We can't compete with the foreign 'talents' unless we sell ourselves cheap too.</p>

              <p>Although I dislike the current PAP, I must say I have no faith
              in Opp. parties at all (not that I have faith in PAP). I mean look
              at Dr. CSJ and you will know what I mean.</p>
              <p>Currently, I don't see there is any way to pull PAP down. The
              only way to is for all the opp. party to come together and form 1
              big united group but I guess that's impossible.</p>
              <p>One thing I'm wondering though, if in any case any one of the
              Opp. party were to win and take charge, do you really think they
              will dismantle the previous set system or do you think they will
              make use of the chance to enjoy what PAP had previously enjoyed
              (e.g. the millions dollar minister salary)?</p>
              <p>In any case, I doubt they will cut the salary down, its a big
              sum of money, who wouldn't want it? Maybe they might cut it down
              but guaranteed it won't be a significant difference.</p>
              <p>My current perspective is both group (PAP and Opp. Parties)
              currently have no real abilities in governing Singapore.
              Personally, I don't care whether is it PAP or the Opp. parties but
              someone with real abilities to govern Singapore as a leader in the
              right direction got to step up before its too late.</p>
              <p>The current PAP have done nothing but increasing our
              difficulties surviving in Singapore. Look at the absurb HDB prices.
              Look at the never-ending rise in cost of living (e.g. GST
              increment). Look at our stagnant salary despite the increase in
              cost of living. Oh wait, stagnant the wrong word, there will be
