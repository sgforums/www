The price for failure in biotech can be very high. A pharmaceutical company has gone off laying off entire laboratories just because of one drug's failure. That wasn't even the first time that has happened. Even if we pick low risk research, the returns aren't great at all. The point of A*Star is not to produce technocrats but scientists! There's a huge difference between technocrats and scientists! Aside from the fact the former are bureaucrats and not even scientists for that matter.</div>

Both methods and ideals are identical, and it is an open secret Yeo had the silent backing of MM Lee during his tenure as head of A*Star.<br><br>Possibly the only thing lacking is Yeo's relatively inept command of the English language as compared to Lee. His tit-for-tat spat with the ex-A*star scholar exposed his petulance and emotional tandrums and could easily have been outmanoeuvred had the scholar been a little more diplomatic.<br><br>Ironically, his daughter's recent sparring match prompted a silent audience from the head honcho (Lee), lest people start claiming that the Lee houshold is 'not in order'.<br><br>We will never know whether taking the 'good advice' may have led to equally good (or better) results. Yet we cannot deny the success his brand of leadership has brought.<br><br><blockquote><br>LKY is revered and respected as much by many Singaporeans, as also hated by those whom he had unfairly treated, and continue to suppressed the "Truth" from being revealed.<br><br>While no one system is best for all, do we have the best system as it is today - given the closed political, social, economic and cultural environment that the MAJORITY of Singaporeans are familiar with ?<br><br>Is Philip Yeo the "be-all-and-end-all" authority in the manner that the Best of Singapore's Future is to be moulded, or do Singaporean not have a say in the values of ourselves as an INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY ?<br><br>Is everything said by the supposedly Elected Government merely political rhetoric, and not count for anything ? </blockquote>LetÂ’s not forget that change takes time. We cannot expect overnight results, nor should we demand them.<br><br>Dr LeeÂ’s points concerning the biotech investment clearly rattled Philip Yeo, prompting a rather sarcastic response which in turn saw an equally blunt reply from Dr Lee. The can of worms it opened will surely keep A*star on their toes, and any failed investment will almost certainly be an embarrassment now that the issue has been discussed in the open. With Philip Yeo leaving the organisation, expect A*star to appoint a more diplomatic face as incoming chairman.<br><br>It took a heavyweight to put a street bully in his place, and her comments echoed the silent majority of educated dissenters, so for once, at least there was a voice of reason spoken loud and clear, never mind that it came from a member of the Lee Family.<br><br><blockquote><br>Without any further chiding or reminder, the stark reality of failure is quite clear to Singaporeans.<br><br>However, what has the leadership done to nurture and encourage success, and prevent the Singapore Society from accepting failure as second best ?<br><br>Has it not been a fact that the Singapore Leadership has nurtured an environment that guarantee success for its own exclusively monopolistic and absorbing enterprises and ideas; while creating a hugely competitive environment for Singaporeans ?<br><br>It is easy for Philip Yeo to preach about - NO VALUE SYSTEM, NO FUTURE; when the values are created by his own self-interest, and the Future is already staked out for him and the Government.<br><br>Is there any system to accomodate the values of the Majority of Singaporeans ?<br><br>Is there a Future for our Singaporean Values ?<br><br>Does the Singapore Leadership accept the values of the MAJORITY of Singaporeans ? </blockquote>Unfortunately, for success, every system used will undoubtedly leave behind debris in its destructive wake. Ours is no different.<br><br>Like the analogy of the private sector, CEOs hire people who can work <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with</span> them, and not work <span style="text-decoration: underline;">against</span> them. No one ever brings in people who object and raise questions on a daily basis. And even if one disagrees, they do so discreetly and through proper channels. There is always a select protocol involved when dealing with top leadership.<br><br>Again I am not condoning the monopolistic style of our current government, but leaders, whether good or bad, will always have their detractors. It is therefore important to target only the critical mistakes that have been made. No point aiming the whole forest and missing the trees.<br><br>In the stark reality of life, it is unfortunately the leaders who take all the credit, while their subordinates do all the leg work. Raffles will forever be remembered as the founder of Singapore, but the forgotten William Farquhar was the unassuming grunt who managed the island state.<br><br>Similarly, after its immense success and progress over the years, everyone remembers only the Â‘founding fatherÂ’ of Singapore, and visionaries like Goh Keng Swee and Hon Sui Sen are sadly consigned to history, only to be remembered by those who acknowledged their supreme contributions over the one who merely talked the talk.<br><br>It is therefore change that will consign the backward thinkers in our current leadership to historical oblivion, once Singaporeans learn to wield their vote with more authority and less Â‘fearÂ’.<br><br>With those who clearly reject Philip YeoÂ’s Â‘NO VALUE SYSTEM, NO FUTUREÂ’, as seen in <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:8f8c2545fa991110VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD:STForumArcIOID:2b962545fa991110VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD:STForumArcDate:1175205540000" rel="nofollow">Â‘My way or the highwayÂ’ </a>and <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:6e8b2545fa991110VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD:STForumArcIOID:2b962545fa991110VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD:STForumArcDate:1175205540000" rel="nofollow">Â‘No place for discussion in Philip YeoÂ’s value systemÂ’</a>, surely hope remains for the future that not all Singaporeans will abandon their homeland, but instead stay and fight?<br></div>
