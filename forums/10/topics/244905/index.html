            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that present day Singapore came about through hard work and materialism. Everyone wants the basic necessities and is willing to go through all means and ways to get them even through hornest work, so technically Philip Yeo is wrong to comment about the older generation having a good value system.<br><br>In fact, as CEO of A*Star, he should look further down the road as the basic family system begins to disintergrate due to work stress and economic inflation. The government is now complaining about declining birth rates and yet Mr Yeo chose to complain about the value system of Singaporeans.<br><br>Technically, there is no way to deconflict the issues being brought up, so Mr Yeo should shut his yap before the social and economic systems crumble.</div>

But in today's world, it's about creating movable platforms for one to jump around without constraint against new ideas. The only constant is change, and ideas propel the change. Hence the gulf in perceptions on values between the old and the new. They are so stuck on stability that they fall back on the only criteria they know - straight A's scholars to bring in results.

This promotion of mass practical knowledge application is more important than sheer promotion of academic talents and grades. It can be done by EDB, MOE, MTI and our ministers at every level and can be done through schools and work places. Philip Yeo merely promotes foreign investments and has neglected coming up with relevant master plan to achieve higher level of excellence needed to turn around the moribund economy.

We can hurl the blame left right centre, but incidentally, raising the next generation and educating them happens to be the responsibility of the previous. If they turned out differently from what the previous expected, then just who is at fault? Moreover, the previous generation in Singapore simply are so stuck in an old mindset that incidentally will not survive in this world. The previous generation believe that mere hard work will succeed. I am afraid that is not the case now. With the world so globalised, it is hard to stay rooted in one place anymore. The previous generation was guaranteed an iron rice bowl, but such a bowl no longer exists. Criticise the youth of a lack of loyalty, but Singapore's development is rapidly running onto a plateau. Reinventing has its limits.</div>

The problem is A-Star is not an organization to produce technocrats! Its a place to produce groundbreaking researchers that can put Singapore proudly on the World Map!<br><br>The problem is picking exceptionally creative people who do ground breaking research is like gazing crystal ball. ... If you read my earlier post on Terman Longitudinal studies on high IQ children, picking the "would be creators" is not as easy as administering an IQ test or using GPA. Terman himself failed.<br><br>Setting a high GPA is only a form of self-deception into deceiving onself that the investment in the potential scholars are well spent.The system just created a filter for scholars who are are afraid to take risks. Well.... lets waits another 5 years and we would know the results..<br><br></div>
