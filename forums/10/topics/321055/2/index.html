              <p>Isn't the forum here already very open and people voice out
              watever they wanna say without fear ? I thought the opposition
              always wanna have a discussion, or a face to face debate over the
              television over policies made in singapore ? Suddenly, it seems to
              me tat they wanna act like the gov, want to have a one sided media
              and want to promote censorship. U just want to have a
              propaganda machine or u want to have a real discussion ?</p>
              <p>I personally do not care if the person I am debating is an
              agent, or a opposition party member, or even LKY or george bush. In
              here, whoever u r is not important. The important things is the
              facts and points u wanna bring out. Everyone is equal. Tis is the
              real "liberal" media.</p>
              <p>If tis cyber agent is pointless and insulting, he will
              be counter productive and the cyber agents actually make PAP
              look worse. If tis cyber agent make sense, then why care if he
              is a cyber agent or not ? We wanted to be closer to truth, not to
              be mindless emotional mob. Tis makes me wonder if the opposition
              comes into power, will they do exactly the same thing as the
              current gov in controlling the media.</p>
              <p>Not anybody who talk for the gov is a cyber agent. I can tell u
              proudly I get nothing coming over here to write all these replies.
              If u think deerhunter should not go about scolding vulgarities and
              name calling, then tat is precisely the reason why we push tis
              thread to prevent people from spourting vulgarities and name
              calling here. But all tis while u seemed to be supportive of people
              to speak vulgarities and name calling.</p>

              <p>Ideally PRP is right in asking people to be more courteous and not resort to insults in putting their views across.</p>
              <p>My point was to balance his views in this regard and try to get the power that be to realize that he cannot keep using his one-sided propaganda like in the past refusing to consider other points of views put up by many ordinary citizens.</p>
              <p>If he is unrepetent and even putting up more cyber-agents to slam forummers with some hidden agendas not made accountable to citizens then this is a bigger problem from my perspective. No one I believe is denying what PRP has said so do be accommodate of non-government mainstream propaganda views different from yours for once.</p>

              <p>PAP and PAP government have absolutely no problem with exercising their own freedoms of the same order we are discussing.Being the government it is its duty to answer to any complaints or feedbacks to serve the citizens.</p>
              <p>In fact they can the civil defamation laws as the trump cards to sue anyone whom they regard as threats even on people as civic as Mr. Brown. Administratively they have even greater power to deal with critics like dismissing or transferring civil servants speaking out of line or not seen as acting in concert with their own interest.</p>
              <p>They would sue anyone in their own appointed courts for even the slightest innuendos as happened in Tang Liang Hong case with civil laws narrowly interpreted as libellous for remarks made against them even in the course of electioneering without giving their oppositions defence such as fair comment or public interest.</p>
              <p>It is therefore quite incorrect your underlying assumption that government is entitled to same freedoms of speech or replies as done by critics of government.</p>
              <p>The plain fact is the PAP and PAP government has been enjoying one-sided freedom of expression for too long it cannot now accept critics' views and must try new way and means to target the critics even against Mr. Brown who is just a citizen with views concerning governing of the country.</p>
              <p>The real issue here today is whether PAP and PAP government should be more equal than equal while all are supposed to be equal in the manner of speech.</p>
              <p>So weighing both the freedoms of speech or expressions on both sides there is no need to be so overly concerned that when critics speak up there must be opportunities for PAP and PAP government to rebut or reply.</p>
              <p>If MM Lee does not use such defamation suits so often against his political opponents will we today be running out of political leaders of calibre?</p>
              <p>For every good and bad policy there is always a price to pay. If we want to practise a "no free lunch" system of government, we may end up having a greedy money-grabbing government on the other side of the equation.</p>
              <p>It is quite wrong for the government to control the media or pass draconian laws just for their own purposes without looking at the other side of the equation what we stand to lose.</p>
              <p>It does not make sense that we allow a one-sided policy like "no free lunch" or "meritocracy" to dominate our political system for so long and today we as a people are suffering from naivety of accepting such propaganda.</p>
              <p>It is the duty of all citizens to speak the truths against wrongfulness of government without fear or favor in whatever forums or occasions to put us back on proper path of growth and vibrancy as Hong Kong people are now enjoying.</p>
              <p>Just look at Deerhunter. He obviously has been sent here (not of his own natural volition) to slam at citizens' views and opinions with vulgarities and name callings.</p>
              <p>Is the Freedom of Speech balanced with complete control of PAP and PAP government of the public media leaving the internet now as the only available free venues to express their views and opinions ?</p>
              <p>Is there a justification for ministers to send cyber-agents to come to slam people using hidden unequal selfish political power and probably using publicly paid servants to do so.</p>

Even if they are not the government, PAP itself is a big organization with money and ability. If anybody think of taking on any big organization, a rich man, a lawyer (if you are not), then they have to know that these big organization, with big money, big knowledge…are unfair advantages against you from the very beginning.

They can stand in the parliament and spoke against the PAP, right at their nose, how to put the idea across, how to use the right words, definitely no vulgarities…how many of these opposition you had in mind that had this caliber?

              <p>It is also to be noted from what you are now saying that it is a government which does not shy from abuse of power in whatever form whether in the realm of information control or use or misuse of civil libel for political persecution of oppositions like Tang Liang Hong or resorting to hypocrisy and propaganda to get what it wants to the exclusion of all else like the real problems belying NKF or Shin Corp or Mas Selamat. You have just confirmed people's fear that it has become a monster with its own agendas fixated to its own self-important belief in "winner takes all" paraphrased from your own quote in Chinese.</p>
              <p>The long and short of all your views is it is no longer a government which was once elected to serve the people's interest with honor and civility but one which exists by its own power that all agenda.</p>

              over all of us? Yes, very much so. It is a fact of life. Even if
              they are not the government, PAP itself is a big organization with
              money and ability. If anybody think of taking on any big

              to know that these big organization, with big money, big

              in the world, the US. When you face the immigration officer and the
              custom officer, you will know that in the name of counter
              terrorism, they can subject you to any kind of searches and checks
              and fine. And if you are a Punjabi, or wear moustache, good luck.
              They are not our government, but I travel there with a passport
              that the US government recognizes, why should we be subjected to
              all these kind of harassment, all in the name of national security?
              Isn’t that what you hear in Singapore, all in the name of national

              you see, is that the Singaporeans, when faced with these angmoh,
              lan lan. but in Singapore, they would curse and swear at
              PAP.</span></p>

              government, the Malaysian government, he did not have a level
              playing ground. Do you think Anwar has a level playing ground now?
              LKY had to have people like Goh KW, Toh CC, Rajaratnam…just to name
              a few.<span> </span> It may be difficult to find good
              people to join politics, is it because they prefer easy life making
              money? Or many of them already join PAP? And if you form an
              opposition with people like drawer, Fantagf, leeky, AndrewPKYap…and
              ask for a level playing ground, then the PAP will have to go

              <p>So true... But can't deny that CSJ do have some points at some time... Somehow DeerHunter is very similar to CSJ; able to offer valid points at time, but just have to include name calling within the points.</p>

                                              definite yes, because there are other factors involved. I know for

So isn't it a case of government being too paranoid of any dissent in whatever media people may choose to communicate in.

              <p>You are being paranoid about forumers who posted their views here just because they do not agree with government's views or policies. There is nothing new. By your negative attitude towards the forumers they are not likely to agree with you or government policies more. If there is any goodness in your presence here please let us hear your substantive views based on logics and stop inferring that anyone who disagree with government policies are people up to no good. For your information I have never posted any article wishing any body dead or bad. If Minister Teo Chee Hian is to be taken for his words he has said recently that the government will try in future to avoid using the carot and stick approach in presenting its policies in future. If that has the true meaning of change for the better, you should stop all these pressure on forumers to agree with your posts or slander people with name calling as you deerhunter and gazelle seem to be doing here.</p>
              <p>You have stated many times just because the government's has been elected or deemed to be elected due to GRC walkovers it seems to be having the right or power to
                                          do as it likes because of its mandate of being elected.</p>
              <p>My interpretation is that The fact it is elected does not automatically give the government carte blanche power to use its position as
                                          government to unfair advantage does it?</p>
