              <p>Actually, to be objective, the discussion I had with stupidissmart was far better than the likes of Gazelle and clones. Sure, there might be some heated exchanges here and there occasionally (which he would call 'resorting to attacks'), but nonetheless, he did made multiple valid points.</p>
              <p>But I have the impression that he's a little stiff in some sense, and that he does tend to misunderstand my posts (and perhaps me misunderstand his too) in that short discussion we had recently.</p>
              <p>I guess the "hostility" towards PAP supporters, especially newly registered posters, is due to Gazelle and his clones. I believe redDust had such an experience before, when he registered newly and posted something good about the government, and was once accused of being Gazelle's clone.</p>

              <p><br>I don't qualify myself as a PAP supporter, I support some of their policies wholeheartedly, I agree with them on some of their policies though I wish they could be more sensitive to the people, I believe there are much more they could do for Singapore and should not be complacent.

I may have somethings in common with Gazelle and the like on government policies, but the languages, the approach in defence are never some of these.</p>
              <p>I voted for WP, I support Sylvia, Low TK, but that definitely does not make in the same rank like Fangtagf, M13 and clones as opposition supporters.</p>

              <p>There can be many reasons why different types of people , the 33.3% supported the Opposition.</p>
              <p>1. Transparency</p>
              <p>2. Accountability</p>
              <p>3. Freedom of speech and assembly.</p>
              <p>4. Social safety net / welfare</p>
              <p>My friend who voted in singapore finds that despite economic capabililty (contributed by the people), the first 2 factors are important to him when he votes.</p>
              <p>He feels that he knows what is missing in the system and having them will improve the system.</p>
              <p>So, he feels that people should vote to improve the system and not just accept status quo.  This can mean voting for the same party they voted before or giving a party more power to effect changes.</p>

              <p>Heh. I want to support WP because I supporter Sylvia too, but too bad, they didn't come to my constituency to campaign :(</p>
              <p>Being in agreement or in disagreement on opinions is one thing. However, when some trolls made certain glaring mistakes and was pointed out, some trolls flared up and used even more uncouth words, instead of understanding and admitting the errors.</p>

              <p>yup, i have the famous qlpp to contend with then, even tho' i think he still exists in our midst, in the guise of a different nick. best part is i get more cordial treatment now.</p>
              <p>seriously, there are a fair amount of good things that the ruling government did. my purpose is not to discuss this here. i would rather touch on things which i feel strongly that we have not make progress on. regardless, i am just an average joe blogg dispensing my views, they are by no means authoritative. they are subject to discussion or opposition, which i accept if they makes sense. i agree with you that stupidissmart is more rationally balanced even though he comes in from the position of pro-govt, just as i have on the opposite, generally speaking. but it doesn't mean we do not acknowledge the pros and cons that happened in this country.</p>
              <p>there are that few `extremists' like a gazelle that makes this place alive. pro- or against- government, they make for good reading, and sometimes a good laugh when they write what they wrote.</p>
