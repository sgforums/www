              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>With the modern skyscrapers dotting the
              Singapore skyline, fancy cars on the streets (mind you they all belong
              to foreign money launderers),and a transportation system Lee Kuan Yew
              and his cronies stomp around the world claiming a miracle. But how do
              you judge a miracle. Is it these modern fixtures or is there more to
              it? <br><br>If a man were to consider the people as the most important
              possession of the country; the litmus test for a great nation, Lee Kuan
              Yew's Singapore fails miserably. A look at Singaporeans will tell you
              this. They are a people who are insecure, unduly afraid of even the
              slightest provocation, a people who lack any burning passion or love
              for anything except how to earn a buck, a generally effete and weak
              people, a people who cannot run jump or swim compared to anyone else in
              the free world and who judge their acceptance by the Lee Kuan Yew
              clique as their passport to success. This is not saying much, I
              confess, for my fellow Singaporeans. Of course I now live in California
              and had lived lived in Europe before then. I am therefore not, thank
              God, altogether a Singaporean. <br><br>Let me give you 2 examples on
              the complete lack of any adventure in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore
              "digits"; a term by which Lee Kuan Yew has called his citizens. Even
              though there are nearly 4.8 million Singaporeans, one third of them
              foreigners, there are no real sportsmen in the country. No Singaporean
              ran the mile in 2 minutes and never will. <br><br>But you recall only
              a few months ago, Singapore's state controlled press with great fanfare
              and drum beat announced that 2 Singaporeans were going to sail round
              the world! Imagine that! A feat indeed! But when you realise what
              happened, it wasn't like that at all. There were hardly any
              Singaporeans that knew how to sail, despite being surrounded by
              tropical waters, let alone around the world. In fact, Lee Kuan Yew's
              Singapore government went around and handpicked a couple of people, all
              expenses paid to crew on ocean going sailboats on a round the world
              itinerary! The skipper was a foreigner, the navigator was a foreigner
              and anyone who did any real sailing were all foreigners, not
              Singaporeans. The 2 miserable Singaporeans had to just stay on the
              boat, hopefully not getting sea sick, and pose for a few photos which
              were promptly printed on the front pages of the State Controlled
              Singapore Press, with the words, "Singaporeans sail the World". A
              desperate attempt to show a better side. <br><br>The same with Everest
              conquering Singapore housewives! The same nonsense yet again. Singapore
              housewives conquer Everest! My God, what a feat! But truly it was
              nothing like that. It was a publicity stunt. Lee Kun Yew and his Public
              Relations crew got around and persuaded a couple of housewives to climb
              the mountain all expenses paid. And climbing it from the North Face is
              not such a big deal anyway, supported by a gang of Sherpas who do
              everything possible for you, making it nothing more than a breeze. It
              would cost at least about $60,000.00 to do it, in Nepal permit fees and
              the salaries of more than a dozen Sherpas. Even Japanese housewives
              have done it but there is a difference. Those women really wanted to do
              it, and did it with their money. Not the stage managed , all expenses
              paid, Singapore version, involving hand picked reluctant housewives! <br><br>It
              would be entirely true to say, the average Singaporean lives in fear.
              And the fear stifles their development and their achievements. And this
              fear makes them less competitive, innovative and ultimately less happy.
              And not being happy it does not further the country's progress, and
              with a bunch like this, Singapore is a failure, not a success. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">A
              country needs independent thinking citizens who follow their passion,
              not what Lee Kuan Yew says is good for them.</span> It is the independent
              thinking people with novel ideas that propels any country to greatness.
              Not the I follow you in line type you find in Singapore. </strong></span><br><br>Take
              the average Singapore parent. They live in fear of the Lee Kuan Yew
              government. They are afraid to protest the theft of government monies
              by the Ministers, several millions of dollars each year, for fear of
              being punished. They fear to criticize the lack of human rights that is
              denied them. They fear to speak against the lack of a free press. They
              fear everything. They fear their shadows. <br><br>And they make sure,
              for the safety of their children, lest Lee Kuan Yew is offended, that
              they too live in that fear. Their children are told not to say anything
              against the government with the proverbial "walls have ears" warning.
              So the children too grow up the fearful pathetic souls like their
              parents. <br><br>And the teachers too are no different. They tell
              their students to conform to remain politically correct at all times in
              accordance with the Singapore strongman's doctrine. Not to protest, to
              oppose or do anything for themselves that is out of the ordinary. <br><br>When
              I was a boy in a Singapore school I was no different. I was afraid to
              speak. Success meant passing exams and being as obscure and hidden as
              possible. And when you said anything, you said what was politically
              correct. The only reason why I am different today is because I managed
              to set myself free and leave the country altogether, thank God for it. <br><br>Children
              went to school and became lawyers doctors and engineers not because
              they wanted to help mankind, or even because they loved it. They went
              because it meant making money. It did not matter if it was the most
              boring thing in life. And once they qualified in their profession, the
              learning stopped completely. Not a single lawyer in that island has in
              his head, any literature, or anything else for that matter.<br><br>Compare
              an Australian boy. He grows up with an imagination. His teacher in
              school and parents support him with it. He looks up at the sky and
              wants to be pilot. And he does it. He hangs around flying clubs and
              helps around. He saves some money. He works 2 jobs saving up for his
              lessons. Eventually he gets a job as a crop duster but hangs in there
              for a lifetime. He achieves his dream and becomes a great aviator, or a
              professional cyclist or a world class entertainer or whatever. Or he
              might end up protesting outside the governor's house for his failure to
              protect the Kangaroos. The Australian boy is brave, he has courage and
              he is happy. Very happy. Such a boy loves his country and his country
              becomes great because it has great people behind it.<br><br>The Singapore boy is no match to the Aussie. The Aussie has what it takes. And he has it because he is not afraid. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br><br>It
              is the living in fear, that makes Singapore a very weak country and
              incapable of success.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> In this regard, Lee Kuan Yew has failed Singapore
              miserably. Instead of applause, he should be held to account. He has
              destroyed the most valuable asset the country needs, it's people.</span></strong></span><br><br>Gopalan Nair<br>39737 Paseo Padre Parkway, Suite A1<br>Fremont, CA 94538, USA<br>Tel: 510 657 6107<br>Fax: 510 657 6914<br>Email: <a href="mailto:nair.gopalan@yahoo.com">nair.gopalan@yahoo.com</a><br>Blog: <a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/</a><br><br><em><em><em>Your letters are welcome.

              <p>Once again, the weak knees bastard hides behind the stars and stripes to takes a swipe on our fellow citizens and our society, whom had given him a chance to excel but now turn traitorous and shit upon us.</p>
              <p>How apt an insult of this thread by his supporters. What human qualities are they agonising over?</p>
              <p>That we cant swim? That we cant run?</p>
              <p>What utter rubbish is this goo pak lan talking about? Is goo pak lan blinded by american pussies and boobs that he is revelling in? Or is he star strucked by the topless blondes in Australia bondie beach, hoping to keep the gal's brothers and dad happy by praising them, sucking their balls and licking their asses?</p>
              <p>The only passion seen here is his passion to denigrate our courageous boys, who had sacrificed their youths to protect our nation, generation after generations, passed on the next with honour, so that that mad cow's family, relatives and friends and ours can sleep in peace at night.</p>
              <p>Does it matter if we DONT excel in sports? What is sportmanship anyway, but a set of gentlemanly Queensberry rules to have fun in? Someone will win, and someone has to lose. So what does it matter? What have one lost or won? A medal? Can it feed a person, or signify that he is made for life?</p>
              <p>Sports are meant to be fun. It is participation, and not another rat race. Passion comes when one is truly and enjoying such games It cannot be forced up. No matter how much trainning one hopes to gain, it will never turn one into a olympic medallist if the passion is not there.</p>
              <p>And passion is not built up by enforcement of training. It must come from a person's will - to be the best in that particular field, and a freedom of choice for one. It is perfectly ok if we dont have any medals on the international stage - MOST CRITICALLY - IT IS THE PARTICIPATION.</p>
              <p>And i am glad to see our students having fun in their ECAs, or canoeing, cycling in the weekends, along with adults, some of which plays games such as football, tennis, golf, etc. Sports isnt all about winning medals. It is about having fun and learning gentlemanly behaviour as well as working together as a team.</p>
              <p>That is the true quality one should be seeking. And be proud that majority of Singaporeans are doing it, even our Tai Chi workout elders at dawn of each new day.</p>
              <p>Will someone please tell that american citizen goo pak lan to  stop sucking on Aussies cocks, and open up his eyes at least for once and then look around? He can continue on sucking after that since he enjoy aussie cocks, though I doubt if his writing would be better.</p>
              <p><strong>In terms of better human qualities, the  total failure is NOT </strong>upon my fellow citizens, who had courageously and perservered against constant challenges that are often beyond our control. The evidence is clear and a shining example of success for we, the people had worked hard, in peace and nose to the grind to survive and did in this crisis of financial and health.</p>
              <p><strong>The total failure, as evident in his writings,  is this worthless ex-citizen goo pah lan.</strong> Not because he love to suck up aussies' cocks, for as long as he keeps it private, it is his freedom, even though a perversion to many conservative folks. It is his cowardice, bowing, crawling before those whom he sought to challenge, yet behave like a mouse, and roaring like a toothless tiger shamelessly once miles away.</p>

Nair was arrested and charged on June 4 for insulting a public servant.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Nair is also facing a second charge, this time for insulting a judge in the High Court, Justice Lai Siu Chiu.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">He has since been released on bail of $5,000.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In his press statement, Nair said, “</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I did not at anytime send any emails to Judge Belinda Ang or anyone else as far as this incident is concerned.” He added that the authorities have seized his computer notebook as well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Nair also defended his right to criticize Justice Ang in his blog posting. “I believe as a human being, it is my right and my duty under the constitution of the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Republic</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be able to speak free as a free man and to state what I have seen and heard. This benefits Singaporeans and the world at large. If I did not say what I saw, I would in fact be hiding the truth.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Saying that although he has migrated to the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">United States</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and is now a </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">US</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> citizen, he has been “closely monitoring the political situation in </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">”. He added that his efforts “are directed to (sic) the plight of human beings who are denied their human rights and how I can expose the injustices they suffer.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“In the US where I come from, the judiciary just as any other government or official body is open to criticism and they accept it as necessary for the advancement and improvement of the administration of justice”, he explained.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Nair said that after attending the three day court sitting for the assessment of damages in the lawsuit brought by Mr Lee Hsien Loong and Mr Lee Kuan Yew against the Singapore Democratic Party’s chief Dr Chee Soon Juan and SDP Central Executive Committee member Ms Chee Siok Chin, he had “no doubt at all that this Judge was clearly unfair towards Dr. Chee and Siok Chin and she did not appear to conduct herself as an impartial judge in court sitting in judgment between the parties.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">It was, he said, “necessary for me as a human being, to make it public and to the world what this court actually was, since they would not have had the luxury of being in court during the 3 days.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Nair said that it was not his intention to ‘malign or cause distress to anyone’. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“It was never my intention to malign or cause distress to anyone and if the words that I had used had this effect, I withdraw them and apologize. But as far as the contents of my blog post; as to the events that occurred during the 3 days in court, it is an accurate observation which I have stated under my right as a free man”, he said.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Singapore will survive SM Lee (Kuan Yew) but provided he leaves the right legacy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">What sort of legacy he wants to leave is for him to say, but I, a blooming upstart, dare to suggest to him that we should open up politically and allow talent to be spread throughout our society so that an alternative leadership can emerge.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">So far, the People's Action Party's tactic is to put all the scholars into the civil service because it believes the way to retain political power forever is to have a monopoly on talent. But in my view, that's a very short-term view.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It is the law of nature that all things must atrophy. Unless SM allows serious political challenges to emerge from the alternative elite out there, the incumbent elite will just coast along.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">At the first sign of a grassroots revolt, they will probably collapse just like the incumbent Progressive Party to the left-wing PAP onslaught in the late 1950s. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">I think our leaders have to accept that Singapore is larger than the PAP. <br><br><strong>Government scholars</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">For Singapore to survive, we should release half our talent - our President and Overseas Merit scholars - to the private sector.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">When ten scholars come home, five should turn to the right and join the public sector or the civil service; the other five should turn to the left and join the private sector.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">These scholars should serve their bond to Singapore - not to the Government - by working in or for Singapore overseas. As matters stand, those who wish to strike out have to break their bonds, pay a financial penalty and worse, be condemned as quitters.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Economics</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Take our industrial policy. At the beginning, it was the right thing for us to attract multinationals to Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">For some years now, I've been trying to tell everybody: 'Look, for God's sake, grow our own timber.' If we really want knowledge to be rooted in Singaporeans and based in Singapore, we have to support our SMEs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">I'm not a supporter of SMEs just for the sake of more SMEs but we must grow our own roots. Creative Technology's Sim Wong Hoo is one and Hyflux's Olivia Lum is another but that's too few.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">We have been flying on auto-pilot for too long. The MNCs have contributed a lot to Singapore but they are totally unsentimental people. The moment you're uncompetitive, they just relocate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Q. Why has this come about? <br>A. I suspect we have started to believe our own propaganda. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Civil Servants</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">There is also a particular brand of Singapore elite arrogance creeping in. Some civil servants behave like they have a mandate from the emperor. We think we are little Lee Kuan Yews. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">SM Lee has earned his spurs, with his fine intellect and international standing. But even Lee Kuan Yew sometimes doesn't behave like Lee Kuan Yew.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Littlespeck comment:-</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Mr. Ngiam Tong Dow, 66, who retired from the civil service in 1999, is among a handful of permanent secretaries who had helped Mr. Lee shape today's Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The others include JYM Pillai, Sim Kee Boon, Howe Yoon Chong and Philip Yeo.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">His frank, straight-talk interview with The Sunday Times came as a surprise to most Singaporeans, young and old. It caused a ripple among readers who read it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Apparently many had missed it, skipping it as just another establishment figure talking of his past life and former colleagues in passive, polite tones.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A lawyer and a former journalist now in public relations totally missed it and are now frantically seeking a copy of the report on Sept 28.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Currently chairman of HDB Corp, a privatised company, Chiam had been known to people in the civil service and old journalists as a quiet doer, rather than a high-profile public articulator of policies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">That was, of course, when he was in the civil service from 1959. In 1970 he came Singapore's youngest permanent secretary. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Ngiam had shown his brilliance to people who worked with him - and of course to his political bosses. In public he had always maintained a silent profile. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">That he has spoken out in this manner points to of several things. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Firstly, he must be perturbed enough by what is happening in Singapore, especially in the civil service, that he felt compelled to speak out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Secondly, what he said confirms a freer political atmosphere in Singapore in which the authorities are encouraging people to speak out, even critically, as long as it is in Singapore's interests.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A third point is his frank reference to Mr. Lee Kuan Yew as still the overriding authority in Singapore. All his suggestions are addressed to him, not Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Few Singaporeans possess his countrywide, historical perception of Singapore straggling three generations now mired in one of its worse economic crises.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It set off some discussions in the Internet chat-sites with some people wondering whether the government will take action against him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Asked why was Singapore on auto-pilot for so long, Ngiam replied: "I suspect we have started to believe our own propaganda."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">What he said about government scholars, a freer political environment and allow some of the brightest to be used outside the government - and if necessary, serve as an alternative elite leadership was a total surprise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Ngiam's call to cut (by half) the number of scholars in the bureaucratic or political leadership, elitism in government and intellectual arrogance reflect what some critics have privately said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">But Ngiam, being an insider with longtime access to the policy-making process, is the first to have articulated his thoughts clearly. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">As a lifelong civil servant, he is not allowed by law to join the ruling People's Action Party, all these years the line separating them is hardly visible.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">His most telling suggestion is for Lee to leave behind a "free politics" legacy by allowing talent to be spread throughout Singapore so that an alternative leadership can emerge.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Singapore is in the midst of a "remaking" exercise that will include restructuring its economy and loosening its political and social environment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">For a whole generation, thousands of parents are pushing their children towards scoring "A's" in their O- and A-level exams to win a prestigious government scholarship.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">(Some 1,400 "A" level students score distinctions in all four subjects, so commonplace a phenomenon that "A's" in the tougher Special Papers are needed to qualify for overseas scholarships.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">This virtually guarantees them a top-level, high-paying bureaucratic job. The road is long, tense and arduous. Some parents dedicate their lives to help their children achieve it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">I know of someone whose son is in the gifted programme. The father, with a Master degree in Mathematics, takes leave from work whenever his son, in his lower primary classes, faces a year-end exam.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Asked why, he said he wanted him to gain a top political or civil service post through the scholarship trail. For him and his wife, it is a 20-year plan for the 7-year-old.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It is one in which many take but few succeed. Once there, there is no fear of being retrenched unlike thousands of other mortals when profits plunge. </span></p>
