            <div class='col-md body'>First off,I'm a Singaporean first and foremost.I am serving NS now,I have lived here most of my life besides 2 years in Australia,from which I returned to serve NS,studied in SJI and St Michael's.<br><br>I'm of mixed background,Chinese,Indian and Portueguese.<br><br>I have realised,even as I grow older,that there is a feeling of marginalisation among all the many races of Singapore.They are always saying that we are a multi-cultural,multiracial society,that we are an egalitarian society based on justice,equality,progress and all these other words.<br><br>We all know the reality.Within my lifetime,within 2 to 3 generations,Singapore will become a Chinese city,with an overwhelming Chinese culture.It won't be Singapore anymore.It will be Lee Kuan Yew's vision of what he wants Singapore to be.A Chinese outpost,a part of Greater China.<br><br>The Why?Ask any person of minority background,and a very significant number will tell you that they perceive a marginalisation of their own cultures,of a general insensitivity by the Singaporeans of Chinese background around us.<br><br>In our media,East Asia,specifically Taiwan and China,are played up,more so than necessary.While both are economic powers,thir presentation in our media is given great import,more so than needed.Meanwhile,other markets,promising ones at that,are ignored,such as the Middle East and South Asia.<br><br>Even in movies such as "I Not Stupid", where are all the other races?It is a movie set in Singapore,filmed in Singapore,made for a Singaporean audience.Where are the others?<br><br>Similarly,the Speak Mandarin campaign promotes the utilisation of Mandarin.Very well,it does confer an economic advantage to its speakers,but the working language of Singapore,the common space,is English.What you have,are people speaking in Mandarin because they are so used to it,among others who don't understand it.Just because one is Chinese or partly so doesn't mean I speak Mandarin.I might speak Hokkien,Hakka,Cantonese,or not a word of any dialect at all!They are promoting it to the detriment of English.<br><br>You have many normal Singaporeans speaking Mandarin among those who don't understand it,and it is incredibly rude and insensitive,no matter the culture.In my platoon,where there are 3 non-Chinese speakers,they frequently give briefings in Mandarin,talk about work in Mandarin,or chit-chat in Mandarin.That excludes us from the fabric of the platoon,the bonding of us as a part of the platoon.I use this an analogy,something that perhaps other non-Chinese or part-Chinese would have experienced.Why do you think so many Indians and Malays or others in a workplace or school would form cliques of dark-skinned people?Certainly,the example I provide is a contributing factor to it.<br><br>I do not look the remotest bit Chinese besides my eyes,and look more like a Brazilian/Malay/India/Nepali rather than a Chinese,yet have people asking me questions instinctively in Chinese,despite them not knowing my background.Similarly,in camp,when I answer phone calls,the first words answered are also Mandarin.I have nothing against it,but you are operating in a common space with people of various backgrounds.Use the working language as its meant to be used.<br><br>This sign of a language becoming more dominant,more so than necessary,is what many would feel to be an indicator of Singapore's future.A decreasing standard in English?Blame the Speak Mandarin campaign.<br><br>Similarly,there is also a perception that if one is Chinese in origin,you are more likely to be granted citizenship,employment passes,promotions or permanent residency.Whether rightly or wrongly,this is the prevailing conception,and this, worries me.<br><br>Will there be a place for me and other like me,part-Chinese or otherwise,'minorities',in this country?More and more,I feel like an alien in Singapore at times.Will there be a political and social reform,or will things go as they are and evolve to their natural state?<br><br>This is my home.I have sweated for it and at times bled for it,though only a few minot scratches.I have certainly endured discomforts for it,as well as constraints placed upon my time and my personal life,just like every other male Singaporean.These are where my roots are.<br><br>Will it be my home in the future?And that depends on what type of future it will be....</div>

There are forumners talking about legislation against gender discrimination, age discrimination and even discrimination relating to sexual preferences. I think of these, the most serious and sensitive is racial discrimination.<br><br>If minority races find it difficult to obtain employment due to racial discrimination by the dominant race, there can be social unrest with grave consequences. Sri Lanka is a good case in point.</div>

No matter wad race ppls, people tend to favour and feel at ease with individuals that can speak their own langguage or noe their culture. Just like at NTU,NUS we see students of a particular nationality crowding together. Bcos they share the same langguage and have more common grounds for discussion.<br><br>As for Mr Yao........bro u got it wrong again. When Singapore became independent, we choose english as a working langguage and the ethnical langguages as official langguage..........Bcos we have a other races to factor in too. If u chose Chinese, other race will feel discriminated and outcasted. This also go against the founding principles of Singapore, "regardless of race, langguage or religion", that also the reason why we left Malaysia Federation. As the UMNO then believe in "Malaysia Malay".<br><br>I noe this is a little hard for u to understand as China is made up of predominantly Han ppls which stands around 91%. Eventhough there are other ethnic minorities, they are largely "sinotized".</div>
