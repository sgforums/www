(MEF)<br><br>(3)    Use say 20 % of reserve to generate interests and profits from low-risk long-term bond-category investments and plow back such gains into the Medical Endowment Fund. 10% of reserve can be used to set up another endowment to provide limited unemployment bridging financing. Such endowment system will not result in welfarism under prudential insurances and mutual assistance scheme to prevent abuse. At this moment, coupled to the high costs propagated by the government citizens are too stressed and will always face problems with livelihood whenever breadwinner especially sole breadwinner falls ill or unemployed.<br><br>(4)   MEF to operate like Medical Shield - to finance partially (up to 60%) major illness treatment costs (40% payable by citizens under existing medishield)<br><br></div>
