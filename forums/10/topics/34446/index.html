            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Civil servants are required to sign "Aku Janji" ("I agree")<br>declarations before they could continue in office;  UMNO Youth<br>encourages undergraduates to report those of their lecturers who<br>they deem to be anti-government;  anyone who brings to public<br>notice government shortcomings and its political chicanery, even<br>if by the opposition, is treachery.  The list goes on.  The Prime<br>Minister, Dato' Seri Mahathir Mohamed, thinks it a good idea so<br>his 21 year governance would carry on for ever.  But this reveals<br>not strength but weakness.  And a rebellion in the making<br>against a decaying monolithic collossus which remains in<br>office by threats and wose.<br><br>The "Aku Janji" does not have the force of law;  Dr Mahathir<br>thinks this would make it all but impossible for them to defy him<br>and his administration.  It would not.  The civil servants signed<br>something more severe under the Government Orders when they took<br>their jobs, which has a section so strict and so pervasive, and<br>with penal sanctions for its breach.  So, why does the government<br>make it an issue which only reveals the divisions in society that<br>it fights against?  Because civil servants, collectively, are<br>disinclined to back the UMNO-led government in power than at any<br>time in the past.<br><br>Their actions reflect not treachery or a deliberate move to<br>confront but of the schisms in Malay society which Dr Mahathir<br>encouraged -- the deliberate split which made UMNO illegal forced<br>the first fissure;  the humiliation of Dato' Seri Anwar the<br>second, and more dangerous, since it questioned Dr Mahathir's<br>leadership for humiliating a chief.  Instead of resolving this,<br>UMNO insists its view is the only one.  But the Malay challenges<br>it, and reveals the schism UMNO cannot handle on its own.<br><br>The more UMNO -- more than the National Front (BN) it<br>controls -- insists upon it, the more fascist Malaysia becomes.<br>There is only one view allowed for civil servants and all who are<br>paid by the government.  This is enforced in schools, colleges<br>and universities.  There is nothing but anecdotal evidence to<br>prove that teachers and lecturers spout anti-government<br>propaganda.  There is no inquiry or investigation to suggest it.<br>But the evidence the government accepts usually comes from UMNO<br>Youth, whose word is accepted as the gospel by the authorities.<br><br>Now it has compiled a list of anti-government lecturers who,<br>according to the UMNO Youth education bureau head, Dr Adham Baba,<br>"spead anti-Government messages and campaigns to influence staff<br>and students".  And the insidious assumption, which is clear from<br>his statement, that university lecturers are allowed to be<br>members of political parties only if in BN parties.  There are<br>several in government -- at the centre and in the states -- who<br>went by this route.  I know of several who were lobbying for<br>parliament and state seats while lecturing at universities.<br><br>On the principle that the only political view allowed is to<br>back the government, UMNO Youth is shocked at these displays of<br>political independence and the candour which reveals to<br>undergraduates the importance of critical thinking;  that this is<br>impossible when students are encouraged to censure their<br>lecturers anonymously for not being politically correct.  This<br>was rife in Nazi Germany and Communist Russia and China, and<br>parents sent their parents to their deaths on these complaints.<br><br>So how did Dr Adham and his men investigate this breach of<br>political correctness?  They got undergraduates to inform them of<br>"deviations" from the norm amongst lecturers.  Since<br>undergraduates are not allowed to be involved in politics, why is<br>this allowed?  The education ministry, he says, would<br>investigations, but his quislings would not come forth until they<br>are protected from harm, possibly by their lecturers.  How could<br>it when it should look at this breach of the undergraduate<br>undertaking not to be involved in politics?<br><br>In any case, why did the ministry agree to investigate<br>complaints from the youth wing of a political party?  What<br>standing does it have to go off on its own and demand redress,<br>when it should first have directed their complaints to the UMNO<br>supreme council for further action.  Or is it now the norm t can?<br>If so, then one can understand why the civil servant is fed up<br>with this attempt to bring them under UMNO.  There are already<br>dangerous signs:  scholarships are, in practice, given only to<br>those who can furnish proof their parents are members of a BN<br>party.<br><br>It reveals a dangerous trend which divides the country<br>between those who support UMNO and BN, to whom go the perks of<br>government, and those who do not who should be treated as harshly<br>as possible, and their children damned for their parents' less<br>than enthusiastic support of the government or who, in principle,<br>would not join a political party or would rather remain neutral.<br>These decisions are made so casually and callously that it<br>reflects not just the fascism this suggests, but a breakdown of<br>what we know, and honour, as Malaysia.<br><br>M.G.G.
