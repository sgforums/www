              <p><strong>Written by our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>The ruling party is wooing HDB home owners by giving a one-off property tax rebate of up to $120 to help them cope with the expected increase in the property tax next year following the increase in the annual value of their flats.</p>
              <p>The prices of HDB flats have sky-rocketed in the last few months, hitting a record high in June this year.</p>
              <p>PRs constitute as high as 40 per cent of the buyers of resale flats, according to a report released by real estate agency ERA.</p>
              <p>An Indonesian PR “spoils” the market lately by forking out $653,000 for a 4-room HDB flat in Queenstown which is sufficient to pay for a condominium of similar size in the suburbs.</p>
              <p>Though the rebate is likely to be a tiny fraction of the tax increase, it is likely to win much goodwill from the public.</p>
              <p>HDB has been trying desperately hard of late to allay Singaporeans’ fear and anxiety over the rising prices of HDB flats by promising to build more new flats to increase the supply.</p>
              <p>The rising demand is fueled largely by the influx of foreigners who now make up about 36 per cent of Singapore’s 5-million population.</p>
              <p>The ruling party is taking small, but conspicuous measures to “sweeten” the ground before the next election which is due to be called by 2012.</p>
              <p>A few weeks before the 2006 election, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced a “Progress Package” which put a few hundred dollars into the pockets of every Singaporean voter.</p>
              <p>After the ruling party won the election, GST was increased to 7 per cent not too long after followed by hikes in public transport and ERP.</p>
              <p>It may have to spend more efforts this time round to convince Singaporeans to cast their votes for them again.</p>
              <p>An increasing number of Singaporeans are getting frustrated and unhappy at the government’s policies, such as its immigration policies.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee had said earlier during his National Day Rally speech in August that the inflow of foreigners will “slow” as the economy is not doing well.</p>
              <p>With Singapore out of recession, it is unsure if the intake of foreigners will increase again.</p>
              <p>Recent public statements made by senior leaders seem to suggest that the government’s pro-foreigner policy is here to stay and Singaporeans have no choice but to live with it.</p>
              <p>MM Lee Kuan Yew urged Singaporeans to “bear” with the tide of foreigners which has now become a “flood”.</p>
              <p>With no credible opposition to challenge the ruling party, it is almost impossible to vote it out of office.</p>

              <p>Standard practice - Increase everything then give you a one off "rebate/subsidy" to make it look like they care.</p>

              <p>So many ways of explaining that.</p>
              <p>Energy conservation tax, is similar to the implementation of water conservation tax. They will tax a percentage of what you use. In water's case, it's 30% (and there is a waterborne fee that is almost another 30%, which I do not know what this waterborne fee is about, and thus we pay up to 60% more for every 100% water we use)</p>
