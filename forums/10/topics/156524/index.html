GLCs can be re-constituted into smaller units for take over by SMEs to run them more profitably with expansions plans based on full market practices not government support in tenders.

This has been recognized by the government lately after the last two recessions when they found out that foreign MNCs they have been promoting all these years do not have root in Singpaore and would make decisions to shift out their operations to wherever offering them better deals and opportunities.<br><br>If our economic policies have been based on nurturing local indigenious content and technology start-ups, we will not come to the point of wanting to get government into business. It is not that bosses of SMEs are stingy or do not know how to do business like employing right people to run them. The real problem was created far far back when we took the step of giving all the incentives to foreign companies while neglecting to grant the same to local.<br><br>GLCs are run essentially by connected academically qualified civil servants they regared as talents who cannot think entrepreneurial or able to compete as well as the private sector businesses. The failures of Singapore economy to grow in the direction of third-wave technology start-ups can be seen clearly when we objectively look at our economic upgrading as compared with Korea and Taiwan or Finland and Switzerland. Many smaller countries are well on the way to building their own technology sector in manufacturing and services owing to their paying attention to broad-based education and nurturing their real technology applications among the masses.<br><br>GLCs are merely re-constituted from some original public services in certain areas where the government wanted to cut down its expenditures or charge for services to market values to avoid welfarism. We might have gone overboard in avoiding welfarism to the point of making unwarranted surpluses from the ordinary citizens from housing to utilities. I have given many examples before in other posts on the same subject. It is all about the fundamental of government. One step wrong, all the rest will be wrong no matter how we try to fix them. We will succeed only when fundamentals are right. Is our government going to promote the locals and facilitate them in growths and setting new directions for growths.<br><br>GLCs now have to go into bidding for government jobs in order to sustain their profitability. Mediacorp failed because of lack of entrepreneurial spirit of the private sector. The fact that any GLCs are big is not success. Public monies and public tender opportunities given to these GLCs are the real sustenance.<br><br>So you see, GLCs are artificial creatures and they are now largely supported by public monies and public opportunities so that they can be more profitably run. By letting these GLCs operate within the domestic sector, government is competing with the local businesses which finally are deprived the opportunities and cannot grow.<br><br>Why do we reach the point why government has to step in to do business? It is the same as why we keep promoting elitism to the point where we have to ask where are all the practical entrepreneurs gone? People are factor of success. By facilitating and promoting people's growth intellectually or in business, it is real good corporate governance.<br><br>Without governing the correct first steps and addressing the fundamental all will go wrong and finally the country will be without talents and without entrepreneurs and only the leaders will be left to decorate a bit of this or that to look good policies which do not work.</div>
