            <div class='col-md body'>The recent recurrence of power outage has really damaged Singapore reputation. It was highly probable that many ministries are too complacent on their past achievements and sitting tight on their laurels and beginning to feed too many fat cats snoozing on their jobs! Take the Nicol Highway collapse as a showcase example, are we waiting for the next disaster to strike, then do we start to examine the rest of the related worksites? Are we going to take a closer look at the mrt tunnels only after 4000 morning rush hours workers get drown in the mrt tunnel?Did the PUB engineers believe that a pair of underground power cables could last forever?<br><br>Fuel used to power the generators may be expensive but we have excess money from COE,ROAD TAX, INCOME TAXES, and many other profitable collection of taxes to supplement the upgrading of any other essential amenities, they (GLC)even have excess money  for overseas investments, so why save on those essential infrastructural upgrading? DO you want a Singapore to look beautiful outside and rotten inside?On the other hand, It may be a wrong priority to restore the pay-cut of the top civil servants first as their big fat pay are more than enough for their survival. They should do more to those in the middle and lower end workers because they were the ones who provide the efficiency and power thw engines![quote]</div>

If the MIW are as great as they say they are, and have that capability with all their so called "wise investments", then why are Singaporeans still being squeezed dry and having our cost of living constantly rising with their constant increase in our taxes, transportation costs, etc?</div>
