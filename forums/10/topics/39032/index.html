It called on "all the honorable in the Arab world to rise against the new international terror by striking at the interests of the three countries."<br><br>The statement also urged Palestinians to carry out suicide attacks in Israel as part of the war against the US and its allies.<br><br>Palestinian Authority officials said the statement does not reflect the policy of the political leadership of Fatah. "Arafat does not approve of the statement," commented one official. He said the statement could have been issued by a small minority in Fatah that<br><br>The Fatah threat follows an appeal by Hamas and Islamic Jihad to the Iraqi people to carry out suicide attacks against the US and UK troops.<br><br>Hamas declared Monday a day of fasting in support of Saddam Hussein. It urged Muslims to hold special prayers to call for the annihilation of the US and its allies and called on Arab governments to cut off diplomatic relations with Washington and London.<br><br>For the second day running, tens of thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip took to the streets Saturday to protest against the war in Iraq. Most of the demonstrations took place in the Gaza Strip, where protestors carried posters of the Iraqi president and chanted "Death to America, Death to Bush." In many refugee camps Palestinians burned Israeli, American and British flags.<br><br>Some 15,000 students from the Islamic University in Gaza City marched in the streets to protest against the "crusade" campaign against Iraq. The demonstrators held a special prayer calling for the destruction of the US and Great Britain and for the victory of Iraq.<br><br>In the West Bank, thousands of Palestinians staged protests in Bethlehem and Ramallah on Friday and Saturday, denouncing the Arab presidents and monarchs as "traitors and dogs."<br></div>

The picture sharpens daily, one official said, because translation and analysis of the documents continues, and because the operative captured with them began divulging meaningful information about production plans only last week.<br><br>Leaders at the top of al-Qaeda's hierarchy, the evidence shows, completed plans and obtained the materials required to manufacture two biological toxins - botulinum and salmonella - and the chemical poison cyanide.<br><br>They are also close to a feasible production plan for anthrax, a far more lethal weapon, which kills 90 percent of untreated victims if spread by inhalation and as many as 75 percent of those treated when the first symptoms become evident.<br><br>Most of the new information comes from handwritten documents and computer hard drives seized during the March 1 capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, regarded by some government analysts as al-Qaeda's most important operational planner.<br><br>Because of Mohammed's central role in operations, one senior official said, his apparent connection to biochemical weapons is a "very scary" sign that al-Qaeda's efforts reach well beyond the hypothetical.<br><br>What debriefings and documents from his computer hard drives show, an official said, is that "he was involved in anthrax production, and (knew) quite a bit about it."<br><br>Government experts are also filling out their picture of Ayman Al-Zawahri, al-Qaeda's second-ranking leader, as the central figure in overseeing and funding the biological and chemical weapons effort.<br><br>Since the late 1990s, investigators have known that in early experiments, al-Qaeda killed animals with homemade contact poisons at its Derunta camp in Afghanistan. That project fell under the command of Midhat Mursi, an Egyptian who uses the alias of Abu Kebab and is among the most-wanted al-Qaeda operatives still at large. Mursi is not thought to have sophisticated knowledge of biology.<br><br>What is new in the recent documents is the fact that al-Qaeda recruited competent scientists, including a Pakistani microbiologist whom the officials interviewed last week declined to name. The documents describe specific timelines for producing biochemical weapons and include a bar graph depicting the parallel processes that must take place between Days 1 and 31 of manufacture.<br><br>U.S. officials said the evidence neither establishes nor rules out that al-Qaeda completed manufacture. The documents are undated, unsigned and cryptic about essential details. They do not mention the whereabouts of actual or planned production. The documents do not support a theory that al-Qaeda had a role in the anthrax letters mailed in late 2001 to Senate and news media offices that killed five people.<br><br>Mohammed has told interrogators nothing - "nothing yet," one official emphasized - about the intended use of the weapons.<br><br>Analysts suspect an ambition to poison the food supplies of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Botulism or salmonella poisoning would kill relatively few healthy young men or women but would disable many for a time and render them vulnerable to other forms of attack.<br><br>Two officials said this month's discoveries have changed their minds about the significance of an abandoned laboratory found a year ago in Kandahar, Afghanistan's largest southern city, after U.S.-led troops drove al-Qaeda and Taliban forces from the area.<br><br>Some government analysts believe the Afghan laboratory may have been fully equipped and even operating before U.S. ground forces arrived.<br><br>Some officials said the greatest danger remains that al-Qaeda will obtain advanced biological weapons or nerve agents from a state sponsor.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>This is welcome news to shake the sceptics from their slumber, that all the talk of AL-QAEDA laying their hands on Weapons of Mass Destruction is just an excuse for the USA to start war on Third World Countries.<br><br>From the 9-11 New York World Trade Centre disaster, and also the Bali Bombing carnage, one should have already awaken that the AL QAEDA type of terrorists have no qualms if they strike in an urban environment of a First World Financial Center, or in an idyllic holiday resort in a Third World Setting.<br><br>With WMD that is odourless, swift killing, and without cure, it gives the likes of AL QAEDA the power to bring the world's most powerful nation to its knees.<br><br>How much swifter it can strike us in Singapore, with a land area that is smaller than New York State.<br><br></div>
