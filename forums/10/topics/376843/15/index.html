              <p>OK, let  me see if I got this right. </p>
              <p>An arrogant Australian may discriminate against a British immigrant, but the British immigrant won't feel discriminated against because he understands the same language. </p>
              <p>On the other hand, the same arrogant Australian may also discriminate against an Asian immigrant, and the Asian immigrant would feel discriminated against because he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doesn't</span> understand the same language. </p>
              <p>Have I missed anything?  If I haven't, that's an argument in favour of the common exhortation to "learn the f***ing language before you come here", wouldn't it?</p>
              <p>In any case,  it seems that the crux of your argument is that discrimination is in the eye of the beholder, and by extension, that the solution lies not in reducing discrimination, but in reducing the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perception</span> of discrimination.</p>

              <p><br>Put it another way,</p>
              <p>In singapore, some locals complain about immigrants, of all races, for taking singaporean jobs, about everything and anything, although these immigrants speak english, e.g. the philippinos, the indians, and culturally similar, e.g. the chinese.</p>
              <p>In australia, my understanding is, the locals don't complain about immigrants, some locals dislike those who don't speak english, different culturally or racially, and these are more likely than not, immigrants. these locals don't dislike all immigrants, e.g. the immigrants from the UK and the US.</p>
              <p>Correct me if my understanding is wrong. </p>
              <p>and if my understanding is not wrong, australia, like the US and Canada, grant PR to parents of these immigrants, and they may be chinese, indians, italian....and their parents may not speake english!! this is NOT in line with the common exhortation,  is it?</p>
              <p>my argument is this, We should not treat the immigrants in Singapore in one way and expect to be treated differently when we become immigrants in other countries.</p>

              <p><br>my point is, while we are very much against our government for their immigration policies, singaporean should be more magniminus in accommodating the new immigrants. They didn't choose our government, we do. They have no say in what the government do, we have (if it is ineffective, that is because the timing is wrong, wait for election, and more people have to agree).</p>

              <p>Ok, so the govt is trying to do something for the locals, but
              their definition of locals encompasses PRs as well, which probably
              end up with more foreigners taking up the jobs as "locals" as
              well.</p>
              <p>Has the govt come up with a grant that will enable the company
              to consider sending you to their overseas HQ for a stint at the
              gaming lab so as to bring you up to speed? I think this would be
              very useful, rather than subsidising the salary only.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I know Linden Labs is setting up shop in Singapore, and
              my friend is hiring people. I hope this bodes well for Singaporeans
              in the long run through generation of jobs that will go to the
              locals.</p>

              <p>Yea, MDA and EDB have set up a few transfer programs to Japan/UK's Double Negative/America's MIT.</p>
              <p>Ultimately it has to depend on the Singaporeans themselves. I have to say that the government has done well on this part but whether Singaporeans are willing to learn and make progress is up to them.</p>
