              <p>I commend you for leaving Singapore to explore new worlds, career wise.  Very often, us, the seasoned expatriates in China, feel newbie expats to China lack the wide perspective needed to succeed in China (and possibly in other parts of the world).  But the good thing is, after a few years, they expand their perspectives naturally and blend in well.</p>

              <p>Actually, come to think of it, I think you are right in saying that our thinking, with regards to Singapore may differ, as we move into the various age groups. At my age of early 30s, its when I conquer the world. Perhaps when I reach retirement, I might decide to come back to Singapore to retire after making enough $$$ from overseas.</p>
              <p>Or, to australia for retirement :)</p>

              <p>As a Singapore expatriate to many cities and now China's Shanghai, I have been away for more than 20 years.  In recent years, the urge to return home kept growing and I know I will return home the moment my project takes shape.  To answer your question, I am here to gather information back home in order to keep myself abreast with the most current issues (other than the news - Channel News Asia that I watch daily) from the ground.</p>
              <p>80% of the information here is nothing but crap.  Totally agreed that most people here have nothing concrete to share, mere whinners basically.  This is why I expressed my intention (in fact, decision) to leave this forum aside for a while, only to have some better/ good comments posted for me to answer.  I just feel obligated to attend to the latter group - afterall, I own this thread and cannot be a cold host.</p>
              <p>If only there is a filtering system so that only "qualified" forumers can post here.  In this case, time wasting can be minimized, even for the whinners (as they can forget whinning in my thread and save the whinning time that otherwise could be spent on other threads).</p>

              <p>lot of changes already in Singapore after 20 years, the roads and the buildings, you can see,  but the changing of mindset, human value, ...this you can't see, you can only feel. Here in this forum you get a little bit of that,  so don't filter or qulifiy them, or you will be restricting the opposing views.</p>
              <p>But I do my own sieaving here, I ignore many posts, one glance and you should see what is rubbish and what is lost items, having lived overseas does rubbish still bother you? hehe..some posts I don't respond, don't want to get into very lenghty discussion (don't have that much time),  but read the various arguments and move on, but sometimes its a cultural shock reading the language used. </p>
              <p>Having in here long enough, you should get an idea whose posts you want to read and whose you just want to skip, and who you want to tickle a bit, hahaha... </p>

              <p>You think I am not a Singaporean so I should shut up, that is
              "smacks of arrogance", in your own words! who are you to say if I
              am a Singaporean or not, you listen to fantagf? hehe...in this

              <p>Yes, I think you are no Singaporean, and EVEN if in the most remote of possibility you are, you bring shame to our ancestors. So yes, even IF you are a Singaporean, we do not recognize you.</p>
              <p>Just shut up and get lost. No one will miss you, since you treat others with such a poor attitude.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, you are right. I ignore most of your posts coz you are a pathetic nobody pretending to know much. You don't analyse much, you don't think much, your postings betray your shallowness.</p>

              <p>Actually, come to think of it, I think you are right in saying that our thinking, with regards to Singapore may differ, as we move into the various age groups. At my age of early 30s, its when I conquer the world. Perhaps when I reach retirement, I might decide to come back to Singapore to retire after making enough $$$ from overseas.</p>

              <p>Around me are friends in my age group, and almost <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EVERYONE</span></strong> (I would say more than 98%) decide to go home when the time comes.  For the remaining 2%, they either find cost of living too high to maintain their lifestyle in China (and they can forget Shanghai and possibly Beijing one day - which would mean going home anyway), or their China attachments are just too strong - be it family or business.</p>
              <p>Generally speaking, for male expats to China, those who have not gotten enough of China tend to be in their 30's, making good enough living, have girlfriends (&amp; KTV's), and enjoy the food that they don't normally get in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Female expats will do things slightly differently.  In their 30's, they hang out with other expats from various countries (one of the reasons is for marriage), and long to go home before they grow too old in a foreign land - more conservative, quite understandably, and tend to take on shorter employment stints.</p>

              <p>If you compare apple for apple, meaning similar locations and similar housing quality, they could be more expensive.</p>
              <p>On-going rates are Rmb60k-100k per square meter for XinTianDi area and Lujiazui area, meaning around Rmb6000-10000 psf or SGD1.2k-2kpsf.  BUT the finishing, building materials, design, amenities, mangement &amp; facilities are poor compared to Singapore or even some Thailand properties.</p>
              <p>So price wise comparable, but quality under par.  Yield based on rental/ residential - is 3-4% gross, bank prime rate 6%.  I will stay away with my investment dollars.</p>

              <p>If you can believe me, our so called difference is not that big, we are just talking similar (not exactly the same) things from different angles.</p>
              <p>I like the fact that you have earned your right to stay employed in the US - EARN is a key word.  Despite the odds, you fight for your place, and similarly, even if discrimination is taking place in Singapore against its country men though sadly, I just hope some fellow citizens can do something about it.  I have worked in the US too, as a door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman some 20 years ago.  I earned my right to be an area rep, against local Americans.  What you and I have put up, is something I hope to see amongst Singaporeans.  You will realize, what I have come to realize, is again such fighting spirit is a rare commodity, and will ALWAYS remain a rare commodity.</p>

              <p>I see it necessary to revisit your post here.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have EARNED their right against the local American, the australian.... What do the local says, when influx of foreigners coming in to their countries, working longer hours and probably at lower salaries? but I have not heard them complaining about the foreigners taking away their jobs, or the need to control foreign immigrants, may be only Hanssen, the oz woman opposition. In Singapore, foreigners are here working long hours, do you think they also EARN their place here, "against all odds"? </p>
              <p>I don't hear the americans and australians say what they are ENTITLED to, like many people here think about what they are ENTITLED to, just because they are Singaporean.</p>
              <p>I have seen many immigrants staying in america, australia and canada who continue to speak their own languages, especially cantonese and italian, instead of american, australian and canadian, and the local government have to find interpretors to handle their problem. Here in Singapore we are complaining that the imported waiters don't speak English, even though we have 4 official languages here.</p>
              <p>I believe there is much to learn from the local americans, the australia in the magnanimity in accepting different people in their countries and as global citizens, ... is it our education (blame the government), our parents (but they were immigrants when they came here) or we need to look at ourselves?</p>
              <p>If for whatever reason we have to leave Singapore, just hope that the locals there don't treat us the way some Singaporean are treating the foreigners here.  </p>

              <p>It seems like you're talking about something different then.</p>
              <p>If (and that's a very advisedly used "if") Australians do complain about jobs being taken away from them, it only reflects that the doors are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> being closed to immigrants, doesn't it?  How can immigrants be treated worse if they're the ones getting the jobs?  If that's the case, then what's happening instead is that the immigrants are being treated <span style="text-decoration: underline;">better</span> than the locals, which is the opposite of what you allege.</p>
              <p>As for the immigrants not speaking English, it's a case of you muddying the waters.  Would you speak to a Somali refugee if he spoke no English and you spoke no Somali?  If you didn't speak to him, would it be a case of you simply not being able to communicate with him, or would it necessarily be a case of you discriminating against him?</p>
              <p>I've no problem with your raising issues, but in the first case above it's illogical and in the second case it's unsubstantiated and does not account for competing explanations.  Put simply, you have no point in either case.</p>
              <p>If you read through this thread, that's precisely the kind of behaviour that Lionoasis is trying to correct.</p>

              <p>People,</p>
              <p>Again, without taking out the fun (intelligent and/ or serious types), it is preferred to substantiate your opinion with either common knowledge or with data support.  Totally agree that it is not always possible (can be very tiring - can feel like writing a proposal/ term paper), but let's try to cut down internet waste (as in environmental waste), and make visiting the threads more rewarding.</p>
              <p>Thank you very much!</p>

              <p>Not sure if we understand each other, what I am saying is that Australia has been open to immigrants, and for years these immigrants have been getting jobs in australia, while I believe the immigrants have worked hard and earned their position, I have not heard the local australians complaining about these immigrants taking over their jobs, or that the immigrants were given special priviledges by the government!</p>
              <p>Singapore is now open to more immigrants, but the locals are complaining that the immigrants are taking over their jobs, and that the government is giving them special priviledges.</p>
              <p>So, IF, the australian complains, then they would be behaving like some singaporean here. IF they don't, then there is lesson on magnanimity some of us can learn here.</p>
              <p>It is different to say that we can't communicate with a somali in Australia, and making all somali to speak english before they are allowed in australia. If the guy can't speak english you just go find another one who does, here we are saying to them "you bloody well speak english if you want to be in Singapore."  </p>
              <p>hmmm...lionnoisy may not like what I say, but if this is the situation in Australia, then this is something we need to learn, no? </p>

              <p>I am in USA earning more than the local, because I EARNED the
              right to. I don't work overtime, I don't take lower pay. I proved
              my competence above the competition, therefore I am paid US MARKET
              PAY. I am not paid Singapore dollars working in USA.</p>
              <p>Only our govt defines Foreign Talent as those who come here
              willing to work longer hours and accept lower pay than the local
              talent. As I said, they have corrupted the term "Foreign
              Talent".</p>
