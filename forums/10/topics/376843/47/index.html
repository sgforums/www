              <p>Mind you all that these books are quite old and would be out of print. But I'm sure it's available in Singapore. All of you MUST read these books!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>And after that, come back here to contribute, debate or discuss or enquire about the health and well being of Asia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

              <p>To answer your childish comment, as a matter of fact, I have read ALL 3 books I've mentioned here!! And do you have any hint that it's because of the likes of you, yes!!!! mainly you, that people are not coming here to debate anymore???? Do you know that? You stupid bitch? I bet you just don't have a clue do you? Grow up, learn to respect others or crawl under a rock and stay there!!!!!!!!!!!!! Or better still, since Singapore has so many high rise buildings, I dare you to jump off from the top floor!!!!!!!! Bet you wouldn't dare to do that!!!!!!!!!!!!?????? You are just a stupid coward!!! Plain ignorant and stupid bitch. What's more, UNEDUCATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>I've said my piece and bye to the rest of the decent people here. I for one will not be coming back to childish and stupid remarks made by so called people like "Angel"</p>

              <p>Why care about people coming or not, no one come, so be it lah, we are not running a business that need people to sell...just be yourself, why need to change to accomdate others, people dun want to debate can be due to various reasons like being timid, unable to debate, coward out or simply, look down on people and find it useless to debate, for whatever reason, so be it, like shakespear said, to be or not to be.</p>

              <p>Not sure why a proud Asian must read these books, make us more proud or want us to be humble?</p>
              <p>You can start the discussion by highlighting the giss of what the books say that would interest us?</p>
              <p>You can also give us your contribution by your views on how the australians look at asians, do they think we can think? what's their perception of A Dragon, a creature that fly with two wings, spitting fire to burn out everything on their way?</p>
              <p>In Asian values, staying close to parents is being good to parents to begin with, it is not easy to live a western life with asian values.</p>
              <p>what is western dream? I have asian dream.</p>

              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p>Thank you for your contribution, for whatever position you are taking, this thread is probably most read.  I am pleased in a way...</p>
              <p>There are probably two main groups of people here.  One group wants to have an intellectual exchange of opinion which opens minds; and the other wants to stir S*** which closes minds.  The latter group is the dominant group thus far and there is no way to stop it.</p>
              <p>Thanks for those book titles Chelsea, I wish I will have time to read them.</p>
              <p>I will be returning to Singapore later this year for good (thank goodness), and will try to get a cyberspace where only people who are really keen and ready for an intellectual discussion can join in.  If you already have one, please drop me a note so that I may join you.  But if you wish to join mine, please drop me a note.  However, I must state here that <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">my space will NOT be political nor anti-government</span></strong>, though critical thinking will be the flavor of the day.</p>
              <p>Cheers!!</p>
              <p>p.s.  Much improvement has been done to our pavillion at Shanghai Expo 2010.</p>
