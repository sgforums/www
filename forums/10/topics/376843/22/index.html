              <p>Good argument, we are however, refering to countries people want to migrate to, since they complaint so much about Singapore as if is awful to live here, and that being Singaporean is such an ordeal.</p>
              <p>My opinion, is that Singaporean should know where is best for them not what reports say about what/ where is better than Singapore.  We are a very different breed, and I urge people to stick around and make life better for themselves, without moving away. </p>

              <p>It remains to be seen if scientists can prove with certainty that the ability to migrate is one of the primal instincts in higher animals like Man. I will certainly not doubt that our ancestors desired to seek an oasis of plentiful resources that they made the choice to cross mighty oceans from all corners of the globe and settle in this Lion City. Fast forward to more recent times, it seems that this very primal instinct to migrate is revitalized in later generations of Singaporeans as they desired to seek pastures abroad.</p>
              <p>Whilst our leaders expound the value of loyalty to one’s country irregardless of the circumstances that one faces, one must acknowledge that such a form of altruism is a rarity. Loyalty to one country is nowadays a form of commodity traded in exchange for say, a security of livelihood or the opportunity to fulfil one’s dreams. The pertinent questions is why are Singaporeans migrating or harbouring desires to migrate in huge numbers?</p>
              <p>The first reason is the topic of disillusionment amongst Singaporeans especially the young. They are talented in their own capacity, yet the system established DO NOT RECOGNIZE their talents, and worse, stream them into categories, which they feel are not commensurable with their talents. The end result is that these people are left on the fringes of the system and denied of an opportunity to nurture their talents. As a result, these people become disillusioned, and feel that Singapore is not the place to develop their talents. If they are given the opportunity to nurture their talents in overseas destinations, usually these people would stay on overseas.</p>
              <p>The second reason is the limited diversity within the Singapore sphere. Are there opportunities for budding rocket scientists (rocket designers for space and NOT weaponry), the Winter Olympics hopeful who loves winter sports, our future astronautical engineers or nuclear physicists? It’s an inevitable fact that Singaporeans with such aspirations will seek their playground elsewhere.</p>
              <p>The third reason is the relative cheapness of air travel. Budget airlines that ply air-routes within a region allow Singaporeans to get quickly from one place to another. Singaporeans settling in other lower living costs countries in the Asian region can take advantage of budget Airlines to keep in touch with relatives in Singapore. The upcoming Airbus A380 that is capable of direct flight from Australia to Chicago will be the future of air travel, and will allow relatives from further destinations to travel at greater convenience.</p>
              <p>The fourth reason has more to do with the Singapore society’s tolerance with certain categories of people. It has to be said that our laws are in a way not conducive towards certain minorities like the homosexuals for instance. I know of a friend who is one. He studied overseas and grew to like the country where he completed his undergraduate studies because of its tolerance towards gays and tremendous track record when it came to LGBT rights. Comparing it to Singapore which is still at its infancy stage when it came to LGBT rights and tolerance for the LGBT group compounded with the fact that the latter is a constant target of religious right elements, my friend was immediately drawn to the country where he did his tertiary studies and away from Singapore. He was considered a talent in his field, and was head-hunted before he even graduated. These are the type of top brains that Singapore will eventually lose, a sentiment echoed by SM Goh. The encroachment by the religious right whose agendas revolve around attempting to deny the LGBT group the rights they are fighting for isn’t helping matters either. On a lighter note, I would suspect die hard gum chewers might find Singapore a little inconducive, because it may be a little hard to purchase gums, and secondly, they need to get a medical certification.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, the issue of migration is a consequence of globalization. We may do well to recall the old adage,”The world is our oyster”. As it is, the world is increasingly seen as the travellers playground that the Kent Ridge Common is nothing but a temporary stop on the traveller’s highway</p>

Now, the difference is just seven per cent. <br><br>ECA International's Regional Director for Asia, Lee Quane, said the increase in living cost is unlikely to deter firms from relocating their staff here. <br><br>Tokyo maintained its position as the most expensive location for expatriates to live in, as the stronger yen outweighed the impact of deflation in Japan. <br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1021996/1/.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #417e15;">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stori...021996/1/.html</span></span></a></div></div>

              <p>wats a dolly fish?nz is cheap and most people from hong kong,thailand,india,taiwan,south korea ,.japan,,malaysia and vietnam are there.</p>
              <p>if u dont find life in spore good and cant go anywhere yet ..easy way is to change spore into a new zealand.....u can go ask lky or lhl to improve things.u have nothing to lose and its more convenient and cheaper.so instead of spending time and money immigrating...just change spore.just dont use harsh words on them.</p>
              <p>the fish in new zealand taste 80% like the cheap wet market fish u can get in spore.beef in spore is cheaper too and taste almost the same freshness...only a bit more expensive in spore.theres alot of shell fish in new zealand.the ones most japanese goto</p>
              <p>the only thing spore hasnt got is land and time.most people leave spore because they intend to build up an industry or factory overseas and have the time to invent things be it from a shoulder mounted howitzer to a holographic 3d projection.</p>
              <p>spore has time taken  away by national servist and reservist duties that involve athelete remedial trainings for many days in a week!u cant build anything with that kinda time TAKEN AWAY.by thae time they release u from reservist forced chores...u would be too tired out.</p>
              <p>the reason why the other foreigners could immigrate to new zealand was that their national service did not retard their civilian life.take for example the south koreans in nz...they never need to go for ippt or rt after 2 years national service.even though they are not fit n fail in ns they need not go for rt as a civilian.and their reservist duty for south koreans in korea is only at most 7 days in a year...no remedial training n fail ippt or not dun matter!and currently south korea and north korea are still technically at war.no peace treaty was ever signed......</p>
              <p>the rest 0f the asian countries are free citizens where they can go as they wish at home and overseas ....</p>

              <p>I am not physically in Singapore for a home/ biz trip.  Over the last week, I have had the chance to visit a number of locations, saw the Sands Casino, saw Resort World, saw 313 Orchard where my ex-colleague was part of the small team responsible for putting together the mall....I have also the chance to talk to a number of people and following is the overall sentiment (limited to my interactions during this trip):</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Financial &amp; Legal industry - Very excited and outlook positive with problems to solve;</li>
              <li>Teaching (Academic) Industry - Cost too high, price downward pressure;</li>
              <li>Parents of children attending pre-school (Eaton House) - Money Sucking Machine - poor faculty/ classroom too cramp</li>
              <li>Job Seekers - still tough, some complaints about FT, but attitude still choose to fight on, and salary for FT gradually to be localized;</li>
              <li>Grass Root Leaders - "Slowly it will be a different political game, but we are still in control" (exact quote)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>So, seems everyone has got something different to say, but none say they gonna quit.  So please, dun quit on your country.  These people are no different from you and I, let's do something about our lifes, dun quit dun complaint.</p>
