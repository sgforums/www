              <p>My comments were not directed at late Ken, and I am not aware of his passing.  Most certainly I would not disrepect him, I just stated my opinion of the Pavillion.  I think both issues are seperate....</p>
              <p>Having said this, the best paid government in the world should be well resourced, or are they not well financed enough?  More importantly, it is a matter of managing the project, tap the right resources and execute them well.  It is not about capital but leadership, that I think is not beyond our reach - a 3000sqm structure - please tell me this is not tooo much to ask for?</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am no head of state but I have run Fortune 500 companies in China.  I believe LKY is the last of his breed (those who are still active), and LHL and gang are just not there.  Parallel to running a corporation, sometimes we need champions to stick out and tell everyone what else to do to make things better.  To find such a person is difficult and to find an audience to such voices (especially le boss) is even harder.  It takes wisdom, courage to change, and gratitude to be corrected.  I do NOT see it in our current batch of government.  Another LKY is possible (LKY is just human), but our political environment prevents us from finding another one.</p>
              <p>Applying the above theory to our sad Pavillion, our Pavillion is a subset of a stale, "yes man" &amp; "no accountability needed" government culture.</p>
              <p>The effects of such culture is not limited to a our Pavillion, it applies to every aspect of our lives.  It may take a serious tragedy to install a major shake-up, and I will hope the cost is not too high.</p>
              <p>I also believe the role of ordinary citizens like us is to create within our people, a vibrant <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">culture of innovation</span></strong>, tenacious <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">will</span></strong> to weather out bad times &amp; <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">compassion</span></strong> to understand the world.  These are, I believe, human-resource pillars that will make us stronger.  Again, if the government can help good, if not, well, what else is new?</p>
              <p>I am NOT waiting for them to do something....I just do it.  Hope more people will do the same.</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading my two cents worth.</p>

              <p><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sgpav.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-25275" title="sgpav" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sgpav-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a>Along with more than 190 countries, Singapore is represented with its own pavilion at the Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China. Situated between the Malaysia and Australia pavilions, the Singapore pavilion, which boasts 3,000 square meters, looks like a small version of the Esplanade and is dubbed a “smart music box.”</p>
              <p>Once you have passed the excruciatingly long lines in front of the Expo and the pavilion, you are greeted with a multicultural musical display. After that you enter an unassuming foyer, where you first receive a plastic fan for a special light display. When you hold the fan into the exhibit, you can view various sceneries in Singapore. The small pictures, however, are hardly impressive. Afterwards, you are invited to play on drums and read the many signs highlighting Singapore’s successes and environmental achievements which litter the whole pavilion.</p>
              <p>Once you have passed the first floor (called “movement”), you once again have to stand in line for at least 15 minutes before being able to get into the second floor.</p>
              <p><img class="alignright" title="singapore pavilion" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/firstfloorinside.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240">The second floor is a theater with a huge screen (150° widescreen, 2.8 meter high), which displays varying films at different times. During my visit, they showed a small eight minute propaganda film called “City Made from the Sky” narrated by Lee Kuan Yew and displaying Singapore’s achievements in building a garden city. Seeing the aging Minister Mentor towering on such a huge screen was quite an experience. However, judging from the noise level and the early exits of patrons, the movie did not really reach most of its audience, which may have been partially due to the fact that the film was narrated in English with Chinese subtitles.</p>
              <p>The third floor, my favorite part of the exhibit, was a small rooftop garden with more than 20 different orchids from Singapore. Unfortunately besides being small, it was hardly possible to linger there and enjoy the flowers.</p>
              <p>While the Singapore Pavilion can compete well with the other pavilions, I think none of the pavilions justifies the long wait in the hot humid climate. Both young and old waited patiently in line to view the exhibit. I was visiting with my in-laws who were not very impressed by what they saw. This was, however, also the case with the other pavilions that we visited.</p>
              <p>The Shanghai Expo will run until October 31, 2010.</p>

              <p>hi mate, I am back from my trip :)</p>
              <p>Vegas and the Grand Canyon are really interesting places to see :)</p>
              <p>But then coming back here, and see a poor cockroach withering in self-inflicted misery, is also interesting :)</p>
