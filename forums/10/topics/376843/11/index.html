              <p>Well, unlike Gendaken, soul_rage and Araphoe i work in the lowly gaming industry that the government now is trying to hard to promote so let me share my experiences and potential problems i see with the skewed immigration policies our precious little government has created.</p>
              <p>For one, the locals to foreigners ratio is badly off balanced. Out of an employee base of around 70-75 only about 10 are locals. Only 2 deals with the technical side of it, while the rest are artists (which i am one).</p>
              <p>This means that it would be impossible for the local 3D animation and gaming industry to even gain strength here because our local talent base are strangled right from the get go.</p>
              <p>It has become too easy for foreign companies to get a foreigner that has the relevant experience they want and escape any responsibility for training any locals to fill in the slots.</p>
              <p>This isn't helped by the fact that the Ministry of Manpower considers PRs as a local for the local/foreigner ratio it demands for companies</p>
              <p>I do agree that there should be equal competition in Singapore and i have learnt a great deal from my foreign colleagues.</p>
              <p> But for new industries like 3D animation and gaming,  very little people are going to have relevant experiences on their resumes. And why should the foreign companies bother if it's just so easy for them to use professional headhunters and get someone from Indonesia/China/Philippines/Malaysia to do the job?</p>
              <p>It becomes a chicken and egg problem, since the locals have no experiences why hire them ? But if the locals are not hired and trained accordingly, their skills would never appeal to the foreign companies either, not when a replacement is so easily available. </p>
              <p>The Bureaucrats also think a gaming industry only needs artists to support it. But it's a very complex operation because you need a strong technical base in order to develop for the PS3, XBox360 and MMORPGs.All the SPURs sponsorship they give are only low level stuff, only enough to churn out low level staffs.</p>
              <p>Big corporations like LucaArts and Ubisoft come here to look for factory workers, they have very little interest in training mangerial materials, why bother when it is so easy to get them from their respective Western countries?</p>
              <p>How could a new local industry grow when a Monopoly is already there before it could even take root?</p>
              <p> I do not know what would be true fairness, but right now the balance is immensely skewed to point where locals are actually more troublesome to hire.</p>

              <p>I think on the FT subject, I should listen more than I speak as I have not gotten any first hand exposure of the situation.</p>
              <p>For all people with some knowledge about this subject, can you enlighten me why the FT population has increased so rapidly in just a few years?  Can anyone share some insights please?</p>

              <p>Not to be an ass, but the impression i'm getting here even if we get a complete overhaul with the political system you're still going to leave.</p>
              <p>A big chunk of your beef with why you're dissatisfied with Singapore seems to be the lack of things for you to spend on, i don't see how a small island like Singapore would ever satisfy your desire to experience.</p>
              <p>And also, i'm guessing the paycheque you receive in America would be bigger than any you would get for the same job in pretty much any of the 1st World industrialized countries. How could Singapore possibly, even with a change in political system increase the wage levels to match what you're getting now ?</p>

              <p>If I may add my opinion, our feelings change with respect to our stages in life, generally speaking.  People who are in the 30's think differently from people in the 40's - the stage I am in.</p>

              <p>As a Singapore expatriate to many cities and now China's Shanghai, I have been away for more than 20 years.  In recent years, the urge to return home kept growing and I know I will return home the moment my project takes shape.  To answer your question, I am here to gather information back home in order to keep myself abreast with the most current issues (other than the news - Channel News Asia that I watch daily) from the ground.</p>
              <p>80% of the information here is nothing but crap.  Totally agreed that most people here have nothing concrete to share, mere whinners basically.  This is why I expressed my intention (in fact, decision) to leave this forum aside for a while, only to have some better/ good comments posted for me to answer.  I just feel obligated to attend to the latter group - afterall, I own this thread and cannot be a cold host.</p>
              <p>If only there is a filtering system so that only "qualified" forumers can post here.  In this case, time wasting can be minimized, even for the whinners (as they can forget whinning in my thread and save the whinning time that otherwise could be spent on other threads).</p>

              <p>one thing is certain, everything here is political, and it
              is about PAP and the government, Singapore is also PAP, the cause
              of every evil is PAP, even when they have constipation, and for PAP
              to come down Singapore must fall...</p>
              <p>SO YOU ARE EITHER FOR THEM OR AGAINST THEM!!! </p>
              <p>but remember, this is not the real world, you still have to go
              back to work tomorrow, your family is the one whom you should take
              care, ...</p>
              <p>l come here when I have some free time, hope to pick up some
              interesting ideas or info (so far everything they say
              about the government I already know, so haven't been able to pick
              up anything, even news against the PAP), sometimes when I feel
              like, I respond to some idiotic remarks, most of the time I ignore,
              got better thing to do, there is a lot to read, a lot to
              watch... in this forum, I find Military Nuts more interesting.</p>

              <p>To add on, the PAP has been lowering their standards of FT over the years. While we were more picky on who we import in the past, we are now importing people from all walks of life.</p>
              <p>Their definition of FT has became blurred over the years, such that almost anyone who is from overseas is a FT.</p>
              <p>There is not much control, anyone is free to come in and compete. As such, things become tougher for the average Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Some people are able to excel and go beyond the foreigners, such that we are able to do better than them, and not worry about them. But this is not the case for the average guy on the streets.</p>

              <p>I like the fact that you have earned your right to stay employed
              in the US - EARN is a key word.  Despite the odds, you fight
              for your place, and similarly, even if discrimination is taking
              place in Singapore against its country men though sadly, I just
              hope some fellow citizens can do something about it.  I have
              worked in the US too, as a door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman
              some 20 years ago.  I earned my right to be an area rep,
              against local Americans.  What you and I have put up, is
              something I hope to see amongst Singaporeans.  You will
              realize, what I have come to realize, is again such fighting spirit
              is a rare commodity, and will ALWAYS remain a rare commodity.</p>
              <p>I mentioned many of my views about the government in my thread
              titled "TOP 5 QUESTIONS YOU WANNA ASK THE GOVERNMENT", if you
              care, please read it.</p>

              <p>Yes, the term is EARN, not ENTITLED.</p>
              <p>Some people think I am crazy to leave my career where I took a scholarship from, because they think I am nuts to give up the management track given to me. It's difficult to explain why I left, but I guess it's the above that can explain my reason.</p>
              <p>I prefer others to view me as earning the right to be a manager, and NOT entitled to be a manager. And in that sort of career, no matter how hard you try to convince others you have the right, people will always perceive it as an entitlement.</p>
              <p>I will read your other threads.</p>
              <p>And as for some forumers, just ignore them when they make disparaging remarks. As sgdiehard said, when its rubbish, just ignore, no need to get yourself worked up over such comments.</p>

              <p>Personally, my guess would be the baby boomer retirement wave.</p>
              <p>That would explain why there's a need to increase CPF contributions and the increased obstacles being laid to avoid paying back the full CPF sum.</p>
              <p>I would venture to guess that the CPF is pretty much an empty shell and is no longer capable of paying back the money it is obligated to return to the people thus the need to dramatically increase the amount of workers AKA CPF contributers.</p>
              <p>Low population rate as a reason is pretty much bullshit, it takes 20+ years on average for a baby to grow to an age capable of contributing to the economy, it doesn't explain why there's such an urgent need for such a dramatic increase of population size (1.5million increase thus far)</p>
              <p>It seems to me to offer the most complete answer. </p>
              <p>Currently Social and Employment passes and subsequently PR are all awarded based only on CPF contribution amounts. Checks are not conducted on whether employers really pay the full amount in salaries.</p>
              <p>That's why there was a news report on foreigners obtaining PR status even though they worked as waiters because they sacifice some of their salary to increase their CPF contributions, to give them the illusion of having a higher salary.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Atobe,</p>
              <p>Read it and like it as usual...bravo.  I had a funnyy feeling, after reading so much complaints in this forum (even from the very young) on our government.  Granted, some people are just venting their frustrations (or is it too much homone), but I thought it was still a reflection of sentiments from a particular group of people.  The new entrants will not be "badly influenced" by the real locals that soon.</p>
              <p>There was another argument that surrounded the CPF, contributed by Stevenson, and I tend to concur.  The aged population and CPF paydays are closely tied, just like the situation surrounding 401k in the US.  Your views please?</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Personally, my guess would be the baby boomer retirement wave.</p>
              <p>That would explain why there's a need to increase CPF contributions and the increased obstacles being laid to avoid paying back the full CPF sum.</p>
              <p>I would venture to guess that the CPF is pretty much an empty shell and is no longer capable of paying back the money it is obligated to return to the people thus the need to dramatically increase the amount of workers AKA CPF contributers.</p>
              <p>Low population rate as a reason is pretty much bullshit, it takes 20+ years on average for a baby to grow to an age capable of contributing to the economy, it doesn't explain why there's such an urgent need for such a dramatic increase of population size (1.5million increase thus far)</p>
              <p>It seems to me to offer the most complete answer. </p>
              <p>Currently Social and Employment passes and subsequently PR are all awarded based only on CPF contribution amounts. Checks are not conducted on whether employers really pay the full amount in salaries.</p>
              <p>That's why there was a news report on foreigners obtaining PR status even though they worked as waiters because they sacifice some of their salary to increase their CPF contributions, to give them the illusion of having a higher salary.</p>

              <p>I tend to concur.</p>
              <p>Just like the US is facing 401k major payouts around the years 2013-2016, not a distant future from now.  That paired with hefty healthcare costs, the never-ending war around the world (I would say one of the major diplomatic ploy by the US - and burning a BIG BIG hole in its economy), the over-reliance on oil, the US is facing MORE tough times ahead.</p>
              <p>Does anyone have a stat to indicate the average age of Singapore residents after the influx of FT?  What about the GDP per capita?</p>

              <p>Yes, the term is EARN, not ENTITLED.</p>
              <p>Some people think I am crazy to leave my career where I took a scholarship from, because they think I am nuts to give up the management track given to me. It's difficult to explain why I left, but I guess it's the above that can explain my reason.</p>
              <p>I prefer others to view me as earning the right to be a manager, and NOT entitled to be a manager. And in that sort of career, no matter how hard you try to convince others you have the right, people will always perceive it as an entitlement.</p>
              <p>I will read your other threads.</p>
              <p>And as for some forumers, just ignore them when they make disparaging remarks. As sgdiehard said, when its rubbish, just ignore, no need to get yourself worked up over such comments.</p>

              <p>I commend you for leaving Singapore to explore new worlds, career wise.  Very often, us, the seasoned expatriates in China, feel newbie expats to China lack the wide perspective needed to succeed in China (and possibly in other parts of the world).  But the good thing is, after a few years, they expand their perspectives naturally and blend in well.</p>
              <p>I will try to ignor the rubbish posts and wannabe's.  Thanks.  Just that I started this thread and sometimes feel obligated to say something to entertain "visitors" and sometimes feel the need to do "house cleaning"...</p>

              <p>Hi Lionoasis,</p>
              <p>hehe...you don't see the faces of the people here, know where they come from or what they do...you can't possibly be expecting much, or you will be totally disappointed and frustrated.</p>
              <p>Among those who post here, there are some who put in a lot of thoughts in their argument, most simply cut and paste; there are a few who argue intelligently, many simply æ³¼å¦‡éª‚è¡—ï¼›a few, like you, come hoping to discuss issues, many are here just to vent their frustration;</p>
              <p>some talk like they know the world (but they probably have only been to JB), some talk like kids (may be they are), some talk like they are fighting for the poor and the underpriviledged (but never say how they are trying to help), some talk as if they know what is good for singapore (but they are not singaporean), ... the only truth I read here is that nobody would die for Singapore, actually they won't die for anybody...</p>
              <p>one thing is certain, everything here is political, and it is about PAP and the government, Singapore is also PAP, the cause of every evil is PAP, even when they have constipation, and for PAP to come down Singapore must fall...</p>
              <p>SO YOU ARE EITHER FOR THEM OR AGAINST THEM!!! </p>
              <p>but remember, this is not the real world, you still have to go back to work tomorrow, your family is the one whom you should take care, ...</p>
              <p>l come here when I have some free time, hope to pick up some interesting ideas or info (so far everything they say about the government I already know, so haven't been able to pick up anything, even news against the PAP), sometimes when I feel like, I respond to some idiotic remarks, most of the time I ignore, got better thing to do, there is a lot to read, a lot to watch... in this forum, I find Military Nuts more interesting.</p>

              <p>the problem with you is you can't post something to save your life without putting down others. as if you are any better...</p>
              <p>in fact, i find your post about your sexual prowess a while back to be the most idiotic and non-sensical post; this coming from an old bird who claims to be one of the more sensible guys around. (puke!)<br>how's your libido lately?</p>
              <p>interestingly, you said you came here to learn, but what you learnt about yourself and your posts?</p>
