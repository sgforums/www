              <p>I'm very much incline to agree wholeheartedly what all Soul Rage have said here!! I, for one left Singapore in the early 70s and have only been back there twice!! Once when my mother was hospitalised and the second time was for my mother's funeral!!</p>
              <p>I'm 60 years of age now and have made Melbourne in Australia my home ages ago! Two years ago, I've sponsored my elder sister and my niece over here.

              <p>Life is pleasant, no controlling from the government as to what you must or mustn't talk about, what style of hair you should have or even what type of clothing suits you best!! For your information, I'm talking about the PAP in the 60s, 70s, 80s and even 90s!! Looks like they're still just as bad, passing on from father to son!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>I was born and grew up in Singapore till I was in my early twenties. Still no regrets about leaving and know I won't be going back for good. Maybe, just maybe, I might go for a short period of stay, so I can pay a visit to my mother's niche at St Michael's!</p>

              <p>Oh, and there's a difference between being shrewd, and being a hypocrite. You are a hypocrite, for on one hand you support the PAP with their astronomical high salaries, and on the other, hire cheap labour coz they are cheaper than locals.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, I feel you should shut up if you are running a business, because businesses have a lot of benefits in Singapore.</p>
              <p>But then again, you are just faking your businesses, so you don't understand how true businessmen actually keeps their profile low.</p>
              <p>And don't have to always behave as if you are high and above the rest of the forum people here. You think businessmen are the top of the crop. I am an employee, that's true, but I enjoy a standard of living and work-life balance that is second-to-none over here. Many employees here are not like your slaves, whom you make them slog for long hours with cheap pay. In fact, businessmen are usually also slaves to their businesses.</p>
              <p>If you REALLY are running a biz, you will know what I mean. Otherwise, explaining to you also is a waste of my time.</p>

              <p>Hi mate,</p>
              <p>nice to know that you are living a good life over in Melbourne. It's a city which I seriously considered as an ideal place for retirement, that's why I have some investments over there.</p>
              <p>But now I am in the USA and working for an organization with excellent benefits, both in terms of current and retirement. So I am still contemplating where I should go in the later stages of my life.</p>
              <p>One thing that I badly miss (other than my parents) are my roti pratas and roasted duck in Singapore. Did you ever had those cravings that you have to suppress? :)</p>
              <p>Anyway, Christmas is like summer for you. So enjoy the weather, while here, I am fighting below freezing temperatures :)</p>

                                <p>2) He is looking to distinguish between people who left
                                Singapore COMPLETELY (not coming back), and those who are away for
                                the time being (like myself, who may go back still), and to see
                                views of each group of people</p>
                                <p>Your posting above is something that is probably what he likes
                                to read, constructive observation and discussion.</p>
                                <p>As I cautioned to him, if he wishes to go back to Singapore, he
                                has to be very careful about the 40 year old age
                                discrimination.</p>
                                <p>It's a major issue of why I decide to uproot myself. In the
                                future, I do not want to see myself being told by the Govt that I
                                am stupid becoz I am 40 and above, and thus must accept their
                                rubbish about lower pay.</p>
                                <p>PS: Frankly, (no offense), I find remarks about wanting to go
                                and live in Antartica very immature.</p>

              <p>Was referring to some others, those who don't contribute constructively, but make remarks about living in Antartica. Between Antartica and Singapore, Singapore still wins :D</p>
              <p>I guess what Lionoasis was trying to bring across, later on, was about valid reasons on living in other countries. Valid points like, "experiencing another lifestyle", "freedom of speech", etc are things he is looking out for in what influences the forumers here.</p>
              <p>Silly remarks like "Living in Antartica" on the other hand... just goes to show how much a person making that remark has not seen any part of the world. It's just plain immature in my opinion as well.</p>

                                <p>Like what soul_rage said, I DO like to read your
                                kinda articles...thank you.  I am sure you know now why I
                                started this thread.  In my own words, I was not cynical, just
                                wanted to stimulate people's minds to think this issue real
                                seriously, instead of complaining or fantacizing where they
                                could have been or should have been, without a real understanding
                                of their "Utopia".  I hope our people can be more practical
                                and be responsible for themselves - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">research, understand, analyze and
                                act</span></strong>.  Singapore or not, should be a
                                by-product of their mature &amp; tested decision. 
                                However, I still think Singapore is the best destination for great
                                majority of Singaporeans, one of the reasons is because we are
                                culturally unadaptable, we have been living in a city that is too
                                contained - partly due to our national policy - and I do blame the
                                government for this.</p>
                                <p>A related issue, do you know I do not like dealing with most
                                Singaporeans and I totally dislike dealing with our government or
                                related companies?  And I have lived more than 20 years
                                outside Singapore.  Why do I still return?  To me, a home
                                is a home, and will always be a home.  This sentiment may not
                                apply to all, I am sure.</p>
                                <p>What you sighted about lives of beyond 40's is mostly true (not
                                that you are lying, I just see them slightly differently) and
                                sad.  But look around, aren't these "natural' things we will
                                see in an aging economy whose literacy level is amongst the highest
                                in the world?  Must we do something about it?  Of
                                course!  But are we alone?  NO.  We are
                                not isolated in the type of problems we face.  What is
                                more relevant is, can we solve our problems?  Well, may be, I
                                am not quite sure.  Visiting SgForum has opened my eyes
                                (despite the houseflies....Smack!!  Just hit another one...),
                                and I am asking myself questions these days.  But yes,
                                I<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> WILL</span></strong> go back to
                                Singapore, hopefully next year in 2010, here's a timeline for
                                you.</p>
                                <p>Please contribute more, even if you don't agree with me. 
                                Quality posts are always welcomed here.</p>

              I believe singaporeans should not just confine themselves to living in Singapore especially now that Singapore and the world is different from 20 years ago. We should ventured out to other parts of the world to live and experience for ourselves the good and bad of wherever we decide to be apart from Singapore. That's why I took issue with your comment that <b>Singaporeans belong in Singapore</b> and painted the contrast of Singapore 20 years ago and Singapore now to you in my previous post. 
              
              <p>The concept of home is subjective and depends on each individual. I used to believe that if you are born into that country, you should call it home as it is the place where you grew up, make friends, work, get married and eventually die. Well, not anymore, thanks to exposure to my foreign friends and PAP government's wonderful policies. To me, if you like the place (country) you are living in and can envision yourself settling down, growing old happily and eventually dieing there, then that's home for you. It doesn't have to be that you must be born into that country to call that place a home.
              
              </p><p>As for returning back to Singapore permanently, I would suggest you take a 2 week vacation trip in Singapore to feel the changes Singapore has experienced within these 2 decades. Even singaporeans living in the country are not comfortable with the changes.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Just to clarify a few things:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>I have always made it clear Singapore is my choice and may not be everybody's choice;</li>
              <li>I have always encouraged exploration to understand, instead of reading "passively" about what the media reports about various places that look good, and take things at face value - I was worried for some people here;</li>
              <li>I remain that Singapore is the best place for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span></strong> Singaporeans because I don't see them settling down successfully in other countries - not because of competency or attitude towards work - but because we are culturally unadpatable;</li>
              <li>Most importantly, I wish all Singaporeans will <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">make the best out of their situation</span></strong>, instead of complaining endlessly like loosers do (obviously if you don't have the nack of complaining, this message is not for you).  We complaint too much, and this is the impression we give to other countries. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>I do visit Singapore 5-6 times a year, and I still have my apartment, relatives and friends there.  I am also a member (and founding member) of a large Singaporean soccer team in Shanghai.  So I am in touch with issues back home.  But the time spent away from home has given me other perspectives, that sometimes, it takes time to find the right audience.</p>
              <p>In this forum, I have enjoyed exchanges with Atobe &amp; soul_rage, and a few others, but I cannot remember their avatars or names since they have not written in for some time.  Sorry guys/ gals.</p>

              <p>Why are Singaporean quitters so enamoured with anglo-saxon countries? Haven't you guys had enough of materialism and consumerism? Why not go for somewhere more "European" (and no, Britain is hardly European)? I'll be leaving next April/May to a place where a whole stretch of the avenue is lit up every night with some of the world's most beautiful lights. It's a place world famous for its cuisine (if you gonna take Michelin for its word). If you're in an arty farty mood and want some Da Vinci, you can stroll down to a pyramid-like art museum which houses works like the Mona Lisa, St John the Baptist etc. If you happen to fall sick and feel too sluggish to go down to the doctor's, call them to come to your house. This is after all the country with the best healthcare system in the world (again, if you believe WHO). Forget about Golden Village. This place has the largest cinema screen in Europe. Or you can always join crowds of people to watch a movie on the grass patch and under the stars. Tired of working? You only work 35 hours a week here (although the right wing president wants to change it). Best of all (doesn't apply to Singaporean women) there's no compulsory military service here. Cheers :)</p>

              <p>Many Singaporean who work for the government and local companies (with local CEO) are still working even though they are way passed 50. Many in the MNC, especially those in the senior positions, are always concerned whenever there is sound of reorganisation, re structuring.... A very different thing I am witnessing here compared to your stories.</p>
              <p>But if you are looking for a new job, I guess you subject yourself to competition with others who are much younger than you. The older you are, the more younger compeititors, there are many reasons why you may not get the job, not age discrimination, language discrimination....</p>
              <p>The problem with the PAP government here is that they do not have much protection for locals against the exploitation of the MNC. What kind of protection your government provide for people over 40 downunder?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>I believe singaporeans should not just confine themselves to living in Singapore especially now that Singapore and the world is different from 20 years ago. We should ventured out to other parts of the world to live and experience for ourselves the good and bad of wherever we decide to be apart from Singapore. That's why I took issue with your comment that <strong>Singaporeans belong in Singapore</strong> and painted the contrast of Singapore 20 years ago and Singapore now to you in my previous post.</p>
              <p>The concept of home is subjective and depends on each individual. I used to believe that if you are born into that country, you should call it home as it is the place where you grew up, make friends, work, get married and eventually die. Well, not anymore, thanks to exposure to my foreign friends and PAP government's wonderful policies. To me, if you like the place (country) you are living in and can envision yourself settling down, growing old happily and eventually dieing there, then that's home for you. It doesn't have to be that you must be born into that country to call that place a home.</p>
              <p>As for returning back to Singapore permanently, I would suggest you take a 2 week vacation trip in Singapore to feel the changes Singapore has experienced within these 2 decades. Even singaporeans living in the country are not comfortable with the changes.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans are probably one of the most frequent travellers in the region, and many Singaporeans are actually stationed, or have worked in other countries because Singapore is such a small market. As a air and sea travel hub, it doesn't take us a long flight to be out of Singapore to see and experience other parts of the world, not like australia, haha...many singaporeans have made the decisions, AFTER experiencing other parts of the world, to call Singapore our home.</p>
              <p>It is difficult to believe that millions of singaporean are living uncomfortably in Singapore.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>First and foremost, greetings from Downunder! As to your query about roti pratas and roast ducks, you need to realise that Australia is VERY multicultural now compared to the earlier years!! Asian migrants have brought with them famous recipes of Asian foods, ALL, I repeat, ALL Asian foods are available here in Australia, especially in Melbourne!! Hawker stalls and take aways in most shopping centres!!</p>
              <p>Australia is also much closer to Singapore than the US of A, hence also one of the reasons why I picked this country to be my home!</p>
              <p>As for those who come to this forum and make foolish remarks, just ignore them! They're uncultured, no family education and just can't tell the difference between yea or nay! That will be the day when they have the knowledge to debate wisely and can say something nice to anyone who don't agree with them! Typical social misfits!!!</p>
              <p>Anyway, have a good day and ciao!!</p>

              <p>Baby squids??!! Indeed you can get them at Springvale market!! But not in the supermarket itself, you'll have to go upstairs, two doors away from the Chinese restaurant. Unfortunately, they stock only frozen food. So, if you're looking for fresh ones, you won't find it there!</p>

              <p>Hello people, I think adaptability is sometimes being forced by
              circumstances. If you really think you can't do better or simply
              survive in Singapore, just pack your bages and go. There are tons of
              Malaysians working and staying in Singapore, mainly because they can't
              get that kind of good life in Malaysia. No point arguing where else is
              better or worse than Singapore. Everybody's life style, habits and
              desires are different. How to make a comparison just by mentioning
              personal experiences?</p>
              <p>Singapore is indeed getting harder for
              true blue Singaporean to stay with all the rising living cost, scarily
              high rental prices for government-owned flats (99 years rent, not
              freehold), even more scarily high in number of FT influx. Also not
              forgetting the meritorcacy systems in Singapore. Even if you are a
              foreigner from some ulu ulu foreign university where the name of the
              uni is not pronounceable by normal Singaporeans, you will still have
              advantage over ordinary non-grad Singapore peasants in Singapore. For
              Singaporean men no need to say lah, proudly serve your country with all
              your sweat and tears but strangely, somedays when you are back in the
              civilian world, finding half the people in the same MRT train cabin,
              speaking languages/dialects that you don't quite understand. Of course
              not forgetting the state-controlled press always have motivational
              speeches for ordinary Singaporean peasants like myself, hopefully we
              can have the same forsight and think in line with the highest echelons
              of the state forgetting that ordinary Singaporean peasants have
              problems fending for their survivals and space with their dust-like
              salaries (if and only if peanuts salary=600k). Then scali one fine day
              another blogger with elite back ground will pop up and tell you to FO
              from her elite uncaring face, of course, with an elite daddy jumping to
              her defense saying that her speech is fundamentally not wrong.</p>
              <p>Maybe more true blue Singaporeans should try leaving this
              country. My foreign friends are always amazed by the number of
              languages that we can speak but also inability to step out of our
              self-portrayed comfort zones. In my own heart, I firmly know that
              regardless of the amount of complains made in this monitored cyber
              space, things will not be changed or improved. But if you really can
              make it in another country, you will always be welcomed back with open
              arms. In fact, every country in this world welcomes a successful person
              and despise leeches, especially true for a meritocracy nation like
              ours. But if LL cannot make it, then must come back also lor. No harm
              trying, I guess...</p>
              <p>People, please don't blast me for saying all
              these, I'm just one mid-30s, low-level, non-grad Singaporean male
              peasant that will soon move to try out in another country. Not because
              I don't like Singapore, simply because I can't live well and happy
              here. Hopefully I can make it somewhere else someday and have a simple
              family of my own. If you are in the same plight as me, maybe you should
              do the same.</p>
