              <p>Hi Hitman, don't understand why you are looking for more greener pastures.</p>
              <p>some Singaporean got one home here another in Bataam, many HK people also got second home in Shenzhen.</p>

              <p>a good paratrooper always check his parachuts before every jump, he will not wish to have to use back up.....new parachut will become old, whether you change or repair depends on your own ability, unless you expect somebody to change for you.</p>
              <p>So how are you doing with current parachut? changing to a high performance parachut does not necessary mean you can do high performance sky diving.</p>
              <p>You can find many beautiful houses in magazines, or driving along Tanglin area, Trevose area, even Katong area, got money can buy one, not much money can rent one, but it is a home that you will need to build, think long term.</p>

              <p>Exactly what I am trying to drive home sgdiehard!  We should be thinking beyond the "material things" and "why our situation is not perfect"..., thinking this way makes our life really dry and perspectives very limited.</p>
              <p>However, though, will people really begin to realize the above?  My expectations have been lowered yet again since joining this forum.</p>

              <p>I have been married for 12 years.  It is amazing how questions can come from certain angles....</p>
              <p>The definitin of "ME" varies for individuals, some people see themselves as an individual (and that's it), and some see themselves as part of a bigger group or family.  Therefore, his/ her self-worth or rather, role, is interlocked with all aspects of his/ her life.  The "yourself" meant in my previous post means different things to different people.  Can you understand?</p>
              <p>In my case, I see myself in the latter group and therefore, whatever I choose, I will have that kinda mindset - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSIBILITY</span></strong> - a word that I use repeatedly throughout my posts.</p>
              <p>I do not think people wanna see you fall as they are busy trying to survive, but if it means stepping on some people, the coward in them says "Go for it!"</p>

              <p>maybe u should give up material life as u wish by joining a monastry or some church.but pastors n priests also earn a respectable salary nowadays.</p>
              <p>if a guy likes to be surrounded by swimming pools and Zen gardens....then its his view of relaxation.material value???what material value.....?if u think my style of relaxation sounds too materialistic and sinful......well maybe u would expect a cave with pictures of animals on the walls.</p>

              <p>Actually your final few posts are pretty skewed towards Singapore. Some of us who reply on the other side of the fence, you did not bother to acknowledge. But you only acknowledge a certain person who agrees with you that Singapore is a good place to live in.</p>
              <p>What's home? I don't know what sgdiehard is trying to drive at. I only know Singapore doesn't feel too much like home to me. The country is run so much like a corporation, that I DO NOT have a sense of belonging to it. My wife, who is Chinese, once tried to explained to me why the Chinese love China so much. I cannot comprehend, because Singapore to me, is not a country, but a corporation.</p>
              <p>I am still proud to be a Singaporean, because its a strong branding. But I am not proud of Singapore as a country, because of the way it is being run. Perhaps if the PAP bother to listen more to the people, there would be more who would stand with Singapore.</p>
              <p>I remember the good old days when SM Goh was still PM, he was saying to slow down, to look at how to be a more caring society. At that time, support for PAP was higher. I was also supportive of it. I had so much respect for that man.</p>
              <p>As I said, we are all treated 2nd class even though we are citizens. Heck, I even heard of Headhunters telling me that companies prefer foreigners to locals (this even surprised the foreigner that came to look for a job), and there are those companies that prefer foreign males than local males because of our committments to reservist. Don't laugh, these are examples of discrimination that the PAP will not acknowledge, but exist on the ground.</p>

              <p>I DO appreciate good posts - posts that are well thought out and objective.  For all reading, please pardon me that I may not be able to acknowledge ALL good posts, but I DO appreciate them, and whether or not you agree with me.  By the fact that I am writing to you, I hope to convince you that your opinion is noted and acknowledged.</p>
              <p>But if I write to imply certain posts have under par quality (like a few you must have read too), it is another thing. </p>
              <p>I do not skew towards supporting Singapore, I support Singapore - the imperfect society &amp; country - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all the way</span></strong> because I am a Singaporean.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I critique while I support</span></strong>,  something that you too, do and accept.</p>

              <p>Yes I know you acknowledge that, but I would like to highlight that your last few posts aren't really too objective. Perhaps its coz of your frustration at getting your point thru to some other forumers here. So yes, it's fine if our writings go under-par once in a while.</p>
              <p>And yes, as a responsible Singaporean, I critique while acknowledging the imperfections of any country. Those pro-govt supporters who have challenged me before to come out with good ideas to solve the issues I raised, I have raised good ideas before to shut them up.</p>
              <p>Coming back to your point on FT, I am NOT implying that we should discriminate against FT, but EVEN if we do, it's a normal practice for many other countries. Organizations must justify the need of a FT (like WHY locals cannot do the job) before they can hire a FT. I think that's reasonable.</p>
              <p>What I am emphasizing about, is that in Singapore, from what I understand from some Headhunters, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a FT is given preference AHEAD of locals. Now, THAT'S 2nd CLASS.</span></span></p>
              <p>I give you an example, of a certain ministry that hired a vendor to outsource their IT projects. Their vendor hired 100% Indians to perform the project. They simply tell the ministry that Singaporeans CANNOT do the job (which is totally untrue), and the ministry just accept that excuse. In the end, 100% of the positions were given to Indians. My friend, who was then the project manager working for the vendor, was forced to leave once they were able to import Indians, because she is a Singaporean (they were prejudiced against her).</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I am not AGAINST the FT policy (In fact I support it). I am AGAINST the implementation. And the govt is to be blamed for it 110%.</span></p>
              <p>Either way, life isn't easy, I agree with you. I would like to highlight that even though I put the blame squarely on the PAP for many issues that we face (rising costs, suppressed salaries, age discrimination, 2nd class citizens, discrimination against locals in the job market, etc), I made my own decision to walk out of that mess in protest of how they have made the environment so stifling.</p>
              <p>The only things I miss are my parents, my friends. I don't miss Singapore much, coz there's really nothing much to miss.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, we are in danger of implosion, due to overrewarding. Just look at Wall Street. Overrewarding, and underpunishment caused the credit crisis. Our Govt is in danger of that as well. A certain DPM Wong can be allowed to stay in his position, even when Mas Selamat escaped under his watch. (Probably now he is claiming credit for capturing Mas Selamat back). That's underpunishment for you. If it's me being the PM, I will ask him to step down. It's the same DPM Wong that proposed jailing Singaporeans if illegal immigrants are found in their rented apartments.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if the opposition party is reading this, please target his GRC in the next election. I hope he lose his job.</p>

              <p>We've covered shipping container homes on AT before (<a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/ny/shipping-container-homes-by-pfnc-global-communities-064351"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">here</span></span></a>, <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/sf/inspiration/container-house-by-leger-wanaselja-architecture-042535"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">here</span></span></a> and <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/sf/inspiration/cargotecture-057958"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">here</span></span></a>), but we're continually impressed by the possibilities of this malleable recycled material.

              <p>Available technology for homes may be outpacing the consumers ability to install and manage the digital technology according to a report by <strong>Accenture</strong>, <a title="The Digital Home" href="http://www.accenture.com/Global/Research_and_Insights/By_Industry/Electronics_and_High_Tech/ManagingTheDigitalHome.htm"><span style="color: #a91b33;">Managing the Digital Home</span></a>.</p>
              <p><span id="ACNAuthenticPlaceholder1">Although the demand for an integrated environment in the home continues to rapidly grow, Accenture reports “troubling trends” that could seriously slow this trend down. Consumers are having trouble dealing with the technical complexity of the digital home. Connectivity problems are common and return rates for unused equipment are very high. Indeed, a recent Accenture study put the cost of consumer electronics product returns at close to $14 billion in the U.S..</span></p>
              <p>Despite the problems we homeowners are having keeping up with the technology many more people are expected to embrace networked devices in the home in 2009 and 2010. According to a report by Accenture, home networks deployed and <em>managed by service providers</em> are expected to increase by 10 million households by the end of 2009. By 2011, they predict more than one-third of U.S. households will have digital home systems in place.</p>
