              <p>No, I am not encouraging people to leave the country.  I have visited sg.forum for a month now, and I have read many Singaporeans complaining about our country about this and that, and some claim that many Sinaporeans are planning to leave and have left for other greener pastures....</p>
              <p>May be they are all true, but to me, I choose to stay here because this is home.  I am not alone, I am certain.</p>
              <p>I am asking a direct questions: "Where else but here?"  We are born here, have our roots &amp; memories here, relatives &amp; childhood friends here.  We can still see the old playgrounds we spent afternoons after afternoons, the corner foodstall at the hawker centre where we had our best food - be it chicken rice, rojak, or plain kachiam pute (sorry if I spelled it wrong),...</p>
              <p>Yes there are problems, but I can assure you other countries have problems too.  Look at the USA with the horrible healthcare system; spending so much money and risking American lifes in the Iraqi war, for the benefit of a few greedy individuals; the shcool yard shooting and killings; and the education system is so backwards that they are considering using our text books for their students?!</p>
              <p>Nope, definitely not where I wanna be...and I have lived there for 5 years of my life, so I know what I am talking about.</p>
              <p>My choice is still here in Singapore, and I know some will differ, so let's hear it...</p>

              <p>Where in Europe will you go?  Hungary or Spain or England, they are all very different, all with pros and cons.  We have often heard teh French complaining about the Brits about certain things, and Brits on French vice versa...</p>

              <p><br>I lived in Canada - Toronto and Ottawa - for 3 years, and the country does not suit me.  The cultural difference was just too much.  The Canadians were in general too relaxed (some called lazy) and though the social welfare system was rather good (free or highly subsidized medicals, housing loans etc.), but somehow I felt it was not sustainable over a long time as it was burning a big hole in the country's wallet.</p>
              <p>There was also a small rivalry between the Anglofones and the Quebec'uars, and latter fiercely needed to be recignized to be a different province - even though the constitution clearly stated each and every province was unique and was to be respected for its background (I paraphrase a bit, it has been 20 years).</p>

              <p>On the contrary, I have been married for 12 years, and family life is my top priority.</p>
              <p>My feelings towards my country is because Singapore IS my country.  As the Russians like to put it - motherland.  It is a love-hate relationship.  I have no doubt whatsoever that our country has problems, as I have mentioned repeatedly in my forums, but will I change my mother because she nags at me, or disapproves my simplest of requests, or fail to appreciate the sacrifices I mak for her, NO.  I think the basis of ALL relationships is compassion and forward-looking, why should our take on our country be any different?</p>
              <p>Am I a big fan of PAP, or LKY or LHL or GIC?  Hell NO.  I just choose not to complain that much and seek to understand and if possible something about it, but not getting myself politically involved.</p>
              <p>Again, I choose to return home not because Singapore is so perfect, it is because it is MY COUNTRY, that's all.  No need to be called patriotic, just a regular joe who chooses to call this place my home.</p>

              <p><br> I lived in Canada - Toronto and Ottawa - for 3 years, and the
              country does not suit me.  The cultural difference was just
              too much.  The Canadians were in general too relaxed (some
              called lazy) and though the social welfare system was rather
              good (free or highly subsidized medicals, housing loans etc.),
              but somehow I felt it was not sustainable over a long time as it
              was burning a big hole in the country's wallet.</p>
              <p>There was also a small rivalry between the Anglofones and the
              Quebec'uars, and latter fiercely needed to be recignized to be a
              different province - even though the constitution clearly stated
              each and every province was unique and was to be respected for its
              background (I paraphrase a bit, it has been 20 years).</p>

              <p>haiz..but you know, the cost of living aboard is high, u live abroad before, so u should know, i mean the cost of hotel stay, rental of car and petrol, these could tally up to atleast $3000+</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so all in all, if your company send u there for work, best, if not, u waste alot..</p>

              <p>No, I am not encouraging people to leave the country.  I have visited sg.forum for a month now, and I have read many Singaporeans complaining about our country about this and that, and some claim that many Sinaporeans are planning to leave and have left for other greener pastures....</p>
              <p>May be they are all true, but to me, I choose to stay here because this is home.  I am not alone, I am certain.</p>
              <p>I am asking a direct questions: "Where else but here?"  We are born here, have our roots &amp; memories here, relatives &amp; childhood friends here.  We can still see the old playgrounds we spent afternoons after afternoons, the corner foodstall at the hawker centre where we had our best food - be it chicken rice, rojak, or plain kachiam pute (sorry if I spelled it wrong),...</p>
              <p>Yes there are problems, but I can assure you other countries have problems too.  Look at the USA with the horrible healthcare system; spending so much money and risking American lifes in the Iraqi war, for the benefit of a few greedy individuals; the shcool yard shooting and killings; and the education system is so backwards that they are considering using our text books for their students?!</p>
              <p>Nope, definitely not where I wanna be...and I have lived there for 5 years of my life, so I know what I am talking about.</p>
              <p>My choice is still here in Singapore, and I know some will differ, so let's hear it...</p>

              <p><br>Dubai - no speed limit - kill someone - and get beheaded ? No thanks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How should we consider any other place to be home besides Singapore ?</p>
              <p>One of the main criteria will have to be opportunities and political openness; while all other factors related to security, weather, health care system, taxation, education and housing will be secondary - as one simply has to adapt oneself to the situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The USA for all the dark negativism in social ills - will still present a land of opportunity for anyone willing to slog and make a life for oneself.</p>
              <p>It remains a multi-ethnic melting pot that basically tolerates differences between those who are themselves immigrants - with the exception of those who are insecure in their group culture of red-necks, white prejudices, brown skinns, and black cultures</p>
              <p>It is a place where hardwork will be rewarded in self-satisfaction, pride and hard cash.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any one of the Scandinavian cities or towns will also be a worthwhile place to consider adopting as a second home - from which one can find the opportunities to grow one's entrepreneurial creativity.</p>
              <p>Their open society almost invite diversity with such tolerance as their society will also demand social responsibility from each individual to protect the rights of another, and their collective willingness to be responsible for the preservation of the openess for themselves as a Community.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Having said all that Singapore will still be where HOME is</strong> - as so much of ourselves is here, especially the school friends, the National Service comradeship,  the emotional roller-coaster rides in careers and courtships, in money made and lost, and most of all - the sacrifices made in tolerating the dishonest politics that existed since the days of our forefathers.</p>

              <p>most peoplwe asians who come to oz region dont find it nice as they have not much decent jobs around.so they setup own company only to find that they have no cooperation from oz component suppliers.in the end they had to import components which was much cheaper than oz prices.prolly oz is worse than usa to find career or make things as oz land price for a desert area is as costly as major american city apartments.</p>
