              <p>Hi Chelsea,</p>
              <p>Sorry to hear about your mother, I am sure she is happy in
              heaven looking down at your fulfilling life in Australia.</p>
              <p>No problem at all, this forum is for all to participate and
              voice their views or concerns.  I take a slightly different
              view becuase of my approach in life, and I am sure we all
              have different sets of value systems.  Both you and soul_rage
              choose to stay away from Singapore and I choose to return home - so
              there!!</p>
              <p>Are you writing from Aus at the moment? </p>

              <p>Actually, I am staying away for now, until things get better in Singapore, or I finally decide what I want to do after I retire at 40.</p>
              <p>Anyway, pertaining to the showcase in Shanghai, where it's a major screw-up, nothing surprises me anymore. We are even reverting back to the 80s era where streets get flooded.</p>

              <p>as decided by an expert of Lloyd's register?</p>
              <p>The design was just a passenger ship,not designed for militrary use.</p>
              <p>not to mention one or 2 crews were drowned, caused by the poor designs.</p>

              <p>In relpy to Terminator Hitman's comments, I should point out to you and everyone here that my father passed away before I left Singapore. My mother came to Australia and lived with me for a couple of years before she decided that the cold weather in Winter here doesn't suit her and thus returned to Singapore. But she was a regular visitor every year, until she's was diagnosed with heart problems later in life.</p>
              <p>That said, "Chelsea" is not my name, please don't jump into conclusions. I'm now living in a surburb named Chelsea and it's about a twenty minutes stroll to the beach front!</p>
              <p>I attended the Anglo Chinese School in Singapore, served two years of NS and after that just couldn't get any decent job in Singapore because all I learnt whilst in the army was how to handle a rifle properly!! Tell me what prospective company would need a person like me!?</p>
              <p>During the 70s, 80s, it was the hippie, flower power era!!! Being young and rebellious, I followed the trend and kept my hair long and wear bell bottom trousers. But guess what??? The LKY government ordered the police to arrest us youngsters, cut our hair at the police station by a police man and using a pair of scissors, ripped our bell bottom trousers to bits!!!</p>
              <p>Is that communist way of thinking or what, I asked you??? Either we do the LKY way or rot in Singapore! There's absolutely no freedom at all!!</p>
              <p>Terminator.......all I can say to you and everyone reading this, is that I'm still an Asian. Nothing can change that and we're all human beings. Try not to be too offensive in your contribution here and if there's any questions you would like answered, try to ask it in a proper and civilise way. After all, this is a 60 year old man and also is having the same heart problem my mother had all those years ago in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Not asking for sympathy at all, but it would be nice to have a civilise chat with people where I once came from.</p>
              <p>Be nice and take care always. :)</p>

              <p>Hi!</p>
              <p>It's interesting to know that Sg was like that in the past. Nowadays, I don't see such things. In fact, in one of the sgforums outing, we have one young male forumer with shoulder length hair!</p>
              <p>Fortunately, I was born in the early 80s, so I don't see LKY's govt when I'm more atuned to society's happenings. I do agree with you that if that was what happened to you (not talked about in history texts, definitely), then it is indeed tyrannical.</p>
              <p>Nice listening to your views and opinions. :)<br>These are bits and pieces of history that will be gone if they weren't shared by you :)</p>

              <p>Hello Eagle,</p>
              <p>Is that your spoilt brat?</p>
              <p>My two Jack Russells passed away last October!! A boy and a girl, both had cronic kidney disease! Stopped eating one day altogether, lost weight tremendously and vomitting literally bile!!!!!!! My poor little angels!! Took them to the Vet and he literally told me straight that it'll be cruel to let them go on suffering like that!! So, the little girl, Cookie, was put to sleep on the 10th of October and the little boy, Samsam, followed on the 12th of October. Both were 16 years old and always will be in my memories!! No one can take that away from me!! Still missing them heaps!!</p>
              <p>Yes, indeed! During the LKY years, it was dreadful. Have a guess how much I was paid by the Army when I was serving my NS!!!??? A mere $30.00 a month!! That's not a typing error!! Only thirty Singapore dollars a month!!! Somethings are impossible to forget in your life, especially in such circumstance!!</p>
              <p>There were so many unhappy people then, the hawkers in the hawker centres, taxi drivers, just ordinary people who were struggling to make ends meet!!</p>
              <p>By the way, no pets allowed when we were living in the HDB flats!! If caught adopting a cat or a dog or even a small bird in a cage, you'll be made to pay a penalty by the authorites!!</p>
              <p>Have a good one and bye for now! :)</p>

              <p>Hi Chelsea,</p>
              <p>Not sure if you are updated, but NS pay is about $420 for recruits nowadays. But of course, it's still well less than market rate. But if you are a 2LT, it's about $940, which sounds a little better for someone with just an A level cert. It's really a wonder $30 is paid...</p>
              <p>I believe there are some leeway for pets in HDBs nowdays too.</p>
              <p>I can feel you, why you were unhappy with Sg back then. Then again, it's all these unhappy experiences that indirectly drove you to your success today :)<br>Ironically, you could actually thank Sg for giving you the unhappy experiences</p>

              <p>History texts did say that there are curfews during the racial riots period in the late 60s.</p>
              <p>In fact, July 21's racial harmony day was sort of an anniversary of the worst racial riots ever happened in Sg.</p>

              <p>Is it true that the "illegal assembly act" (dun know the real term) is still in force?  It states that any assmebly of 6 people or more (without permit) is not allowed, and it was never lifted?</p>
              <p>During my days, my recruit pay was around SGD230, but considering the inflation over the last 20 over years, seems I had more to spend.  Hahaha.</p>

              <p>That's where you need to understand the purpose of the illegal assembly law.</p>
              <p>Technically speaking, any one of us who are in a group of 3 or more (Yes, Chelsea and eagle, it's NOT 6 people or more, it's 3 or more) is breaking the law. It's up to the police to evoke the law or not.</p>
              <p>The law exists to make sure that they have a reason (or excuse) to close you behind bars should they find you a threat. It's not exactly something I agree with.</p>
              <p>I think there's a saying that somewhere within our laws, there is probably one law that catches everyone, so much so that each person is technically a criminal when living in Singapore.</p>
