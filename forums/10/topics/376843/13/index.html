              <p>Not sure if we understand each other, what I am saying is that Australia has been open to immigrants, and for years these immigrants have been getting jobs in australia, while I believe the immigrants have worked hard and earned their position, I have not heard the local australians complaining about these immigrants taking over their jobs, or that the immigrants were given special priviledges by the government!</p>
              <p>Singapore is now open to more immigrants, but the locals are complaining that the immigrants are taking over their jobs, and that the government is giving them special priviledges.</p>
              <p>So, IF, the australian complains, then they would be behaving like some singaporean here. IF they don't, then there is lesson on magnanimity some of us can learn here.</p>
              <p>It is different to say that we can't communicate with a somali in Australia, and making all somali to speak english before they are allowed in australia. If the guy can't speak english you just go find another one who does, here we are saying to them "you bloody well speak english if you want to be in Singapore."  </p>
              <p>hmmm...lionnoisy may not like what I say, but if this is the situation in Australia, then this is something we need to learn, no? </p>

              <p>You make it sound like Australia's immigration policies are as liberal as Singapore's.</p>
              <p>Are 40%(37%, if you want to be picky) of their total population consisting of immigrants now? This doesn't even include immigrants who decided to become citizens.</p>
              <p> Unless this has changed for the past few years, I'm pretty sure they are a lot more selective about who they allow in. And no, the children of the Asian rich in their universities does not count as their population.</p>
              <p>Singapore isn't just open to immigrants now, it's opening the bloody floodgates. As long as the water flows the government no longer cares about who it washes out.</p>

              <p>Hitman, I can only tell you this... soul_rage has indeed left for USA for a very very very very prestigious job...</p>
              <p>The success he has achieved for himself in society is very much respectable. It was not through inheritance or marriage, but through his talent and hard work...</p>
              <p>He might sound arrogant to you, but from what I know about him so far, I would say he's already being very humble... Serious...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Working hard and making plans are never wrong. God doesn't plan your path for you; he gives you the choices to different paths, and it's up to you which path you want to take.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Indeed, you have no intention to be serious here. There's nothing wrong with that. But I do find the insights by Lionoasis and soul_rage refreshing. I would appreciate if there are less disruptions ;)</p>

              <p>Lol, as I said, the little boy is so impulsive and stupid and he will definitely respond to my post. Wonder up till now does he know what "Fool of Hagar's Offspring" mean?</p>
              <p>Anyway, little hitboy, trust you to make stupid comments just through watching CSI miami. This is really the butt of all jokes :D</p>
              <p>The more you shout, the more we see your immaturity. The more it serves my purpose. Continue, boy. Let us see how much more immature you can be :)</p>
              <p>Eagle, save your breath on little boys.</p>
              <p>And, there are people who grow old with a little boy mentality (never grow up). This guy is probably going to be one of them :D</p>

              <p><br>Just to add in more info, immigration policies in Australia are tightening. Where, you could apply for a work visa independently, now you can only apply given the following conditions:</p>
              <p>(1) When there is an Australia company that has hired you and will sponsor your visa</p>
              <p>(2) When there is a state in Australia who will sponsor your visa</p>
              <p>Getting (1) or (2) is very difficult since the company or state MUST justify why they need foreigners. Therefore, its becoming harder to immigrate to Australia.</p>
              <p>Singapore is very much different. We are opening the tidegates and let the foreigners flood the market until even the locals die.</p>
              <p>It doesn't hurt me, coz the so-called foreign-talents in Singapore cannot do my job. But this flooding has affected many of our fellow Singaporans whose jobs can be worked on by the foreigners, who are willing to accept lower pay and longer working hours.</p>
              <p>As I mentioned, sgdiehard knows nothing, and yet wants to comment on Singaporeans, then Americans, Canadians, Australians.</p>
              <p>PS: Stevenson101, thanks for the insight on the gaming industry. It's pretty interesting to know what is going on over there. Are there any govt grants given to companies to train locals, or the companies are just continously hiring foreigners?</p>

              <p>Don't get me wrong, I don't support the way our government let in foreigners. but I won't fight with the FW such as maids, construction workers,...they are doing jobs that singaporeans don't want to do, and they are really contributing to the standard of living here. </p>
              <p>The problem is the expats who are allowed in freely. they are the "FT" who are provided with housing here and their children go to international schools at company's expense. Are they really doing the jobs that Singaporean can't do?</p>
              <p>but the acceptance of immigrants and the government's immigration policies are quite separate issues.</p>
              <p>33% of population of Perth are from countries other than the UK, america or local australia. It does not appear that the people resent the arrival of foreigners from other parts of the world, notably India and China. In vancouver, the whole suburb looks like part of HK, in a mall called Aberdeen, a fun raising event was held to help the China earthquake victims, only cantonese and mandarin were spoken on stage. I was amazed, but my canadian colleagues really don't bother. It was interesting to find that the punjabi community was actually petitioning the government to let in more of their own people.</p>
              <p>I am not sure if the local australian, canadian would change their attitude if more immigrants were allowed.</p>
              <p>but the real question is, if you leave singapore and go to a new place, how would you like the locals to treat you? surely you don't want them to vent their dissatisfaction with their government on you.</p>
