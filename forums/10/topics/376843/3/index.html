              <p>There are different levels of passion and it does not take the
              deepest of passions to convince oneself to pick a home.  Thus,
              my unwillingness to pick up a rifle is not an indication of my
              devotion to my choice.  Put in another way, I love my
              family more than I love my country, I think most people are the
              same, and I will be more inclined to risk my life for the former
              than the latter.</p>
              <p>If you are comparing a PR and a citizen, why not compare a
              Minister and a commoner?  Is that not a more relevant
              comparison?  They feed off our money, and are our leaders
              right?</p>
              <p>And will yor fight, serioously?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>eh, i dont see how your comparison works. Cause a minister and a commoner dont have almost equal or better opportunities or rights. Flaw there.</p>
              <p>In a war, if im most certain, well.. you'd be compelled to fight, regardless of your choice. but thanks anyway for your opinion. And yes, i do understand that you'd prefer your family. Cmon. who doesnt! seriously. But you should be aware that in the case of a war, almost or all NSmen will be deployed, as sg troops are seriously small in number.</p>
              <p>About me? No. Ive revoked my citizenship and im 17. TO be frank, i feel no sense of belonging or loyalty whatsoever towards sg. I have my reasons for my choices, and im sure that you do too.</p>

              <p>but i fight because i feel a thrill in it all for some perturbed strange reason due to my exposure to violent war movies in the then SBC tv.it had more info whern i was a  kid.they had war psychology documentary every afternoon on soldiers.and then in the evening they had war movies n then afyer years of exposure to these kinda movies from a 5yr old.....i feel more at home in a wartime singapore than a peacetime singapore.</p>

              <p>See this..., your Ministers are your leaders who tell you to contribute to your country and remember to pay your taxes, CPF's and vote for the PAP.  The people of Singapore have been doing this for 44 years, and when war comes and by some people's definition of patriotism (dun know if it is yours), one need's to fight to prove his/ her love for the country, and why are Ministers different?  Should they not lead by example?</p>
              <p>And if you have revoked your citizenship, why are you questioning a Singaporean if he/ she will fight for the country when you yourself have already abandon it?!  This question is a good one, but it is better to be asked by someone who is still a Singaporean.  Why?  All answers are irrelevant to you, except maybe, for your curiosity. </p>
              <p>Yes the Ministers are different becuase they have more choices and previleges than a commoner, and therefore when war comes, for the same reason, they should charge first by virtue of their role as leaders.  Leaders lead, and that means from the front.  You are young and I commend you for attending to these sites.  I am sure you can appreciate more of what is being discussed here in a few years.</p>
              <p>If you like these topics, I highly recommend reading Atobe's posts.  I have benefited much, I am in my 40's.</p>

              <p>precisely the point which ive been trying to make in your 1st para. agree with that 100%. Somehow, previous paragraphs show otherwise. maybe misinterpretation or somehow, but besides that, yes i do agree.</p>
              <p>ok. with regards to the 2nd para.</p>
              <p><strong>I asked you on that topic as you stated sg as your "home", and by that definition, i wished to know more about what it meant to you.</strong> simple. If you can define sg as the place which you seek shelter in, im sure you can further explain by what terms those would mean to you. outright and straightforward.</p>
              <p>yes. And i do read Atobe's posts. Maybe you might consider reading up online news and blogs. Cause they may also provide an insightful aspect to the political/economic and labour landscape of sg.</p>
              <p>eg. theonlinecitizen.com</p>
              <p>eg. temasekreview.com</p>
              <p>+ many more. Dont wish to pull them all out. but im sure that Ah Chia had stated them in a post before</p>

              <p>Dear Oh Sheet,</p>
              <p>I think it is relatively more difficult for us to continue this conversation because we are looking at things from different perspectives.  No disrespect to you, but our background and age difference is just too huge.</p>
              <p>The words "Choice" and "Home" are very different to you and I.  For example, you mentioned "you have your reasons and I have mine" in our choices of citizenship.  Was there a choice for you?  I doubt it.  I would think your parents migrated and you had to tag along.  You acted out of "no choice" and I choose to return home.</p>
              <p>You also question Singaporean's willingness to fight for Singapore when you have already given up your RIGHT to fight for Singapore.</p>
              <p>You asked me for my definition of HOME when you have given up yours.</p>
              <p>Being able to read and thinking you understand the English words written is different from feeling it deeply for having gone throough life filled with up's &amp; down's.  If you are like Angel7030 thinking he/ she knows about stuffs because of the experience of the father, well, it is not the same also.</p>
              <p>I can anticipate your reactions being an enthusiatic teenager with some confidence that you know something about this world, but it is not what you think.  You should continue with the persuit of your passion to understand about politics, economics &amp; society.</p>

              <p>Have you wondered why the health-care system is top notch, how about the fund? Where does the govt get them from.?</p>
              <p>Cost of living low compared to other developed countries? Surveys show otherwise. In a recent survey posted on TOC, it shows the buying power of singaporean workers are among the lowerst as compared to other developed countries. (its a survey about the amt of working hours req to purchase an ipod, and other grocery prices, compared with other countries.)</p>
              <p>Lastly.. transport. Ok. what you've stated seriously makes no sense at all.</p>
              <p>You can buy a chrysler 300C 2nd hand at just 3 years old for $9000, and do note that you keep the car for life, instead of in sg, after 10 years, it'll most probably be in the dump. Try doing that in sg.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Woah, why would anyone in their right mind want to buy a Chrylser???</p>
              <p>And similarly, I personally won't buy a car in SG for the reason you mention, dumping a good car after only 10 years. But the public transport system is pretty good in SG for old ppl, with buses, MRT, and taxis. Come over here to the US, and you see all the 80+ year old drivers who are SO dangerous weaving here and there. You're not supposed to be drinving when you're so old...but they don't have a choice since the public transportation system sucks here.</p>
              <p>The standard of living in SG is WAY cheap compared to developed countries, especially if you take out te cost of cars. HDB flats are still cheap. Look at the food and groceries prices, way lower than other developed countries like Japan, US, Europe. And that's a fact. Surveys are always manipulated, but I've shopped in many developed countries before, and everyday necessities are so much more expensive than in SG.</p>
