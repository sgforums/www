              <p>To answer Angel................you have never experience anything what the early batches of NS men went through. Inspite of my explanation to you, you're still trying to force me to admit that it's done me good!! Are you telling me that all the goodness in me is through NS training and not my parents upbringing? You're talking rubbish and don't have a single clue what the men went through in the first and second batch of NS training!! Walk a mile in my shoes, then you can pass silly comments on how I should be grateful to the Singapore government!! In the meantime, do some research before you make silly comments because it does upset many decent people here!</p>
              <p>God almighty!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Give me strength!! How can anyone be so ignorant!!!!!!!!!!!! And you're a Singaporean????????????? I'm ashame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

              <p>Just ignore her. She/He/It is a well-known empty vessel, who makes comments on things not known to her/him/it, and then get ridiculed totally in the forums.</p>
              <p>The most 'impressive' part is, she/he/it is very thick-skinned, and will continue to go on posting rubbish.</p>

              <p>well....if they dun give u enough food rations for military exercise or time to get enough food from yer enviroment,,,u may proceed to faint in front of yer CO.thats all they are gonna get with nuts for meals!</p>

              <p>To answer Angel................you have never experience anything what the early batches of NS men went through. Inspite of my explanation to you, you're still trying to force me to admit that it's done me good!! Are you telling me that all the goodness in me is through NS training and not my parents upbringing? You're talking rubbish and don't have a single clue what the men went through in the first and second batch of NS training!! Walk a mile in my shoes, then you can pass silly comments on how I should be grateful to the Singapore government!! In the meantime, do some research before you make silly comments because it does upset many decent people here!</p>

              <p>Hi uncle chelsea,</p>
              <p>in this forum you find all kinds of people, andÂ you don't really know whoÂ are at the other end of the line.Â stupid, ignorant and arrogantÂ remarks are inevitable, so do not get agitated.</p>
              <p>are they all singaporean? no, even if they are, they are not the singaporean you used to know, especially since you haven't been back here for a while.</p>
              <p>the young singaporean who had gone through NS cannot feel the what people like youÂ in the early SAF had gone through. That is what I call generation gap. <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>To what you had gone through, I can only say this, thank you, the pioneer of the SAF, for the foundation you built, we canÂ now enjoy aÂ better SAF. Foundation began from the ground, that is why itÂ was so tough for you, the building is now up,Â and we are enjoying the view from high, and weÂ are indeed grateful.</p>
              <p>have a good day.Â Â </p>

              <p>Yes!!!Â  I am reading, why wouldn't I be...?</p>
              <p>I will welcome anyone who will contribute to Singapore - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">native or new immigrant</span></strong> - I will have no problem taking in FT's who are really responsible people who can also add value to our small nation.Â  To me, having a culprit native is worse than having a contributing new immigrant.Â  I may get fried over here, but this is my value system.Â  Remember, our ancestors were not original natives themselves, so we are children of new immrigrants.</p>
              <p>If there is any relavance to NS topics, it is one of the things that make overseas Singaporean (women too) click instantly.Â  SoÂ are the terms like KNN &amp;Â CCB that I still hear every week.Â  They are vulgar but uniquely Singaporean &amp; touches us intimately (I wouldn't have said this had I not left Singapore).</p>
              <p>Yes be nice to everyone (try lah, even if you are in a bad mood), this makes Singapore more liveable for yourself too.Â  Cheers!!!</p>

              <p>To Mr. Chelsea,</p>
              <p>Is there a lot of racial discrimination in Aus? Sorry for asking this but i do heard some positive and negative feedbacks from my friends regarding Aus.</p>
              <p>After reading the full 42 pages, i think my stand is firm. I will still come back to Singapore and remain as its citizen. However, i will venture out in overseas countries to broaden my vision and perhaps grind me into a better person.</p>

              <p>No need to apologise Blurking123, if you don't ask, you'll never find out. So there!!</p>
              <p>To answer your question, there's racial discrimination everywhere in any parts of the world, even in Singapore. Some of the comments made by them do hurt, but as the Asian saying goes, "If you want to live under some other people's roof, you'll just have to put up with it."</p>
              <p>In the 60s and 70s, if you're Asian or people with dark skin or someone with a foreign name, you'll be "kept an eye on" so to speak! They have that sort of mentality to presume that we're not to be trusted. But since the mid 90s, their attitude slowly, I repeat, slowly changed to the better. Mostly due to their trade with Asian countries and they come to understand Asians better. I'll say they're influenced by China's economic boom and the friendly Asian people. Politicians started to be friendly with our head of states and hence their people were encouraged to spend their holidays in Asia because most things are much cheaper there than in Australia!</p>
              <p>All my years here, I've encountered a couple of name callings, but no one has ever put a finger on me.</p>
              <p>On the whole, Australia is quite safe now, as long as you're respectable to yourself and your family, i.e. if you have a family. What I'm trying to say, is don't get yourself involve with drugs, or anything that's against the law and wherever you live, your neighbours or community will definitely welcome you.</p>
              <p>If you decide to broaden your knowledge in some oversea countries, please make sure you find out evrything you can about the particular country you want to visit! Otherwise you'll find yourself behind bars or even kidnapped or even killed for a simple silly mistake. So, be very careful!</p>
              <p>The best of everything endeavour and cheers for the day.</p>

              <p><br>Actually, from my numerous years as a global consultant trotting to parts of Europe, Asia and now USA, I have to say that this racism topic is really overplayed.</p>
              <p>Discrimination (not just racial) happens everywhere, every minute. To be a global citizen (as what I see myself), one must be able to put up with certain unpleasant incidents. Most times, it's a small matter (superficial), if you are able to look past the incident.</p>
              <p>I was once a global mgr, and I had to work for a period in the UK. I had to put up with discrimination everyday I walked into the office, because I was the youngest manager there (the only one in my early 30s, the other managers were 40s and beyond), and not to mention, the ONLY asian manager.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, at the end of the day, it's how you manage those unpleasant incidents. I understand that it's all part of the experience of beingÂ a global worker, and it helps to shape me and make me even stronger, and become more tolerant and open to views from a diverse cultural background.</p>
              <p>PS: I also enjoy the feeling that I give to those Westerners that aren't happy with an Asian sitting amongst the top ranks.Â :p</p>

              <p>Soul Rage, I couldn't agree with you more!! 200 % as a matter of fact! The best part is when they have to address you "Mister" or "Sir" and you can literally see the dissatisfaction on their faces when they said those two words!!!!!!!!!! How idiotic can one be? But just like you, I put up with the rubbish and came out on top of them!!</p>
              <p>I was Customs Declaration Officer, working for Rothmans of Pall Mall, the big cigarette company here in Melbourne. Doesn't exist anymore because it was taken over by the British Tobacco Company. Life was so easy and sweet, what with company cars and long lunches as well............well, why not? I worked hard for the position. Just as long as I don't abuse the priviledge!! Don't you agree?</p>

              <p>Soul Rage, I couldn't agree with you more!! 200 % as a matter of
              fact! The best part is when they have to address you "Mister" or
              "Sir" and you can literally see the dissatisfaction on their faces
              when they said those two words!!!!!!!!!! How idiotic can one be?
              But just like you, I put up with the rubbish and came out on top of
              them!!</p>
              <p>I was Customs Declaration Officer, working for Rothmans of Pall
              Mall, the big cigarette company here in Melbourne. Doesn't exist
              anymore because it was taken over by the British Tobacco Company.
              Life was so easy and sweet, what with company cars and long lunches
              as well............well, why not? I worked hard for the position.
              Just as long as I don't abuse the priviledge!! Don't you agree?</p>
              <p>Take care won't you and be good!! :)</p>

              <p>Just to highlight a funny experience related to me by my direct boss (who was also asian) at that time, the global financial controller of the organization.</p>
              <p>She was a good tennis player, and an Englishman and wife challenged her and her friend. In the end, the English were whitewashed. They were very sore losers, giving excuses that they were not feeling well (so din play well), and refusing to play again with my boss.</p>
              <p>The point being, I find that some of the Westerners are still refusing to admit that asians can be superior.</p>
              <p>Thanks for the well wishes, anyway I am proud to bear the Singapore flag in the USA.</p>
