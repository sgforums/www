              <p>Too often I have read (am sure you do too) of people wanting to move to other countries for this and that reason.  Some of these people have valid reasons, but some are either just too misguided or too young to know what the world is all about.</p>

              <p>I would still prefer to be in singapore because first of all, there is not much natural disasters around here. Even if earthquakes, its not affecting us very much. Also there are no seasons, and whole year round we get the sun. Lastly, since i have been staying in singapore for so many years, I would just continue staying here.</p>
              <p>However, I do believe it is a great experience to try staying overseas as well. Be it in the europe, america, asia, australia or africa. It is definitely a rich experience to try out the culture of other people and experience how others around the world live their lives.</p>
              <p>I had stayed in America before for 4 months, and it was wonderful. Totally different from singapore. The pace is much slower. Anyway I am not staying at nyc or other major cities. Interacting with other people and getting know more about them if definitely great. Further more it allows you to experience different climates as well.</p>
              <p>I would definitely wish to try staying australia, in africa as well as taiwan or europe.</p>
              <p>Best is to have some relatives in the countries you want to visit and then go over and look them up.</p>

              <p>There are many cities out there with no natural disasters as well.</p>
              <p>Also, there is this interesting issue with the earthquake in Indonesia. The epicenter seems to be moving closer to Singapore every year. From 2002, 800km away, to the recent one, 570km away.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it's each person's choice. My choice for not being in Singapore are as follows:</p>
              <p>Negative Points of Singapore</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Too high a price to pay for perceived security and safety. For just one advantage, have to give up my freedom and being suppressed by the PAP</li>
              <li>Suppressed wages in Singapore. I know I can earn much more, and even though I was amongst the top 10% of salaries in Singapore, it is still suppressed</li>
              <li>Unequal opportunities. Opportunities (regardless of performance) given to so-called elites like scholars and people related to certain people. I was also a scholar but I gave it all up because I did not believe in favortism. I prefer to be judged by my talents, not by my background.</li>
              <li>Citizens being treated like 2nd-class. There is no difference then being in Singapore and being 2nd-class somewhere else.</li>
              <li>Age discrimination. Once you hit 40, you are told that you are now stupid and hence have to lower your salary expectations. This doesn't apply to certain groups of people (ie the PAP), who have an iron rice bowl year in, year out.</li>
              <li>Lousy choices of shopping, groceries and entertainment. Everywhere, its Giordano, G2000, etc. Going to one shopping mall means you covered almost 70-80% of what shops there are in other malls. Groceries are severely limited, and entertainment is largely limited as well. The only thing good about Singapore is hawker food, which is also becoming bad, given the kind of price increases we see in a short span of time.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Positive Points of being elsewhere</p>
              <ul>
              <li>I enjoy working and living in an international environment. Where we get to interact with people from diverse nationalities and culture. Singapore is too small to provide such an experience. Though the govt tries to import foreign talent, the foreign talent quality is a huge question mark.</li>
              <li>I enjoy living in a country where it is huge and there are so many places to go and explore. In Singapore, go east go Changi, go west to Tuas, go North go Woodlands, any further goes into Malaysia. There isn't much space to have fun</li>
              <li>I enjoy living in a city where there are endless options of shopping, huge variety of groceries with endless amounts of flavours. There is just so much to sample, so much to do.</li>
              <li>I enjoy living in a city where the cost of living is not artifically high like in Singapore. I get branded stuff at a fraction of a price to what we pay in Singapore. Groceries are also cheaper.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>And then, there is one last thing, the question of where Singapore will be in 30 years time. If I have a kid, I most definitely would not want him to be tied down in Singapore, because things may be vastly different in 2 to 3 decades. I do not have faith in Singapore continuing to be ahead of others in the near future, because our leaders are now stagnating, continously singing praises of what they DID, and not focusing on what they SHOULD BE doing for the future.</p>

              <p>Well said, Lionoasis, and I hope positive outcome means we are more aware of life outside of Singapore vs inside, but of course, this differ from people to people depending on their experience overseas, and it will be difficult to compare ALL the good things about living in the world outside Singapore with ALL the not so good thing in Singapore. The reality of life is that we can't have the cake and eat it.</p>
              <p>I lived in China (4 years) and Canada (only 14 months).</p>
              <p>First, ADJUSTMENT: Like in singapore, I have to travel out of my base in these countries, so to me life is not so different. But it is a lot of adjustment for my family, especially my wife. Looking for place near to school, to my office, to amenities...(more difficult when my office was not in the city), making new friends, get used to all kind of people....in the end, Singapore is where my family will call home.</p>
              <p>if you are single, should be easy. If your children grown up, also easy.</p>
              <p>Second, MERGING INTO LOCAL COMMUNITY. I want a chinese lifestyle, so shopping, dinning...all ended up in China town, HK; to my canadian colleagues, we are still chinese, just different; to the shanghainese, we are also Chinese, but different, so we ended up among the very small Singaporean community, hahaha....</p>
              <p>if you are single, easy, if your children grown up, also easy.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, LOOKING FOR NEW JOB. it is very different comparing salaries from statistic and actual situation. Got a job here and go there is easy, go there find a job, depends....washing dishes gets quite a lot of money.</p>
              <p>if you are prepared to just find any job and make a living, the western country is better, but if you want to pursue your career and do what you studied, it will depend on which town or city you live, and what you study.</p>
              <p>Finally, MEDICAL AND EMERGENCY. It is the same everywhere, you need insurance. This you really have to find out yourself, where you stay and what are the rules. In Singapore, no insurance still can do. In Shanghai, also can do. In Canada, no can do. You get what you pay.</p>
              <p>and I prefer to pay tax in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I don't have problem talking about any politics, going to church (even in China), in Singapore, Canada and China. It all depends on who I speak to.</p>

              <p>Calling ALL Well Travelled Singaporeans,</p>
              <p>Too often I have read (am sure you do too) of people wanting to
              move to other countries for this and that reason.  Some of
              these people have valid reasons, but some are either just too
              misguided or too young to know what the world is all about.</p>
              <p>For all people that this posts is directed to, hope you can
              join me and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">share
              with our fellow Singaporeans our experience in foreign
              countries</span></strong>, so that this forum creates more positive
              outcome  - more informed and educated fellow citizens - rather
              than being reduced to a whinners corner (does not apply to all -
              totally agreed).</p>
              <p>So please, step right up, and do our part!  Instead of
              reading passively, we can actually do something about it.</p>
              <p>Thank you in advance!</p>

              <p>Lionoasis, I'm not sure if I'm reading this right, so help me out here.</p>
              <p>As
              far as I can tell, the raison d'etre of this thread is to enlighten
              "are either just too
              misguided or too young to know what the world is all about".  That
              being the case, you have a Catch 22 here: whatever information any of
              these people glean from any discussion in this thread is secondhand at
              best.  Put bluntly, anything anyone learns from here is simply a case
              of, "well, someone on the internet told me ...".</p>
              <p>For
              argument's sake, let's just accept that since there's no better
              alternative at hand, short of sending these people to other countries
              to live and find things out for themselves.  We come to a second issue,
              namely how the topic is being framed.</p>
              <p>Right from the thread
              title, the tone set in this thread is problematic.  In particular, I'm
              talking about the "if you are leaving Singapore" part of the title. 
              Two ways of viewing the topic of immigration issues is that you are
              either moving <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> another country, or you are moving <span style="text-decoration: underline;">away</span> from the one you are in.  At face value, this seems to be a
              hair-splitting distinction, but it has a significant effect upon the
              decision-making process.</p>
              <p>Frederick Herzberg has an interesting
              take on this situation, making the distinction between being
              dissatisfied and simply not being satisfied, terming the relevant
              factors hygiene and motivation factors respectively.  The key
              distinction here is that hygiene factors relate to issues that need to
              meet a threshold level to avoid dissatisfaction, but that in themselves
              do not actually provide satisfaction.  We're not talking about a
              continuum from dissatisfaction to satisfaction.  Instead, we have two
              separate dimensions, one going from "dissatisfied" to "not
              dissatisfied", and another going from "not satisfied" to "satisfied".</p>
              <p>So, how does this fit into the current pictutre?</p>
              <p>If
              we're talking about leaving a country, we're talking about avoiding
              dissatisfaction - not about seeking satisfaction.  Certainly there are
              issues such as unacceptable crime rates in various countries that
              attend to the dissatisfaction factor, but the expected or attained
              level of satisfaction can outweigh the dissatisfaction.  This has
              already been reflected in this thread where people have said that
              despite the drawbacks of countries, the attractions would still make
              them want to stay there.</p>
              <p>In addition, if we're just talking about
              dissatisfaction driving the decision to leave a country, what's there
              to say that satisfaction can be found in the destination country?</p>
              <p>Turning
              that around, if one decides to move to another country, does it mean
              that one is dissatisfied with the original country, rather than being
              attracted by the satisfaction that can be found in another country? 
              This is an important issue, because a fair number of people here seem
              to make the unsubstantiated assumption that immigration is necessarily
              an insult to the original country, and they get defensive about it and
              start a bun fight.</p>
              <p>If you do want to achieve your stated objective, it's important that you clearly frame your approach to this issue.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Quite a lot written here.  Thank you and I like posts like this, whether in support or against my opinion, is irrelevant.  I guess TWO things are requested to be clarified, and I shall provide me answers in the following short and specific manner (probably injustice to you as they will be short compared to your questions):</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Where I stand?  Well the thread was title and angled "If you are leaving Singapore..." because I read many people's posts expressing their dissatisfaction about our country and many of them expressed their desire to seek greener pastures (I do have other thread from which these remarks were made known to me).  I gathered from the way of the words, that the remarks were made by either young people or people who have not been well exposed (just speaking for myself obviously), and this thread is meant to be a small <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">challenge</span></strong> to them to tell us which countries are a better fit to them?  And why?  I would expect most of them would not be able to come back with a well substantiated answer.  I am proven to be correct.  More importantly,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> I hope to create an awareness within themselves that they are not ready to make such decision for themselves</span></strong>.</li>
              <li>Higher Satisfaction vs Avoiding Disatisfaction?  Well, we are all motivated by different needs, and we approach life <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">proactively or reactively, </span></strong>between these two words lies the answer for most people.  I cannot answer for them nor do I attempt to intervene.  I have lived outside Singapore for 20 years, and just feel a sense of duty to share so that people can realize that things are different when transpired through the media or word of mouth (including mine), and they should seek to understand one of the most important issues in their lifes - like migrating - by taking a responsible and practical approach and see it for themselves, before any harsh decision is made.  While people don't move away just like that, but at least, they should know where our country stands relative to other countries.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>In short, "education by challenge".  Hope this answers your querries, but if you have a better approach please feel free to let me know...thanks.</p>

              <p>Well said, Lionoasis, and I hope positive outcome means we are more aware of life outside of Singapore vs inside, but of course, this differ from people to people depending on their experience overseas, and it will be difficult to compare ALL the good things about living in the world outside Singapore with ALL the not so good thing in Singapore. The reality of life is that we can't have the cake and eat it.</p>
              <p>I lived in China (4 years) and Canada (only 14 months).</p>
              <p>First, ADJUSTMENT: Like in singapore, I have to travel out of my base in these countries, so to me life is not so different. But it is a lot of adjustment for my family, especially my wife. Looking for place near to school, to my office, to amenities...(more difficult when my office was not in the city), making new friends, get used to all kind of people....in the end, Singapore is where my family will call home.</p>
              <p>if you are single, should be easy. If your children grown up, also easy.</p>
              <p>Second, MERGING INTO LOCAL COMMUNITY. I want a chinese lifestyle, so shopping, dinning...all ended up in China town, HK; to my canadian colleagues, we are still chinese, just different; to the shanghainese, we are also Chinese, but different, so we ended up among the very small Singaporean community, hahaha....</p>
              <p>if you are single, easy, if your children grown up, also easy.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, LOOKING FOR NEW JOB. it is very different comparing salaries from statistic and actual situation. Got a job here and go there is easy, go there find a job, depends....washing dishes gets quite a lot of money.</p>
              <p>if you are prepared to just find any job and make a living, the western country is better, but if you want to pursue your career and do what you studied, it will depend on which town or city you live, and what you study.</p>
              <p>Finally, MEDICAL AND EMERGENCY. It is the same everywhere, you need insurance. This you really have to find out yourself, where you stay and what are the rules. In Singapore, no insurance still can do. In Shanghai, also can do. In Canada, no can do. You get what you pay.</p>
              <p>and I prefer to pay tax in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I don't have problem talking about any politics, going to church (even in China), in Singapore, Canada and China. It all depends on who I speak to.</p>

              <p>Again, we make decisions for ourselves, not for anybody else.  Makes no difference if you decide to be a capitalist or a hermit, as long as you are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">responsible</span></strong> for yourself, and you are happy with your decision.  If living in Singapore is inhumane for you (though I find it difficult to believe), then you have every right to be human if you choose to be...</p>

              <p>eh??greener pastures in just one place??why cant we have more greener pastures instead of just one as long as we are comfortable with them?its like a backup plan.if you went skydiving from 7000 feet  and your main parachute fails...........u still have your backup parachute so u dont end up as prata when u land.dont be too hasty on making a good decision.</p>
              <p>it all depends on the unpredictable situation one is living in......</p>
              <p>but definitely having just one main parachute if its somewhat in bad shape would mean ...............................certain death depending on factors involved. if u intend to be alive both main and  standby parachutes should be in good condition.however recently fer the last decade i noticed holes in my main parachute.should i repair it or get a new parachute?...i still have a standby parachute that werks.</p>
              <p> however if your parachute is good then you dont really need to fix it or rely on your backup parachute....if its going to break apart for no reason one fine day then u still need yer backup!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>If your comments are directed at me, it is PERFECTLY OK to have one or more parachutes, it is YOUR CHOICE.  Dun know who many times I have to keep repeating myself...</p>
              <p>Sigh....it is NOT ABOUT YOUR CHOICE but the<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MANNER YOU MAKE YOUR CHOICE</span></strong></span>....very big difference here - you have to hit the target not miss the target HITMAN1111111....your Rifle needs zeroing lah...</p>
              <p>One can live in a drain today and a toilet tomorrow if he is happy...</p>
