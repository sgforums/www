              <p>ok...time fer serious werk projects.....leave the name callin and illogical reasons at the door  if ya cant dent me...we are all civilised humans so if you really need to discuss anything please do so in a civilised human way.</p>
              <p>a gal jogged past me when i was a recruit in national service probably they didnt think much of sad army recruits who were almost bald.</p>
              <p>i dun fantascise bout hitman ,terminators.... even in fantascising it has to be buildable and economic as a $$$ building tool ...more like industrial robotics programming in industries that mean real $$$$$ n real business .perhaps u deal with masak masak robots and daydream without results or have any ability to program industrial robots or even build one from scratch as well as programming....thats what i have been doing non stop even when i was a recruit in pulau tekong decades ago.I never stopped progressing!</p>
              <p>if ya a security guard ....i doubt ya be able to do dat....</p>
              <p>if ya a businessman....u can pay people the average market rate of $60,000 /yr per engineer or buy the whole robot at $80,000 or more and then try to figure out a few years how to program them by yerself.....</p>
              <p>if ya a head shrink....u can ask people how it werks but lacking of specific knowledge,system designs and exposure makes it  impossible and a total fantasy.</p>
              <p>rmeber im the one who programs a robot ,designs and enables it thru a laptop by pressin a few buttons.i am able to design mechanical stuff.electronics design.electrical design and wire em up to make fantasies happen....this are stuff i learnt from silicone valley with its machines invented,designed and made  by genius.</p>
              <p>so who are u all?really!</p>

              <p>1st floor - total waste of space (so empty and so dim) - they should have made it into a garden (Singapore Eden Style) since this is the impression people have about Singapore, shift 3rd floor contents into first floor</p>
              <p>2nd floor - Singapore Inventions/Quality Products/ Achievements: NeWater/ Breakthrough in Medicine/ Creative Technology/ Osim/ Singapore Airlines/ Soil-free agriculture/ World's N0. 1 port etc.... there are so many things we can be proud of...</p>
              <p>3rd floor - Singapore The FUN - New IR's, Singapore Flyer (do a mini ride at top of Pavillion - the Swiss Pavillion has a mini ride too), F1, Youth Olympics, Merlion</p>
              <p>In a nutshell, 1st floor reinforces a good impression, 2nd floor to tell people Singapore has substance, and 3rd floor to increase traffic into Singapore. </p>
              <p>I am sure there are better ideas...let's hear them since SM Goh is inviting more opinions...</p>

              <p>Yes I agree... and I will add that the nature &amp; method of decision making prevents them from getting caught in operational cock-ups.  To be fair, when the operation gets that big (like running a country), it is sometimes difficult to pay attention to every detail (c'mon they are humans too).  And in operations ad hoc problems come when they come, they shoot up like a "cock" - hahaha.</p>
              <p>What I am upset with, is that the Expo is such an important platform to showcase Singapore and quite frankly, the nation's Pavillion is worse than a coporate event.  Leadership at ground level was needed and was not there.</p>
              <p>You are right when you say the top brass don't get hang, and I hope someone will at least get a slap on the behind to serve as a wake up call.</p>

              <p>No excuses isn't it?</p>
              <p>I mean at such a global platform, there is no room for failure. Every single effort should be put in to ensure success. If leadership at ground level isn't there, isn't this precisely a failure from the top brass? The inability to identify the correct people to put in place to ensure success is a total failure of the top command.</p>
              <p>LHL? I doubt it, given that he's not the top ranking person in our country. There is 1 MM, 2 SMs above him. He's only 4th in command</p>

              <p>one thing i noticed bout u is yer inability to take punishment.unlike ged who had taken quite a lot in commandoes and probably had suicidal tendencies in the past....what kinda punishment did u get in spore tat stopped u in yer progress n goal?and do u even have a goal in life....yeah i know making $$$ is a goal but what really is yer goal in life???</p>
              <p>you chelsea are weak.there was a time when i was yunger and laughed at death with my army folk who later shed a tear and called me a @$#$#$#.another senior in the same situation later smiled at  me and said something bout the vietnam war comradeship.how u would react to problems?run off leavin everyone behind??to what avail?accountability of time,people and $$$$ is a big responsibility and with that comes carelessness,thoughtlessness and wastage.u as a older guy should know what im talking about.</p>
              <p>if had i got stuck in spore i would fight it out to the end:live or die.....it will be changed.</p>
