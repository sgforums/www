              <p>However, I am not sure if you have ever lived in a city where the turnover is high. I am living in one like that now. Renters trounce Home owners by 7:2. For every 7 renters, there are only 2 home owners.</p>

              <p>Singapore hasn't reached this stage yet, but the foreigners vs locals, if I am not wrong is currently at a ratio of 1:4. And the Govt always doesn't breakdown between citizens and PRs amongst the locals.</p>

              <p>There isn't much difference between the pink and blue IC. Other than some differences that they tweak for show (school fees slightly higher for blue ICs for eg), there is really nothing much.</p>
              <p>However, do note one big thing, the Singapore passport. IF a foreigner comes from a country that has many restrictions placed on its citizens for travel to other countries (such as always having to apply for a visa whenever they need to travel), then becoming a citizen of Singapore becomes attractive.</p>

              <p>Well let's see, and hopefully we can contain the negative aspects of new immigrants, but these things are like this - a "packaged deal".</p>
              <p>I lived in Hawaii in the early 90's, as I have told you, and over there, the locals were complaining a lot about not being able to afford housing (even just renting) as the influx of foreign money - mostly from Japanese (it was rumored they owned 70% of Waikiki) origin and tourism related money - jacked up the prices by leap and bounds.  Yes, uncontrolled "anything" can cause problems.  Hope we can do a good job at this...</p>
              <p>Ironically, and laughable too, may be the Kiasu-ness of Singaporeans will alarm the government much earlier, and "save" us as a result.</p>

              <p>Well let's see, and hopefully we can contain the negative aspects of new immigrants, but these things are like this - a "packaged deal".</p>
              <p>I lived in Hawaii in the early 90's, as I have told you, and over there, the locals were complaining a lot about not being able to afford housing (even just renting) as the influx of foreign money - mostly from Japanese (it was rumored they owned 70% of Waikiki) origin and tourism related money - jacked up the prices by leap and bounds.  Yes, uncontrolled "anything" can cause problems.  Hope we can do a good job at this...</p>
              <p>Ironically, and laughable too, may be the Kiasu-ness of Singaporeans will alarm the government much earlier, and "save" us as a result.</p>

              <p>If they lose an entire GRC, I think that will hit them really hard, and if they continue to claim they won by a landslide, chances are, they will lose even more in the next next election</p>

              <p><br>you need to read it up</p>
              <p>the counting of votes are done by Singaporeans, and mostly handled by public servants (teachers, etc) from the various districts.</p>
              <p>I believe vote counting is fair, in the sense, they wouldn't commit fraud by declaring one side the winner if the other side had won in the votes</p>
              <p>However, the unfairness stems from the use of GRCs, and the techniques beforehand used to limit the no. of opposition that can contest the elections.</p>
