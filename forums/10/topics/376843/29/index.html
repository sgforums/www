              <p>You have already written it out...my approach, my stance and my conclusion (also what I hope people would accept).  Yet you dun get it??  What do you not get?  What I was driving towards or my intentions or why my approach or the choice of words? </p>
              <p>"Where's the connection"?   I am really confused now.</p>
              <p>Let me waste my time yet again.  Assuming a child, 3 feet tall, keeps insisting he can jump over a wall 10 feet tall, instead of explaining all the theories and illustrating all the physics experiments, I will probably ask him to just try, and let his own failure tell him he's wrong.</p>
              <p>Now I am not encouraging Singaporeans to migrate (as mentioned in my fist post), but I wanted them to think through what would happen if they went here or there...and the conclusion was the lesson or message I wanted to deliver.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I will NOT answer any more of your questions about what's the connection or whatever if it is asking me to prove myself (why should I ?!!), as I have spent too much time on this.  Hope you can understand what I have been saying, and if you are still not convinved (for whatever reason), just conclude that we should not have any converstations whatsoever.</p>

              <p>Well, if you say one thing (i.e. "If you are leaving Singapore where would you go?") and mean another (i.e. "there is no
                                      real alternatives for them"), by definition that makes you a liar.</p>

              <p>You don't have to respond.  Frankly, apart from admitting your dishonesty there's little you could say anyway.</p>
              <p>I don't have to start a thread to lobby against you.  All I am going to do is - how did you put it? - ask questions, hard questions!  The less you address them the more credibility you will cost yourself, so it's perfectly fine by me if you don't ever respond to me again.</p>
              <p>Don't count on not hearing from me again, though.  Someone's got to keep you honest.</p>

                  war,,recessions............i tried lookin at usa immigration and
                  its not easy....and the other countries have made immigration such
                  a vague thing that it cant be easily understood anymore.might as
                  well write it all in urdu and u go figure it out.</p>
              <p>those dat immigrated over like chelsea and ged dun seem generous
                  at this time of da year wiv da good stuff.in fact they all sound
                  very angry and start calling people as insects.....probably due to

                  wants to be in oz........  ..he shoulda read more b4

                  been comparing his fabled english standards with fellow
                  sporeans.not only dat...he tries to compare his failed immigration
                  result to others and will ensure he is the best of the best...no
                  one else should be ahead of him.</p>
              <p>THIS ARE THE KIND OF CHINESE AND FELLOW SPOREANS WHO ARE WEAK

                  sporeans.</p>
              <p>LKY would be laffing again knowing dat the result of overseas
                  sporeans have turned themselves on one another...like a pack of
                  hungry animals.</p>
              <p>i wonder if i should throw my spore passport away if i were to

              <p>Well, if you say one thing (i.e. "If you are leaving Singapore
                  where would you go?") and mean another (i.e. "there is no real
                  alternatives for them"), by definition that makes you a liar.</p>
              <p>So there.</p>
              <p>You don't have to respond.  Frankly, apart from admitting
                  your dishonesty there's little you could say anyway.</p>
              <p>I don't have to start a thread to lobby against you.  All I
                  am going to do is - how did you put it? - ask questions, hard
                  questions!  The less you address them the more credibility you
                  will cost yourself, so it's perfectly fine by me if you don't ever
                  respond to me again.</p>
              <p>Don't count on not hearing from me again, though.

              <p>I have spoken to Singapore overseas unit, they

              <p>While west coast in SFO alone is approximately more than 3000

              living in other major cities...</p>
              <p>And I have met singaporean who reside in the US for over 30 yrs
              and still visit singapore for various reasons.</p>
              <p>Just an observation</p>
              <p>What is unique characteristics about singaporean is that they
              tend to live more independently from another singaporean.
              While ethnics chinese from PRC, ROC, Korean have shown
              a tendency to live together and have their social
              network in the same vicinity/city.  </p>
              <p>once in a while i would bump into another singaporean in unusual
              places. So perharps it depend on which generation that seeked
              the change.</p>

              <p>The claim against me is in itself groundless, and exposes one's self-righteousness at best.  And talks about someone needing to keep me "honest" (well this is new), haha, if this person is so noble (ha!) and has found a "liar" in me, the call of duty should prompt him or her to start exposing me at a larger scale, why stop here???!!!!  It's because he/ she knows he/ she will have<strong> </strong>a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hard sell</span>.  Most forumers respect me or at least treat me properly, so let's bring it on if you dare, looser!</p>
              <p>For one, this person has at least admited he/ she goes around finding most people's opinion challengeable - and I am sure he/ she actually goes around challenging people saying "Oh! I dun understand this.." or "Where is the connection...?" - so what is he or she trying to prove?  Funny??!!  Sometimes, I think this person rejects other people for the sake of rejecting, and may be this is a way of getting attention for him/ her.  Pitty.</p>

              <p>Hello everyone!</p>
              <p>I found this forum on the 1st of December this year and thought what a nifty place to be, to able to have a debate or a discussion about the place where I was born and grew up! Disappointedly, after a mere few days, I discovered that neither the place nor the people have ever changed for the better. Rather, the sniping amongst one another still exists. What's worse, here in this forum where all of us should be able to "debate" and tell each other stories of our living experiences in Singapore or overseas.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying all of us are the same, but when will some of you ever grow up and treat each other in a civil way? I wonder!! Why aren't you lots happy at all and have no sense of patriotism towards your homeland I read Soul Rage enquire!!!!</p>
              <p>Well just think of yourselves as two banks of the same canal, they run parallel with one another, and yet remain so very, very far apart.</p>
              <p>Nothing has altered, nothing has changed. Nothing! It's still a question of abstract proletarian consciousness, of abstract proletarian consiousness, while the dialectical aspects of the matter............................</p>
              <p>Forgive me because I'm unable to go any further! Goodbye and God bless one and all!</p>

              <p>Hello everyone!</p>
              <p>I found this forum on the 1st of December this year and thought what a nifty place to be, to able to have a debate or a discussion about the place where I was born and grew up! Disappointedly, after a mere few days, I discovered that neither the place nor the people have ever changed for the better. Rather, the sniping amongst one another still exists. What's worse, here in this forum where all of us should be able to "debate" and tell each other stories of our living experiences in Singapore or overseas.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying all of us are the same, but when will some of you ever grow up and treat each other in a civil way? I wonder!! Why aren't you lots happy at all and have no sense of patriotism towards your homeland I read Soul Rage enquire!!!!</p>
              <p>Well just think of yourselves as two banks of the same canal, they run parallel with one another, and yet remain so very, very far apart.</p>
              <p>Nothing has altered, nothing has changed. Nothing! It's still a question of abstract proletarian consciousness, of abstract proletarian consiousness, while the dialectical aspects of the matter............................</p>
              <p>Forgive me because I'm unable to go any further! Goodbye and God bless one and all!</p>

              <p>Hi Chelsea,</p>
              <p>I must apologise that you have not gotten what you want out of this forum, I am sure I am partly to be blamed.  I just didn't expect you to be a victim earlier than me.  Like you, I dun like to deal with (in your case read) houseflies' comments or entertain endless word twitching or revisiting of definitions, and prefer what I called "free flow of minds".  I once contemplated with soul_rage &amp; Atobe to set up a private domain within sgforum, for invited forumers only, and we can exchange our views and information without distractions.  But due to my business expansion next year, I cannot see myself having time for it.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the activities over the last few days have taken all the fun away...  If you really dun come back all the best to you.  My apologies once again.</p>

              <p>Actually, it's kinda a conclusion on Lionoasis's part.</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>Given the absence of proper reasons other than rash remarks
              about leaving Singapore in this thread (other than a few of us), he
              has kinda reached a consensus based on what he has heard on this
              thread, and of what he has experienced in actual life, that most
              Singaporeans are only suitable to stay in the country.</p>

              <p>Funny you should mention that, soul_rage.  I recall Lionoasis stating:</p>

              <p>I wonder if he's missed the delicious irony of the present situation.  he appeals for people to go and find out for themselves, and yet he tries to push his conclusion.</p>
              <p>I'll chalk another point up for hypocrisy.</p>
              <p>As for the consensus, are there not enough reasoned posts by members such as yourself, scrambledeggs and others to give one pause before barrelling along to a conclusion that there is no other place than Singapore?  Surely the intelligent thing to do would be to take these into consideration, would it not?</p>

              <p>Well, it's a perspective on his part, and I do not deem it right
              or wrong. In my opinion, Singaporeans are one of the most
              productive workforces in the world, and there are less of us out of
              Singapore due mostly to lack of opportunities and personal reasons,
              than not being adaptable.</p>

              <p>And once again I have absolutely no argument with that.  It's a balanced, reasonable and defensibleopinion to hold.</p>
