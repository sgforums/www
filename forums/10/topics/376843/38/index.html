              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>Just happen to be in Singapore vacationing...visited the two casinos, and they are quite nice - albeit they have done a rush job - the atmosphere is still good though.  So now there is another reason to stick around - gambling is much easier liao!</p>
              <p>I know some people think it is a bad idea, but look, we needed more stimulus to our economy, more growth sectors, and these resorts make Singapore more fun.  Personally I think it has been a good idea.</p>
              <p>Enjoy life and please remember Singapore is your home if you are a Singaporean, and for new immigrants, I welcome you if you are the value-adding FT.</p>

              <p>Compulsive gamblers will always find ways to gamble, with or without the casinos.  Think there is a way for family members to blacklist these compulsive gamblers with the two casinos and no access will be granted to the latter - but I doubt this will really stop them.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I hear you.....Casinos do make gambling easier but if people gamble out of convenience, I personally will not worry about them, as they are not real gamblers.  I have been to the Sands and Resort World a few times, and I have not once stepped into the Casinos...what does it say?</p>
              <p>I was refering to hard core gamblers, and they would find ways to gamble, 4D, Toto, Star Cruises, Sports betting, even Mahjong.... If people want to gamble they gamble, if they do not like gambling, like me, they don't step in.  The Casinos do not make the gambling problems worse or better than what it is...fundamentally speaking.</p>
              <p>On a seperate note...</p>
              <p>I remember many years ago when the government was saying Casino's were bad because of this and that reason, and Singaporeans were complaining the government was being too "motherly"; and now, we have people saying they should manage the gambling issue.  People always have something to say...</p>
              <p>End of day, people need to manage themselves.  I have repeatedly mentioned throughout this forum that people should not look to our government for solutions, this is one of them.</p>

              <p>2 things I wish to highlight</p>
              <p>There's the compulsive gamblers (cannot be saved)</p>
              <p>And then, there's the boundary compulsory gamblers (close to becoming one, making it more convenient will push them off the edge).</p>
              <p>There's also a huge difference between 4D, Toto versus the casinos. I think you should know what I mean. Casinos have more 'kick' for gamblers.</p>
              <p>Secondly, in other countries, casinos are usually centralized into specific areas. Look at USA, Korea, Malaysia, Macau, and you can see that being the case. One probable reason is not to make it too convenient for people to gamble, and the other is also to manage the vices that come with casinos better.</p>
              <p>For Singapore, we don't have the luxury. That means that the population have to cope with the vices and convenience that come with the proximity of the casinos. It remains to be seen if we can handle it appropriately. After all, we seemed to be the 1st country that is so small, to open casinos (not 1, but 2). The consequences of doing so cannot be found going back into history.</p>
              <p>We can just keep our fingers crossed.</p>
              <p>I understand you are very positive about Singapore, but the above, you have to admit, are not unfounded risks that I am raising.</p>
              <p>And, end of the day, this is not about whether we are a nanny state, but whether its the right thing to do for a country that is so small.</p>

              <p>Secondly, in other countries, casinos are usually centralized into specific areas. Look at USA, Korea, Malaysia, Macau, and you can see that being the case. One probable reason is not to make it too convenient for people to gamble, and the other is also to manage the vices that come with casinos better.</p>
              <p>For Singapore, we don't have the luxury. That means that the population have to cope with the vices and convenience that come with the proximity of the casinos. It remains to be seen if we can handle it appropriately. After all, we seemed to be the 1st country that is so small, to open casinos (not 1, but 2). The consequences of doing so cannot be found going back into history.</p>
              <p>We can just keep our fingers crossed.</p>
              <p>I understand you are very positive about Singapore, but the above, you have to admit, are not unfounded risks that I am raising.</p>
              <p>And, end of the day, this is not about whether we are a nanny state, but whether its the right thing to do for a country that is so small.</p>

              <p>Hi Soul_rage,</p>
              <p>Our country is small and therefore we need more angles for growth and global positioning.  Casinos should not be seen purely as a moral issue, there is a bigger picture to it.  Our two IR's play an important role in Spore's future.</p>
              <p>I really do not see any point in making the Casinos isolated and inconvenient.  Why?  First of al Singapore is small  - as you have mentioned earlier - how isolated can it be?  Secondly, simple economics will tell us that investments need to be recovered soonest possible and given the global situation these days, no developer will build something this nice and operate in the red so that they can weed out the borderline gamblers.</p>
              <p>Granted there will be cosmetic influence on the gambling hype in Singapore in the short term, but over the long run, gamblers are gamblers and non-gamblers stay away!  Trust me!</p>

              <p>Well, I have to politely disagree.</p>
              <p>I also noted that you did not take note of my point, that we are the FIRST small country to build casinos, and therefore, unlike other countries, where they could isolate casinos to minimize the negative impacts, we CANNOT.</p>
              <p>There are no historical lessons that we can learn of the potential consequences of casinos to a very small country. We are the FIRST. We can only keep our fingers crossed that this will not result in negative consequences to Singapore. Already my parents are telling me that there is increased crime in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I also disagree that just because Singaporeans say no casino, equals that we want a nanny state. The decision to open casinos is not a straightforward decision, and therefore should have gone to a vote. Instead, the govt did some 'wayang' thing about asking us about our opinions, and when there were many disagreements to that, still went ahead with it anyway. You weren't around when that fiasco happened, so I feel you are being unfair to Singaporeans by your statement.</p>
              <p>Finally, you are incorrect to say that gamblers are gamblers. Are you telling me that a baby born immediately has gambling instincts? The fact remains that even compulsive gamblers were once innocent kids, and something happened in their lives that caused them to become compulsive gamblers. Increasing convenience equals increasing the probability of increased exposure to non-gambling people, who may end up going in to try, and end up becoming gamblers themselves.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I think you are taking it too lightly the matter of convenience. I have seen so many businesses suffer/prosper because of convenience.</p>

              <p>The IR's (mainly the casinos) is a strategic consideration and decision, and as are all decisions of this magnitude, one needs to understand there will be pros and cons.  I am not saying IR's do not produce problems, but as our country embark on the long journey of reconstructing our nation's future, side effects are anticipated and dealt with.</p>
              <p>NO Casinos will ever be isolated, they never will be either in a large or small country, FIRST or LAST.  Look at Las Vagas, it was in the middle of a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">desert</span></strong> (far far away from civilisation....) a few decades ago, and look at what it is today?  Human nature and the law of economics my friend.  And when I say economics, I do not mean the recovery of investments for the developers/ investors, I refer to the overall impact of the two IR's -financially, job opportunities, the private banking sector, tourism spin-offs, attraction of FT's.... etc.  Albeit, there are always negatives amongst positives. </p>
              <p>Most Singaporeans said "Yes" to casinos btw..., and from what I have heard at ground zero, I have NOT seen one negative feedback.  Though I am sure there will be.</p>
              <p>When I said "gamblers are gamblers" I was refering to the hardcore ones that you said they were "hopeless" cases yourself.  Yes, some borderline ones could be converted, but this is just a natural phenomenon of a new addition to our entertainment infrastructure.  Are the increased crimes that you mentioned directly linked to the casinos?  I dun think so, but hey, vice is vice.</p>

              <p>Since we cannot agree (and anyway we have always agreed to disagree), let me summarize my points to emphasize that you should get an alternate perspective.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>To be honest (not meant to be offensive), you have not lived in Singapore like I did when the decision on the IRs was made. Therefore you have not seen the way they made the decision on this. Where was the decision by the people? It's again the govt deciding everything. You cannot thus blame Singaporeans about us being a nanny state<br></li>
              <li>Two, Sydney, Monte Carlo, etc, are cities, NOT a country. There is still a difference between that. Get that perspective right. And in no way did I say that the casinos will kill the country. I am just talking about the negative impacts that come with it, whether it is worth it.<br></li>
              <li>Three, I think you still do not understand the foreign policies that ARE shortchanging our people. Look at the number of foreign labor in our midst. You aren't living in Singapore for a long time. Do you know that the salaries of starting grads have stagnated for the last few years, if not even gone down? My wife has also said that for the past 10 years, she has seen that Singapore, as a clean and green society, is going downhill<br></li>
              </ul>

              <p>Since we cannot agree (and anyway we have always agreed to disagree), let me summarize my points to emphasize that you should get an alternate perspective.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>To be honest (not meant to be offensive), you have not lived in Singapore like I did when the decision on the IRs was made. Therefore you have not seen the way they made the decision on this. Where was the decision by the people? It's again the govt deciding everything. You cannot thus blame Singaporeans about us being a nanny state<br></li>
              <li>Two, Sydney, Monte Carlo, etc, are cities, NOT a country. There is still a difference between that. Get that perspective right. And in no way did I say that the casinos will kill the country. I am just talking about the negative impacts that come with it, whether it is worth it.<br></li>
              <li>Three, I think you still do not understand the foreign policies that ARE shortchanging our people. Look at the number of foreign labor in our midst. You aren't living in Singapore for a long time. Do you know that the salaries of starting grads have stagnated for the last few years, if not even gone down? My wife has also said that for the past 10 years, she has seen that Singapore, as a clean and green society, is going downhill<br></li>

              <p>I don't know if you remember my first contribution here Lion Oasis!!?? But that was once upon a time............. anyway, I left Singapore in the early 70s and settled down in Australia. I established myself very well and only been back to Singapore twice after all these years away. And that was for my mother's funeral!!</p>
              <p>I don't miss Singapore because I don't like the life the Singapore government has "forced" upon me to lead!! There are many factors which I find impossible to point out at this moment, but I can tell you that if I were to remain there and not make a move, I will never be able to establish myself to the way of life I'm leading now!</p>
              <p>I own my property for many years now, my car......my everything!! I don't owe the bank or any one a single cent!! I have enough in my bank account to last me till I leave this world and pass on all that's left to my nieces!! One, I sponsored and living here and the other is still in Singapore, waiting till she's ready to migrate!!</p>

              <p>Sorry to hear about your mother, I am sure she is happy in heaven looking down at your fulfilling life in Australia.</p>
              <p>No problem at all, this forum is for all to participate and voice their views or concerns.  I take a slightly different view becuase of my approach in life, and I am sure we all have different sets of value systems.  Both you and soul_rage choose to stay away from Singapore and I choose to return home - so there!!</p>

              <p>Dear Temasek Review,</p>
              <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-27776" title="sg-pavilion" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/sg-pavilion-300x151.jpg" alt="sg-pavilion" width="300" height="151">I like to share with your readers my recent visit to the Singapore Pavilion at the Expo 2010 in Shanghai. Like at all the major pavilions there, I had no plan to join in the long queue formed outside the music-box-like two-story structure, spending hours waiting to get in just for a few minutes of experience it offered. However, after having read some negative feedback about it, I was curious to see for myself how bad it could be when the exterior was quite cosmetically appealing.</p>
              <p>Upon entering the pavilion on the ground floor, I was shocked to be greeted by the sight of stack upon stack of cartons lining up along the walkway leading to the main hall. Initially, I thought they were part of the decorations but upon closer look, I realized they were not. Apparently, the walkway had been turned into a temporary holding area! It was an eye sore that did injustice to the millions of dollars pumped into building the pavilion.</p>
              <p>The main hall featured some simple activities for visitors that were boring and disappointing. These include jumping on mini trampolines in line with some rhythms to trigger music, and capturing projected images on hand held paper fans distributed free to visitors, activities that were reminiscent of those at the Singapore Science Center I visited in my early school days.</p>
              <p>Very quickly boredom drove me to find my way to the 2nd floor reached by a spiraled ramp where hordes of visitors were queuing up. I joined in without a clue to what I was lining up for at the upper level. Statistics of Singapore adorning the wall on one side of the steep ramp and corporate advertising boards hanging above kept all in the queue accompanied. One interesting set of statistics that caught my attention showed our population density to have doubled in under 40 years to over 7,000 per square km in 2009. Is this 7,000 figure – that ranks Singapore as the world’s third most densely populated country – meant to be an achievement the country is proud of to showcase to the world? I thought otherwise.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/DSC_01133.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-27777" title="DSC_0113(3)" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/DSC_01133-300x199.png" alt="DSC_0113(3)" width="300" height="199"></a>Finally the 20-minute wait was over and I found myself stepping into a dimly lighted movie hall where I had to maneuver my way around many small arm chairs and stools strewn across the floor. I found myself one such mini arm chair right at the back of the theater that turned out to be a mini Osim massage chair to my delight. However, just when I was fidgeting around looking for the switch to turn it on to sooth my aching legs and body, the audience were told not to operate them, without any reason given!</p>
              <p>The movie soon came on and it was a music video clip featuring our 4 famous homegrown singers belting out the pavilion theme song against a backdrop of Singapore. The screen was so low due to the restricted ceiling height of the hall that those at the rear had their views largely blocked by those in front.</p>
              <p>When the MV ended, we were ushered out via the rooftop garden landscaped with what else Singapore Orchids and palm tress, that was even less impressive than that of the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple in Chinatown in both size and landscaping, not to mention other mega rooftop gardens featured in other pavilions at the Expo.</p>
              <p>Oh by the way, the Durian boy mascot was nowhere in sight except in the form of small soft toys sold at the counter. It looked indeed really ugly!</p>
              <p>The overall experience in the Singapore pavilion was a big letdown though not a surprise, and certainly did not deserve the 2 hours of wait. Fortunately for me, I managed to negotiate with a local security officer manning a side entrance to let me in without the need to queue, by flashing my Singapore IC to identify my nationality otherwise I would not have bothered with even a 5-minute wait having heard previous negative feedback and not having any sense of national pride in our pavilion.</p>

              <p>If South Korea - ji zhou, Japan - 4 Pefectures , Taiwan - peng hu, Malaysia - JB and Tahiland - Bangkok all decided and confirmed to build(more) casinos to earn <strong>tourists monies</strong>, what would happened to our 2 casions?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>We needed high tech to solve future food shortage. In case, another bird flu outbreak, blah, blah, blah occurred.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif">  Due to climate change, other countries also might/would cut their export of foods to us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif">  Example</p>

              <p>Other rice export countries would just raise up  rice prices.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif"></p>

              <p>Hi Santa,</p>
              <p>Thanks for your approval!</p>
              <p>I guess it is beautiful that Singaporeans (and those interested in sharing their views) around the world can have a domain to share.  Yeah, sometimes there are disagreements, but if everyone can speak sensibly, we always learn something.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Pavillion at Expo 2010 is really crap, so much so that SM Goh would pass comments like "there is always room for improvement" and "public opinion is always welcome". <strong><em> <strong>I can share with you from an "insider" point of view that there was not enough budget</strong></em></strong> - and how can this happen????!!!!!  The STPB (the department in charge I suppose - please correct me if I am wrong) should have done more canvassing or get more direct funding.  This is an important platform to shwocase Singapore and this is the best we can do?</p>
              <p>We screwed up major I am afraid....</p>
