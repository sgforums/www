              <p>Just do what  Lion Oasis and I do in this forum, just ignore the "houseflies" because they're just misfits and not worth responding to in any shape or form! Until they learn and know how to respond to other people, then they'll be misfits for the rest of their lives! So, don't waste your time and getting yourself into a knot over ignorant remarks and name calling here! They're just a waste of space!</p>

              <p>...........immigration got tougher in oz..........as well as in other countries.it is due to the 9-11 thing.....the iraq war,,recessions............i tried lookin at usa immigration and its not easy....and the other countries have made immigration such a vague thing that it cant be easily understood anymore.might as well write it all in urdu and u go figure it out.</p>
              <p>those dat immigrated over like chelsea and ged dun seem generous at this time of da year wiv da good stuff.in fact they all sound very angry and start calling people as insects.....probably due to unhappy situation in oz..</p>
              <p>the dude from usa ......who couldnt get a single green card wants to be in oz........  ..he shoulda read more b4 relocating from spore to usa.......since then he has been comparing his fabled english standards with fellow sporeans.not only dat...he tries to compare his failed immigration result to others and will ensure he is the best of the best...no one else should be ahead of him.</p>
              <p>THIS ARE THE KIND OF CHINESE AND FELLOW SPOREANS WHO ARE WEAK OVERSEAS.trust me.....u would rather be in siberia then be with the likes of these sort of "kind" people who claim they are sporeans.</p>
              <p>LKY would be laffing again knowing dat the result of overseas sporeans have turned themselves on one another...like a pack of hungry animals.</p>
              <p>i wonder if i should throw my spore passport away if i were to meet with this kinda sporean.......</p>
              <p>as i have not been recentlyreading on various country immigration policies...u can start finding out on differet country from internet.just make sure ya folks are able to immigrate wiv ya....else ya end up psychotic like ged,chelsea or some soul rtag who loves peasants fer lunch n dinner.</p>

              <p>U.S.A.</p>
              <p>in usa,be prepared to wait fer ages fer green card due to 9-11 incident which changed and wrecked the immigration timing ....as if it wasnt bad before that already.</p>

              <p>Here we go again!  Are you suggesting I am lying?  And that I am trying to argue my way out again?</p>
              <p>Considering I started this thread, I shall take the courtesy to answer your question.   But hope you can just take my word for what my intention is, I really do not wanna have another spin with you about what I should have said or how I should have said it.</p>
              <p>It was <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REVERSE SUGGESTION.</span></strong>  Ok?  I indicated after 15k &amp; 18K views that there was no clear winner in terms of where Singaporeans, in general, could migrate to and suggested people to stick around &amp; make the best out of their situation. <strong> Clearly this ought to be sufficient to understand my TRUE message, please look at things in its entirety.</strong></p>
              <p>Again, there is no point for me to pretend to be this or that, nor do I have any need to be recognized here.  None - whatsoever!!  Cyberspace is just a pass time for the time being, and may not be in the near future.  I say what I mean and say it I do, period.  If you dun feel convinced, please dun talk to me, or ignor my posts.  Why border to reply or communicate if I have no credibility to you?  I find that really funny?  Unless of course, your motivation is to pick a fight with most people as you have indicated in your post to soul_rage, but I am not interested in any wrestlemania of words with you.</p>
              <p>Hope this is not last my last post to you.</p>

              <p>They neither respect themselves nor others.</p>

              <p>No, no and no.</p>
              <p>It's not "here we go again" - you can see my assurance to soul_rage that I would let the previous disagreement drop, and I'm keeping my word.  This query is an entirely different issue, applicable only to your post at 1:58 pm, so there's no need to bring up outdated and irrelevant issues.</p>
              <p>What I was asking was for you to point out which part of " If you are leaving Singapore,
                                      where will you go?" indicates that "there is no
                                      real alternatives for them".  That was a fairly straightforward request, wasn't it?  Which part of that do you not understand?  I'll be glad to clarify if necessary.</p>
              <p>Wherever in my previous post did I suggest that you were lying, or that you were trying to argue your way out again?  Please point that out too.  If you can't please have the courtesy to retract what appears to be a false accusation.</p>
              <p>Am I to understand that your "reverse suggestion" is in fact a rhetorical question?  I'll have to go back through the thread, but if memory serves me correctly you stated that you were presenting an open invitation for people to share their experiences, and that doesn't fit with this "reverse suggestion".  Could you please clarify your stance?  Unfortunately, reading through the thread and taking everything in its entirety only serves to unearth more contradictions than to answer questions.</p>

              <p>OK if it was an innocent question, fine.  I thought I was being very clear and if you wanna know where I stand, which I have repeated many times, you may wish to read the FIRST post of this thread.</p>
              <p>When asked the question "If you are leaving Singapore where would you go?", I presumed most people would either go blank or be prompted to think deeper, and I was anticipating most will not get a convincing answer.  I hoped the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">thinking excercise</span></strong></span> would create an awareness within my fellows, and hopefully, would make them appreciate Singapore more.</p>
              <p>Can you tell me in more no than 3 words, what is it you that you wanna know?  Again, my stance is SUPER clear since the first post, and thanks for taking such keen interest in my stance.  But I am really curious though, I have had very little problem making people understand me (including your mate soul_rage, and the ever articulate Atobe), and you seem to stand-out, to either "dun understand me" or find my statements "contradicting", it's as if we have learnt the language from different planets.  It is frustrating for me as I do not fancy back traking so often to explain myself, as I seek a free flow of minds.  Seems this wish is not working out with you.</p>
