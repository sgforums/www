              <p>lionasis,</p>
              <p>buying a country with your theory of good,honest and smart people?</p>
              <p>if they were averagely  smart do u think they would be dumb enough to let someone take control of their lifestyle until got not much money even to retire or struggle daily?</p>
              <p>honest and smart people can see theres no hope in lionasis island theory.</p>
              <p>hardworking and smart people think that lionasis must be insane and would immigrate instantly.</p>
              <p>good people would probably start to organise a civil war against lionasis and imprison him and his entire family for a generation....</p>
              <p>only left in lionasis island would be houseflies and boliao people.and no one would buy island even if u added in hotels and shopping centres.</p>
              <p>yes...its very simple.....just like pol pots cambodia.</p>
              <p>those left in the lionasis island:</p>
              <p>honest and smart people would end up inevitably as houseflies n boliao people due to work and time damage.very unfortunate.</p>
              <p>no country exists like lionasis island from beginin of time.</p>
              <p>lionasis.......perhaps u should take over singapore leadership and let the few good men talk to u in civilised ways.</p>

              <p>do u wanna see how yer theory future island people of good,honest,smart and hardwerking would be?</p>
              <p>go to nearby hawker center and ask the meepok  or duckrice seller about your plans.........would he chase u round n round the hawker center with a fat chopper knife?</p>
              <p>ok....now goto NUS and ask anyone there and tell them bout your future plans....would they simply scold u and call campus security after that?</p>
              <p>ok...now goto any police station and tell them about your plans......tell me what the policeman there face look like after that?</p>
              <p>ok...now go to woodbridge hospital and tell them your plans....i bet thats the only place that agree to your plans and would give u life membership...but must pay  for membership b4 u enter or else they chase u out.</p>

              <p>Well, when I first started this thread, I had a hunch this would be the case.  So - SINGAPORE -  is still a more viable choice, like it or not.  2-3k views ago, I already commented on the same observation.  So there are places that are clear run away winners, let it be known.</p>
              <p>Singapore will have problems, let's have no illusions about this, but if one looks for a PERFECT place to live and grow old in, that day may not come at all.  Best, make good use of where you are now...unless it is really that bad.</p>
              <p>I would like to thank all viewers and forumers, wow, did not expect to see this thread run for so long.  Your participations are very much appreciated.</p>

              <p><br>The logic is people will say it here in this thread, whether they really know it...well.  Anyway, as per my opinion when this thread hit 15000 views, the numbers dun lie!!  And what is said about other countries being better - well, inconclusive to say the least.</p>
              <p>Fellow Singaporeans, dun look elsewhere for a better living, Singapore is one of the best places on earth for you, native who are born and raised here.  Trust me!!!</p>
