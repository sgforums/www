              <p>ot sure if we understand each other, what I am saying is that
              Australia has been open to immigrants, and for years these
              immigrants have been getting jobs in australia, while I believe the
              immigrants have worked hard and earned their position, I have not
              heard the local australians complaining about these immigrants
              taking over their jobs, or that the immigrants were given special
              priviledges by the government!</p>
              <p>Singapore is now open to more immigrants, but the locals are
              complaining that the immigrants are taking over their jobs, and
              that the government is giving them special priviledges.</p>
              <p>So, IF, the australian complains, then they would be
              behaving like some singaporean here. IF they don't, then there
              is lesson on magnanimity some of us can learn here.</p>
              <p>It is different to say that we can't communicate with a somali
              in Australia, and making all somali to speak english
              before they are allowed in australia. If the guy
              can't speak english you just go find another one who does,
              here we are saying to them "you bloody well speak english if
              you want to be in Singapore."  </p>
              <p>hmmm...lionnoisy may not like what I say, but if this
              is the situation in Australia, then this is something we need
              to learn, no? </p>

              <p><br> Just to add in more info, immigration policies in Australia are
              tightening. Where, you could apply for a work visa independently,
              now you can only apply given the following conditions:</p>
              <p>(1) When there is an Australia company that has hired you and
              will sponsor your visa</p>
              <p>(2) When there is a state in Australia who will sponsor your
              visa</p>
              <p>Getting (1) or (2) is very difficult since the company or state
              MUST justify why they need foreigners. Therefore, its becoming
              harder to immigrate to Australia.</p>
              <p>Singapore is very much different. We are opening the tidegates
              and let the foreigners flood the market until even the locals
              die.</p>
              <p>It doesn't hurt me, coz the so-called foreign-talents in
              Singapore cannot do my job. But this flooding has affected many of
              our fellow Singaporans whose jobs can be worked on by the
              foreigners, who are willing to accept lower pay and longer working
              hours.</p>
              <p>As I mentioned, sgdiehard knows nothing, and yet wants to
              comment on Singaporeans, then Americans, Canadians,
              Australians.</p>
              <p>PS: Stevenson101, thanks for the insight on the gaming industry.
              It's pretty interesting to know what is going on over there. Are
              there any govt grants given to companies to train locals, or the
              companies are just continously hiring foreigners?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Just to expand, soul_rage, the employer-sponsored worker scheme is only one of the types of visas available, and it's really not the best way to go because it puts you in a Catch-22 situation where employers aren't going to hire you unless you have work rights, and you can't get work rights unless someone hires you.</p>
              <p>There's also skilled migration, where residency is granted based upon what applicants bring to the table in terms of skills.  It works on a points-based system, with more points being attached to skills that address shortfalls in the Australian workforce.  The threshold to be crossed is revised regularly in order to cut off applicants at the immigration quota set for the year (which was 190,300 the last time I checked).  The advantage of this system is that it resolves the Catch-22 and also helps ensure that the right balance of skills is found in the Australian workforce.</p>

              <p>Just to expand, soul_rage, the employer-sponsored worker scheme
              is only one of the types of visas available, and it's really not
              the best way to go because it puts you in a Catch-22 situation
              where employers aren't going to hire you unless you have work
              rights, and you can't get work rights unless someone hires you.</p>
              <p>There's also skilled migration, where residency is granted based
              upon what applicants bring to the table in terms of skills. 
              It works on a points-based system, with more points being attached
              to skills that address shortfalls in the Australian
              workforce.  The threshold to be crossed is revised regularly
              in order to cut off applicants at the immigration quota set for the
              year (which was 190,300 the last time I checked).  The
              advantage of this system is that it resolves the Catch-22 and also
              helps ensure that the right balance of skills is found in the
              Australian workforce.</p>

              <p>Hi Gedanken</p>
              <p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
              <p>I remembered they only accept 3 kinds of people who wish to apply for a work visa now</p>
              <p>- Critical Skills programme (where there is a small list of professions that is glaringly in shortage in Australia)</p>
              <p>- Employer-sponsored programme (the one you said)</p>
              <p>- State-sponsored programme</p>
              <p>All 3 requires the applicant to pass the points test, regardless.(Correct me if I am wrong)</p>
              <p>That's what I remember, there is no special treatment for any category. Of coz, I only know about the skilled migration programme (which consists of the 3 above). There are other programmes, like the investment programme, etc., which I do not know coz I don't have that much $$$ to invest in Australia</p>

              <p>racial discrimination exists everywhere, in Australia, used to be against the lebanese, recently against the indians, that is arrogance plus difference in cultural and language, this can happen anywhere, nothing to do with immigration policies, in HK, the chinese against the indian, called ah char, many of them have been in HK for years, speak cantonese.</p>
              <p>The Brits immigrants in australia will have little or no difference in culture and language, so relative to the asians and eastern europeans, it is easy for the oz to handle the Brits, isn't it? one arrogant australian will not make a brits feel discriminated, but an asian who don't understand the same language would.</p>

              <p><br>Just to add in more info, immigration policies in Australia are tightening. Where, you could apply for a work visa independently, now you can only apply given the following conditions:</p>
              <p>(1) When there is an Australia company that has hired you and will sponsor your visa</p>
              <p>(2) When there is a state in Australia who will sponsor your visa</p>
              <p>Getting (1) or (2) is very difficult since the company or state MUST justify why they need foreigners. Therefore, its becoming harder to immigrate to Australia.</p>
              <p>Singapore is very much different. We are opening the tidegates and let the foreigners flood the market until even the locals die.</p>
              <p>It doesn't hurt me, coz the so-called foreign-talents in Singapore cannot do my job. But this flooding has affected many of our fellow Singaporans whose jobs can be worked on by the foreigners, who are willing to accept lower pay and longer working hours.</p>
              <p>As I mentioned, sgdiehard knows nothing, and yet wants to comment on Singaporeans, then Americans, Canadians, Australians.</p>
              <p>PS: Stevenson101, thanks for the insight on the gaming industry. It's pretty interesting to know what is going on over there. Are there any govt grants given to companies to train locals, or the companies are just continously hiring foreigners?</p>

              <p><br>Currently i know that the government pays half the salary of any local LucaArts employees, whether Ubisoft is receiving the same grants i have no idea.</p>
              <p>Right now for Ubisoft they are eagerly looking for locals to fill in the slots so they could raise their quotas of foreigners. But since Lucas was here first they have been having a hard time filling in those slots.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately what constitutes as local is questionable because apparently it includes both Singaporeans and PR, so it's not really rare to have a Singaporean based company to have only at best 10-20% Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>As i have mentioned before, this is a relatively new industry so it's very difficult to have Singaporeans who have relevant working experiences. But i will acknowledge that the government has done its part in encouraging people to pick up the relevant courses through SPUR and MDA sponsorships.</p>
              <p>The big companies didn't come here because Singaporeans are particularly creative or even hardworking but for our IP laws and liberal immigrant policies.  It's a good center strategically to recruit from the talents in Indonesia, China and Malaysia.</p>

              <p>The problem is the expats who are allowed in freely. they are the "FT" who are provided with housing here and their children go to international schools at company's expense. Are they really doing the jobs that Singaporean can't do?</p>
              <p>but the acceptance of immigrants and the government's immigration policies are quite separate issues.</p>
              <p>33% of population of Perth are from countries other than the UK, america or local australia. It does not appear that the people resent the arrival of foreigners from other parts of the world, notably India and China. In vancouver, the whole suburb looks like part of HK, in a mall called Aberdeen, a fun raising event was held to help the China earthquake victims, only cantonese and mandarin were spoken on stage. I was amazed, but my canadian colleagues really don't bother. It was interesting to find that the punjabi community was actually petitioning the government to let in more of their own people.</p>
              <p>I am not sure if the local australian, canadian would change their attitude if more immigrants were allowed.</p>
              <p>but the real question is, if you leave singapore and go to a new place, how would you like the locals to treat you? surely you don't want them to vent their dissatisfaction with their government on you.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, the same arrogant Australian may also discriminate against an Asian immigrant,

              <p>Have I missed anything?  If I haven't, that's an argument in favour of the common exhortation to "learn the f***ing language before you come here", wouldn't it?</p>
              <p>In any case,  it seems that the crux of your argument is that discrimination is in the eye of the beholder, and by extension, that the solution lies not in reducing discrimination, but in reducing the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perception</span> of discrimination.</p>

              <p><br>Currently i know that the government pays half the salary of any local LucaArts employees, whether Ubisoft is receiving the same grants i have no idea.</p>
              <p>Right now for Ubisoft they are eagerly looking for locals to fill in the slots so they could raise their quotas of foreigners. But since Lucas was here first they have been having a hard time filling in those slots.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately what constitutes as local is questionable because apparently it includes both Singaporeans and PR, so it's not really rare to have a Singaporean based company to have only at best 10-20% Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>As i have mentioned before, this is a relatively new industry so it's very difficult to have Singaporeans who have relevant working experiences. But i will acknowledge that the government has done its part in encouraging people to pick up the relevant courses through SPUR and MDA sponsorships.</p>
              <p>The big companies didn't come here because Singaporeans are particularly creative or even hardworking but for our IP laws and liberal immigrant policies.  It's a good center strategically to recruit from the talents in Indonesia, China and Malaysia.</p>

              <p>Thanks for sharing.</p>
              <p>Ok, so the govt is trying to do something for the locals, but their definition of locals encompasses PRs as well, which probably end up with more foreigners taking up the jobs as "locals" as well.</p>
              <p>Has the govt come up with a grant that will enable the company to consider sending you to their overseas HQ for a stint at the gaming lab so as to bring you up to speed? I think this would be very useful, rather than subsidising the salary only.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I know Linden Labs is setting up shop in Singapore, and my friend is hiring people. I hope this bodes well for Singaporeans in the long run through generation of jobs that will go to the locals.</p>

              <p>OK, let  me see if I got this right. </p>
              <p>An arrogant Australian may discriminate against a British immigrant, but the British immigrant won't feel discriminated against because he understands the same language. </p>
              <p>On the other hand, the same arrogant Australian may also discriminate against an Asian immigrant, and the Asian immigrant would feel discriminated against because he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doesn't</span> understand the same language. </p>
              <p>Have I missed anything?  If I haven't, that's an argument in favour of the common exhortation to "learn the f***ing language before you come here", wouldn't it?</p>
              <p>In any case,  it seems that the crux of your argument is that discrimination is in the eye of the beholder, and by extension, that the solution lies not in reducing discrimination, but in reducing the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perception</span> of discrimination.</p>
              <p>Of course, none of this adds up, so help me out here.</p>
