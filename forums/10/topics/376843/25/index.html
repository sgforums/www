              <p>Baby squids??!! Indeed you can get them at Springvale market!!
              But not in the supermarket itself, you'll have to go upstairs, two
              doors away from the Chinese restaurant. Unfortunately, they stock
              only frozen food. So, if you're looking for fresh ones, you won't
              find it there!</p>

              <p>I'm in Chelsea, all I need to do is just cross over the Nepean Highway and there's the sandy beach and open ocean to enjoy. Just 15 to 20 minutes walk from my residence to the beachfront!!</p>

              <p>i am aware that u are not a practical person..........perhaps that is why u are still in singapore.i was forged from the fiery hell of singapore's industrial might that packs as much punch as the heavy weights in the usa and japan.The industrial technology transfer from what usa &amp; japan into spore was complete unto me. my undying will was the start of it along with my adaptations to all enviroments possible. AND THAT IS WHY I AM ABLE TO DO AND GO PLACES .</p>
              <p>IT AINT IMMATURE......more like mission impossible for u. it aint impossible for me with my know-how..its how well u have learnt in lifes own experience.even if im in spore........i wont be in sgforum........most likely an upheavel due to not much results from pap.if i died n failed in process.....i will be back!</p>

              <p>as u read this i made a new method of producing mirror surface prototypes this week with no special tools.....and no method that anyone on the internet gives. i am amazed at its simplicity and such brilliant results.its japanese quality with no special tools!best of all its non-toxic and very safe to use.</p>
              <p>if i were in spore,i would be unable to do it as my time would be taken up by army remedial training on whatever spare time i have left after work.</p>
              <p>what could i do with it???i would say i could now setup many factories , design centres with my know-how and trade secrets with its customer potentials worldwide which is highly technical and  futuristic in its practical designs.</p>
              <p> the oddest thing to is that the materials can be found in singapore too!so how come couldnt i do it when i was in spore ????was i too occupied trying to find the right food on my off days or remedial army athelete trainings???maybe spore was never meant to go anywhere.</p>

              <p>I think you are not reading enough of my posts all these while.  For people who have read enough, they know where I come from.  But here's the thing, the ending sentence, which is part of the entire paragraph is to summarize a thought, and this thought is - Sinpaporeans are (on the whole) not culturally adaptable - nothing wrong there.  If you wish to give me a lesson in English, please take this elsewhere.  You are either having trouble understanding complex English or you are just not focussed on the subject matter and therefore, would take a sentence as a stand alone comment where it is actually part of a paragraph.</p>
              <p>So "which sentence am I to believe?" you asked, well it is not important to me what you believe.  If you really wanna know what I am saying, please invest more time and go through the posts to see where I stand.  To take part of a paragraph and make conclusions about me is rude and kinda stupid - this is what I believe.</p>

              <p>You do have an Australian Embassy in Singapore don't you? The first step is go there and find out from them what you need to know. Their rules and regulations changes every year. It's a rather involve process and no one should be taking "information" from forums anywhere of such importance! It involves your life ahead of you in a different country, so do the right thing and do it properly!! Best of luck endeavour!</p>

              <p>First and foremost, greetings from Downunder! As to your query about roti pratas and roast ducks, you need to realise that Australia is VERY multicultural now compared to the earlier years!! Asian migrants have brought with them famous recipes of Asian foods, ALL, I repeat, ALL Asian foods are available here in Australia, especially in Melbourne!! Hawker stalls and take aways in most shopping centres!!</p>
              <p>Australia is also much closer to Singapore than the US of A, hence also one of the reasons why I picked this country to be my home!</p>
              <p>As for those who come to this forum and make foolish remarks, just ignore them! They're uncultured, no family education and just can't tell the difference between yea or nay! That will be the day when they have the knowledge to debate wisely and can say something nice to anyone who don't agree with them! Typical social misfits!!!</p>
              <p>Anyway, have a good day and ciao!!</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Well yea, I do agree Melbourne is now very much more cosmo than it was many years back, I was just there in 2008, and the Chinese food over there was pretty good. And yes, I was considering Melbourne as it is closer to Singapore.</p>
              <p>However, opportunities beckoned, and here I am in USA, experiencing a totally different way of life.</p>
              <p>A certain die-hard fan of the Singapore govt insisted that there are so many places to fly from Singapore and argued that life is just as good as other places. And he made rude remarks about Australia.</p>
              <p>I, on the other hand, feel that it's so much more affordable to go anywhere in a big country. I go up north, there's Niagara Falls, Toronto, Vancouver, Seattle, Alaskan Cruise, down south to Florida and LA, Carribean, Bahamas, etc. And it's so much more affordable and convenient to travel, than to just keep taking a plane out of Singapore.</p>
              <p>I am getting too bored with Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia for that matter, and will prefer a more convenient and more affordable location to see the world.</p>

              <p>i am aware that u are not a practical person..........perhaps that is why u are still in singapore.i was forged from the fiery hell of singapore's industrial might that packs as much punch as the heavy weights in the usa and japan.The industrial technology transfer from what usa &amp; japan into spore was complete unto me. my undying will was the start of it along with my adaptations to all enviroments possible. AND THAT IS WHY I AM ABLE TO DO AND GO PLACES .</p>
              <p>IT AINT IMMATURE......more like mission impossible for u. it aint impossible for me with my know-how..its how well u have learnt in lifes own experience.even if im in spore........i wont be in sgforum........most likely an upheavel due to not much results from pap.if i died n failed in process.....i will be back!</p>

              <p>As I can see, you do not read postings properly. As I mentioned, I am not in Singapore, and am enjoying another lifestyle somewhere else.</p>
              <p>If you are a great inventer, I commend you for it. But i don't appreciate one-liner postings that were originally what you did. If you wish to live in Antartica, of course you may, but the discussion here is more about why you wish to leave Sg, and WHY you decided in whichever location you are in.</p>
              <p>For me, I left Sg becoz of (1) the govt, (2) cost of living, (3) boredom, (4) retirement, and am here coz of (1) work opportunities, (2) superb work life balance, (3) living a life of more freedom, (4) retirement</p>
              <p>Your previous one-liner posts do not give sufficient respect to forum members in this who are discussing the subject more seriously. You were also not respecting yourself, if you had given the thought of living in Antartica seriously.</p>

              <p><br>I have done it already.</p>
              <p>It's a very intense process with lots of paperwork and evidence through documentation. It kinda weeds out those who have the steel to go thru the intense process, and those who are not determined enough.</p>
              <p>If you are interested, pls go to <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/immigration/">http://www.immi.gov.au/immigration/</a></p>
              <p>There are many different channels to apply for a PR in Australia. You just have to decide which one is the right one for you.</p>
              <p>Also, bear in mind that Australia is shutting its doors tighter to immigrants (protecting their own people, unlike Singapore), so if you are interested, my suggestion is to start reading asap, because it takes months to even get your application submitted, and months to years for the processing to complete.</p>

              <li>I have always made it clear Singapore is my choice and may not be everybody's choice;</li>

              <li>I remain that Singapore is the best place for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span></strong> Singaporeans because I don't see them settling down successfully in other countries - not because of competency or attitude towards work - but because we are culturally unadpatable;</li>
              <li>Most importantly, I wish all Singaporeans will <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">make the best out of their situation</span></strong>, instead of complaining endlessly like loosers do (obviously if you don't have the nack of complaining, this message is not for you).  We complaint too much, and this is the impression we give to other countries. </li>

              <p>I do visit Singapore 5-6 times a year, and I still have my apartment, relatives and friends there.  I am also a member (and founding member) of a large Singaporean soccer team in Shanghai.  So I am in touch with issues back home.  But the time spent away from home has given me other perspectives, that sometimes, it takes time to find the right audience.</p>
              <p>In this forum, I have enjoyed exchanges with Atobe &amp; soul_rage, and a few others, but I cannot remember their avatars or names since they have not written in for some time.  Sorry guys/ gals.</p>

              <p>Hello Lionoasis, I think your statement here is a bit unclear.</p>
              <li>"I remain that Singapore is the best place for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span></strong> Singaporeans because I don't see them settling down successfully in other countries - not because of competency or attitude towards work - but because we are culturally unadpatable; "</li>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What do your "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span></strong> Singaporean" refers? to those Singaporean who cannot "settle down successfully in other countries", they therefore find Singapore the best place? then the "<strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></span></strong>" Singaporean only refers to those who have ventured to live overseas.</p>
              <p>If the "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></strong> " Singaporeans refer to the Singaporean citizens, resident locally or temporarily outside, then those who have found their new home in other countries, and have given up Singaporean citizenship are not part of this.  and you need no statistic (just a little brain) to tell you  that "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span></strong> " Singaporean are comfortably living in Singapore, whether this is the best place or not.</p>
              <p> I don't think it is right to say that we don't migrate, or those who choose to return are "cultural unadaptable". The conditions for cultural adaptability differs from country to country, the need for cultural assimilation also varies.</p>

              <p>Are you now presuming to tell me what real life is?</p>
              <p>In REAL life, CEOs and other executives base multimillion-dollar decisions and form government policies based upon information that I provide to them.  If I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't</span> apply this degree of precision to my message, then I won't be invited again.  But that's just my professional environment.  I'd like to hear how you can justify being so sloppy about communication as to corrupt the message under any circumstances.</p>
              <p>I have a real problem with you playing fast and loose with what you say, and then talking out the other side of your mouth and asking other people for well-thought-out posts without returning the courtesy.  That's just plain rude, and a sure sign that you're playing to your own agenda rather than objectively asking for people's input as you've claimed to do.</p>
              <p>You state that your aim is to get other people to share their experiences of living overseas, but then you proceed to tell everyone about how <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your </span>experiences lead to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> conclusion that there's no better place to stay than Singapore, with little if any regard to what other people have written if it doesn't fit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> agenda.</p>
              <p>Sorry to spoil your little party here, but that's just rubbish and a clear case of intellectual dishonesty.  Don't go asking for well-thought-out posts - ask for only posts that fit your world view.  At least that way you'll be honest.</p>
