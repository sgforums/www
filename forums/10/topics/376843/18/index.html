              <p>But then, don't forget that they have reverted the teaching of Science and Mathematics back to their mother tongue (Malay). The reason given was that English was too hard and since English was only used as a means, they decide that its easier to teach using Malay.</p>
              <p>However, you and I both know that technical terms are very different in different languages. Thus, I view this as a huge step backwards in terms of education in Malaysia, one that would have long-term consequences.</p>

              <p><br>Knowledge is still pretty useless if you can't vocalize it, you would sound like an idiot to your peers if you can't communicate your basic intent to them.</p>
              <p>A scientific or mathematical genius could come out of Malaysia, but be handicapped by his inability to write a thesis that could be understood by the world community,  so would any advanced theories or experiments.</p>
              <p>Knowledge in my opinion, is useless without the grasp of a common language that the global scientific community is using.  You would have problems reading their publications, and they would have the same with yours.</p>

              <p>I learnt a little german partly out of interest, it seems to me that English is popular not because it is the offical language of the British Empire but because it is a far more simple language to learn.</p>

              <p>Hi soul_rage and Stevenson101,</p>
              <p>There are no perfect solutions, and running a country is never easy.  There is always a balancing act and in this case, lifting domestic capabilities via education vs internaionalization.  Both are important to any country.  Malaysia, being so far behind, needs to take baby steps to play catch-up.  We begin with more emphasis on domestic needs, then more emphasis with the integration, both <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">phases</span></strong> are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>I totally agree with grasping a language for better access of the world.  What I meant was, Malaysia was behind on both fronts - language proficiency and general education (I am making somewhat an assumption here) - and what I found valid in the "knowledge over language" approach is in its practical approach to making native malays (mostly for them) more educated and skilled.  It is a practical dometic solution.</p>
              <p>Tapping the international market is another matter, and I don't see the need to have them master everything <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TODAY</span></strong> if they "cannot even add or subtract" (just figuratively speaking).  Again, baby steps....</p>
              <p>For example, as China was sited, great majority of the country is still inefficient in English (in fact almost zero understanding), and why is the country making waves in the world arena - without English domestically?  As long as the "interface" is armed with English (or other international languages)  - that requires only a few people with those ability - they <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span></strong> already do business with other countries.</p>
              <p>Next, will be domesticating foreign languages, achieving an improved integration of domestic and international markets - where more advanced cities like Shanghai, Beijing are getting themselves into.</p>
              <p>No offence to the Malasians in this forum, I am just reading what Najib is doing and have made assumptions to support my argument.  Nonetheless, please correct me if I am wrong about Malaysia, I only lived there for three months.</p>

              <p>Think they do know at the top level (whether they care it is a different story).</p>
              <p>China and Malaysia are two different countries, with different culture, history, resources, domestic markets, strategies for economic well being.</p>
              <p>For China, they actually started way behind Malaysia.  You may wanna know that even <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">China also took baby steps</span></strong>, but at a much <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">rapid pace</span></strong>.  It is now executing the 11th "5-year plan", but the first 9 "5-year plans" where foundation building for the big "lift off" - that we all see today.  Of course, due to its shear numbers, many people are so overwhelmed that they don't see China still has many problems unresolved, and sometimes seen as taking "two steps back".  To me, it is just normal in any nation building or development.</p>

              <p><br>I learnt a little german partly out of interest, it seems to me that English is popular not because it is the offical language of the British Empire but because it is a far more simple language to learn.</p>
              <p>It seems like language have a great role to play in creating what we understand as racial quirks (Why Germans always seemed to make such fine engineers, for example)</p>

              <p><br>Yes, thank you. Couldn't express it any better. All I want to say is, rather than face the crux of the problem, they instead applied a patch (workaround). This patch is very short-term, in my opinion, coz like what you said, there are going to be very negative consequences in the long-run for Malaysia.</p>
              <p>English is here to stay, because as you mentioned in your post, its SIMPLE. It's not elegant like Chinese, its not complicated like German (which I heard is one of the more difficult languages, that correct?), therefore it is here to stay for the rest of our lifetime (and more really)</p>
              <p>Malaysia will be facing the consequences of its actions within the next 2 decades, when the batches of students graduate into the workforce. That's when you will see the huge reprecussions, and then, what are they going to do? Bring back English because they now see that their graduates are not globally competitive?</p>
              <p>Seriously, I thought our Singapore govt was quietly laughing when Malaysia announced this move.</p>
              <p>When I was working in Europe, and now in the USA, I have been commended on my excellent grasp of the English language. It's THE fundamental to a global career. Even though I always feel that my English is "can-do" only, the Westerners are pretty impressed with us Singaporeans. We are one of the few Asian countries that have a strong grasp of the English language, relative to other Asian countries.</p>
              <p>In this sense, I must concede and credit our govt for choosing English as the 1st language when our country was still young. It was a single decision that positively affect generations of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Who cares what great ideas you have if you cannot articulate it well or write it down for others to understand?</p>

              <p>China and Malaysia are two different countries, with different culture, history, resources, domestic markets, strategies for economic well being.</p>
              <p>For China, they actually started way behind Malaysia.  You may wanna know that even <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">China also took baby steps</span></strong>, but at a much <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">rapid pace</span></strong>.  It is now executing the 11th "5-year plan", but the first 9 "5-year plans" where foundation building for the big "lift off" - that we all see today.  Of course, due to its shear numbers, many people are so overwhelmed that they don't see China still has many problems unresolved, and sometimes seen as taking "two steps back".  To me, it is just normal in any nation building or development.</p>

              <p><br>I see your point.  I also think an "ideal" world is different for all of us, and the film series showed millions of people having their own dreams - "ideal world" where in actial fact they were just lying there, while the matrix is sucking thier essense out of their body.  Applying what you trying to tell me, I think we are all caught up in different realities, and which are sometimes called "paper chase", "rate race", "social equality", "government duty"...</p>

              <p><br>I see your point.  I also think an "ideal" world is different for all of us, and the film series showed millions of people having their own dreams - "ideal world" where in actial fact they were just lying there, while the matrix is sucking thier essense out of their body.  Applying what you trying to tell me, I think we are all caught up in different realities, and which are sometimes called "paper chase", "rate race", "social equality", "government duty"...</p>
              <p>Thoughts?</p>

              <p><br>Yes somewhat there. The Matrix has some form of Zen/Buddhism influences to it.</p>
              <p>If you bring it further, it's almost what Buddhism is trying to convey, that everything is but just a passing cloud and an illusion, that when you look past all of it, it's all empty pursuits anyway.</p>
              <p>So what if we work hard and become rich? All will die one day, and the more materials you have, the more difficult it is (or more fearful one becomes) when the day of reckoning draws near.</p>
              <p>However, while acknowledging his point, I stand in my belief that we still have to continue with our dreams, because we have only one lifetime, and we must make full use of it to experience life. Buddhism, to the extreme, can be seen as ultra-passive (sitting there and wasting one's life away), but of course, it's how one interpretes the religion.</p>
              <p>Anyway, we going quite far from our discussion :D</p>

              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p>Malaysia's PM Najib has just lifted the long standing and
              dreaded "BUMI BUTRA" regualtions...hurray!</p>
              <p>This, if carried out sucessfully, should impose some pressure to
              Singapore and neighbouring cities, including Hong Kong, as places
              for Chinese (not limited to China) companies to set up their
              business.  Malaysia finally wakes up a bit.</p>
              <p>Will this change the dynamics favoring Singapore? </p>
