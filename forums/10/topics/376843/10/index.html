              <p>Yes I know you acknowledge that, but I would like to highlight that your last few posts aren't really too objective. Perhaps its coz of your frustration at getting your point thru to some other forumers here. So yes, it's fine if our writings go under-par once in a while.</p>
              <p>And yes, as a responsible Singaporean, I critique while acknowledging the imperfections of any country. Those pro-govt supporters who have challenged me before to come out with good ideas to solve the issues I raised, I have raised good ideas before to shut them up.</p>
              <p>Coming back to your point on FT, I am NOT implying that we should discriminate against FT, but EVEN if we do, it's a normal practice for many other countries. Organizations must justify the need of a FT (like WHY locals cannot do the job) before they can hire a FT. I think that's reasonable.</p>
              <p>What I am emphasizing about, is that in Singapore, from what I understand from some Headhunters, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a FT is given preference AHEAD of locals. Now, THAT'S 2nd CLASS.</span></span></p>
              <p>I give you an example, of a certain ministry that hired a vendor to outsource their IT projects. Their vendor hired 100% Indians to perform the project. They simply tell the ministry that Singaporeans CANNOT do the job (which is totally untrue), and the ministry just accept that excuse. In the end, 100% of the positions were given to Indians. My friend, who was then the project manager working for the vendor, was forced to leave once they were able to import Indians, because she is a Singaporean (they were prejudiced against her).</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I am not AGAINST the FT policy (In fact I support it). I am AGAINST the implementation. And the govt is to be blamed for it 110%.</span></p>
              <p>Either way, life isn't easy, I agree with you. I would like to highlight that even though I put the blame squarely on the PAP for many issues that we face (rising costs, suppressed salaries, age discrimination, 2nd class citizens, discrimination against locals in the job market, etc), I made my own decision to walk out of that mess in protest of how they have made the environment so stifling.</p>
              <p>The only things I miss are my parents, my friends. I don't miss Singapore much, coz there's really nothing much to miss.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, we are in danger of implosion, due to overrewarding. Just look at Wall Street. Overrewarding, and underpunishment caused the credit crisis. Our Govt is in danger of that as well. A certain DPM Wong can be allowed to stay in his position, even when Mas Selamat escaped under his watch. (Probably now he is claiming credit for capturing Mas Selamat back). That's underpunishment for you. If it's me being the PM, I will ask him to step down. It's the same DPM Wong that proposed jailing Singaporeans if illegal immigrants are found in their rented apartments.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if the opposition party is reading this, please target his GRC in the next election. I hope he lose his job.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Thanks for noticing my frustration.  It is very trying to conduct a discussion and "forced" to side-track (by virtue of starting this thread) 80% of the time entertaining people at different frequency or motivation...</p>
              <p>Regarding the headhunters, I have the following theory: the same HH is working for a client looking for FT (to balance the office demographics - for some reason, and indeed that particular talent had been lacking), I am sure not all HH are mandated to do the same.  The other theory is that the government had a policy to beef up FT in Singapore over a few years (look at the population of FT - heard it is 1/3rd of total occupant in Singapore, and just a few years - this is shocking to me).  Whatever it is, I hope what you said is wrong.</p>
              <p>PAP?  I have another thread titled "How do you rate our government from 1-10?"  You will know where I stand in that thread.</p>

              <p>I was not there with your HH but I will take what you say as a true reflection of the situation.  I will investigate further and try to understand from my HH friends.  Thanks for sharing.</p>
              <p>But, in reality, how is one gonna determine what is truly fair and two individuals are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">euqally</span></strong> good?  Be practical.  Granted, I totally agree that some care should be paid to Singaporeans who badly need jobs to keep food on the table.  Is there anything to help from our government?  Some countries have imposed Minimum Wage for all work force to create a more level ground.</p>

              <p><br>When I suggested to see beyond materia things, it is NOT the exclusion of material things.  Are you intelligent enough to understand this?</p>
              <p>Encouraging awareness of where our country stands, does not equate to FORCING onto people my ideas.  I keep telling people their decision is theirs and would be respected - which part of this is forcing people?  What do you not understand?</p>
              <p>Does Practicality imply whinning in forums about life or fight the battle whether or not the government helps you out?  Do you know what I have been advocating?</p>
              <p>You are rude....and a bloody premadona running wild.  Please take your nonsense elsewhere!!  It is people like you that make me feel frustrated and insulted.   But I know people like you will just be lingering in forums trying to waste time and get attention, taking people on as a way of releasing your unhappiness in life, right?  I know YOU WILL come back with more nonsense because hey, you don't see me I don't see you and I can't do anything to stop you right?</p>

              <p>But, in reality, how is one gonna determine what is truly fair

              Be practical.  Granted, I totally agree that some care should
              be paid to Singaporeans who badly need jobs to keep food on the
              table.  Is there anything to help from our government?

              <p>Yes, be practical. Preference should always be Locals first, foreigners second. Basically, what I mean is, always investigate local options first, before looking outwards. It's that simple. That's what OTHER countries do, including USA. Today I am here in USA because I know I am very capable and outscore the rest of the competition, not because I am a foreigner.</p>
              <p>IF the govt doesn't encourage a change in mindset, then what is the point of generating jobs in Singapore, only for majority of jobs to go to foreigners?</p>
              <p>Bear in mind I am speaking with a foreign wife in mind.</p>
              <p>In short, the Govt is often hiding behind the excuse it cannot be practical to measure what is equally good. It's just like it doesn't want to implement staggered GST (where basic necessities like rice are not taxed) using the excuse that it is difficult to implement (Other countries implement staggered GST, and we cannot?)</p>
              <p>It's more, they DON'T want to do it, then they cannot do it.</p>

              <p>There are many cities out there with no natural disasters as
              well.</p>
              <p>Also, there is this interesting issue with the earthquake in
              Indonesia. The epicenter seems to be moving closer to Singapore
              every year. From 2002, 800km away, to the recent one, 570km
              away.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it's each person's choice. My choice for not being in
              Singapore are as follows:</p>
              <p>Negative Points of Singapore</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Too high a price to pay for perceived security and safety. For
              just one advantage, have to give up my freedom and being suppressed
              by the PAP</li>
              <li>Suppressed wages in Singapore. I know I can earn much more, and
              even though I was amongst the top 10% of salaries in Singapore, it
              is still suppressed</li>
              <li>Unequal opportunities. Opportunities (regardless of
              performance) given to so-called elites like scholars and people
              related to certain people. I was also a scholar but I gave it all
              up because I did not believe in favortism. I prefer to be judged by
              my talents, not by my background.</li>
              <li>Citizens being treated like 2nd-class. There is no difference
              then being in Singapore and being 2nd-class somewhere else.</li>
              <li>Age discrimination. Once you hit 40, you are told that you are
              now stupid and hence have to lower your salary expectations. This
              doesn't apply to certain groups of people (ie the PAP), who have an
              iron rice bowl year in, year out.</li>
              <li>Lousy choices of shopping, groceries and entertainment.
              Everywhere, its Giordano, G2000, etc. Going to one shopping mall
              means you covered almost 70-80% of what shops there are in other
              malls. Groceries are severely limited, and entertainment is largely
              limited as well. The only thing good about Singapore is hawker
              food, which is also becoming bad, given the kind of price increases
              we see in a short span of time.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Positive Points of being elsewhere</p>
              <ul>
              <li>I enjoy working and living in an international environment.
              Where we get to interact with people from diverse nationalities and
              culture. Singapore is too small to provide such an experience.
              Though the govt tries to import foreign talent, the foreign talent
              quality is a huge question mark.</li>
              <li>I enjoy living in a country where it is huge and there are so
              many places to go and explore. In Singapore, go east go Changi, go
              west to Tuas, go North go Woodlands, any further goes into
              Malaysia. There isn't much space to have fun</li>
              <li>I enjoy living in a city where there are endless options of
              shopping, huge variety of groceries with endless amounts of
              flavours. There is just so much to sample, so much to do.</li>
              <li>I enjoy living in a city where the cost of living is not
              artifically high like in Singapore. I get branded stuff at a
              fraction of a price to what we pay in Singapore. Groceries are also
              cheaper.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>And then, there is one last thing, the question of where
              Singapore will be in 30 years time. If I have a kid, I most
              definitely would not want him to be tied down in Singapore, because
              things may be vastly different in 2 to 3 decades. I do not have
              faith in Singapore continuing to be ahead of others in the near
              future, because our leaders are now stagnating, continously singing
              praises of what they DID, and not focusing on what they SHOULD BE
              doing for the future.</p>

              <p>Not true. Paycheque is but only one portion of the picture.</p>
              <p>There are other aspects to satisfaction to life. Unfortunately, with the way our govt is going, (rewarding themselves with high paychecks, minimum job security for Singaporeans, continuously leeching $$$ from citizens through ingenious ideas such as the ERP,etc), Singaporeans will also become more and more materialistic, as that's what we are being taught (by the way they pay themselves), and that's how we can survive (since things just keep going up, and job isn't secure, therefore you cannot blame our fellow Singaporeans for only looking at $$$ and nothing else)</p>
              <p>As I mentioned before in another thread, if the cost of living was kept to a more acceptable level, then with whatever wages we have now, we would have a better standard of living. And if the govt bothered to increase protection to workers, then Singaporeans would have a better satisfaction to life, and not having to worry about their jobs all the time.</p>
              <p>I am here because I can both have the cake and eat it. The job has a better pay, the cost of living is lower, and there is job security.</p>
              <p>And no, you missed my point, a big chunk of my issue is NOT the lack of things to spend on (that's only one issue), nor about how things that can be spent on in Singapore are artificially priced so high.</p>
              <p>The issue is about if Singapore is being run more as a country, then I would comprehend what is a sense of belonging to the country.</p>

              <p>may be 'paratrooper' is too specific for the intent, the people I heard about checking own parachute before every jump is a French sky diving enthusiast, jump for fun, told me they learned how to fold, pack and check parachute in the first few lessons. No, I am not a paratrooper, I SAF contractor,combat engineer.  but I'd say I'd check and pack my own equipment, especially if my life depends on it.</p>
              <p>The whole discussion is not about who do what in sky diving, hitman used this to illustrate the need for back up plan for an alternative place to live, I used the same to illustrate my point. if parachutes is not appropriate, I hope my point is clear.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I was not there with your HH but I will take what you say as a
                  true reflection of the situation.  I will investigate further
                  and try to understand from my HH friends.  Thanks for
                  sharing.</p>
              <p>But, in reality, how is one gonna determine what is truly fair
                  and two individuals are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">euqally</span></strong> good? 
                  Be practical.  Granted, I totally agree that some care should
                  be paid to Singaporeans who badly need jobs to keep food on the
                  table.  Is there anything to help from our government? 
                  Some countries have imposed Minimum Wage for all work force to
                  create a more level ground.</p>

              <p>Well, unlike Gendaken, soul_rage and Araphoe i work in the lowly gaming industry that the government now is trying to hard to promote so let me share my experiences and potential problems i see with the skewed immigration policies our precious little government has created.</p>
              <p>For one, the locals to foreigners ratio is badly off balanced. Out of an employee base of around 70-75 only about 10 are locals. Only 2 deals with the technical side of it, while the rest are artists (which i am one).</p>
              <p>This means that it would be impossible for the local 3D animation and gaming industry to even gain strength here because our local talent base are strangled right from the get go.</p>
              <p>It has become too easy for foreign companies to get a foreigner that has the relevant experience they want and escape any responsibility for training any locals to fill in the slots.</p>
              <p>This isn't helped by the fact that the Ministry of Manpower considers PRs as a local for the local/foreigner ratio it demands for companies</p>
              <p>I do agree that there should be equal competition in Singapore and i have learnt a great deal from my foreign colleagues.</p>
              <p> But for new industries like 3D animation and gaming,  very little people are going to have relevant experiences on their resumes. And why should the foreign companies bother if it's just so easy for them to use professional headhunters and get someone from Indonesia/China/Philippines/Malaysia to do the job?</p>
              <p>It becomes a chicken and egg problem, since the locals have no experiences why hire them ? But if the locals are not hired and trained accordingly, their skills would never appeal to the foreign companies either, not when a replacement is so easily available. </p>
              <p>The Bureaucrats also think a gaming industry only needs artists to support it. But it's a very complex operation because you need a strong technical base in order to develop for the PS3, XBox360 and MMORPGs.All the SPURs sponsorship they give are only low level stuff, only enough to churn out low level staffs.</p>
              <p>Big corporations like LucaArts and Ubisoft come here to look for factory workers, they have very little interest in training mangerial materials, why bother when it is so easy to get them from their respective Western countries?</p>
              <p>How could a new local industry grow when a Monopoly is already there before it could even take root?</p>
              <p> I do not know what would be true fairness, but right now the balance is immensely skewed to point where locals are actually more troublesome to hire.</p>

              <p>Yes, be practical. Preference should always be Locals first, foreigners second. Basically, what I mean is, always investigate local options first, before looking outwards. It's that simple. That's what OTHER countries do, including USA. Today I am here in USA because I know I am very capable and outscore the rest of the competition, not because I am a foreigner.</p>
              <p>IF the govt doesn't encourage a change in mindset, then what is the point of generating jobs in Singapore, only for majority of jobs to go to foreigners?</p>
              <p>Bear in mind I am speaking with a foreign wife in mind.</p>
              <p>In short, the Govt is often hiding behind the excuse it cannot be practical to measure what is equally good. It's just like it doesn't want to implement staggered GST (where basic necessities like rice are not taxed) using the excuse that it is difficult to implement (Other countries implement staggered GST, and we cannot?)</p>
              <p>It's more, they DON'T want to do it, then they cannot do it.</p>

              <p>If you can believe me, our so called difference is not that big, we are just talking similar (not exactly the same) things from different angles.</p>
              <p>I like the fact that you have earned your right to stay employed in the US - EARN is a key word.  Despite the odds, you fight for your place, and similarly, even if discrimination is taking place in Singapore against its country men though sadly, I just hope some fellow citizens can do something about it.  I have worked in the US too, as a door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman some 20 years ago.  I earned my right to be an area rep, against local Americans.  What you and I have put up, is something I hope to see amongst Singaporeans.  You will realize, what I have come to realize, is again such fighting spirit is a rare commodity, and will ALWAYS remain a rare commodity.</p>
              <p>I mentioned many of my views about the government in my thread titled "TOP 5 QUESTIONS YOU WANNA ASK THE GOVERNMENT", if you care, please read it.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your comments to Miss-itman11111111, he was indeed out of order.  And from the 6-7 posts that followed from him, and just a few minutes in between them, I know my message hit him good.<br></p>
