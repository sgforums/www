              <p>Woah, why would anyone in their right mind want to buy a
                                      Chrylser???</p>
              <p>And similarly, I personally won't buy a car in SG for the reason
                                      you mention, dumping a good car after only 10 years. But the public
                                      transport system is pretty good in SG for old ppl, with buses,
                                      MRT, and taxis. Come over here to the US, and you see all the 80+
                                      year old drivers who are SO dangerous weaving here and there.
                                      You're not supposed to be drinving when you're so old...but they
                                      don't have a choice since the public transportation system sucks
                                      here.</p>
              <p>The standard of living in SG is WAY cheap compared to developed
                                      countries, especially if you take out te cost of cars. HDB flats
                                      are still cheap. Look at the food and groceries prices, way lower
                                      than other developed countries like Japan, US, Europe. And that's a
                                      fact. Surveys are always manipulated, but I've shopped in many
                                      developed countries before, and everyday necessities are so much
                                      more expensive than in SG.</p>

              <p><strong>please be aware that the SOL is also a measure of the buying power of the people. You would find that the items on shelves in sg is much cheaper than those in the US, or european countries, as sg workers are receiving a low wage.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>By comparing the wage vs buying power, sg ranks among the lowest in buying power, and hence, also reflecting the SOL. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Lower wages= cheaper goods</strong></p>
              <p><strong>higher wages= higher goods.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>the only way to measure it is in terms of the buying power. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well. you need'nt get a chrysler 300c. Im just using that car model to emphasise the point that you can purchase a luxury car under the price of 10k</p>
              <p>Well. you might also consider a ford which can be bought from dealers for 2k. that'll save you 8k. And im sure it'll be a more worthwhile choice to do so, rather than patronising the public transport in sg.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Ill just give a brief extract from the article:: </strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Low wages</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>Singapore has a GDP (PPP) per capita higher than Switzerland, but our wages are way below the Swiss.<br> The UBS study found that employees in Copenhagen, Zurich, Geneva and
              New York have the highest gross earnings. With its extremely high gross
              wages and comparatively low tax rates, Switzerland is a very
              employee-friendly country.<br> The net wages used have been deducted for taxes and social security.<br> Zurich and Geneva have wage indices (gross) of 119.8 and 107.5
              respectively. In contrast, Singapore has a wage index of only 31.3,
              comparable with Moscow (30.9), Tallinn (28.7) and Johannesburg (26.7).<br> In the Asia-Pacific region, it is exceeded by Tokyo (83.0), Sydney
              (74.1), Auckland (44.1), Hong Kong (42.3), Taipei (35.5) and Seoul
              (32.3)</p>
              <p><strong>Low domestic purchasing power</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>Where does an average income buy the most products and services? Wages
              alone do not determine the standard of living in a particular city or
              country.<br> A better way to measure prosperity is to divide the average annual
              salary by the total price of a selected basket of goods and services
              (as used in the UBS study). This tells us how much purchasing power
              local wages.<br> Again, Zurich (106.9), Sydney (95.9) and Luxembourg (95.4) topped the
              list – its citizens have the highest domestic purchasing power.<br> Singaporeans have a low purchasing power of only 39.9, comparable to Kuala Lumpur (39.5), Warsaw (34.0) and Bogota (33.7).<br> Other countries in the Asia-Pacific region which are ahead of us are
              Tokyo (82.2), Auckland (68.9), Taipei (58.9), Hong Kong (58.1) and
              Seoul (57.4).<br> In other words, though the cost of living is higher in Tokyo, the
              average Japanese has a domestic purchasing power more than twice that
              of an average Singaporean.<br> Though Malaysia is still a developing country and has a GDP (PPP) per
              capita of only $14,215, less than 3 times of ours, the ordinary
              Malaysian citizen has about the same domestic purchasing power as the
              Singaporean.</p>
              <p><strong>Low relative purchasing power of wages</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <div>This is calculated in the UBS study by using a specific, highly uniform
              product that is available everywhere in the same quality, and then
              calculate how long an employee has to work to afford it in each city.<br> For the purpose of this article, the iPod nano (with 8 GB of storage) is used.<br> An average wage earner is Zurich and New York can buy a nano from an
              Apple store after nine hours of work. A Singapore worker will have to
              work three times longer after 27.5 hours.<br> The figures for selected Asia-Pacific cities are as follows: Sydney
              (9.5hrs), Tokyo (12hrs), Auckland (16hrs), Hong Kong (19hrs), Seoul
              (22hrs) and Taipei (23.5hrs). Again we came in last among the 4 Asian
              Tigers.<br>  <br> <strong>Long working hours</strong></div>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <div>People work an average of 1,902 hours per year in the surveyed cities,
              but they work much longer in Asian and Middle Eastern cities, averaging
              2,119 and 2,063 per year respectively.<br> European cities had the lowest working hours per year. A global
              comparison showed the people in Lyon and Paris spend the least amount
              of time at work: 1,582 and 1,594 hours respectively.<br> Singaporeans spent on average 2,088 hours at work per year with 11 days of vacation.<br> This is less than Hong Kong (2,295) and Seoul (2,312), but more than
              Tokyo (1,997), Taipei (2,074), Sydney (1,747) and Auckland (1,884).<br> Singaporeans also took the least number of holidays after Hong Kongers (10 days/year).<br> <span style="color: #3366ff;"> <br><strong><strong>High cost of living</strong></strong></span></div>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong></strong></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong> Singapore was ranked the second most expensive place to live in after Tokyo, surpassing Hong Kong for the first time.<br> Let us compare the food prices in Singapore and other developed countries since food is a basic necessity.<br> In the UBS study, a basket of 39 food items is put together and
              weighted mainly according to Western European consumption habits. The
              average worldwide cost of the basket is USD385.<br> In Asia, Tokyo topped the list with an index of 124.7, followed by Hong
              Kong (96.5), Singapore (89.4), Seoul (89.0), Taipei (67.9) and Sydney
              (66.3</strong>)</span></p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Where did you get that info.?  And with the inflation and other provisions (like spread out withdrawals, taxes...), the impact will probably be minimized, speaking from experience.</p>
              <p>Look at the GST rebate, do we really benefit that much?  No, just tip money to get people to keep quiet for a while, and they will earn it back anyway.</p>

              <p>Thats all you can come up with?</p>
              <p>So much for 'language above us all' nonsensical presumptions. Cut the bullshit about use of language already. Facts are facts, no matter how one beautifies or embellishes it, or use another nick to praise it.</p>
              <p>It is the same to a roadsweeper or to a genome scientist, with only more patience to explain to some if one indeed truly believes in one's message and the real hope it can bring.</p>
              <p>No need to be ambigious or hide responsibilities for one's veiw, or change will never come. Only insufferable con artists do that.</p>

              <p>Thats all you can come up with?</p>
              <p>So much for 'language above us all' nonsensical presumptions. Cut the bullshit about use of language already. Facts are facts, no matter how one beautifies or embellishes it, or use another nick to praise it.</p>
              <p>It is the same to a roadsweeper or to a genome scientist, with only more patience to explain to some if one indeed truly believes in one's message and the real hope it can bring.</p>
              <p>No need to be ambigious or hide responsibilities for one's veiw, or change will never come. Only insufferable con artists do that.</p>
              <p>Speaking of fun, hey, you are providing the afternoon tea break fun here! How does it feel now, when the dish is returned, that which you always enjoy and take maschoistic pleasure in?</p>
              <p>Not that fun now eh, tubby, to be played around like merry go round?</p>

              <p><br>As had been expected of a X-rated kid - do we expect you to go beyond the "merry go round " ?</p>
              <p>Only a pathetic kid like you will think that you are leading in a "merry go round" when you are at the center of being played.</p>
              <p>Have you been returning the dish ?</p>
              <p>It looked pretty well cleaned, after the leftovers was intended for your consumption; and regrettably, the dish that you returned was poorly cleaned as some stains still remain as testimony to your shoddiness.</p>
              <p>Can you handle facts ?</p>
              <p>It seems that you have walked away more then a few times, when your presumptious positions have been consistently cut up and each parts addressed in detail with honest facts that overwhelmed you with the "Wall of Honest Text" that you simply cope and prefer to walk away with a hurried "cheerio" of a X-rated kid.</p>
              <p>Your hot air is becoming too familiar, and it has been fun pouring cold water to turn it into steam.</p>
              <p>Keep it boiling, we may make some good use from the steam that we get from you.</p>

              <p>You ARE an obedient child!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>Newer insults now, but still not good enough. It seems done in the same tone, mixed with repetitions. You will need to be more creative. There may be hope yet, but i dare not bank on it.</p>
              <p>But hey, I do think it would be a good idea to take a break now. You know why, cos you have nothing serious or constructive to add the thread. It's hogging it and detrimental to others.</p>
              <p>You dont care about others, as you tyrannically often do, but i do care.</p>
              <p>Till we meet again, cheerios! ( that is if you obediently listen to me once again, but if not, hmm...I may not await, for the sake of others, and will meet you in another time another thread!!!!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png">)</p>
              <p>So go ahead and justify yourself with another wall of text, 'language above all' that means only more bullshit! !</p>
