              <p>to gendakan,</p>
              <p>dont worry about me not conributing to oz.i have decided not to
              give and render them any help whatsoever anyway as most 
              aussies are sitting on their asses all the time while most of the
              jobs are being done by vietnamese,koreans,brazilians and other
              asians.im a p.r. here and also have my own company.i will move away
              from australia and singapore as i find them unworthy of my
              technology and skills they badly need in the future.</p>
              <p>what they need are more abusive gendakans like you yelling and
              screaming like you were badly abused.it tells alot from the way you
              write ,think and your ability to be human,from way you write,,,u
              seem like you are filled with anger and frustration kinda
              outlook.</p>
              <p> you may yell , scream and be very abusive like a mad
              man.....it only tells the state you are in.thats why ive decided oz
              might not be that good.ive still other plans besides oz.</p>

              <p>That's right, go crying to momma about how abusive I am, why don't you?  While you're at it, pretend that nobody's noticed your painfully obvious and embarrassing attempt to run away from the fact that you're an obnoxious twat who loves making up stories about your *ahem* delusional "plans". <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>to liquified,</p>
              <p>ANU is a good university however its also very expensive.people who studied there was Dr cheong or who used to head SIA.he was seen often on local television acting in short skits too.</p>
              <p>im not sure about australian schools.would go study in europe or germany  and in countries well known for specialty skills.oz skills structure is based 90% on apprenticeship method which is time consuming and not tuned to world rapid technology advances.</p>
              <p>oz is only good if you want to immigrate.,,,like gendakan.with all his education and masters degree from oz,he still uses words such as cunt and god knows what else.As you may observe their education churns out people that i wont wanna sit next to on a mrt train.you may also study a long distance education in spore from oz uni but its not recognised by oz immigration for immigration.if u wanna migrate ,u need to study in oz and not long distance in spore.that is oz immigration requirements.</p>
              <p>australian universities are not normally racists due to fact that u are giving them money for courses but if u werk in oz,....they are quite racist.i got this from accounts told to me by friends who studied in oz as well as my own experience in oz too.as long as you are collecting money they tend to be nasty.but its totally different when ya giving them money.</p>

              <p><br>I suggest that before you listen too much to a toad, best you find out more info from other sources.</p>
              <p>I have known many Australian friends, several asians. To date, I have not heard of complaints from them. The regular response to the question on racism is that "if you are nice to others, 90+% of the time, others will be nice to you". There will be occasional racists running around, but its not as if the street is filled with tons of them.</p>
              <p>If Australia is such a hotbed for racists, why then are so many asian students from china, singapore, malaysia going there to study?</p>

              <p>Ultimately it has to depend on the Singaporeans themselves. I have to say that the government has done well on this part but whether Singaporeans are willing to learn and make progress is up to them.</p>

              <p><br>Well agreed. We give credit when it is due. The govt in many ways is a capable govt. However, I concur with you that the immigration policy is very distasteful. We are REALLY a free trade zone, so much so that foreigners can easily walk in and walk out.</p>

              <p>to whom it concerns,</p>
              <p>you can hear it from a friend of a friend  with 2nd or 3rd hand info or to someone who has experienced it first hand in that country first hand.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>however you can experience it for yourself.i will not go round divulging my secrets and techniques as i find that there are quite a few singaporeans who are nasty to the bone which often is part of the factor why i dont want to return to singapore.they will use it to better themselves further at the expense of others even though they have unreliable and questionable data which isnt first hand.in the first place they arent even in australia themselves. </li>
              <li>so there u have it.</li>

              <p>to liquified,</p>
              <p>oz student enrolment from overseas have decreased over the years from newspapers.they are also cutting down staff and manpower and strikes are happening since last week at some universities.</p>
              <p>i know that on first hand accounts and not some unreliable info from people who claim to know this and that when they themselves arent even tuned in to oz news and policies.in the first place they arent even in australia first of all to even comment!</p>
              <p>i was thinkin of returning in a few years time to spore but after observing how some sporeans are so nasty....i would be better off living near hillbilly nazis in a foreign land.i wuld advance better on my own that way.</p>

              <p>csi miami..........dat was a joke.i expect it to be more or less in that area.....if you have a gun.if a gun goes off by accident from a neighbour in states allowing guns,,,it still would be a csi case.people would be seen marking your body area with chalk,dusting for fingerprints and taking samples from all over the house.</p>
              <p>what so narrow minded bout that?dont talk rubbish when you know nuts about it.how many years have you been in the usa??have you lived in all the cities or just ina cave in some dumb town no one has heard of??have you purchased a gun in the first place?how do you know your neighbour dont have a gun in his home??HOW DO U KNOW THERE WONT BE ANOTHER HIGH SCHOOL MASSACRE WITH A GUY HOLDING A FEW RIFLES AND SHOTGUNS AS FROM REAL TIME NEWS?</p>
              <p>you assume what you want your enviroment to be,,,,,,,,,at your Peril.I WANT RELIABLE FACTS NOT UNRELIABLE 2ND HAND DATA AND RESULTS THAT WILL PROVE INCONCLUSIVE.</p>
              <p>IF I HAD PEOPLE LIKE YOU IN MY COMPANY,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BANKCRUPTED AND MAKING LOSSES WITH YOUR DATA AND POOR DECISION MAKING FACTORS.THAT WOULD VERY MUCH EXPLAIN THE POOR SPORE GOV POLICIES EXPERIENCED IN SPORE RIGHT NOW!DAMN I DONT NEED TO DEAL WITH THE GOV ALONE...I NEED TO DEAL WITH THE CLOWNS OUTSIDE THE SPORE GOV ESTABILISHMENT AS WELL FROM ALL OVER!</p>
