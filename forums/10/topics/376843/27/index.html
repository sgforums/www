              <p>Actually after reading my own post i realise that the choice of
                  examples i've used is quite bad, making too much assumptions and
                  leap of faiths. I apologize for that.</p>
              <p>It was never my intention to imply that either you, Lionoasis or
                  any of the examples i've used are elite scholars. I was trying to
                  make the point that saying Singaporeans are not adaptable is not a
                  fair statement because it's just not something that's easily
                  measurable and can't be verified unless we could somehow put a
                  group of Singaporeans overseas and monitor them for a few
                  years. </p>
              <p>But it is, of course his opinion. And there's nothing wrong in
                  stating an opinion on something that's so difficult to measure.
                  Perhaps i have overreacted but i detect the feeling that if we're
                  not working and being successful in an overseas position we're
                  somehow not being adaptable and incapable of integrating
                  culturally.</p>
              <p>That is often a position that i've seen taken by a few who are
                  overseas(true or not, i do not know), mocking the dumb Singaporeans
                  who aren't able to succeed as they have and have to put up with the
                  PAP government.</p>
              <p>If i have indeed misinterpreted what Lionoasis have said then i
                  apologize again.</p>
              <p>It's not about limiting myself but i have personal
                  responsibilities that makes it somewhat difficult to make big
                  choices. The path just isn't as straightforward for a lot of
                  us.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Thank you for the clarifications. I would like to categorically state that I do not think anyone is unsuccessful if he/she decides to stay in Singapore. As I said, there are many reasons why Singaporeans do not move out to other parts of the world, be it the lack of opportunities, or as you mentioned, certain personal responsibilities. Take for instance, our ministers. They sure are successful locals :p</p>
              <p>I have to acknowledge that I am fortunate to have this opportunity when I am still not planning to have kids. It's much easier to make decisions based on personal factors than for many different people.</p>
              <p>Coming back to Lionoasis's points, settling into another country is NOT easy at all. Re-location is a horrible nightmare, given that I was entitled to shipping my personal belongings from Singapore to USA. There's so much to do, so much to plan, and that one day when lots of people came to our house to do the packing, is really horrid. And the leaving of Singapore, the emotions, it's really hard to bear.</p>
              <p>And then, the amount of effort to fill up lots of documentation in the new land, getting a temporary housing, adapting to a different environment together with a new job and new culture, is quite the experience.</p>
              <p>I felt horrid in the first few weeks in my relocation, but settled in sometime into the 2nd month. I relish the challenge, to feel horrible, to try to keep a sane mind while settling down in all aspects of life, because I believe it will increase my maturity.</p>
              <p>Everyone loves to be in the comfort zone, I included, but I just make that effort to discomfort myself in order to bring myself up another level. Call me a sadist or whatever.</p>

              need to prove who you are (though, yes, I know you are the decision
              maker). Leave it to others to determine what they want. It's not
              important. For example, some of those here claimed that I am lying
              about living in USA. It doesn't matter. It's not impt, coz from the
              postings I make, others can determine whether I am speaking the
              truth or not.</div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Spot on, soul_rage, but that's only half the story.</p>
              <p>I don't care if anyone is who they claim to be on the forum - hell, I don't even care if someone <span style="text-decoration: underline;">isn't</span> who they claim to be.  The fact is that getting into the "if you only knew who I was" argument is always going to be a losing proposition.  The only reason I mentioned what I do is to address Lionoasis' attempt to pull the wool over my eyes over what "in real life" is.</p>
              <p>The fact is that all we have to fall back on here is the strength of what we argue.  We know characters like Hitman are to be disregarded because of the outright nonsense they post, but that's all right because they obviously have no intention of being taken seriously.</p>
              <p>Where we have a real point of contention is situations like what we have at present.  As far as I can tell, Lionoasis is in this discussion for reasoned, intelligent discourse, but his methods of reasoning are what I question.</p>
              <p>The irony here is that it is precisely Lionoasis' tolerance, if not insistence upon, imprecision, that has led him to erroneously believe that I was trying to give him an English lesson, be impressed by his personal circumstances and go right off track.</p>
              <p>I think you've been around long enough, soul-rage, to know that there are some people like yourself, eagle and Short Ninja (to provide a very truncated list) that I have simply never had a beef with, and my reason for selecting this particular list is that you can compare the writing styles and see for yourself that this is not a matter of English as Lionoasis claims.  Also note that there are some people that I have traditionally butted heads with, such as xtreyier and Singapore Tyrannosaurus, and yet you will occasionally find me agreeing with them.  Why would this be so?</p>
              <p>It's all very simple, really.  All I'm asking is for people to be reasonable, and regardless of the person's linguistic abilities, politics or other personal characteristics, you will not find me disagreeing with a reasonable statement.  Conversely, reasonable people simply don't start off with "most" and expect to get away with switching to "all" without other people noticing.</p>
              <p>I don't know who this guy is, and frankly I don't care - he's sadly misguided if he expects me to be impressed if he does indeed turn out to be some captain of industry.</p>
              <p>All it would have taken to resolve this issue is if Lionoasis was mature enough to reply, "Yes, you could read it that way, and let's address that by clarifying that the "we" should be "most of us" instead".  That's all it would have taken.</p>
              <p>Instead, he decided to take things personally, throw his toys out of the pram, whip his dick out and expect me to be impressed and all other sorts of nonsense that do not address the issue.</p>
              <p>And <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>then</strong></span> he expects me to believe that he's the guy who keeps his eye on the big picture, after having gone so far off track chasing red herrings.  How ludicrous is that?  He's spent all this time extolling his virtues when the very act of extolling puts lie to his claims!</p>
              <p>Really now, is any of that reasonable?</p>

              <p>Given the lack of a welfare system and the level of competition Singaporeans are subjected to the moment they are old enough to enter school, I would say that the environment is ripe for raising a population that is particularly familiar with being out of the comfort zone, if not entirely comfortable with it.  IMHO, it's one of the greatest gifts from Singapore it its people.</p>

              <p>Spot on, soul_rage, but that's only half the story.</p>
              <p>I don't care if anyone is who they claim to be on the forum -
                  hell, I don't even care if someone <span style="text-decoration: underline;">isn't</span> who they claim to
                  be.  The fact is that getting into the "if you only knew who I
                  was" argument is always going to be a losing proposition.  The
                  only reason I mentioned what I do is to address Lionoasis' attempt
                  to pull the wool over my eyes over what "in real life" is.</p>
              <p>The fact is that all we have to fall back on here is the
                  strength of what we argue.  We know characters like Hitman are
                  to be disregarded because of the outright nonsense they post, but
                  that's all right because they obviously have no intention of being
                  taken seriously.</p>
              <p>Where we have a real point of contention is situations like what
                  we have at present.  As far as I can tell, Lionoasis is in
                  this discussion for reasoned, intelligent discourse, but his
                  methods of reasoning are what I question.</p>
              <p>The irony here is that it is precisely Lionoasis' tolerance, if
                  not insistence upon, imprecision, that has led him to erroneously
                  believe that I was trying to give him an English lesson, be
                  impressed by his personal circumstances and go right off track.</p>
              <p>I think you've been around long enough, soul-rage, to know that
                  there are some people like yourself, eagle and Short Ninja (to
                  provide a very truncated list) that I have simply never had a beef
                  with, and my reason for selecting this particular list is that you
                  can compare the writing styles and see for yourself that this is
                  not a matter of English as Lionoasis claims.  Also note that
                  there are some people that I have traditionally butted heads with,
                  such as xtreyier and Singapore Tyrannosaurus, and yet you will
                  occasionally find me agreeing with them.  Why would this be
                  so?</p>
              <p>It's all very simple, really.  All I'm asking is for people
                  to be reasonable, and regardless of the person's linguistic
                  abilities, politics or other personal characteristics, you will not
                  find me disagreeing with a reasonable statement.  Conversely,
                  reasonable people simply don't start off with "most" and expect to
                  get away with switching to "all" without other people noticing.</p>
              <p>I don't know who this guy is, and frankly I don't care - he's
                  sadly misguided if he expects me to be impressed if he does indeed
                  turn out to be some captain of industry.</p>
              <p>All it would have taken to resolve this issue is if Lionoasis
                  was mature enough to reply, "Yes, you could read it that way, and
                  let's address that by clarifying that the "we" should be "most of
                  us" instead".  That's all it would have taken.</p>
              <p>Instead, he decided to take things personally, throw his toys
                  out of the pram, whip his dick out and expect me to be impressed
                  and all other sorts of nonsense that do not address the issue.</p>
              <p>And <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>then</strong></span> he
                  expects me to believe that he's the guy who keeps his eye on the
                  big picture, after having gone so far off track chasing red
                  herrings.  How ludicrous is that?  He's spent all this
                  time extolling his virtues when the very act of extolling puts lie
                  to his claims!</p>
              <p>Really now, is any of that reasonable?</p>

              <p>Hi soul_rage and all,</p>
              <p>It is probably a good time to state yet again where I stand:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>I am not pro-PAP, just believe there is no easy substitude for them and since they run and will run the show in the forseeable future, my approach is try to get the best out of them, instead of fighting against them.  I am being pragmatic.  I have also statement as always, that the PAP has flaws.  May be not in this thread, but I have other threads and in them,<strong> I have asked them questions, hard questions!</strong></li>
              <li>I think Singapore is best for me, and should be a natural choice for most Singaporeans, for various reasons (and I shall not get into that at this time).  And since it is what it is, I just hope people will not whine, complaint and talk crab about it, and instead look at the imperfections, and see what they can do about it.  The title of this thread is merely to giude people (and most people only), in general, to discover there is no real alternatives for them and hope they look inwards (their immediate environment) for a better life.  Again, I am being pragmatic.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Hope this clears the cloud, and thank you soul_rage for clarifying for me in a number of occasions.</p>
