              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p>It has been really long again... I bring to you today a field report.</p>
              <p>Just some updates from the <strong>Shanghai Expo 2010</strong> that I visited a few days ago.  The Singapore Pavillion was a shame, no contents, no display of our strengths, no Merlion, just a super long screen with a 7-minute song showing four of our singers - Stephanie Sun, Cai Jian Ya, J Lim adn A-Toh and some Singapore scenes.</p>
              <p>Very disappointing....why o why would so little budget be spent on such an important event???!!!!</p>
              <p>Even Thailand had a better show, and Japan was so impressive!!  Oh we did better than a few countries in Polynesia though...they had a few booths with some handicrafts.</p>

              <p>oz . again? Yes.</p>
              <p>I am tell u which countries u shall have a second thought before u committ to go.</p>
              <p>Oz was ranked by Merrill Lynch  in 2008 Nov the highest risky country.</p>
              <p>U dunt believe. nvm. Read here or not, up to u!!</p>
              <p>U wil ask me "Hey LN, Oz was the ONLY western country not suffering fr recession. How come?'"</p>
              <p>Recession is a indicator of GDP of a single country,not comparsion.</p>
              <p>When a country  experience low GDP growth in the past years,</p>
              <p>it wont experience recession (neg GDP in 2 quarters),</p>
              <p>as compared with previous year corresponding quarter,</p>
              <p>so easy.\</p>
              <p>U see Japan, Oz etc, GDP was low in the past years.</p>
              <p>BUT SG GDP is much higher at 7 to 9 % in the past years.</p>
              <p>Once in 2008, it suffer 9 or 10 % recession in a quarter....</p>
              <p>the recession was good news, showing SG had high GDP in the past years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>see how  Merrill Lynch ranked AUSTRALIA as the worst risky country!</p>

              <p>It has been really long again... I bring to you today a
              field report.</p>
              <p>Just some updates from the <strong>Shanghai Expo 2010</strong> that I visited a few days ago.  The Singapore Pavillion was a
              shame, no contents, no display of our strengths, no Merlion, just a
              super long screen with a 7-minute song showing four of our singers
              - Stephanie Sun, Cai Jian Ya, J Lim adn A-Toh and some Singapore
              scenes.</p>
              <p>Very disappointing....why o why would so little budget be spent
              on such an important event???!!!!</p>
              <p>Even Thailand had a better show, and Japan was so
              impressive!!  Oh we did better than a few countries in
              Polynesia though...they had a few booths with some handicrafts.</p>

              <p>Overall, the Shanghai Expo is worth visiting as it showcases 200+ countries and many of China's various provinces have their own pavillion too.  There are also electronic cars/ buses being used, impressive multi-media performances, and cultural shows.  The Single-Day fare is Rmb160 (for whole day) or Rmb90 for night visits.  There are 3-time visit fares and 7-time visit fares, but I cannot remember the prices.</p>
              <p>What do you mean 'competitor'?  For what?</p>
              <p>I have a strange feeling the LKY's 10-Day to visit to China and Japan has something to do with Dr Goh KS's wake - I somehow make a connection there.  I am being speculative of course.  LKY may be bantang and probably his feng shui master has asked him to avoid such occasions this year!  Hahaha.</p>

              <p>I am of the opinion that saving cost for the sake of saving cost is actually a waste of money!!  Heard they had problem looking for sponsors, but this is no excuse, it is not that expensive to do a good one in the worldwide platform.</p>
