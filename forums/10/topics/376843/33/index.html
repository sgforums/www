              <h1>Singapore ranked 70th best place to live in the world after Romania</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">January 17, 2010</span></p>
              <p>Singapore is ranked the 70th best place in the world to live in based on the Quality of Life index computed yearly by Ireland-based magazine “International Living”.</p>
              <p>The index is produced based on the following nine categories: cost of living, culture and leisure, economy, environment, freedom, health, infrastructure, safety and risk and climate.</p>
              <p>Each country in each category is graded on a curve and it is scored relative to every other country. The scores run 0 to 100 for each category. This means the country that gets 0 is the worst in that category, and the country that gets 100 is the best.</p>
              <p>The data is collated from official government sources, the <em>World Health Organization</em>, <em>The Economist</em>, and many other journals, tables, and records.</p>
              <p>Below is Singapore’s scores for each category:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/ilsingapore.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="296"></p>
              <p>While Singapore scores high on risk and safety, health and infrastructure, it scores poorly in environment and freedom, bringing down its final score to a mediocre 61.</p>
              <p>Environment and Freedom each contributed 10 per cent to the countries’ overall score:</p>
              <p><strong>Environment (10%). </strong>To figure a country’s score in this category, we look at population density per square kilometer, population growth rate, greenhouse emissions per capita, and the percentage of total land that is protected.</p>
              <p><strong>Freedom (10%). </strong><em>Freedom House’s</em> survey is the main source for these scores, with an emphasis on a citizen’s political rights and civil liberties.</p>
              <p>In contrast, Romania which was in the spotlight recently in Singapore over the double hit-and-run road traffic accident involving a Romanian diplomat Dr Silviu Ionescu was ranked 53th, 17 positions ahead of Singapore:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/ilromania.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="296"></p>
              <p>The 5 most desirable places to live in the world are France, Australia, Switzerland, Germany and New Zealand. Singapore is ranked below Japan, South Korea and Taiwan among Asian countries.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s leaders have always boasted of their accomplishment of transforming Singapore from third to first world country within a few decades, but if Singapore is really a first world country, why is it ranked among third world countries in terms of quality of life?</p>
              <p>It is highly unlikely that this damning report will be published by the Singapore media. Neither will anybody from the ruling party respond to it.</p>
              <p>They will probably dismiss it as quite “dissociated from reality” to borrow the words of Law Minister K Shanmugam. But International Living is read widely by Europeans and Americans and they may have a poor perception of Singapore based on the report.</p>
              <p>If Singapore really wishes to attract first class talents around the world and not just uneducated peasants from China or India, it needs to improve on the two categories of environment and freedom where it performed particularly badly.</p>
              <p>A world class healthcare, infrastructure and economy is not everything that people look for in life. They also yearn for civil and political liberties for them to play a meaningful role in society.</p>
              <p>Singapore has a first world economy ruled by a petty third world dictatorship. We cannot claim our rightful place as a developed country in the world so long our archaic, oppressive and obsolete political system remains in place to perpetuate the rule of a particular group of self-serving, power-hungry elites with little participation in nation-building from the rest of the people.</p>

              <h1>2010 Quality of Life Index: 194 Countries Ranked and Rated to Reveal the Best Places to Live</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">January 17, 2010</span></p>
              <span class="time">
              <p><strong>International Living, January 2010</strong></p>
              <p><strong>1. France:</strong></p>
              <p>For the fifth year running, France takes first in our annual Quality of Life Index. No surprise. Its tiresome bureaucracy and high taxes are outweighed by an unsurpassable quality of life, including the world’s best health care.</p>
              <p>France always nets high scores in most categories. But you don’t need number-crunchers to tell you its <em>bon vivant</em> lifestyle is special. Step off a plane and you’ll experience it first-hand.</p>
              <p>I always wish quality of life indicators could measure a country’s heart and soul. But it’s impossible to enumerate the joy of lingering for hours over dinner and a bottle of red wine in a Parisian brasserie. Or strolling beside the Seine on a spring morning, poking through the book vendors’ wares. Or buying buttery croissants in bohemian Montmartre…hearing Notre Dame’s bells…walking antique streets paved with poetry.</p>
              <p>Romantic Paris offers the best of everything, but services don’t fall away in Alsace’s wine villages…in wild and lovely Corsica…in lavender-scented Provence. Or in the Languedoc of the troubadors, bathed in Mediterranean sunlight.</p>
              <p>Provincial French properties are often keenly priced and lifestyles are less expensive than Paris. The Southwestern Midi-Pyrenees region is a particularly good hunting ground for village homes for less than $100,000—and classic three-course lunches for $14. Houses cascade with wisteria blossom; outdoor markets are everywhere. <em>Foie gras</em>, pink garlic, Armagnac, and crystallized violets aren’t gourmet fare for locals. Rather, just another day’s shopping.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Australia:</strong></p>
              <p>They don’t call it the “<strong><em>Lucky Country</em></strong>” for nothing. Australia is famous for its large beaches and temperate climate. Across the continent, Aussies and those who’ve chosen to emigrate there have access to an active and healthy lifestyle. But urban dwellers will find plenty of great culture and excellent food in Sydney and Melbourne, and a cost of living below that of some of the world’s other great cities.</p>
              <p>Australia’s economy has managed to weather the Global Financial Crisis better than any other Western country. For tourists and travelers, this means you’ll be dealing with a strong Aussie dollar, making your visit there more expensive. But if you plan to stay, you’ll find that few English-speaking countries with quality health care and good infrastructure will benefit as much as Australia from the economic booms in Asia and China.</p>
              <p>The Australian economy is powered by agricultural, mineral, and energy exports that feed the voracious appetite of rapidly industrializing populations in Asia. Housing in Australia remains expensive by global standards. But there are plenty of jobs for skilled expats who can ride the Asian boom from the sandy, sunny, and safe beaches of the land Down Under.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Switzerland:</strong></p>
              <p>For Harry Lime, in Graham Greene’s story <em>The Third Man</em>, all the Swiss have to show for five centuries of peaceful neutrality is the cuckoo clock. The rest of Europe, meanwhile, stumped on through rivers of blood to create art, history, and civilization.</p>
              <p>This is rubbish. Switzerland is an award-winning country because it turned all its natural disadvantages to its own advantage, ending up as a super-efficient, high-tech society while still managing to play Alpine inn-keeper to the world. Moreover the cuckoo clock comes from the Black Forest in Germany.</p>
              <p>Lacking natural frontiers or a unifying religion, and divided by five different languages, it sensibly decided that internationalism was its calling, quickly adding English to the French, German (two kinds), Italian, and Romansch (like ancient Latin) its people already speak so that foreigners of every linguistic persuasion could feel at home. Altruism followed from this and Geneva became home to the United Nations and the Red Cross.</p>
              <p>Landlocked, mountainous, and without natural resources (except cheese), Switzerland still needed more than tourism to provide a living. So it developed secretive banks, whose potential clientele is numberless and efficient engineering and pharmaceutical industries whose appeal similarly knows no borders.</p>
              <p>Such achievements reinforce each other. Tourists gladly clamber into Alpine cable cars because they trust their Swiss steel cables and electric motors. Jump on a Swiss train and you know you will arrive on time. Swallow a Swiss pill and you know it won’t poison you. Likewise, you know the bank will always be discreet and the hotel room spotless. You also know everyone will speak your language. The Swiss succeeded because they made everything work.</p>

              <div class="entry">
              <p>When nationalists look for a model of what Britain should be, Singapore doesn’t appear to be an example that naturally springs to mind.</p>
              <p>For years, this rich city-state has marketed itself as one of the world’s most open economies.</p>
              <p>But as Singapore recovers from recession, its residents are questioning a key part of the country’s economic model: its long-standing openness to foreigners.</p>
              <p>Singapore is grappling with an uncertain future amid weak demand for its exports to the U.S. and Europe, it faces a sensitive subject: the role of foreign labour in sustaining its multi-decade economic boom.</p>
              <p>Singapore has thrown open its doors to bankers and expatriates in recent years, making it easy in many cases to establish residency and hastening the country’s emergence as an Asian version of Dubai. It also welcomed low-skilled laborers from Bangladesh and other developing countries to help man construction sites and factories.</p>
              <p>The goal was to capture more Asian wealth and offset Singapore’s low birth rate with immigrants, spurring economic growth. But the push has also fueled discontent, turning immigration into a red-hot political issue in a country where dissent is still tightly controlled by the government.</p>
              <p>Between 2005 and 2009, Singapore’s population surged by roughly 150,000 people a year to 5 million—among the fastest rates ever there—with 75% or more of the increase coming from foreigners. In-migration continued in 2009 despite expectations it would collapse because of the global recession.</p>
              <p>The influx helped boost Singapore’s economy in the short run by creating new demand for goods and services and helping manufacturers keep labor costs low. Developers built apartments and posh shopping centers for the new arrivals.</p>
              <p>By some estimates, a third or more of Singapore’s 6.8% average annual growth from 2003 to 2008 came from the expansion of its labor force, primarily expatriates, allowing Singapore to post growth more commonly associated with poor developing nations.</p>
              <p>At the same time, though, foreign workers have driven up real estate and other prices and made the city-state’s roads and subways more congested. Their arrival has kept local blue-collar wages lower than they would be otherwise, exacerbating Singapore’s gap between rich and poor.</p>
              <p>Some economists say the most damaging effect of the immigration is that the influx appears to be putting a lid on productivity gains, as manufacturers rely on cheap imported labor instead of making their businesses more efficient. Labor productivity, or output per employee, fell 7.8% in 2008 and 0.8% in 207—a phenomenon that could eventually translate into lower standards of living.</p>
              <p>Lee Ah Lee, a 58-year-old who makes 850 Singapore dollars a month (about US$600) clearing tables in a cafeteria, says the flood of immigrants has made it hard to make ends meet by pushing down blue-collar pay in Singapore, which has no legal minimum wage. Sitting nearby in a drab apartment block built by Singapore’s Housing Development Board, a state-owned body that constructs and sells subsidized housing, 79-year-old Lee Kwang Joo says low-skilled foreign workers are often housed in corporate dormitories, meaning they have no housing costs and can survive on lower pay.</p>
              <p>On Temasek Review, a Web site dedicated to Singaporean affairs, one writer recently warned Singaporeans would be ‘replaced’ as ‘3rd class citizens’ by foreigners, while another said that immigration ‘will emerge as the single most important issue’ in Singapore’s next general election, due by 2011.</p>
              <p>Immigration ‘kept our economic growth high but, at a tremendous cost,’ says Kenneth Jeyaretnam, the secretary-general of Singapore’s Reform Party, a small opposition party founded in 2008. Relying on foreign labor to help boost growth is unsustainable, adds Choy Keen Meng, an assistant professor of economics at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University. He says a better model would involve the reining in immigration and accepting that Singapore is becoming a more mature economy like the U.S. or Europe, with a long-term growth rate of 3% to 5% a year.</p>
              <p>Singapore, unlike many of its neighbors, has a reputation for reliable public services and minimal corruption. Its openness to foreign investment is one reason why gross domestic product is expected to rebound to 4.5% this year, according to the Asian Development Bank, from a contraction of 2.1% in 2009.</p>
              <p>Still, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, speaking at a Singapore university in September, said there was a need to be ‘mindful of how quickly our society can absorb and integrate’ new arrivals, and vowed to curb immigration.</p>
              <p>The government is also studying immigration as part of a wide-ranging review of the city-state’s economic model launched in 2009. Results of the review, due this month, are expected to include steps to diversify Singapore’s economy and reduce its reliance on exports to the United States and Europe by boosting domestic consumption, among other things.</p>
              <p>Yet people familiar with the government’s plans say it is unlikely to press for deep cuts in immigration, and will aim to find other ways to restore productivity growth. Singapore remains committed to a long-term goal of increasing the population to 6.5 million, though it would do so by prioritizing high-skilled residents as opposed to blue-collar workers.</p>
              <p>Immigration ‘is not a weakness, it’s a strength,’ said one person familiar with the long-term economic planning process. ‘People want to come here, why not make use of that strength?’</p>
              <p>Serious cuts to immigration could also generate a backlash from other interests—notably the factory owners and real-estate developers who rely heavily on foreign arrivals. Many employers complain that local Singaporeans, accustomed to a higher standard of living than most other Southeast Asians, are unwilling to take on menial jobs, and are likely to resist further tightening of foreign labor supply.</p>
              <p>Even if Singapore does not not change its open door immigration policy,  it is remarkable that such a debate happened in the first place.</p>
              <p>Let us not forget that this city state is ruled by an authoritarian regime intolerant of criticism, and freedom of speech is almost non-existent.</p>
              <p>In spite of this, Singaporeans are having a debate on the topic of immigration in a way that Britons can only dream of, and it says a great deal about how much democracy and free speech have been undermined in the UK by a treacherous political elite.</p>
              <p>Nationalists have a lot to learn from Singapore, from its tough policy on crime (they still cane criminals) to its excellent public services and schools.</p>

              <h1>Complete media blackout on Singapore being ranked 70th in world’s best places to live in</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">January 20, 2010</span></p>
              <p>The Singapore media has imposed a complete news blackout on Singapore’s pathetic performance on the annual Quality of Life index compiled by influential lifestyle magazine – “International Living” based in Ireland. (read article <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/01/17/singapore-ranked-70th-best-place-to-live-in-the-world-after-romania/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Though the rankings were released a week ago and circulated widely in Singapore’s blogsphere and forums, the mainstream media chose to turn a blind eye to it.</p>
              <p>Neither did any leaders from the ruling party, which is obsessed with Singapore’s international rankings in everything, respond to it.</p>
              <p>However, when Singapore was ranked as the third least corrupted nation in the world by Transparency International (TI) last year, it was splashed all over the front pages of the major papers on the very same day and they continue to harp on it ad nausem for the rest of the week as if they have become the mouthpieces of TI.</p>
              <p>Similarly, the news of Singapore being ranked as the most competitive economy in the world by Political and Economic Risk Consultancy group (PERC) also made the headlines with the mainstream media lavishing generous praise on the ruling party leaders to justify (subtly) their astronomical salaries.</p>
              <p>The findings of “International Living” were given extensive publicity by the major newspapers in the world because of its significance. While there are many international studies on economic indicators such as GDP, GNP and Gini Coefficient, this is the only study which actually measures the quality of life among citizens living in 194 countries around the world, a rather subjective and soft indicator.</p>
              <p>The 5 most desirable places to live in the world are France, Australia, Switzerland, Germany and New Zealand. Singapore is ranked below Japan, South Korea and Taiwan among Asian countries and the lowest among the thirty most developed economies in the world below developing countries such as Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia which does not reflect well on the performance of the ruling party whose leaders have always boasted unshamedly about their “world class” talents deserving the highest pay in the world.</p>
              <p>The Singapore media has a propensity to publish only news which make its political masters look good and censor those unpalatable truths which may embarrass them.</p>
              <p>While it may be relatively successful in the past, it is impossible to practice that kind of gutter journalism in today’s borderless world made possible by the internet.</p>
              <p>Their continued one-sided editorial policy slanted towards the ruling party will probaby hurt them in the long run by diminishing both its credibility and readership.</p>
              <p>It is unlikely that the spin doctors at SPH remain unaware of this damaging report by “International Living”. Perhaps they are brainstorming of ways to spin the study in a manner which favors the ruling party but even that may be an uphill task for them – how can one sugar-coat Singapore’s 70th ranking in terms of quality of living to present to an citizenry increasingly flustered, peeved and antagonized by the ruling party’s policies?</p>
              <p>Perhaps in a few months’ time, long after the findings fade away from public consciousness, we will have one minister stepping forward to denounce it as quite “divorced fro reality” like what Law Minister Shanmugam said about the Singapore media’s 133th ranking in press freedom by Reporters without Borders last year.</p>

              <h1>Instant reporting by Straits Times on Singapore being the 2nd “freest” economy in the world</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">January 20, 2010</span></p>
              <p>Even before the news made the headlines around the world, the Straits Times is the first newspaper to publish it in big titles on its online “breaking news” section:</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p><strong>“Spore is 2nd freest economy”</strong></p>
              <p>The ranking is based on The Index of Economic Freedom, published by The Wall Street Journal and The Heritage Foundation, an conservative American think-tank.</p>
              <p>However when Wall Street Journal published an article last week on the negative impact of the relentless influx of foreigners on Singaporeans, the Straits Times is surprisingly silent on it.</p>
              <p>Neither did it carry any reports on the latest release of the Quality of Life Index by Ireland-based lifestyle magazine “International Living” which ranked Singapore as the 70th best place to live in the world below the likes of Bulgaria, Namibia and Romania.</p>
              <p>As expected, the article was entirely one-sided and devoid of any analysis of the findings.</p>
              <p>So what if Singapore is ranked the 2nd freest economy in the world? Does it translate into a better life for ordinary Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>Given the pro-business policies of the ruling party which has allowed large numbers of foreigners to flood the labor market at the expense of the locals, it is not surprising that Singapore is the second freest economy in the world after Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>The figure should be interpreted in a wider context together with other indices such as the income gap and the quality of life index.</p>
              <p>Though Singapore’s economy is relatively free, it has the highest income-gap between the rich and the poor among the thirty most developed nations in the world.</p>
              <p>This means that the fruits from the nation’s economic development are not distributed equally among the people with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer resulting in an overall lower standard of living than before.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the Singapore media, which is used to being a propaganda mouthpiece of the ruling party will not dare to tell Singaporeans the truth by such selective reporting and censorship.</p>

              <h1>Many Singaporeans want to migrate – Why?</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Leong Sze Hian</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I refer to the article “<a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10625002"><span style="color: #336699;">Singapore envies Kiwi lifestyle</span></a>” (New Zealand Herald, Feb 9).</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">It states that</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><br><em>“The bait was better working hours, cheaper cars and housing – and in three weeks thousands from Singapore have registered their interest in living in New Zealand.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>An Immigration New Zealand pilot project aimed at attracting Singaporean migrants has resulted in over 1000 registrations each week since it was launched last month, with 3565 potential immigrants having registered their interest in just three weeks”.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p>According to another article “<a href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/business/asia/singapore/2010/01/12/240437/Survey-finds.htm"><span style="color: #336699;">Survey finds that workers in Singapore put in longest hours</span></a>” (The China Post, Jan 12),<em>“Singapore’s workers continue to lead the pack when it comes to the number of hours they put in at work, according to a report by the International Labor Organization (ILO). The report puts them at the top of 13 economies in the group’s Global Wages Report for 2008-09, surpassing even the notoriously hardworking Japanese and Taiwanese”.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporeans are among the hardest workers in the world, but do not have enough, upon retirement, to live in comfort in their home country. Is there any wonder why they should choose to migrate to other places that are much more affordable?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cars for example, are so expensive in Singapore that a car owner may end up with $2 million less in retirement. This is calculated from an estimated cost of $1,000 monthly compounded at 6 per cent over 40 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To explain the poverty of retired Singaporeans, we’d have to explore the possible link between the 2 largest entities that effectively ‘lock up’ the wages of Singaporeans – HDB and CPF.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Increasing flat prices decrease the amount of CPF upon retirement</span></p>
              <p>In line with the government’s policy of letting Singaporeans use their flats for asset enhancement, many Singaporeans have bought their flat, using the bulk of their CPF in a typical 30-year mortgage, in hope that the continued increase in property prices would serve as a boon during retirement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By pricing flats under ‘market subsidy’ pricing, asset ‘enhancement’ schemes such as upgrading inevitably become a burden to Singaporeans who have no choice but to use even more of the CPF for their upgraded HDB flat. In addition to that, HDB has never disclosed the cost of building flats. Thus, flat pricing, and the amount of CPF ‘locked’ in it, is really at the whim of property speculation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With 80 per cent of the population living in public housing, and with a bulk of a typical homeowner’s CPF savings ‘locked’ by the flat, social security for the average Singaporean is contingent on HDB policies. When you can’t pay your mortgage, you may lose your home and maybe your life CPF savings too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Consequently, with the bulk of their CPF ‘locked’ in unliquidated assets, many Singaporeans end up with very little CPF when they retire.</p>
              <p><br><img class="alignright" style="float: right; margin: 13px; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2674/3915382955_9f9a7e41c7.jpg" alt="" width="319" height="317"></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CPF gets transferred out of Singaporeans’ hands, into HDB’s pockets</span></p>
              <p>When the HDB sends a notice of Compulsory Acquisition to flat owners, 90 per cent of the flat’s valuation is used to offset the loan arrears; HDB makes a profit of 10 per cent of the valuation. While it is understandable that HDB as a statutory board has to run on a sustainable business model, it seems counterintuitive that a public housing board should profit from the destitution of its citizens.</p>
              <p>For example, flat owners in addition to losing 10 per cent of their flat valuation to HDB, are only given one month to vacate their flats. Why does the HDB not give them a bit more time to find alternative accommodation?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a public housing authority with the mission to provide affordable housing for Singaporeans, is the HDB not in a sense, in breach of its fiduciary duty, in this arbitrary practice of ‘pinching’ 10 per cent of the valuation?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are there any public housing authorities in the world that takes an additional 10 per cent profit on foreclosure?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Parliamentarians may like to raise this issue with a view to refunding the ‘pinched’ valuation to all past foreclosed flat owners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why it’s almost impossible to get enough cash upon retirement</span></p>
              <p>Effective last year, if you sell your HDB flat after age 55 to downgrade to a smaller flat and to monetise your flat for retirement, any CPF utilised plus accrued interest has to be returned to the CPF account if the CPF Minimum Sum (MS) has not been met.</p>
              <p>With the current MS at $117,000, what this policy change means is that this sum cannot be used to purchase the smaller flat downgrade.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why are we making it harder for Singaporeans to downgrade to monetise their flat for retirement?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many Singaporeans subscribed to the call for asset enhancement by purchasing HDB flats – only to be hit by the policy change now, which in effect, may result in their inability to cash out of their “enhanced” HDB asset.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The CPF Minimun Sum (MS) was raised from July 1, 2009, for those aged 55 years, to $117,000, up from $106,000. â€¨â€¨This is an increase of 10.4 per cent, much more than the inflation rate for the previous year, which was 6.5 per cent. How can the increase in MS be “an adjustment for inflation, is to ensure that Singaporeans set aside sufficient savings for their retirement?”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Similarly, the MS was increased by 6.4 per cent in July 2008, from $99,600 to $106,000, when inflation was only 2.1 per cent in 2007.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the current recession, some of those reaching age 55, may have lost their jobs or failed in their businesses, and thus a large increase in the MS, may cause some financial stress to them. â€¨â€¨As last year’s increase is the highest in the history of the MS scheme, at its current quantum of increase, does it mean that by 2013, the MS may be about $161,000 ($117,000 now plus $11,000 increase for 4 years)?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Can anyone afford to retire in Singapore in future?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The <a href="http://mycpf.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Gen-Info/CPF_LIFE/NLIC.htm"><span style="color: #336699;">Longevity Insurance Committee’s (LIC) CPF Life report</span></a> last year only projected a MS of $134,000 in 2013 (chapter 4). â€¨â€¨Adding the projected Medisave Required Amount (MRA) of $36,000 in 2013, does it mean that those reaching age 55 may only be able to withdraw $5,000, if they have less than $197,000 (MS $161,000 plus MRA $36,000) in their CPF? â€¨â€¨How many Singaporeans will have more than $197,000 in their CPF in 2013?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The answer can be found in the LIC report: <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/328324/1/.html"><span style="color: #336699;">only 60 per cent are projected to have at least $67,000 in their CPF in 2013</span></a>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the current rate of increase of $15,500 per year ($11,000 MS + $4,500 MRA), will the combined MS and MRA be $352,000 and $507,000 in 2023 and 2033 respectively?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In conclusion, is it any wonder why so many Singaporeans may be thinking about migrating to New Zealand?</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">It states that</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><br><em>“The bait was better working hours, cheaper cars and housing – and in three weeks thousands from Singapore have registered their interest in living in New Zealand.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>An Immigration New Zealand pilot project aimed at attracting Singaporean migrants has resulted in over 1000 registrations each week since it was launched last month, with 3565 potential immigrants having registered their interest in just three weeks”.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p>According to another article “<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/business/asia/singapore/2010/01/12/240437/Survey-finds.htm"><span style="color: #336699;">Survey finds that workers in Singapore put in longest hours</span></a>” (The China Post, Jan 12),<em>“Singapore’s workers continue to lead the pack when it comes to the number of hours they put in at work, according to a report by the International Labor Organization (ILO). The report puts them at the top of 13 economies in the group’s Global Wages Report for 2008-09, surpassing even the notoriously hardworking Japanese and Taiwanese”.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporeans are among the hardest workers in the world, but do not have enough, upon retirement, to live in comfort in their home country. Is there any wonder why they should choose to migrate to other places that are much more affordable?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cars for example, are so expensive in Singapore that a car owner may end up with $2 million less in retirement. This is calculated from an estimated cost of $1,000 monthly compounded at 6 per cent over 40 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To explain the poverty of retired Singaporeans, we’d have to explore the possible link between the 2 largest entities that effectively ‘lock up’ the wages of Singaporeans – HDB and CPF.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Increasing flat prices decrease the amount of CPF upon retirement</span></p>
              <p>In line with the government’s policy of letting Singaporeans use their flats for asset enhancement, many Singaporeans have bought their flat, using the bulk of their CPF in a typical 30-year mortgage, in hope that the continued increase in property prices would serve as a boon during retirement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By pricing flats under ‘market subsidy’ pricing, asset ‘enhancement’ schemes such as upgrading inevitably become a burden to Singaporeans who have no choice but to use even more of the CPF for their upgraded HDB flat. In addition to that, HDB has never disclosed the cost of building flats. Thus, flat pricing, and the amount of CPF ‘locked’ in it, is really at the whim of property speculation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With 80 per cent of the population living in public housing, and with a bulk of a typical homeowner’s CPF savings ‘locked’ by the flat, social security for the average Singaporean is contingent on HDB policies. When you can’t pay your mortgage, you may lose your home and maybe your life CPF savings too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Consequently, with the bulk of their CPF ‘locked’ in unliquidated assets, many Singaporeans end up with very little CPF when they retire.</p>
              <p><br><img style="float: right; margin: 13px; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2674/3915382955_9f9a7e41c7.jpg" alt="" width="319" height="317"></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CPF gets transferred out of Singaporeans’ hands, into HDB’s pockets</span></p>
              <p>When the HDB sends a notice of Compulsory Acquisition to flat owners, 90 per cent of the flat’s valuation is used to offset the loan arrears; HDB makes a profit of 10 per cent of the valuation. While it is understandable that HDB as a statutory board has to run on a sustainable business model, it seems counterintuitive that a public housing board should profit from the destitution of its citizens.</p>
              <p>For example, flat owners in addition to losing 10 per cent of their flat valuation to HDB, are only given one month to vacate their flats. Why does the HDB not give them a bit more time to find alternative accommodation?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a public housing authority with the mission to provide affordable housing for Singaporeans, is the HDB not in a sense, in breach of its fiduciary duty, in this arbitrary practice of ‘pinching’ 10 per cent of the valuation?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are there any public housing authorities in the world that takes an additional 10 per cent profit on foreclosure?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Parliamentarians may like to raise this issue with a view to refunding the ‘pinched’ valuation to all past foreclosed flat owners.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <div>
              <h3>Posted on January 19th, 2010 by Giuseppe De Santis</h3>
              <div>
              <p>When nationalists look for a model of what Britain should be, Singapore doesn’t appear to be an example that naturally springs to mind.</p>
              <p>For years, this rich city-state has marketed itself as one of the world’s most open economies.</p>
              <p>But as Singapore recovers from recession, its residents are questioning a key part of the country’s economic model: its long-standing openness to foreigners.</p>
              <p>Singapore is grappling with an uncertain future amid weak demand for its exports to the U.S. and Europe, it faces a sensitive subject: the role of foreign labour in sustaining its multi-decade economic boom.</p>
              <p>Singapore has thrown open its doors to bankers and expatriates in recent years, making it easy in many cases to establish residency and hastening the country’s emergence as an Asian version of Dubai. It also welcomed low-skilled laborers from Bangladesh and other developing countries to help man construction sites and factories.</p>
              <p>The goal was to capture more Asian wealth and offset Singapore’s low birth rate with immigrants, spurring economic growth. But the push has also fueled discontent, turning immigration into a red-hot political issue in a country where dissent is still tightly controlled by the government.</p>
              <p>Between 2005 and 2009, Singapore’s population surged by roughly 150,000 people a year to 5 million—among the fastest rates ever there—with 75% or more of the increase coming from foreigners. In-migration continued in 2009 despite expectations it would collapse because of the global recession.</p>
              <p>The influx helped boost Singapore’s economy in the short run by creating new demand for goods and services and helping manufacturers keep labor costs low. Developers built apartments and posh shopping centers for the new arrivals.</p>
              <p>By some estimates, a third or more of Singapore’s 6.8% average annual growth from 2003 to 2008 came from the expansion of its labor force, primarily expatriates, allowing Singapore to post growth more commonly associated with poor developing nations.</p>
              <p>At the same time, though, foreign workers have driven up real estate and other prices and made the city-state’s roads and subways more congested. Their arrival has kept local blue-collar wages lower than they would be otherwise, exacerbating Singapore’s gap between rich and poor.</p>
              <p>Some economists say the most damaging effect of the immigration is that the influx appears to be putting a lid on productivity gains, as manufacturers rely on cheap imported labor instead of making their businesses more efficient. Labor productivity, or output per employee, fell 7.8% in 2008 and 0.8% in 207—a phenomenon that could eventually translate into lower standards of living.</p>
              <p>Lee Ah Lee, a 58-year-old who makes 850 Singapore dollars a month (about US$600) clearing tables in a cafeteria, says the flood of immigrants has made it hard to make ends meet by pushing down blue-collar pay in Singapore, which has no legal minimum wage. Sitting nearby in a drab apartment block built by Singapore’s Housing Development Board, a state-owned body that constructs and sells subsidized housing, 79-year-old Lee Kwang Joo says low-skilled foreign workers are often housed in corporate dormitories, meaning they have no housing costs and can survive on lower pay.</p>
              <p>On Temasek Review, a Web site dedicated to Singaporean affairs, one writer recently warned Singaporeans would be ‘replaced’ as ‘3rd class citizens’ by foreigners, while another said that immigration ‘will emerge as the single most important issue’ in Singapore’s next general election, due by 2011.</p>
              <p>Immigration ‘kept our economic growth high but, at a tremendous cost,’ says Kenneth Jeyaretnam, the secretary-general of Singapore’s Reform Party, a small opposition party founded in 2008. Relying on foreign labor to help boost growth is unsustainable, adds Choy Keen Meng, an assistant professor of economics at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University. He says a better model would involve the reining in immigration and accepting that Singapore is becoming a more mature economy like the U.S. or Europe, with a long-term growth rate of 3% to 5% a year.</p>
              <p>Singapore, unlike many of its neighbors, has a reputation for reliable public services and minimal corruption. Its openness to foreign investment is one reason why gross domestic product is expected to rebound to 4.5% this year, according to the Asian Development Bank, from a contraction of 2.1% in 2009.</p>
              <p>Still, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, speaking at a Singapore university in September, said there was a need to be ‘mindful of how quickly our society can absorb and integrate’ new arrivals, and vowed to curb immigration.</p>
              <p>The government is also studying immigration as part of a wide-ranging review of the city-state’s economic model launched in 2009. Results of the review, due this month, are expected to include steps to diversify Singapore’s economy and reduce its reliance on exports to the United States and Europe by boosting domestic consumption, among other things.</p>
              <p>Yet people familiar with the government’s plans say it is unlikely to press for deep cuts in immigration, and will aim to find other ways to restore productivity growth. Singapore remains committed to a long-term goal of increasing the population to 6.5 million, though it would do so by prioritizing high-skilled residents as opposed to blue-collar workers.</p>
              <p>Immigration ‘is not a weakness, it’s a strength,’ said one person familiar with the long-term economic planning process. ‘People want to come here, why not make use of that strength?’</p>
              <p>Serious cuts to immigration could also generate a backlash from other interests—notably the factory owners and real-estate developers who rely heavily on foreign arrivals. Many employers complain that local Singaporeans, accustomed to a higher standard of living than most other Southeast Asians, are unwilling to take on menial jobs, and are likely to resist further tightening of foreign labor supply.</p>
              <p>Even if Singapore does not not change its open door immigration policy,  it is remarkable that such a debate happened in the first place.</p>
              <p>Let us not forget that this city state is ruled by an authoritarian regime intolerant of criticism, and freedom of speech is almost non-existent.</p>
              <p>In spite of this, Singaporeans are having a debate on the topic of immigration in a way that Britons can only dream of, and it says a great deal about how much democracy and free speech have been undermined in the UK by a treacherous political elite.</p>
              <p>Nationalists have a lot to learn from Singapore, from its tough policy on crime (they still cane criminals) to its excellent public services and schools.</p>

              <p>"Even if Singapore does not not change its open door immigration policy,  it is remarkable that such a debate happened in the first place.</p>
              <p>Let us not forget that this city state is ruled by an authoritarian regime intolerant of criticism, and freedom of speech is almost non-existent.</p>
              <p>In spite of this, Singaporeans are having a debate on the topic of immigration in a way that Britons can only dream of, and it says a great deal about how much democracy and free speech have been undermined in the UK by a treacherous political elite.</p>
              <p>Nationalists have a lot to learn from Singapore, from its tough policy on crime (they still cane criminals) to its excellent public services and schools."</p>
              <p>The last few paras are quite interesting. Some Singaporeans are asking the government to learn from the west, and now some westerners are asking their government to learn from Singapore.</p>

              <p>Vancouver has again topped a list of the top 10 most liveable cities in the world, giving the Canadian west coast city an extra boost as it opens the <span id="lw_1265986850_0">2010 Winter Olympics</span>.</p>
              <p>In the annual survey by the <span id="lw_1265986850_1" style="background: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">Economist Intelligence Unit</span>, Vancouver scored 98 percent on a combination of stability, health care, culture and environment, education, and infrastructure — a score unchanged from last year.</p>
              <p>The city has also topped the index since at least 2007.</p>
              <p>In the 2010 ranking, there was little change in the top positions with Vienna, <span id="lw_1265986850_2">Melbourne</span> and <span id="lw_1265986850_3">Toronto</span> still taking the second, third and fourth positions and the top 10 dominated by Canadian and Australian cities which took seven of the 10 slots.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1265986850_4">Johannesburg</span>, which is hosting the <span id="lw_1265986850_5">soccer World Cup</span> finals in June, came in 92nd place, the <span id="lw_1265986850_6" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">highest score</span> in <span id="lw_1265986850_7">sub-Saharan Africa</span>.</p>
              <p>“Vancouver scores well across all categories in the survey and the <span id="lw_1265986850_8">forthcoming Winter Games</span> contribute to a strong score in the cultural and sporting events category,” said Jon Copestake, editor of the report, in a statement.</p>
              <p>“Johannesburg has had well-documented crime problems, but performs better in other categories, with the highest overall livability rating in sub-Saharan Africa.”</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1265986850_9">The Economist Intelligence Unit</span> survey ranked 140 cities on 30 factors such as healthcare, culture and environment, and education and personal safety, using research involving resident experts and its own analysts.</p>
              <p>It said in a statement that these rankings were used by employers assigning hardship allowances as part of expatriate relocation packages.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1265986850_10">New York</span> was ranked 56th, two slots behind <span id="lw_1265986850_11">London</span> which was at number 54, while <span id="lw_1265986850_12">Los Angeles</span> ranked at number 47.</p>
              <p>Zimbabwe’s capital Harare scored the least, making it the list’s worst city, with a rating of 37.5.</p>
