              <p>Overall, the Shanghai Expo is worth visiting as it showcases 200+ countries and many of China's various provinces have their own pavillion too.  There are also electronic cars/ buses being used, impressive multi-media performances, and cultural shows.  The Single-Day fare is Rmb160 (for whole day) or Rmb90 for night visits.  There are 3-time visit fares and 7-time visit fares, but I cannot remember the prices.</p>
              <p>What do you mean 'competitor'?  For what?</p>
              <p>I have a strange feeling the LKY's 10-Day to visit to China and Japan has something to do with Dr Goh KS's wake - I somehow make a connection there.  I am being speculative of course.  LKY may be bantang and probably his feng shui master has asked him to avoid such occasions this year!  Hahaha.</p>

              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p>It has been really long again... I bring to you today a
              field report.</p>
              <p>Just some updates from the <strong>Shanghai Expo 2010</strong> that I visited a few days ago.  The Singapore Pavillion was a
              shame, no contents, no display of our strengths, no Merlion, just a
              super long screen with a 7-minute song showing four of our singers
              - Stephanie Sun, Cai Jian Ya, J Lim adn A-Toh and some Singapore
              scenes.</p>
              <p>Very disappointing....why o why would so little budget be spent
              on such an important event???!!!!</p>
              <p>Even Thailand had a better show, and Japan was so
              impressive!!  Oh we did better than a few countries in
              Polynesia though...they had a few booths with some handicrafts.</p>

              <p>still talking about 5 c?</p>
              <p>too many credit cards make money management a bit difficult.</p>
              <p>my office in robinson road, wife office in orchard road, MRT is more convenient. Children take school bus. Car would be nice for family outting, but at the present price, taxi is more economic and convenient.</p>
              <p>Grow up in kampong, LANDED, still cannot appreciate the beauty of Condos. 5 room HDB is more value for money.</p>
              <p>With the above, I already have more cash for other things.</p>
              <p>Country Club? yes, I need one, to play golf and for my family in the week end. Lucky I bought the membership early. This is the C i keep, not looking for more, not an objective in life.</p>
              <p>it is good to acknowledge that concentrating on 5 c is a mistake, but what is the new focus?</p>
              <p>my focus:</p>
              <p>i) Family: quality time together with wife, and children.</p>
              <p>ii) Financial planning: especially investment and insurance, for the rainning days.</p>
