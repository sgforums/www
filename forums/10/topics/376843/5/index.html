              <p>With the amount of bad mouthing by the noisy pussy towards Oz,

              <p>It will be comforting for those who
              have already entered Oz, to know that the noisy

              pussies.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if only the noisylion will just admit itself to be a
              real "pussy" - and a noisy one, perhaps it maybe
              considered to be less of a threat and more compatible with the

              <p>FYI, the French are having a really bad time now, and suicides are at record high.  The global economic crisis is affecting everyone badly there, and to me the social welfare system as it is cannot sustain for too long.</p>

              <p>hi Lionoasis,</p>
              <p>I have lived outside SG for the last 17 years. I been in various cities around Asia all these years. Recently, I asked myself a similar question: "Should I re-settle back to SG?" And I started a thread in SG'reans Overseas forum last month to chat about this. Recently, I was back in SG for a holiday for about 2 week. I talked to many old friends, relatives, taxi drivers, and others. Just to get a sense of their views about life in SG.</p>
              <p>Although its by no means a scientific or representative survey, my own feel from all the conversations I had was that many of them felt that SG was a "passable" place to live.</p>
              <p>"Passable" meaning that the pros generally outweight the cons. Some of the pros included stuff like relatively comfortable living environment, safe, straight forward way of doing business, nice food, forward thinking government that is good in planning …. Some of the cons include higher and higher costs of living while incomes remain stagnant, boring place because everywhere seem so sterile and artificial, more and more foreigners, "world-class" public transport that often falls short of standards, govt that is so self patronizing thinking that they are the best and constantly justifying their own policies, govt who seems to be more and more out of touch with grassroots, reservist obligations, etc……</p>
              <p>The list of "complains" were long, but what I gathered was that people felt that the generally comfortable standard of living was probably why they stay although the place was far from perfect. Plus even more importantly, the place was familiar to them, and they have their families and friends here. Changing to a brand new environment was just too troublesome, too much factors to consider, too great a change…. It seems "impossible" and so they stayed...</p>
              <p>Then I start to wonder if my original question should not be "Should I re-settle back to SG?". Maybe it was the wrong question to ask.....</p>
              <p>Rather it should be "Should I give up my nomadic lifestyle and settle down in one place?" I have lived in different cities, and perhaps I was simply tired of having to move every few years. But then if I settle down to one place on a more permanent basis, I am beginning to feel that the place need not be in SG after all. Having left SG for this length of time, I actually feel a bit alienated about SG and wondered if I will ever fit in again… I have even lost touch with some of the singlish and some of the words were lost on me during those conversations! And I was a bit embarrassed to clarify!</p>
              <p>All the moving around different places all these years have expose me to different cultures and way of life, but it has also made me a permanent foreigner or alien to all places. It’s a sad realization for me… It seems I have been to many places without actually belonging there! I don't feel rooted anywhere!</p>
              <p>So if I do change my question to "Should I give up my nomadic lifestyle and settle down in one place?", then of course the next logical question will be "where will you go!?" which is the question of your thread, TS. It has now become the real question for me…. For me, the search continues......</p>

              <p>Here's my life.</p>
              <p>I pride myself as a global citizen, working in global positions out of Singapore for the past 7 years. During this period, I had the privilege to work in different countries and experience the lifestyle and culture over there.</p>
              <p>Recently, I have relocated to USA to work for an international institution.</p>
              <p>I have always been proud of been a Singaporean. In fact, I regard myself being able to get through the gruelling interviews to obtain the coveted position, something that I have done Singapore proud.</p>
              <p>However, I disagree that we should stay in Singapore because its our motherland. I feel that because Singapore is so small, its very difficult to experience many things properly. If there is an opportunity, we should really go out and experience life. And even overseas, we are able to do Singapore proud (by being excellent in whatever we do).</p>
              <p>However, I have negative views of our Govt. Being in the global arena, you sort of realized they are overselling their capabilities (in order to justifty their exhorbidant types of $$$ salary), when there are so many people out here much more intelligent than them, and earning a big deal less than them.</p>
              <p>Also, Singapore job market is one that is ageist. Once you hit 40, the govt starts to psycho you that you are more stupid than before, and so should take up a job with lesser pay.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I choose to take the drastic step of relocation, to live a life of freedom, to not conform to the norms of what the Govt wants us to believe, in order to continue to furnish their exhorbidant $$$. I don't see it as me turning my back to Singapore, but as me choosing to have a better life.</p>

              <p>Ah....just when I wanted to give up coming to this site, you guys showed up!!  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Real sharing of experience" is few and far in between!!</span></strong></p>
              <p>Well, ScambledEggs, we are all different.  I have too, lived outside Singapore for 20 years, and as I approach mid 40's, it is time to plan not just for myself but for my family.  Singapore scores the highest in a few possible places of permanent living for me and my family.  Also I still sucker for things native, the shopping, tropical living, food, and yes, I feel safe in Singapore.  What is "strange" in my case is that while I love my country, I dun like most of the fellow citizens - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">major cultural differences</span></strong> (due to differences in exposure) is the reason why.  You will know what I mean for having lived outside for 17 years.</p>
              <p>Soul-Rage, hey, whatever works for you man!  I lived in the US for 5 years and though I enjoyed my time there, 2.5 years in Hawaii (Aloha! What you think?), I still didn't feel it was home.  Dun know where in the cycle of life you are at, but I will not choose the US (not saying you have made your choice) to settle down.  The US citizens have a serious mentality of supremacy (well flawed) and often can't help thinking they are the centre of the entire earth (most of them are rather ignorant as a global citizens).  The US healthcare system, diplomatic policies, financial system are major screw-ups.  Dun take it from me, ask an informed American.</p>
              <p>Thanks guys for sharing, we are free to make our own choices, as long as we choose because we <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WANT TO</span></strong> not because we <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HAVE TO</strong></span>...</p>

              <p><br>Well, being out of Singapore for a long time, I guess you have the experience to say that Singapore is best for you, and that's something I respect.</p>
              <p>What I do not respect, are people in Singapore who have not seen the world, but insist that Singapore is the best place, NOT because they actually believe in it, but because they cannot leave the place. It's like a "Beggars can't be choosers" kind of mentality, therefore they self-delude themselves that Singapore is where they want to be. There are a couple of such people in this forum, based on my readings of their postings. Worse is, they start labelling others who leave the country as "quitters".</p>
              <p>Bear in mind that our ancestors were also "Quitters" from China, India, etc. Labelling Singaporeans who do not stay in Singapore as "Quitters" is tentamount to insulting our own ancestors (That's something I cannot tolerate the PAP for introducing such a term)</p>
              <p>People who dare to leave the country to go into new situations are actually very capable people who can endure hardship, pressure, etc in order to seek a better life. At the very least, they have guts.</p>
              <p>People who don't dare (not able) to leave the country, and start commenting on those who leave, are to me, like the old aunties at the void deck, very NATO (No Action Talk Only)</p>
              <p>Anyway, I respect you for moving out to experience the world, and then make a decision on where to settle down (back in Singapore). There is no right or no wrong, just choices. And we live with the consequence of our choices.</p>
              <p>I haven't really decided where to settle down actually. Could be USA, could be Australia, could even be Singapore in the end. But, at the very least, I am living my life fully.</p>

              <p>And just wanted to add to Lionoasis statement below:</p>
              <p>"The US citizens have a serious mentality of supremacy (well flawed) and often can't help thinking they are the centre of the entire earth (most of them are rather ignorant as a global citizens)."</p>
              <p>You will be surprised that for us Singaporeans, quite a few are also ignorant as global citizens. Sometimes, we are worse than the Americans. Interestingly, I have seen Singaporeans behaving like a Chihuahua (small little country, still think we are elites and supreme), barking very loudly for a small little dog.</p>
              <p>Just reading global news doesn't make us global citizens. What I see as global citizens are those who have truly interacted with people across nationalities, cultures, etc, and have truly come to understand how to work amongst the global community.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: And the fact that so many can accept the sort of exhorbidant pay that our leaders have, emphasizes the point that many are not global. They cannot see that it is completely ridiculous paying an engineer, etc 5-6 times more than the market rate.</p>

              <p>Anyway, I respect you for moving out to experience the world, and then make a decision on where to settle down (back in Singapore). There is no right or no wrong, just choices. And we live with the consequence of our choices.</p>
              <p>I haven't really decided where to settle down actually. Could be USA, could be Australia, could even be Singapore in the end. But, at the very least, I am living my life fully.</p>

              <p>By the same token (about people who have not lived outside Singapore adn think we are the Best), there are people who have not seen how the other governments function in other countries &amp; how chaotic their social systems are, and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">yet</span></strong> they criticize our very own day in day out, putting our country &amp; government down like they know what they are saying.</p>
              <p>If you are looking for insanity, the phenomenon mentioned above is one good example,  and you will find many of such examples here.  No disrespect to Jason - supposedly the person who started this website, but advertisement fees apart, this site fails to attract forumers with real substance, generally speaking.</p>
              <p>To make informed &amp; responsible critiqe is one thing; but to whin for the sake of whinning, is just distasteful.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>For starters, try watching <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fahreinheit 911 &amp; Sicko</span></strong> - by Michael Moore.  These two films will open your eyes to how the US functions.</p>
              <p>Not to ruine your dream, there are good schools there, but having good schools &amp; how that society functions are two different things...</p>
              <p>Good Luck!!</p>
