              <p>Special provisions should be created to cater this group's needs.  May be 5-10% of the Ministers' pay?  Okay, we make it 100% tax deductible and call it the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Ministers' Aged Fund</span></strong>.  Jokes aside, if they can do this &amp; LHL can champion this, I am sure this will leave a good taste amongst Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>You may wanna try other places, if you are that young, you should not stay in the comfort zone.  Nonetheless, I am not saying you give up everything and start afresh elsewhere, but it is worth to try out other coutries for exposure/ opportunities.  Speaking from personal experience and I hear the same from fellow Singaporeans, living abroad have broadened their perspectives, and this can only be good for one.</p>
              <p>I will probably experience cultural differences when I return home, but I am glad of this difference.</p>

              <p>You may wanna try other places, if you are that young, you
              should not stay in the comfort zone.  Nonetheless, I am not
              saying you give up everything and start afresh elsewhere, but it is
              worth to try out other coutries for exposure/ opportunities. 
              Speaking from personal experience and I hear the same from fellow
              Singaporeans, living abroad have broadened their perspectives, and
              this can only be good for one.</p>
              <p>I will probably experience cultural differences when I return
              home, but I am glad of this difference.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the suggestion.  I may just do that, if I have the time.  See, I have encountered too many crap talkers and wannabe political anal-ysts..., and just feel too frustrated to share these days.  Eg. Angel7030 is one of the forumers I do not wish to see here..., on the other hand Atobe is someone I like to talk to because I benefit so much from reading his/ her posts - whether I agree with all of them is a different thing.</p>
              <p>Recently (say one week), strangely, people who write it seem to be more mature and sensible.  Last week, I almost gave up coming back ...</p>
              <p>May be, I am just not suited to the online community, it is a whole lot different culture all together...</p>

              <p>not all countries are alike ...............luckily we are living on planet earth and not some advanced civilisation thats able to clone everything alike.savings interests rates,housing prices,salaries and food prices are  vastly different from country to country....and so are their politicAL systems and scheme of things.i would rather go find a place where everyone can retreat n recuperate n reconsolidate resources in a battle than to perish altogether in a battle.there is a difference between winning( staying alive),losing(not staying alive) and trying to have a chance to win (and also staying alive).</p>
              <p>fightting with problems on familiar grounds depends on the complexity of the person involved ........like some people are able to fight in arctic conditions and in tropical jungles.its the training involved and past experience.its all in the training n experience of the individual to fight with present problems and on how to handle them.</p>

              <p><br>To him, all who leave Singapore are traitors to the country. Even though he does not say it outright, his postings show otherwise.</p>
              <p>Perhaps he is one who have tried to leave before, but having failed to do so, has become very grouchy about it.</p>
              <p>But then again, I was not forced to leave Singapore. I have a high level position in Singapore, just that I wanted to try out new challenges, and relocation and working overseas are tougher challenges to me, which I had wanted to try out.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, I was too comfortable, I needed to do something out of my comfort zone in order to mature even more. At the same time, I was voting with my feet against the PAP, to break free from the suppressed wages in Singapore that they have imposed, to be free.</p>
              <p>Many things are cheaper over here, and wages much higher over here than in Singapore</p>

              <p><br>Agree</p>
              <p>There is a term called self-delusion as well, where an individual deludes himself that he is better than everyone else, or thinks that his way is 100% correct, and all others 100% wrong.</p>
              <p>One tell-tale sign of a person in delusion is that only he himself thinks he is right, and everyone else condemns him, AND he DOES NOT realize it</p>
