              <p><br>My perspective is, we have at most 3 generations living in Singapore to this day since independence. Perhaps its not long enough to build a sense of belonging yet.</p>
              <p>At the same time, our immigrant policies are too liberal, thus continuously adding strain to the local communities that has not fully established the roots yet.</p>
              <p>LKY also removed dialect, which kinda aided in keeping dialect groups closely knitted together. His intention was good (to try to knit everyone in Singapore together thru English and the common 2nd language), but the results are probably not what he had envisioned.</p>
              <p>To me, Singaporeans (for those who have grasped the opportunity to move overseas) are in a strong position to adapt, because we are not too comfortable with our country as yet (no deep roots entrenched)</p>
              <p>Of course, the education system then works the opposite direction. It encourages Singaporeans to follow a rigid system, and therefore we may not be as flexible.</p>
              <p>Still, I continue to stand by my opinion that we Singaporeans have the ability to adapt to any situation, given the opportunity. With both good English and Mandarin, we are able to traverse both the East and the West.</p>

              <p>Hello everyone!</p>
              <p>I found this forum on the 1st of December this year and thought what a nifty place to be, to able to have a debate or a discussion about the place where I was born and grew up! Disappointedly, after a mere few days, I discovered that neither the place nor the people have ever changed for the better. Rather, the sniping amongst one another still exists. What's worse, here in this forum where all of us should be able to "debate" and tell each other stories of our living experiences in Singapore or overseas.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying all of us are the same, but when will some of you ever grow up and treat each other in a civil way? I wonder!! Why aren't you lots happy at all and have no sense of patriotism towards your homeland I read Soul Rage enquire!!!!</p>
              <p>Well just think of yourselves as two banks of the same canal, they run parallel with one another, and yet remain so very, very far apart.</p>
              <p>Nothing has altered, nothing has changed. Nothing! It's still a question of abstract proletarian consciousness, of abstract proletarian consiousness, while the dialectical aspects of the matter............................</p>

              <p>Dear mate,</p>
              <p>you haven't been long enough in this forum to realize that there are many houseflies in the forums. But you should really focus on the positives.</p>
              <p>There are those that bothered to think, analyze and write, like Atobe, Arapahoe, Lionoasis, Gedanken, Stevenson101, eagle, Genesis, just to name a few, etc</p>
              <p>There are also those who would support Singapore staunchly, such as xtreyier and sgdiehard. Though I disagree with most of their opinions (given the fact, I have anti-PAP views, and thus we butt heads most of the time), at least they write with passion and their postings can be seen to have proper thoughts in them.</p>
              <p>It's also what makes it fun to debate, when people have differences in opinions, and share them out with one another. Of course, try not to let it become too personal (though I acknowledge I myself can't control at times, calling xtreyier a dumbass and he calling me a madman).</p>
              <p>If you stay a little longer, you will realize that there are those who think and write well. Singaporeans ain't as bad as you think. Of course, at the end of the day, it's your decision, and I respect that.</p>

              <p>Ultimately, he probably feels that the no. of houseflies outweigh those that think, that results in his personal conclusion.</p>
              <p>And since this thread is started by him, I deem it his right to make his own personal conclusion here. Sure, he probably forgot to add certain assumptions, but we all made mistakes in our postings anyway (and learn as we go along).</p>
              <p>Personally, if I ask him about myself, "do you think I cannot adapt?", he will probably answer no, he would feel that I adapt pretty well, given my stints in Europe and USA. But he will still stick to his conclusion that the majority of Singaporeans cannot adapt well. And that's his own opinion.</p>
              <p>Of course, I can see that you feel he is pushing his opinion on others, and it may seem that he feels there is no need for others to try, since we are not adaptable anyway.</p>
              <p>Still, as this is a debating forum, it should be left to each individual to agree or disagree with his views.</p>

              <p><br>good good. So let's skip that disagreement.</p>
              <p>Anyway going on with other experiences. There are quite a no. of Singaporeans living around my area over here. The Singapore Embassy tries to encourage us to get together during National Day and Chinese New Year. Haven't been to one yet, but I intend to go next year and see how it turns out.</p>
              <p>I heard that quite a no. of fellow countrymen will go to those events, and will make an effort to go and check it out and see how things turn out there.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I do not make an extra effort to locate Singaporeans and try to forge bonds. My opinion is that I have the ability to forge bonds with everyone, regardless of race, language, or religion :p (Another strength from our education, to be comfortable with everyone regardless of differences, as was highlighted in our national pledge)</p>
              <p>But if I do meet a Singaporean, and we start speaking, usually, it's quite a happy event coz we can always chat about something in common (NS, roti prata, PAP, etc).</p>

              <p><br>good good. So let's skip that disagreement.</p>
              <p>Anyway going on with other experiences. There are quite a no. of Singaporeans living around my area over here. The Singapore Embassy tries to encourage us to get together during National Day and Chinese New Year. Haven't been to one yet, but I intend to go next year and see how it turns out.</p>
              <p>I heard that quite a no. of fellow countrymen will go to those events, and will make an effort to go and check it out and see how things turn out there.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I do not make an extra effort to locate Singaporeans and try to forge bonds. My opinion is that I have the ability to forge bonds with everyone, regardless of race, language, or religion :p</p>
              <p>But if I do meet a Singaporean, and we start speaking, usually, it's quite a happy event coz we can always chat about something in common (NS, roti prata, PAP, etc).</p>

              <p>In my early years in Shanghai (1993-94), whenever I heard Singlish, I would take a keen interest in that voice and the person behind that voice.  These days, I keep quiet and dun bother to strike any conversations.  There are around 20k Singaporeans in the greater Shanghai (if I remember correctly) region, and sometimes in certain places, it feels like a mini Singapore.</p>
              <p>The situation in Shanghai is that most who have stayed here for more than 1-2 years dun attend such events, unless they are the committee members or SSBA (Shangai-Singapore Business Association) personnel.</p>
              <p>Dun know the situation in US these days, but having lived there 5 years myself, the Singapore experience could be better given that you are in a PURE western environment, and anything Singapore is very refreshing.  I am sure most people will feel liberated and that the invisible ceiling has been lifted, yeah?  It was for me too.  But towards my last 12 months there (my 5th year), I had a strong feeling that I didn't belong there, and felt very home sick.</p>
              <p>Now that I have spent 16 years in China, I am feeling home sick once again.  You have heard this before.</p>

              <p><br>Good that you can find what you want over there.  Whether you choose to return home to Singapore, nothing should stop you from loving this country.  But you alrady know that.</p>
              <p>Back in my days there, pre-internet and 3G phone (or 1 G for crying out loud), what I found appealing was the playboy channel, strip clubs, the opened culture, atmosphere that was in the air, access to many of the books and training courses (as most of these things originated from there) etc etc...</p>
              <p>Have not returned to the west for almost 20 years now.  Will travel there next year when my things are more settled.  Will take up your offer...thanks.</p>
