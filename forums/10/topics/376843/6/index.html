              <p>Hi sgdiehard,</p>
              <p>Thank you, I am relieved to have met in this forum a few rational &amp; mature ones.  I guess this is the problem with online forums, people either live in their alter ego (thus not needing to feel responsible for their actions or words - revealing their true selves), or probably  - and I am making an overly general statement here - people like to use websites as their prime source of releasing their frustrations.  Anyway, responsible people are rare in both the real &amp; virtual world.</p>
              <p>"Age" could be another determinant as majority of web surfers tend to be under 30's, thus the type of comments we see here and in other places.</p>
              <p>Can't help you with schools as my children are still in pre-school.  If you are in China, what I have been told is some  elementary and senior schools have opened up foreign language teaching (with expatriate faculties) &amp; joint certs with foreign schools.  There are a few good ones in Shanghai adn Beijing; forget secondary cities as the expatriate communities have not reached critical mass - thus such "spin-off's" are not possible.</p>
              <p>I choose to return home as our school curiculum is not that bad. What I worry is for my children to fall into the "typical" Singaporean value system, and I am not a big fan of that.  You can see what challenge that is gonna be... Well we dun live in a perfect world.</p>
              <p>Sorry could not comment much for schools... :(</p>

              <p>I'd say there's a good chance I will migrate in the future, but only if I don't get treated as a second-class citizen or get snubbed wherever I go. But that's not going to happen. Well, not at least in the near future. </p>
              <p>So it does look like I've got no other choice but to stay put in Singapore, but if that is going to be the case for the rest of my life, I certainly would expect more benefits to be allocated to citizens like us, rather than for the government to treat PRs and foreigners as "equals". After all, if I am not a priority in my own country, then I'd rather move to places like the US, Beijing, Moscow.. wherever, as long as I don't stay in a place which does not feel like home. </p>
              <p>Point to the government: Make us feel at home! And it will be greatly appreciated. </p>

              <p>Hi Lionoasis,</p>
              <p>I really enjoy this post.  It begs the question about the future for a Singaporean who is working or studying overseas.  I have lived 1/3 of my life in UK now, since graduating from University I have now worked in England for about 5 years.</p>
              <p>Most Singaporeans will find that it's difficult to migrate overseas and work.  The reality of the situation is that it's really the mindset of the person on whether he/she will do whatever it takes to make a life for his/herself overseas.  To me, I feel that the education system in Singapore is far superior to most countries, and when Singaporeans study overseas they tend to stand out in class and end up as top students.  Singaporeans in UK spend 100% of their time studying only at University while most Brits have to work part time to supplement their lifestyle and school fees.  Therefore the trend is quite obvious in most universities in UK, and that Singaporeans who do very well will find it easier to acquire jobs based their superior grades and final degree classification.</p>
              <p>I have acquired a job for a major aircraft manufacturer in England and have worked here for a good 5 years.  Based on my current job, the salary, holidays and working hours a week, it's really difficult give up for a job in Singapore.  The UK goverment has also made it a requirement for companies in UK to pay for maternity leave for both men (2 weeks) and women (9 months full pay, 3 months half pay).  The life in Europe is totally different from Singapore. There is the countryside to visit on the weekends and most parts of Europe are also easily accessible from England with the budget flights.</p>
              <p>However I have reached a point where I have to question my responsibility to my parents.  Both my sister (in Oz) and I are working overseas, and in very good positions and with good salaries.  I feel it's part of my responsibility as a son to return to look after the folks when they retire next year (since my sis will never return).  Therefore I will be looking at job opportunities in Asia next year and give up a good career in Europe.  </p>
              <p>However I would have to say that Singapore will not be on top of my list.</p>

              <p>I really enjoy this post.  It begs the question about the future for a Singaporean who is working or studying overseas.  I have lived 1/3 of my life in UK now, since graduating from University I have now worked in England for about 5 years.</p>
              <p>Most Singaporeans will find that it's difficult to migrate overseas and work.  The reality of the situation is that it's really the mindset of the person on whether he/she will do whatever it takes to make a life for his/herself overseas.  To me, I feel that the education system in Singapore is far superior to most countries, and when Singaporeans study overseas they tend to stand out in class and end up as top students.  Singaporeans in UK spend 100% of their time studying only at University while most Brits have to work part time to supplement their lifestyle and school fees.  Therefore the trend is quite obvious in most universities in UK, and that Singaporeans who do very well will find it easier to acquire jobs based their superior grades and final degree classification.</p>
              <p>I have acquired a job for a major aircraft manufacturer in England and have worked here for a good 5 years.  Based on my current job, the salary, holidays and working hours a week, it's really difficult give up for a job in Singapore.  The UK goverment has also made it a requirement for companies in UK to pay for maternity leave for both men (2 weeks) and women (9 months full pay, 3 months half pay).  The life in Europe is totally different from Singapore. There is the countryside to visit on the weekends and most parts of Europe are also easily accessible from England with the budget flights.</p>
              <p>However I have reached a point where I have to question my responsibility to my parents.  Both my sister (in Oz) and I are working overseas, and in very good positions and with good salaries.  I feel it's part of my responsibility as a son to return to look after the folks when they retire next year (since my sis will never return).  Therefore I will be looking at job opportunities in Asia next year and give up a good career in Europe.  </p>
              <p>However I would have to say that Singapore will not be on top of my list.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>15 posts in 4 years and this thread is one of the few you actually choose to post your comments - thank you.</p>
              <p>Glad to hear that you are having a good career in England.  Guess to have families  - siblings - living outside Singapore makes your decision to do the same (not sighting this is the basis of your decision) easier I guess.  But I am sure, you fnd life more fulfilling and the skies seem to be more opened there in England.  More than 20 years ago, I had the same experience when I was living and working in the US and thought Singapore was "NOT HAPPENING" - of course the playboy channel &amp; strip bars helped hahaha.</p>
              <p>I live in China now and the country seems to feel very upbeat and everyone is motivated to make more money, not to mention China being a huge country; compared to Singapore's gloomy sentiment amongst most people, this again is a strong contrast.</p>
              <p>For a driven businessman and ambitious individual like me, one wonders why Singapore?  Well you mentioned one key word - MindSet, and this is what I have been advocating in my threads, or at least I try to share.</p>
              <p>Good luck and I know you will not forget Singapore though it is not your top choice.</p>

              <p>Yeah...the standard of living in Singapore is definitely high and it has crossed my mind as well.  The heathcare expenses are gonna cost a bomb, and this is where I think most improvement is needed.  I am also not impressed by the common "money face" doctors these days.</p>
              <p>However, I told myself, if Singapore's problems are not isolated, meaning I will see the same things elsewhere, I rather tackle the issues where I am a familiar with, and where I am a native.  But this is my take, not necessarily yours...</p>
