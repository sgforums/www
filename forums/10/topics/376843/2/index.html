              <p>On the contrary, I have been married for 12 years, and
              family life is my top priority.</p>
              <p>My feelings towards my country is because Singapore IS my
              country.  As the Russians like to put it - motherland. <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong> It is a love-hate relationship.  I have no doubt whatsoever
              that our country has problems, as I have mentioned repeatedly in my

              disapproves my simplest of requests, or fail to appreciate the
              sacrifices I mak for her, NO.  I think the basis of ALL
              relationships is compassion and forward-looking, why should our

              <p>Am I a big fan of PAP, or LKY or LHL or GIC?  Hell
              NO.  I just choose not to complain that much and seek to
              understand and if possible something about it, but not getting
              myself politically involved.</p>
              <p>Again, I choose to return home not because Singapore is so
              perfect, it is because it is MY COUNTRY, that's all.  No need

              <p>must my reasons be political? of being illtreated as a citizen? of being neglected as a citizen? can they not be of personal preference?<br><br>if i am a nature lover, i would leave the country because of its lack of nature, its inexistent seasons, its abundance of concrete facade... i would love to live in a house, a proper one; not one of those pathetic apartment with windows that faces my neighbour's kitchen; a proper house, close to nature, by the sea, perhaps.</p>
              <p>if i am an avid driver, i would leave the country because of its regulations. I don't blame the government, but circumstance. I would hate paying outrageous sums of money (which includes the COE, radio taxes, and such) for a Subaru Impreza then have nowhere to drive to because it takes a mere hour to travel across the width of this island. Or own a 4WD i cannot use off road.</p>
              <p>and what if i hate the country's culture? what if i hate the monotonous cycle repeated every day? i hate being packed like sardines in a can when i go to work; i hate seeing people not giving up their seats - and no one doing anything about it; i hate it when singaporeans accidentally tread on your foot and not apologize, but pretend as if nothing has happened; i hate going home, then realize that singapore-produced dramas are cmi and there's nothing i can do about it because the network is just another monopoly; i hate bringing work home because competition with this new china-imported employee - a colleague in the same department, no less - is so stif; i hate getting beaten to college scholarships by a math genius from india.</p>
              <p>but this is my country after all; do i go ahead on the pursuit of happiness or should i stay and be loyal?</p>

              <p><br>I can share with you what went through my mind a long time ago...</p>
              <p>Being educated in the US (and worked &amp; given a social security number), and had the chance to know there was no ceiling to what we could do, I opted out because the whole country is very messed up.</p>
              <p>Canada was too cold and laid back.</p>
              <p>Non Ang Moh countries that would give us Sinaporeans a similar lifestyle would be Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea &amp; Japan.  HK would not work for me, as the city is too cramped, and people too materialistic (&amp; busy trying not to loose out by very conforming fashion sense or career direction); Taiwan - a very confrontational country though we do find some of the nicest people there; Korea and Japan - forget it, though I love to travel to JPN and for its food, do you think they will really accept us?</p>
              <p>Then I looked at alternatives, Malaysia &amp; Thailand.  Well Malaysia's Bumi Butra ticks me off totally and Thailand is on a different planet, the mystical aspect is beautiful but not I cannot associate myself to it.</p>
              <p>Therefore, Singapore is where I belong.  Initially it was a choice by deduction (of possibilities) and now, it is choice of my heart and responsibility.  Yes RESPONSIBILITY, because I know I can contribute be it small or big, whether the government is screwed up or a good one.  I certainly have many questions to ask and I also feel angry when I see unreasonable policies, but since I am "stuck here", I will find ways to make changes within my means and influence.</p>
              <p>Again, good luck in your persuit of better places if you choose to go...</p>

              <p>Hi I can relate to what you have mentioned, about "ill treatments"....etc.</p>
              <p>Do you honestly think you will not be "ill treated" elsewhere?</p>
              <p>It is indeed sad if we feel alienated in our own country, but could it be the result of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">false expectation</span></strong> from our so called leaders?  What is in our rights is different from what eventually will be given to us.  I do not fantasize our leaders are genuinely dedicated to the country's cause, nor do I even imagine to sit down with them on a heart-to-heart talk.  In my other forums, I mentioned my experience with a few Ministers, and I was not impressed; and their associates..., "ass kissers" is a term I would use.  So do I have a beautiful picture of my leaders?  Absolutely NOT.  Notice my other forum titles:</p>
              <p>Top 5 Questions you wanna ask d Government/ Is our government like the Titanic/ How do you rate our government from 1-10?  10 being perfect?</p>
              <p>These questions will tell you I have questions to ask of my government.  Yet I choose what I choose...</p>

              <p>Hi I can relate to what you have mentioned, about "ill

              <p>Do you honestly think you will not be "ill treated"
              elsewhere?</p>
              <p>It is indeed sad if we feel alienated in our own country, but
              could it be the result of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">false expectation</span></strong> from our so called leaders?  What is in our rights is
              different from what eventually will be given to us.  I do
              not fantasize our leaders are genuinely dedicated to the country's
              cause, nor do I even imagine to sit down with them on a
              heart-to-heart talk.  In my other forums, I mentioned my
              experience with a few Ministers, and I was not impressed; and their
              associates..., "ass kissers" is a term I would use.  So
              do I have a beautiful picture of my leaders?  Absolutely
              NOT.  Notice my other forum titles:</p>

              <p>Where will I go...hmmm..I guess it depends on the situation at hand.</p>
              <p>If I were to retire, I think Singapore would not be a bad choice, since I was born there, and would hopefully still have some family alive for company. The healthcare system in SG is still top notch, even the gov-system is extremely effective. Also, by the time I retire, I believe I can afford at least a flat in SG, and since the cost of living is pretty low compared to other developed countries, it's still affordable. No need for a car also since the taxis are so cheap (compared to the US).</p>
              <p>If I were to chiong career, then I would say probably China, since there's alot of stuff going on there, and opportunities abound. However, I would have to tahan the lower standard of hygiene and graciousness. But hey, if I get to climb the corporate ladder, I can endure it for awhile.</p>
              <p>If I just want to ease on and coast through a job and life in general, the US is pretty comfy for that. The whole work-life balance awareness here is pretty good, but I'd say it really depends on the city you work in. US ppl here are also mostly oblivious to the material accomplishments of others, so there's no keeping up with the Jonses kind of deal like in SG. In the US, ppl respect you for what you do, not what you own. You could have loads of money but don't do squat with it, and ppl would think you're a loser. But if you're not rich, but have lots of stuff going on with your life, volunteering, travel, sports, etc., ppl will respect you. And of course, cars and houses are so cheap, so it doesn't cost much to be comfortable. Screw the whole thing going with the politics in this country. Just tune it out, just like if you were in SG.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents...</p>

              <p>because there is a difference between choosing to stay in a country, and actually belonging to one.and NO, it isnt a measure of your nett contribution to the country.</p>
              <p>In the case of a war, well... its like that.<strong> And thats why tons of citizens are complaining, as to why PRs can run free, while citizens defend the interest of despots and foreigners (who do not have any feeling towards sg, except for monetary incentives). </strong></p>
              <p>Regardless, im sure. If one feels compelled and belonged to their country, they will not hesitate to defend it, even if it means at the expense of their lives.</p>
              <p>so... in this case. Sg wouldnt be your home. As for instance. If someone were to invade your home(or any prized possesion of yours), im certain that you will not hesitate to defend it at all costs.</p>
              <p>which again, links back to my point of the degree of abuse which the citizens have been facing. lol. ok somehow i think its funny that everything connects.</p>

              <p>In the case of a war, well... its like that. <strong>And thats why tons of citizens are complaining, as to why PRs can run free, while citizens defend the interest of despots and foreigners (who do not have any feeling towards sg, except for monetary incentives).</strong></p>
              <p>Regardless, im sure. If one feels compelled and belonged to their country, they will not hesitate to defend it, even if it means at the expense of their lives.</p>
              <p>so... in this case. Sg wouldnt be your home. As for instance. If someone were to invade your home(or any prized possesion of yours), im certain that you will not hesitate to defend it at all costs.</p>
              <p>which again, links back to my point of the degree of abuse which the citizens have been facing. lol. ok somehow i think its funny that everything connects.</p>

              <p>There are different levels of passion and it does not take the deepest of passions to convince oneself to pick a home.  Thus, my unwillingness to pick up a rifle is not an indication of my devotion to my choice.  Put in another way, I love my family more than I love my country, I think most people are the same, and I will be more inclined to risk my life for the former than the latter.</p>
              <p>If you are comparing a PR and a citizen, why not compare a Minister and a commoner?  Is that not a more relevant comparison?  They feed off our money, and are our leaders right?</p>
              <p>And will yor fight, serioously?</p>

              <p>Where will I go...hmmm..I guess it depends on the situation at

              <p>If I were to retire, I think Singapore would not be a bad
              choice, since I was born there, and would hopefully still have some
              family alive for company. <span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>T</strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>he healthcare system in SG is still
              top notch, even the gov-system is extremely effective.</strong></span></span> Also, by the
              time I retire, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I believe I can afford at least a flat in SG</strong></span>, and<span style="color: #339966;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> since the cost of living is pretty low compared to other developed
              countries</strong></span></span>, it's still affordable. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #800080;">No need for a car also since the

              <p>Have you wondered why the health-care system is top notch, how about the fund? Where does the govt get them from.?</p>
              <p>Cost of living low compared to other developed countries? Surveys show otherwise. In a recent survey posted on TOC, it shows the buying power of singaporean workers are  among the lowerst as compared to other developed countries. (its a survey about the amt of working hours req to purchase an ipod, and other grocery prices, compared with other countries.)</p>
              <p>Lastly.. transport. Ok. what you've stated seriously makes no sense at all.</p>
              <p>You can buy a chrysler 300C 2nd hand at just 3 years old for $9000, and do note that you keep the car for life, instead of in sg, after 10 years, it'll most probably be in the dump. Try doing that in sg.</p>
