              <p>Are you now presuming to tell me what real life is?</p>
              <p>In REAL life, CEOs and other executives base multimillion-dollar decisions and form government policies based upon information that I provide to them.  If I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't</span> apply this degree of precision to my message, then I won't be invited again.  But that's just my professional environment.  I'd like to hear how you can justify being so sloppy about communication as to corrupt the message under any circumstances.</p>
              <p>I have a real problem with you playing fast and loose with what you say, and then talking out the other side of your mouth and asking other people for well-thought-out posts without returning the courtesy.  That's just plain rude, and a sure sign that you're playing to your own agenda rather than objectively asking for people's input as you've claimed to do.</p>
              <p>You state that your aim is to get other people to share their experiences of living overseas, but then you proceed to tell everyone about how <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> experiences lead to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> conclusion that there's no better place to stay than Singapore, with little if any regard to what other people have written if it doesn't fit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> agenda.</p>
              <p>Sorry to spoil your little party here, but that's just rubbish and a clear case of intellectual dishonesty.  Don't go asking for well-thought-out posts - ask for only posts that fit your world view.  At least that way you'll be honest.</p>

              <p>You are probably a detailed but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not intelligent person</span></strong>.  It is rather clear that you cannot differentiate between social forum and business presentation.  Though we still seek quality posts, the level of intensity should be adjusted accordingly.</p>
              <p>So you are a precise professional manager?  Get this, I <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AM</span></strong> the decision maker in the boardroom.  Ask soul_rage who knows my real name, and he can google about me and verify.  If my department heads behave like you, they dun go far with me, cause' they dun have the intelligence to differenciate relevant information from what is not.  And if they keep interrupting me with unimportant issues, I show them the door sooner or later.</p>
              <p>If your type of precision and consistency is to be applied in life, guess our government must have been lying.  Talks about we Singaporeans are hardworking, diligent and honest?!!  Oh my god, they forgot to qualify and use <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONSISTENTLY without fail</span></strong>, the word "most" or use percentages to reflect the real facts <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>throughout</strong></span> their statments!  How can the highest paid government in the world make such mistake???!!!</p>
              <p>Do you wanna suit them?</p>
              <p>I do invite different views, and soul_rage does not agree with me all the time, neither does Atobe, but it's ok.  I have praised these two forumers a few times becuase I get something out of my conversations with them.  But your sort of "difference" is not about views, it is sadly <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">based on misconceptions due to your "precise" angles!</span></strong></p>

              <p>Hello Lionoasis, I think your statement here is a bit unclear.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>"I remain that Singapore is the best place for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span></strong> Singaporeans because I don't see them settling down successfully in other countries - not because of competency or attitude towards work - but because we are culturally unadpatable; "</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What do your "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span></strong> Singaporean" refers? to those Singaporean who cannot "settle down successfully in other countries", they therefore find Singapore the best place? then the "<strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></span></strong>" Singaporean only refers to those who have ventured to live overseas.</p>
              <p>If the "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></strong> " Singaporeans refer to the Singaporean citizens, resident locally or temporarily outside, then those who have found their new home in other countries, and have given up Singaporean citizenship are not part of this.  and you need no statistic (just a little brain) to tell you  that "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span></strong> " Singaporean are comfortably living in Singapore, whether this is the best place or not.</p>
              <p> I don't think it is right to say that we don't migrate, or those who choose to return are "cultural unadaptable". The conditions for cultural adaptability differs from country to country, the need for cultural assimilation also varies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I really think Singaporeans in general are not adaptable in foreign land.  We have been living in a very orderly and efficient country for far too long.  Yes, we are paying the price of success, some may say.</p>
              <p>If people do return home, I won't know all the resons, but they will probably have complaints about  lifestyle, food and prospects problems.  I have sighted this as a reason, but you are free to have your views.</p>
              <p>Culture, by definition, is a collective way of life and believe systems.  My observation, is that we are uniquely positioned, such level of advancement (also fairly westernized)and in S.E.A., no where else do we find countries with similar parameters.  Not saying who is better or worse, but as Singaporeans (in general) who have been here all their lifes, one can imagine how difficult it will be for them to adopt a new culture, and I am cynical about this.</p>
              <p>Does this answer your questions?</p>

              <p>You see, YOU are the unintelligent one here.  The pertinent point here is that what you say is rubbish because you can't decide what you're talking about, but you choose to chase after red herrings and turn this into a laughable "whose dick is bigger" exercise instead.  My oh my, how many business deal have you burned by thinking with your gonads and tying yourself up with irrelevancies, Mr Power-that-be? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Okay, okay, let's get back to the topic.  Given how utterly and completely flawed your methods of dealing with information are, your conclusion that Singapore is the best place to be is completely bunkum.  That's not to say that Singapore's a bad place to be by any stretch of the imagination - it's just that no conclusion you reach is sound.</p>

              <p>Culture, by definition, is a collective way of life and believe systems.  My observation, is that we are uniquely positioned, such level of advancement (also fairly westernized)and in S.E.A., no where else do we find countries with similar parameters.  Not saying who is better or worse, but as Singaporeans (in general) who have been here all their lifes, one can imagine how difficult it will be for them to adopt a new culture, and I am cynical about this.</p>
              <p>Does this answer your questions?</p>

              <p>honestly, home is ultimately the best place to live. i've been in sydney for 4 years, and its been overall a very lonely experience. the place is beautiful (lotsa nice parks), and the standard of living high, but what is the point of these things when your friends/family/relative are not close by. whats more there is still the inevitable racial prejudice. trust me, i'm speaking from a position of having lived in sydney for 4 years and counting. </p>
              <p>i'm returning to singapore at the next opportunity i can. in the meantime, i'm just making the best of what i have. </p>

              <p>What is wrong with comparisons? There are ranking reports on standards of living cost of living, etc between countries. So are you saying that we should ignore these comparisons?</p>
              <p>If a country refuse to look at data published about other countries in comparison to itself, then it is committing the same fatal flaw as a complacent corporation that does not track its competitors' progress closely. Now, THAT is idiotic.</p>

              <p>Dear Lionoasis and Gedanken,</p>
              <p>Do refrain from personal abuses of each other. In my opinion, both have your own valid views and sound observations, therefore I would hope that both take a step back and not get into further arguments that borders on personal detail and are pointless. Sometimes, it's the heat of debates that can turn two friends against each other. So try to refrain from that.</p>
              <p>Lionoasis, just a point to note about the forums. You do not need to prove who you are (though, yes, I know you are the decision maker). Leave it to others to determine what they want. It's not important. For example, some of those here claimed that I am lying about living in USA. It doesn't matter. It's not impt, coz from the postings I make, others can determine whether I am speaking the truth or not.</p>

              <p>I really think Singaporeans in general are not adaptable in
                  foreign land.  We have been living in a very orderly and
                  efficient country for far too long.  Yes, we are paying the
                  price of success, some may say.</p>
              <p>If people do return home, I won't know all the resons, but they
                  will probably have complaints about  lifestyle, food and
                  prospects problems.  I have sighted this as a reason, but
                  you are free to have your views.</p>
              <p>Culture, by definition, is a collective way of life and believe
                  systems.  My observation, is that we are uniquely positioned,
                  such level of advancement (also fairly westernized)and in S.E.A.,
                  no where else do we find countries with similar parameters. 
                  Not saying who is better or worse, but as Singaporeans (in general)
                  who have been here all their lifes, one can imagine how difficult
                  it will be for them to adopt a new culture, and I am cynical about
                  this.</p>

              <p>The only way to test out your theory is to put every Singaporean in a foreign country for a couple of years and record how they adapt.</p>
              <p>I'm sure we both know that the stituations and scenarios of which you, Arapahoe, Gedankan, soul_rage and pretty much most of the professionals working overseas  get to work in privileged positions overseas is rare for your cohort, or at least uncommon.</p>
              <p>Of course, i hold no statistics of actual numbers but i'd venture a guess that no more than half of your classmates are working in a similarly high position overseas.</p>

              <p>You could argue we're just not working as hard but that's like saying the Africans deserved what they're getting because they're dumb and lazy.</p>
              <p>I think it is extremely unfair to say we are incapable of adapting when we are not even able to have access to the same game as you have to prove that we are capable of it. </p>
              <p>Actually if you want to talk about inability to accept change, i would think the Japanese have an even harder time adjusting to new cultures considering the effort they put in to isolate themselves from the local population.</p>
              <p>Maybe i'm just ranting but gaining the opportunity to go overseas and test out our ability to adapt just isn't as easy for most of the population. And quite a few of us have personal responsibilities that just isn't easy to let go.</p>

              <p>Thank you for writing.  I would like to clarify that when I remarked about Singaporean's inadaptability, I was not making a comparison  between Singaporeans and people from other countries.  It was purely what I thought Singaporeans in general, would get themselves into, should they begin to presume settling life on other places is easy.  We live in a very orderly, clean and efficient city, and we are also cursed by the same pluses.</p>

              <p>Hi Stevenson101,</p>
              <p>before you continue with the assumptions, I would like to
              clarify some points in your post.</p>
              <p>I started off as a never-do-well. I am not like my brother who
              has scored straight As since primary school all the way to
              university. I only woke up sometime in my late teens when I
              realized I am not being responsible for my life</p>
              <p>My dad was a teacher, my mum a housewife. My family is
              considered probably middle-income, that's about it.</p>
              <p>I am a local grad like you. I am proud of it. I never joined the
              elite undergrad programs in university, even though the professor
              tried to get me to join the elitist program, which provides lots of
              additional benefits to those students. Instead, I championed the
              'ordinary' students' needs, maintaining that 'ordinary' students
              should not be discriminated against, and led a campaign to provide
              more support to the 'ordinary' students. And in the process,
              incurred the wrath of that professor. I aced my exams and was in
              the top 10% of the cohort, beating many of the elite students.</p>
              <p>The reason I am where I am today, is from my waking up to
              realize that I need to live my life responsibly and fully, to
              continuously challenge myself, and to grasp whatever opportunities
              that come my way. I am where I am today, after going through a
              gruelling interview process that involved virtual interviews, to
              flying over to do IQ/EQ tests that are even tougher than uni exams,
              and to do a one-day business test to verify the authencity of my
              skills and personality.</p>
              <p>I did not come here due to some connections (as forum member
              eagle will know), but from my own capabilities and
              opportunities.</p>
              <p>I highlight the above, not to validate my claims, but to let you
              know that I am not unlike you, that we share the same set of
              education (I was not in any gifted programs), and that I am an
              example of a 'normal' guy (in the govt's eyes) that has exceled in
              my career and have gone even further than any of those govt
              scholars.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, I just want to say, do not limit yourself
              because of your environment, but find a way out through observing
              the surroundings and finding opportunities for yourself. Given the
              nature of your postings, I can say that you have an analytical mind
              that has the potential to go far.</p>
              <p>In fact, Lionoasis is also not some high-flying govt scholar. He
              has gone thru many hardships to be where he is today. That was from
              my conversations I had with him outside of this forum.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Actually after reading my own post i realise that the choice of examples i've used is quite bad, making too much assumptions and leap of faiths. I apologize for that.</p>
              <p>It was never my intention to imply that either you, Lionoasis or any of the examples i've used are elite scholars. I was trying to make the point that saying Singaporeans are not adaptable is not a fair statement because it's just not something that's easily measurable and can't be verified unless we could somehow put a group of Singaporeans overseas and monitor them for a few years. </p>
              <p>But it is, of course his opinion. And there's nothing wrong in stating an opinion on something that's so difficult to measure. Perhaps i have overreacted but i detect the feeling that if we're not working and being successful in an overseas position we're somehow not being adaptable and incapable of integrating culturally.</p>
              <p>That is often a position that i've seen taken by a few who are overseas(true or not, i do not know), mocking the dumb Singaporeans who aren't able to succeed as they have and have to put up with the PAP government.</p>
              <p>If i have indeed misinterpreted what Lionoasis have said then i apologize again.</p>
              <p>It's not about limiting myself but i have personal responsibilities that makes it somewhat difficult to make big choices. The path just isn't as straightforward for a lot of us.</p>

              <p>Just some reference numbers for the states side.....</p>
              <p>I have spoken to Singapore overseas unit, they told me there are estimated singaporean in the states side about more than 6000 reside in NY state alone.</p>
              <p>While west coast in SFO alone is approximately more than 3000 and another few thousand in L.A.  that exclude SG population living in other major cities...</p>
              <p>And I have met singaporean who reside in the US for over 30 yrs and still visit singapore for various reasons.</p>
              <p>Just an observation</p>
              <p>What is unique characteristics about singaporean is that they tend to live more independently from another singaporean. While ethnics chinese from PRC, ROC, Korean have shown a tendency to live together and have their social network in the same vicinity/city.  </p>
              <p>once in a while i would bump into another singaporean in unusual places. So perharps it depend on which generation that seeked the change.</p>
