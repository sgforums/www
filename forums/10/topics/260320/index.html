            <div class='col-md body'>Salaam,<br><br>pls read the below article..<br><br><blockquote><br>All civilians living in Gaza are collectively guilty for Kassam attacks on Sderot, former Sephardi chief rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu has written in a letter to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.<br><br>Eliyahu ruled that there was <span style="color: red;">absolutely no moral prohibition against the indiscriminate killing of civilians during a potential massive military offensive on Gaza aimed at stopping the rocket launchings. </span><br><br>The letter, published in Olam Katan [Small World], a weekly pamphlet to be distributed in synagogues nationwide this Friday, cited the biblical story of the Shechem massacre (Genesis 34) and Maimonides' commentary (Laws of Kings 9, 14) on the story as proof texts for his legal decision.<br><br><span style="color: red;">According to Jewish war ethics, wrote Eliyahu, an entire city holds collective responsibility for the immoral behavior of individuals.</span> In Gaza, the entire populace is responsible because they do nothing to stop the firing of Kassam rockets.<br><br>The former <span style="color: red;">chief rabbi also said it was forbidden to risk the lives of Jews in Sderot or the lives of IDF soldiers for fear of injuring or killing Palestinian noncombatants living in Gaza. </span><br><br>Eliyahu could not be reached for an interview. However, Eliyahu's son, Shmuel Eliyahu, who is chief rabbi of Safed, said his father opposed a ground troop incursion into Gaza that would endanger IDF soldiers. Rather, he advocated carpet bombing the general area from which the Kassams were launched, regardless of the price in Palestinian life.<br><br><span class="large">"If they don't stop after we kill 100, then we must kill a thousand," said Shmuel Eliyahu. "And if they do not stop after 1,000 then we must kill 10,000. If they still don't stop we must kill 100,000, even a million. Whatever it takes to make them stop." </span><br><br>In the letter, Eliyahu quoted from Psalms. "I will pursue my enemies and apprehend them and I will not desist until I have eradicated them."<br><br>Eliyahu wrote that "This is a message to all leaders of the Jewish people not to be compassionate with those who shoot [rockets] at civilians in their houses."</blockquote>http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1180527966693&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull<br><br></div>

It is not said anywhere in the article that they are representative of the views of the majority or entirety of the Israeli population.<br><br>They are highlighted, yes, and I agree with you that this may be misleading to the casual reader. However, you and I may interpret the motive behind the highlighting and the posting differently. You might choose to impute against him certain unsavoury motives behind this posting, but I assure you that I find no surface evidence to reach such as conclusion as you, and hence I give the TS the benefit of the doubt.<br><br>The point of this topic, as I take it, is to show that there are extremist elements within the Israeli camp, just as there are extremist elements on the Palestinian side.<br><br>Well, I hope I have made my point clear, and that you will respect my views as much as I have respected yours, so that we can have an amicable and reasonable discussion on this topic, instead of degenerating into another flaming war.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sderot's mayor, Eli Moyal, demanded that the government send the army to reoccupy or destroy the Gaza town of Beit Hanoun, the area from which many Palestinian rockets are fired, if Sderot was to survive. "You have to choose," he told officials in the prime minister's office. "If you do not destroy Beit Hanoun, Sderot will become a ghost town. The people of this city cannot sustain any more Qassam attacks."<br><br>If someone attacks you do you say to yourself, Â“I will only throw two punches. If that doesnÂ’t work I hope my hospital stay is a short one.Â”<br><br>What would be YOUR response to two incoming Qassams to YOUR home<br>such as these? Consider yourself lucky? The Qassams have no specific address! You must be lucky if one of them lands in your home.<br><br><img src="http://img516.imageshack.us/img516/6643/32793228jo1.jpg"></div>
