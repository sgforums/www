But unlike you, I was not<br>raised<br>&gt; with a silver spoon in my mouth and grew up in the poorer quarters<br>of<br>&gt; Geylang.<br>&gt; The poverty of my youth has put the steel in my subsequent resolve<br>to<br>&gt; SPEAK UP FEARLESSLY on issues of public interest and concern.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I owe much to my illiterate but wise mother who taught me this<br>&gt; Cantonese saying at a very young age: "If what you SAY or DO are<br>the<br>&gt; RIGHT THINGS, you need not fear the LIGHTNING BOLT* striking you<br>&gt; dead." [*such as that depicted in the PAP logo!]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I studied hard and earned a place at Raffles Institution, where a<br>&gt; dedicated teacher also taught me this: "Do not be afraid TO SPEAK<br>UP<br>&gt; to RIGHT a WRONG."<br>&gt; [ I had also participated under the RI school contingent in our<br>very<br>&gt; first National Day Parade, having underwent many long hours of<br>&gt; training under the hot sun.]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I next earned a Colombo Plan scholarship to study at a British<br>&gt; university --- where I learnt how to think/analyse logically. So I<br>am<br>&gt; very clear in my mind that as a scholarship holder (whether Colombo<br>&gt; Plan or S'pore Govt), I am certainly beholden to SINGAPORE but<br>&gt; definitely not the PAP --- as the scholarship was not paid out of<br>PAP<br>&gt; party funds.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Upon receiving my degree, I returned to serve my full-time National<br>&gt; Service some 30 years ago. I went through rigorous training under<br>&gt; both roasting hot sun and drenching rain --- but found it to be no<br>&gt; big deal.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 2 (a) Over the past 30 years (more than half of my now 57 years), I<br>&gt; have written extensively to newspaper forums as well as directly to<br>&gt; politicians/bureaucrats --- mostly on education/social issues and<br>&gt; particularly issues of PUBLIC HEALTH and of PUBLIC SAFETY.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I may not be a Medical Doctor, but on the latter issues, I am well<br>&gt; read, well researched and speak with a STRONG SOCIAL CONVICTION.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (b) I had dared to speak up on subjects deemed "taboo" (to be swept<br>&gt; under the carpet and kept from public view) --- such as the disease<br>&gt; threat of AIDS and student suicides (with such "shameful" social<br>&gt; statistics: From 1997 - 2001, 20 primary students [ie under age 13]<br>&gt; have jumped to their deaths. Figures for 2002 onwards were<br>strangely<br>&gt; undisclosed! )<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Why should I bother to do so? --- which is probably what former PAP<br>&gt; MP Lau Ping Sum would have asked, until his own son tragically took<br>&gt; his life at a British university.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (c) Why should I speak up about public safety issues and persevered<br>&gt; OVER 4 LONG YEARS to finally "corner" the laid-back, bird-brained<br>&gt; bureaucratic buffoons at LTA to install the concrete safety<br>bollards<br>&gt; now seen at bus stops (to protect the daily countless<br>adults/students<br>&gt; who have to wait at such places) [Details at Annex A para 1]?<br>&gt; --- which is probably what former Snr Minister of State Peter Chen<br>&gt; would have asked, until his own wife died in a tragic accident<br>&gt; involving a heavy vehicle driven by a reckless driver.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (d) Mr Lee, why do I send you so many lengthy write-ups [with<br>&gt; detailed compelling arguments] on WHY our POLITICIANS/BUREAUCRATS<br>&gt; cannot afford to be COMPLACENT but MUST BE PRO-ACTIVE in the fight<br>&gt; against numerous emerging/re-emerging INFECTIOUS DISEASES (such as<br>&gt; SARS, Bird Flu, Superbugs, etc)?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Remember how your own mother had a close shave with SARS at S'pore<br>&gt; General Hospital? Likewise, your one precious daughter studying at<br>&gt; NUS when an NUS researcher was infected by SARS at the EHI<br>&gt; Laboratory? (He could have wandered around the campus and<br>&gt; cough/sneeze near her, right?)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (e) The following descriptions best sum up my experiences over 30<br>&gt; years in Speaking Up Openly and in dealing with our mostly laid-<br>back<br>&gt; public officials:<br>&gt; (i) "Talking to the Great Wall of China" in English.<br>&gt; (ii) "Vomitting Blood" in Cantonese.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (f) It is quite evident that, in supposedly First World Singapore,<br>&gt; our supposedly "World-Class" million-dollar ministers and<br>&gt; supposedly "First-Class" half-a-million dollar senior civil<br>servants<br>&gt; have yet to learn such invaluable lessons:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (i) 2004 Thai Government Bird Flu Hush-Up/Cover-Up Scandal.<br>&gt; The Nation editorial --- "....the government has been caught red-<br>&gt; handed in lying to the people..."<br>&gt; The Bangkok Post editorial --- ".... the government's efforts to<br>&gt; SWEEP THE PROBLEM UNDER THE CARPET have EXPLODED IN ITS FACE,<br>leaving<br>&gt; the poultry industry in tatters and the very SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC<br>in<br>&gt; jeopardy..."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The parents of the first Thai (a 6-year old boy) to die from Bird<br>Flu<br>&gt; VOWED TO SUE the government [with PM Thaksin as first plaintiff and<br>&gt; his Cabinet the second plaintiff.]<br>&gt; Mr Thaksin had admitted he had suspected "for a couple of weeks"<br>that<br>&gt; the disease had appeared in the kingom but kept it quiet for "fear<br>of<br>&gt; sparking mass panic".<br>&gt; Boy's angry Father: "If the government had told us about the spread<br>&gt; of bird flu, we would have protected our son."<br>&gt; Boy's angry Mother: "I REGRET VOTING for Thaksin. I will NEVER<br>&gt; FORGIVE them (the government) for this pain."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (ii) 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami Tragedy:<br>&gt; --- Expect the Unexpected. Be Prepared for the Worst.<br>&gt; --- Practise "Worst-Case Scenario" Contingency Planning.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (iii) Justified Public Anger at America's Bush Administration for<br>its<br>&gt; PATHETIC SLOW RESPONSE following Hurricane Katrina.<br>&gt; "Has the U.S. Government become a CAN'T DO Government" (ST headline)<br>&gt; "WHAT TOOK THEM SO LONG? Petty turf wars, red tape and lack of<br>&gt; preparation were all factors in debacle." (ST 7.9.05)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (iv) "MOSQUITO-BORNE DISEASE KILLS 650 IN INDIA. More than 3,000<br>&gt; people warded with Japanese encephalitis in northern state." (ST<br>&gt; 12.9.05)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (g) MISPLACED PRIORITIES of Singapore politicians:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; SO MUCH TALK about fighting TERRORISM.<br>&gt; SIMILAR TALK on protecting/saving the ENVIRONMENT.<br>&gt; BUT WHERE IS THE "OWNERSHIP &amp; POLITICAL WILL"<br>&gt; on "educating/preparing" the people to deal with disease threats<br>&gt; [viruses/bacteria being tiny/unseen "terrorists"] and possible "bio-<br>&gt; terrorism" ???<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (h) So, this is my SIMPLE MESSAGE to our politicians/bureacrats (in<br>&gt; particular) and fellow S'poreans (in general):<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Viruses and Bacteria may be very tiny but can cause SERIOUS HEALTH<br>&gt; PROBLEMS (and even DEATH) to ANYONE (whether young or old, whether<br>&gt; you are a politician, bureaucrat or ordinary citizen).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Thus, ALL OF US had better wake up, sit up and join forces to<br>tackle<br>&gt; DISEASE THREATS ( with OUR POLITICIANS providing the EXPECTED<br>&gt; LEADERSHIP !!! Otherwise, what the heck are they paid million-<br>dollar<br>&gt; salaries for ???).<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; THE NEA DENGUE FIASCO<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 3 Our current dengue "crisis situation":<br>&gt; As of 3 Sep 05 --- 8 deaths (incl 10-year old schoolboy). 8,850<br>cases<br>&gt; (with high percentage of 80% [ or 6,000 people] requiring<br>&gt; hospitalisation).<br>&gt; [Compared to 9,459 cases for the WHOLE of 2004, then considered a<br>10-<br>&gt; year record high.]<br>&gt; With weekly cases of some 600 (or some 80 cases daily), our<br>hospitals<br>&gt; are bursting at the seams with resources fully stretched.<br>&gt; Hence, the various forum letters by angry S'poreans on being turned<br>&gt; away by hospitals or the long wait before admission.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 4 I have been closely monitoring the dengue situation here for the<br>&gt; past 15 years (1992 spike at 3,000 cases, 1998 spike at 5,500 cases<br>&gt; and 2004 ten-year record spike of some 9,500 cases --- reflecting a<br>&gt; worrying rising trend!)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; [ Some years ago, my own mother nearly died of DHF. She required 6<br>&gt; bags of blood transfusions and took 4 long months to recover<br>&gt; completely.<br>&gt; I was naturally worried sick --- since I happened to know that the<br>&gt; risk of contracting AIDS or other blood-borne diseases from blood<br>&gt; transfusions may be low but can NEVER BE ZERO, as confirmed by our<br>&gt; Health Ministry.]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 5 Over the years, the ENV/NEA handling of the dengue threat can be<br>&gt; rightly described as laid-back, complacent and pathetic:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (a) For sure, the current "crisis situation" did not just happen<br>&gt; overnight --- there was a DISCERNABLE build-up since END OF 2004<br>&gt; (i.e. some TEN MONTHS AGO).<br>&gt; In short, if Minister-IN-CHARGE Yaacob and his NEA officials have<br>&gt; been PRO-ACTIVELY monitoring the situation closely over the PAST<br>TEN<br>&gt; MONTHS, they would have seen it coming.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The January 2005 dengue death of a 10-year old schoolboy would have<br>&gt; sent alarm bells ringing --- but did all these highly-paid public<br>&gt; officials really care or was it just a "hard-luck" conveniently-<br>&gt; forgotten death statistic??? [Death toll so far has gone up to 8]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (b) I have never failed to notice that each time dengue cases rise,<br>&gt; these same public officials will fall back on the same standard<br>LAID-<br>&gt; BACK REACTIVE approach of just calling on Singaporeans "to play<br>their<br>&gt; part"!<br>&gt; OF COURSE, any fool will agree that Singaporeans must play their<br>part<br>&gt; and co-operate.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As the saying goes: mere TALK IS CHEAP (and easy!).<br>&gt; BUT how are you going to get the people to play their part when NEA<br>&gt; HAS YET to mount a programme to EFFECTIVELY EDUCATE S'poreans on<br>the<br>&gt; SERIOUSNESS of the Dengue Threat (as many S'poreans have this<br>&gt; complacent approach of leaving everything to their Damn Good PAP<br>&gt; Government or "si beh ho cheng hu" in Hokkien) ???<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So WHEN is our NEA officials going to WALK THE TALK?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In fact, last year on 8 Mar 04 (i.e. 17 MONTHS AGO), I took the<br>time<br>&gt; and trouble to write in to then ENV Minister Lim Swee Say with this<br>&gt; suggestion:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Make use of TELEVISION (as a powerful graphic medium) to EDUCATE<br>as<br>&gt; MANY people as QUICKLY as possible (to "prepare" the people to<br>handle<br>&gt; A POSSIBLE LARGE-SCALE OUTBREAK.)".<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This is what is called PRO-ACTIVE CONTINGENCY PLANNING.<br>&gt; Alas, Minister Lim did not bother to reply to my suggestion, even<br>&gt; after I sent him my 29 Mar 04 reminder.<br>&gt; Thus, my file records showed he had maintained a DEAD SILENCE not<br>&gt; once but TWICE.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On 17 Nov 04 (i.e. 11 MONTHS AGO), I revived the same suggestion<br>with<br>&gt; his successor MEWR Minister Yaacob Ibrahim. Alas, it too fell on<br>deaf<br>&gt; ears!<br>&gt; With my two reminders on 22 Dec 04 and recently on 27 Jun 05,<br>&gt; Minister Yaacob is on record of maintaining a DEAD SILENCE not once<br>&gt; but THRICE to a citizen's well-meaning feedback.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (c) On the latter date of 27 Jun 05 (i.e. more than TWO MONTHS<br>AGO),<br>&gt; I had sent an email titled "DISEASE THREATS IN SINGAPORE ---<br>&gt; Unanswered Questions" to PM Lee and Ministers Yaacob, Khaw,<br>Tharman,<br>&gt; Lim Swee Say.<br>&gt; It took me four weeks to prepare this lengthy comprehensive<br>&gt; submission containing my feedback/insights/suggestions on fighting<br>&gt; these various disease threats --- SARS, Bird Flu, Dengue, HFMD,<br>&gt; Tubercolosis, Meningitis, Superbugs MRSA &amp; VRE, Polio and AIDS.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Its Section 10 on DENGUE reads as follows:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (a) Two types --- Dengue Fever (with 4 strains of virus) and the<br>more<br>&gt; deadly Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (internal organs bleed/potentially<br>&gt; fatal).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (b) FEW S'poreans know these FACTS:<br>&gt; --- Since 2003, 10 people here have died from Dengue.<br>&gt; --- HDB/private flats are just as prone to dengue outbreaks as<br>landed<br>&gt; homes.<br>&gt; --- Severe cases may require blood transfusions (with an attendant<br>&gt; AIDS risk, which can NEVER BE ZERO -- as confirmed by MOH)<br>&gt; --- Both young and old people are vulnerable [ In one Yishun<br>&gt; outbreak, a 2-year old infant and a 68-year old woman were both<br>&gt; hospitalised]<br>&gt; --- The year-end mosquito breeding season coincides with important<br>&gt; year-end school/university exams. [An 18-year old DHF victim had to<br>&gt; sit for his important A-level exams in a hospital, with his<br>&gt; performance naturally affected by the ordeal]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (c) DO NOT EVER ASSUME these large-scale dengue outbreaks CANNOT<br>&gt; happen in tiny densely-populated Singapore:<br>&gt; (i) Mar 2003 Indonesia Dengue Outbreak<br>&gt; [ over 50,000 infected/ over 500 dead (mostly children)]<br>&gt; (ii) May 2005 Thailand Dengue Outbreak<br>&gt; [ 7,000 infected(mostly children under 9 years), 16 dead so far]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (d) Feb 2004 --- NEA announced its Mozzie Buster programme to get<br>&gt; primary students (initial target: 2,000 students) to seek<br>&gt; out "potential mosquito breeding sites"!!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yet another "incredibly stupid idea" ---coming from former NEA<br>Public<br>&gt; Health Commissioner Wang Nan Chee --- as this would expose the<br>&gt; students to the risk of being bitten by mosquitoes and contracting<br>&gt; DF/DHF.<br>&gt; Interesting Question: WHY didn't ANYBODY in both NEA and MOE (who<br>&gt; allowed the scheme to be introduced in schools) EVER GIVE A THOUGHT<br>&gt; to such risks for the students?<br>&gt; [ Some years ago, an 8-year old schoolgirl had died of dengue.<br>&gt; Recently, a 10-year old schoolboy also died of dengue.]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Question No 1 (for Minister Yaacob) --- I had previously<br>written<br>&gt; extensively to your predecessor Lim Swee Say (who did not bother to<br>&gt; respond) to have the scheme scrapped rightaway to safeguard the<br>&gt; health of our school children.<br>&gt; I now seek the following answers from you: Has the Mozzie Buster<br>&gt; scheme for students been scrapped? If so, indicate when it was<br>&gt; scrapped. If not, please explain fully WHY NOT?<br>&gt; [ THINK (IBM slogan) --- If your own children were in primary<br>school,<br>&gt; would YOU allow them to participate in such a stupid/foolhardy<br>&gt; scheme?]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (e) There are still many older HDB/private flats installed with<br>&gt; sloping bamboo-pole holders which can harbour stagnant rain water --<br>-<br>&gt; and so breed mosquitoes (VERY FEW S'poreans know this). [See<br>today's<br>&gt; ST 12.9.05 Forum letter "Dengue threat in HDB laundry pole<br>holders".]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; NEA's Dengue public education programme SHOULD thus be:<br>&gt; (i) PRIMARY Objective --- Make use of TELEVISION to EDUCATE as MANY<br>&gt; people as possible (to QUICKLY "prepare" the people to handle a<br>&gt; possible large-scale outbreak).<br>&gt; Show on TELEVISION a homeowner or maid carrying out ALL the various<br>&gt; simple measures to prevent mosquito-breeding in homes eg covering<br>up<br>&gt; bamboo pole holders, overturning pails,etc,etc ["monkey see, monkey<br>&gt; do"]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (ii) SECONDARY Objective --- Next, carry on with its "grassroots<br>&gt; approach" to "reinforce" the messages in the TV education<br>programme.<br>&gt; If NEA just do this "time-consuming" approach (as currently), by<br>the<br>&gt; time it finish going around the numerous grassroot bodies, many<br>&gt; S'poreans (including possibly our politicians/bureaucrats!) may<br>have<br>&gt; already died of Dengue!!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Question No 2 (for Minister Yaacob) --- Are you going to direct<br>&gt; current NEA Public Health Commissioner Khoo Seow Poh to undertake<br>&gt; approach (i) RIGHTAWAY (no time to lose, as we had big spike in<br>&gt; dengue cases early this year)? If not, please explain fully WHY NOT?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 6 Mr Lee, please note the following:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (a) From the above revelations, IF Minister Lim Swee Say had<br>&gt; seriously heeded/adopted my said suggestion 17 MONTHS AGO and IF<br>&gt; Minister Yaacob had done so 11 MONTHS AND TWO MONTHS AGO, the<br>&gt; current "crisis situation" could have been avoided (and with<br>possibly<br>&gt; FEWER DEATHS!)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; How Pathetic And Pathetic (PAP) --- so many OPPORTUNITIES and so<br>much<br>&gt; LEAD TIME to educate/prepare the people for a large-scale epidemic<br>&gt; wasted i.e. "gone down the mosquito-infected drain" !!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (b) So, if there are more deaths to come (especially of young<br>&gt; children), Singaporeans can rightly hold Ministers Lim Swee Say and<br>&gt; Yaacob Ibrahim ACCOUNTABLE and ANSWERABLE for the laid-<br>&gt; back/complacent/tardy handling of the dengue threat leading up to<br>the<br>&gt; current crisis.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And the grieving relatives of such victims can also sue such<br>million-<br>&gt; dollar ministers. ( Since PAP ministers like to sue people so much,<br>&gt; it would be a nice welcomed change for the people to sue them ! )<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; CONCLUDING REMARKS<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 7 The NEA Dengue Fiasco is JUST ONE of our numerous Fiascos after<br>&gt; Fiascos ( as listed in Annex A below).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The ROOT CAUSES of all these fiascos lie in the Basic Principles of<br>&gt; Political Governance &amp; Public Service (as spelt out in Annex B<br>&gt; below) --- which can be summed up as follows:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (a) control/manipulation of Press/TV media (people only hear "feel-<br>&gt; good" news and not "the good,the bad and the ugly" aspects of a<br>&gt; society) = yes-man journalists<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (b) mollycoddling civil servants (through condoning their<br>&gt; shortcomings/mistakes in serving the people) = yes-man civil<br>servants<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (c) using the law as a political weapon through defamation suits to<br>&gt; deal with differing/dissenting views (i.e. Fear Factor,Singapore<br>&gt; Edition) = yes-man citizens<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Simple mathematical equation:<br>&gt; yes-man journalists + yes-man civil servants + yes-man citizens<br>&gt; = perfect recipe for fiascos/cock-ups/screw-ups/cover-ups (with<br>HUMAN<br>&gt; LIVES possibly at stake)<br>&gt; = SINGAPORE going "down the drain" (infested with dengue<br>mosquitoes!)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 8 Remember, at a PAP 50th Anniversary function, you said to this<br>&gt; effect: Don't just sit there! DO SOMETHING! Don't be NATO (No<br>&gt; Action,Talk Only)!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; [ "DPM Lee promises a more open Singapore". "I don't make promises<br>I<br>&gt; can't keep: DPM Lee" (ST &amp; Jan 04) ]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Internet readers of this Open Letter will rightly expect you (as<br>the<br>&gt; PRIME MINISTER ) to demonstrate the requisite POLITICAL LEADERSHIP<br>as<br>&gt; follows:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (i) DIRECT all your ministers and senior civil servants to put an<br>&gt; IMMEDIATE STOP to all the DEAD SILENCE (a most ARROGANT and<br>&gt; DISRESPECTFUL ACT towards citizens [like myself] who try to<br>&gt; participate/contribute to the well-being of Singapore.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; For if they continue to do so, Singaporeans (who are paying for<br>their<br>&gt; salaries) have EVERY RIGHT to treat such public servants as DEAD<br>and<br>&gt; should thus be struck off the public payroll! (WHY should our<br>people<br>&gt; pay for the salaries of DEAD public servants???)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (ii) ADVISE Minister Yaacob to set the proper/correct example to<br>&gt; civil servants in not maintaining any further DEAD SILENCE to the<br>&gt; long-outstanding Questions No 1 &amp; 2 stated in para 5(c) above.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I will be expecting his PERSONAL email reply (i.e. as MEWR Minister-<br>&gt; IN-CHARGE,thus any passing-the-buck to NEA officials is<br>unacceptable)<br>&gt; by 5 pm WED 14 September 2005 [as per Civil Service 3-working day<br>&gt; Response Directive].<br>&gt;<br>&gt; After this deadline, I will proceed to download over the Internet<br>the<br>&gt; following to help fellow S'poreans judge/decide for themselves:<br>&gt; --- this Open Letter<br>&gt; --- Minister Yaacob's email reply (if any)<br>&gt; --- Your response to this Open Letter (if any)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; [ Note: My feedback on SERIOUS ISSUES (Disease Threats) are the<br>&gt; contributions of a SERIOUS-MINDED educated 57-year old S'porean who<br>&gt; has "eaten more salt than 50-year old Minister Yaacob has eaten<br>rice"<br>&gt; (in Cantonese). So Minister Yaacob will do well to take me VERY<br>&gt; SERIOUSLY! ]<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 9 Mr Lee, the current dengue crisis has completely vindicated by<br>&gt; persistent feedback efforts to our politicans/bureaucrats on<br>various<br>&gt; disease threats (and not merely dengue).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I am not a member of any political party. I speak as an educated<br>&gt; concerned citizen. And coming from the same alma mater Raffles<br>&gt; Institution (as your Famous Father and SM Goh), I cannot be such a<br>&gt; stupid Singaporean as to make unfounded statements.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Firstly, I have documented file records. Secondly, I am raising<br>&gt; issues of public health (involving human health and human lives)<br>and<br>&gt; so am confident of the people's backing.<br>&gt; Therefore, any clever attempt to cook up a defamation suit against<br>a<br>&gt; Public Health Whistle-Blower will result in a hugh backlash of<br>&gt; justified public anger as seen in the NKF Disgraceful Debacle-cum-<br>&gt; Shameless Scandal.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In your planning for the coming General Elections, here are some<br>&gt; invaluable/honest feedback taken from Internet postings of younger,<br>&gt; better-educated, Internet-savvy S'poreans:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (i) Hi ALL, notice these glaring similarities in the NKF and PAP:<br>&gt; --- a deplorable Lack of Transparency and disgraceful disrespect<br>for<br>&gt; donors/citizens.<br>&gt; --- using defamation suits to threaten the people's right to ask<br>&gt; questions.<br>&gt; --- officials paying themselves very handsome, so-called "peanut"<br>&gt; salaries.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Wah lau, if such high salary is "Pea-Nut", then the salaries of the<br>&gt; majority of Singaporeans must be "Pee-Sai", hor?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (ii) This Andrew Kuan Wayang Show. Why can't they stage the show<br>&gt; themselves, instead of making use of civil servants?<br>&gt; They also make use of civil servants to fiddle electoral boundaries.<br>&gt; This is not fair to civil servants, lah. Civil servants are<br>supposed<br>&gt; to be non-political, mah.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ANNEX A: Other Fiascos (involving Human Health and Human Lives).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 1 LTA Bus Stop Safety Fiasco.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; My 15 Sep 2004 STREATS published letter "I,not LTA, wanted bus-stop<br>&gt; bollards":<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ".......In his letter "Bollards make me feel safer" (Streats, Sept<br>&gt; 7), Mr Tan Kok Tim had mistakenly commended the Land Transport<br>&gt; Authority (LTA). Allow me to set the record straight.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In 1998, a runaway car ploughed into a bus stop, killing one and<br>&gt; injuring two students. In 2000, a similar tragedy happened, with<br>two<br>&gt; students and two women seriously injured.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Many concerned commuters then suggesed putting "some form of<br>barrier"<br>&gt; at bus stops. The LTA persistently argued that such barriers impede<br>&gt; passenger movement and merely advised motorists to drive "more<br>&gt; carefully"!!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In 2001, I wrote directly to former LTA CEO Han Eng Juan*,<br>&gt; asking "Who says you have to erect massive or continuous barriers?"<br>&gt; and suggested concrete bollards (even providing a sketch). [*<br>former<br>&gt; S'pore Navy top-brass]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Regrettably, the LTA dithered on the matter with exasperating lame<br>&gt; excuses. The correspondence "ding-dong" went on for three months!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In 2003, I revived the issue with LTA. Were it not for for my<br>dogged<br>&gt; persistence, the concrete bollards would never have been installed<br>&gt; recently. Still, it has taken the LTA FOUR LONG YEARS to act on<br>such<br>&gt; a simple and inexpensive safety measure to protect adults and<br>&gt; students who have to wait at bus stops......"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 2 AIDS Risk Through Blood Transfusions.<br>&gt; In my published 25.1.93 ST Forum letter "Can MOH explain why I<br>can't<br>&gt; donate blood to my son?", I had publicly raised this concern ---<br>&gt; which was clearly not taken seriously by MOH officials. [Then<br>Health<br>&gt; Minister Yeo Cheow Tong, PS/MOH &amp; DMS Dr Kwa Soon Bee]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; FIVE YEARS LATER, in 1997, the tragedy that was "waiting to happen"<br>&gt; did happen to not one but two innocent adult S'poreans who<br>contracted<br>&gt; AIDS through blood transfusions.<br>&gt; MOH officials then "downplayed" this double tragedy, promising to<br>pay<br>&gt; the victims' medical bills. This was SCANT CONSOLATION to their<br>loved<br>&gt; ones, as both victims died of AIDS not so long after.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; MOH also had to FINALLY and PUBLICLY admit to the following (which<br>&gt; was previously kept from the public for many years):<br>&gt; ".....No procedure can reduce the risk of infection from<br>contaminated<br>&gt; blood to ZERO...." [ then MOH/DMS Dr Chen Ai Ju ST 17.11.97].<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Food for Thought --- That is, even if the risk of contracting AIDS<br>&gt; from a blood transfusion is so remotely low as one in three million<br>&gt; [our citizen population], how would ANY S'porean like to be that<br>ONE<br>&gt; unfortunate statistic ???<br>&gt;<br>&gt; [ Additional Note: Currently, Donated Blood are routinely screened<br>&gt; for AIDS and Hepatitis B/C.<br>&gt; However, there also VARIOUS OTHER "blood-borne" diseases (incl Mad<br>&gt; Cow Disease) that could be transmitted through a blood<br>transfusion.]<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 3 Our 2000 HFMD Outbreak Fiasco.[ some 4,000 infected/ 7 young<br>&gt; children dead ]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The 1997 Sarawak and 1998 Taiwan HFMD epidemics showed this<br>&gt; contagious disease could spread quickly to large numbers of young<br>&gt; children. (But, alas, our ENV/MOH officials didn't pick up the<br>&gt; lessons.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ENV Public Health Commissioner Wang Nan Chee was then Chairman of<br>the<br>&gt; HFMD Task Force. He was caught napping, slow to react and his<br>&gt; deplorable "smug complacency" were revealed through these burning<br>&gt; questions:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (i) WHY did he not adopt the PRO-ACTIVE APPROACH of making the<br>&gt; disease LEGALLY NOTIFIABLE when the Task Force was set up in 1998?<br>&gt; [ Doing so would have enabled it to track cases, anticipate an<br>&gt; impending epidemic with more time to alert parents/childcare<br>&gt; operators.]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (ii) WHY WAIT until the death of a 2-year old toddler on Sep 10 to<br>&gt; annouce making it notifiable as from Oct 1, and not rightaway?<br>&gt; [ Anyway, for the 20 days after this was done, some 2,200 cases<br>were<br>&gt; notified --- confirming that an epidemic was ALREADY AT HAND!!! ]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (iii) WHY WAIT until the deaths of two siblings* on Sep 30 to<br>HASTILY<br>&gt; announce the SUDDEN closure of childcare centres in a BELATED bid<br>to<br>&gt; halt the growing epidemic?<br>&gt; [ *All three children in one family came down with HFMD, with a 2-<br>&gt; year old brother and 14-month old sister dying within hours of each<br>&gt; other. Altogether, 7 young children died in this outbreak.]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; [ Note: In the above 2000 HFMD fiasco, senior civil servant Wang<br>Nan<br>&gt; Chee had demonstrated a deplorable "smug complacency". In the 2003<br>&gt; EHI laboratory SARS case fiasco (para 5 below), he demonstrated an<br>&gt; equally deplorable "smug over-confidence". And in 2004, he was<br>behind<br>&gt; the incredibly stupid NEA Mozzie Buster scheme for primary<br>students.]<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 4 Our 2003 SARS Outbreak [ 238 infected/ 33 deaths]:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (i) We were DAMN LUCKY in that, THIS FIRST TIME, the disease was<br>&gt; largely confined to the healthcare setting --- so most victims were<br>&gt; HCWs (healthcare workers ie nurses/doctors).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; THE NEXT TIME, if the virus spreads to the WIDER COMMUNITY through<br>a<br>&gt; combination of Coughing/Sneezing AND Sharing Food, it would<br>be "near<br>&gt; impossible" to contain the disease!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (ii) Beneath the SEEMINGLY CALM EXTERIOR, there was UNDERLYING<br>PANIC<br>&gt; and under-estimation of the threat:<br>&gt; 01.03.03 Victim No 1 hospitalised at TTSH.<br>&gt; 12.03.03 WHO global alert on "atypical pneumonia".<br>&gt; 15.03.03 WHO named new disease as SARS. 16 infected to-date.<br>&gt; 18.03.03 21 infected (still early days)<br>&gt; Amazingly, an over-confident Health Minister Lim Hng Khiang told<br>&gt; Parliament: "It will require us another 10-14 days, before we can<br>&gt; declare 'all clear' if all things go well". He also said there was<br>NO<br>&gt; CAUSE FOR ALARM (when this was just the BEGINNING of the<br>outbreak !!!)<br>&gt; 30.05.03 Singapore taken off WHO SARS list. [Final tally 238<br>&gt; infected/ 33 deaths]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (iii) On extending the closure of schools, I had to send then<br>&gt; Education Minister Teo Chee Hean my 3 Apr 03 email to remind him<br>&gt; thus --- "The LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN are DEFINITELY MORE IMPORTANT<br>&gt; than the unavoidable disruption to curriculum, examinations and<br>&gt; holiday plans. With this new and little-known killer SARS virus, it<br>&gt; is DOWNRIGHT SENSIBLE to err on the side of caution."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 5 2003 EHI Laboratory SARS case Fiasco.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Singapore became the "laughing stock" of the international medical<br>&gt; community (first country in the whole world to have a SARS case<br>&gt; contracted in a laboratory!).<br>&gt; Former NEA Public Health Commissioner Wang Nan Chee displayed a<br>&gt; deplorably "smug over-confidence" in his persistent denials that<br>the<br>&gt; SARS-infected NUS researcher could have picked up the infection at<br>&gt; its "world-class" laboratory.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He was proven wrong by the International Expert Panel, which also<br>&gt; provided these very shocking findings. These VERY BASIC laboratory<br>&gt; procedures (for a lab dealing in "live" viruses!) were ABSENT ---<br>&gt; restricted access to the lab; proper records; wearing appropriate<br>&gt; protective gear; using properly-sterilised equipment. [ Even a<br>&gt; secondary school Chemistry teacher would be shocked!]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; At the televised Press Conference on the findings, both ENV<br>Minister-<br>&gt; in-charge Lim Swee Say and Wang were conspicuously absent.<br>&gt; When interviewed by reporters the next day, Minister Lim finally<br>&gt; offered his Belated Apology (one day late).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This incident is certainly no small nor laughing matter.<br>&gt; POSSIBLE DIRE CONSEQUENCES --- WHAT IF the SARS-infected NUS<br>&gt; researcher is a "super-spreader" who then wander around the<br>&gt; university campus to start new clusters of SARS infection amongst<br>NUS<br>&gt; students???<br>&gt; [ Note: PM Lee's one precious daughter was then an NUS student.]<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 6 MOE Vietnam School Visit Fiasco.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; [ Minister-IN-CHARGE Tharman Shanmugaratnam.<br>&gt; Perm Sec Lieutenant-General Lim Chuan Poh (Army top-brass) ]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; From my 16/3/05 TODAY published letter "Unwise to put pupils at<br>risk":<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In 2004, 69 Singapore schools did "community work" overseas.<br>&gt; In Nov 2004, 6 teachers and 10 students from Choa Chu Kang Primary<br>&gt; School spent a week helping out in an orphanage in Vietnam (around<br>&gt; that time, Vietnam was having its major bird flu outbreak!)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Whatever the good intentions, the trip was "an incredibly stupid<br>&gt; idea" !!!<br>&gt; The teachers/students were putting themselves at risk of<br>contracting<br>&gt; bird flu AND PASSING ON THE INFECTION to fellow<br>&gt; citizens/teachers/students upon returning to Singapore.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 7 2004 Nicoll Highway Collapse Fiasco.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Are these two incidents that were "WAITING TO HAPPEN"?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In 1993, at the Clementi Station, an MRT train crashed into a<br>&gt; stationary train (156 people injured, some with severe "whip-lash"<br>&gt; neck injuries).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; DAMNING INDICTMENT of then Inquiry Panel --- ".....The seeds of the<br>&gt; collision were actually sown FIVE YEARS AGO in 1988. The crash<br>COULD<br>&gt; HAVE BEEN AVOIDED but for a series of "errors of judgement,<br>omissions<br>&gt; of communication, lack of initiative, over-confidence in the<br>&gt; automatic train protection system and a LACK OF A SENSE OF DANGER<br>by<br>&gt; groups and individuals prior to the collision........."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ELEVEN YEARS LATER, the past lessons have clearly not been<br>learnt !!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; SAME DAMNING INDICTMENT in the 13 May 05 Final Report (Committee of<br>&gt; Inquiry into the Nicoll Highway Collapse) --- the collapse of the<br>&gt; section of MRT Circle Line and subsequent collapse of 100m of<br>Nicoll<br>&gt; Highway was a MAN-MADE DISASTER that COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ST 14 May 05 front-page headline --- "Panel slams safety at<br>worksite:<br>&gt; RECKLESS, SLOPPY, INDIFFERENT"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; TNP 14 May 05 report "So many warning signs, but....." --- FOUR<br>lives<br>&gt; could have been saved. FOUR families would not be grieving. IF ONLY<br>&gt; the WARNING SIGNS had been taken more SERIOUSLY. But they went<br>&gt; UNHEEDED. Only simple patch-ups were done.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Again, this incident is no small nor laughing matter.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; POSSIBLE HORRENDOUS CONSEQUENCES --- WHAT IF the<br>design/construction<br>&gt; faults manifest themselves only AFTER the project was completed?<br>Say,<br>&gt; during peak hour traffic, the collapse occur. ABOVE GROUND, many<br>cars<br>&gt; and crowded buses plunge into a big gaping hole along Nicoll<br>Highway.<br>&gt; BELOW GROUND, many MRT commuters suffer the terrible fate of<br>&gt; being "entombed" to death. Total Death Toll in the hundreds,<br>&gt; thousands???<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ANNEX B: Basic Principles of Political Governance &amp; Public Service.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 1 A VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:<br>&gt; SINGAPORE is a country with a 200-year history and belongs to ALL<br>its<br>&gt; 3 million citizens.<br>&gt; The PAP is just a 50-year old political party with only some 15,000<br>&gt; members.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (Some years ago, academic-turned-PAP politican Koo Tsai Kee almost<br>&gt; committed "political suicide" when he BRAZENLY declared that<br>&gt; Singapore and the PAP are synonymous !!!<br>&gt; He was immediately lambasted by many educated/thinking S'poreans.<br>&gt; Served him right! Over the Internet, many were saying he was<br>&gt; suffering from the deadly/incurable "Foot in the Mouth" disease! )<br>&gt;<br>&gt; [ Million-Dollar Question --- If the PAP is really held in such<br>high<br>&gt; esteem by the people and with the attraction of million-dollar<br>&gt; ministerial salaries, WHY are there no long queues of<br>&gt; educated/capable people lining up to join the PAP?<br>&gt; Even they have publicly admitted they need to "drink a lot of tea"<br>&gt; to "persuade" people to join! ]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 2 Similarities between CORPORATE Governance &amp; POLITICAL Governance:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As FINANCE Minister, Lee Hsien Loong had preached the following:<br>&gt; --- Need for Good CORPORATE Governance through TRANSPARENCY &amp;<br>&gt; ACCOUNTABILITY and CHECKS &amp; BALANCES.<br>&gt; --- Avoidance of Conflict of Interests.<br>&gt; --- Recognition of Whistle-Blowers in exposing Corporate Fraud.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; [ Million-Dollar Question for a Million-Dollar Minister --- wearing<br>&gt; his hat as PRIME MINISTER, WHEN is he going to practise what he<br>&gt; preached in introducing similar desirable requirements in the even<br>&gt; more important area of Good POLITICAL Governance?<br>&gt; Educated/thinking S'poreans have been impatiently waiting for such<br>&gt; Political LEADERSHIP --- not least in their desire to have more<br>&gt; political choices through a level-playing field in our political<br>&gt; arena.]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; From the Internet:<br>&gt; In America, Red Indians say White Men speak with forked tongue.<br>&gt; In Singapore, Singaporeans say Men In White also speak with forked<br>&gt; tongue.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In Singapore's Political Governance, there is little TRUE SUBSTANCE<br>&gt; but hell of a lot of FORM such as political orchestration ("wayang"<br>&gt; in Malay,"chor hee" in Hokkien); election gerrymandering;<br>&gt; mollycoddling of civil servants; flirtation with union members,<br>&gt; etc,etc,etc.<br>&gt; This may be good for the PAP, but are DEFINITELY NOT GOOD IN THE<br>LONG-<br>&gt; TERM for Singapore (as a country) and for Singaporeans (as a<br>people).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; From the Internet:<br>&gt; You can fool MOST people MOST of the time.<br>&gt; But you cannot fool ALL the people ALL the time.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 3 Singapore's CONTINUED SURVIVAL depends ultimately on the<br>COLLECTIVE<br>&gt; INPUTS of its politicians, civil servants and people. NO ONE GROUP<br>&gt; can claim the FULL CREDIT for the country's achievements.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If the people can do everything by themselves, there would be no<br>need<br>&gt; for a Government. Conversely, if the Government thinks it can<br>afford<br>&gt; to brush aside the people's feedback, it may as well govern a<br>&gt; deserted country, say Timbuktu in Africa!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If the FEW strengths (eg incorruptibility) of our public officials<br>&gt; are constantly trumpeted, but their MANY weaknesses (eg DEAD<br>SILENCE<br>&gt; or exasperating replies to public feedback) are not publicised, how<br>&gt; can they ever IMPROVE to help Singapore PROGRESS "from a small<br>&gt; country to a Great Nation" ?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Our public officials can look at public feedback in two ways ---<br>the<br>&gt; negative, defensive way or the positive, constructive way, which<br>will<br>&gt; help them try "harder" to serve the people "better". This is the<br>true<br>&gt; meaning of "public service" --- plain and simple!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A truly First-Class Civil Service is one that is RESPECTFUL OF<br>PUBLIC<br>&gt; FEEDBACK and RESPONSIVE TO PUBLIC NEEDS.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 4 As the term rightly indicates, Public SERVANTS (generic term for<br>&gt; politicians/bureaucrats) are PAID by the people to SERVE the people.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; --- As such, they have no right to go around "expecting"<br>&gt; or "demanding" respect from the people. Or worse, trying to "beat<br>&gt; respect out of the people" in using the law as a legal weapon, such<br>&gt; as through defamation suits.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Like it or not, they MUST FIRST "earn" such public respect through<br>&gt; appropriate WORDS (what they say) and DEEDS (what they do).<br>&gt; [ In short, if they do not FIRST show respect for the people, why<br>&gt; should the people respect them at all ??? ]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; --- ANY Public SERVANT who either maintains a DEAD SILENCE to<br>issues<br>&gt; of public concern raised by the people or delivers exasperating<br>&gt; public replies that insult the people's intelligence is guilty of<br>&gt; displaying an ACT OF ARROGANCE AND DISRESPECT to the very same<br>people<br>&gt; (who are paying for his super-generous salary/bonuses out of their<br>&gt; hard-earned monies collected through numerous taxes and dues.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; [ Million Dollar Question: Are our public officials "definitely<br>dumb"<br>&gt; (unable to comprehend issues stated in plain simple English)<br>&gt; or "deliberately dumb" (to avoid/evade the issue at hand) ?<br>&gt; EITHER WAY is bad for the LONG-TERM FUTURE of Singapore! ]<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Also copied to:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; MOH --- Parl Sec Dr Maliki Osman; PS Yong Ying-I; DMS Dr Satku<br>&gt; Kandiah;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; HPB --- CEO-designate Lam Pin Woon<br>&gt;<br>&gt; SingHealth --- CEO Dr Tan Ser Kiat<br>&gt;<br>&gt; National Health --- CEO Dr Lim Suet Wun<br>&gt;<br>&gt; MEWR --- PS Tan Yong Soon<br>&gt;<br>&gt; AVA --- CEO Dr Chua Sin Bin<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Other Ministers:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; MOF Raymond Lim / MCYS Dr Vivian Balakrishnan / MOT Lim Hwee Hua<br>&gt;<br>&gt; DPM Wong Kan Seng/ MOM Ng Eng Hen/ MINDEF Teo Chee Hean<br>&gt;<br>&gt; MOE Tharman Shanmugaratnam/ MICA Lee Boon Yang<br>&gt;<br>&gt; MFA George Yeo/ MTI Lim Hng Kiang/ MOT Yeo Cheow Tong</div>

But all the NEA departments are controlled by engineers who know nothing about disease controls, food hygiene and food poisoning. Can you imagine an engineer trying to do a doctorÂ’s work?<br><br></div></blockquote>I tend to agree with you. I suspect there could be a gap somewhere. NEA is generally concerned about the technical aspects of environmental control. It  wouldn't be monitoring the changes in the habitat, breeding habits or mutation of those pests or health-threatening micro-organisms. And knowning how our govt ministries push work, I doubt the co-ordination is as good as it should be to ensure the highest standard of public health.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A very well worded (if not fiercely critical and unbaised) open letter by See Leong Kit.<br><br>I have personally read several of his letters in ST forum pages and Streats myself concerning National health issues. Judging by the manner in which this letter has been written, i can rightly assume his published letters have been hugely moderated prior to print.<br><br>What he emphasized on respect for individuals is true, for trigger-happy filing of defamation suits have led to a blatant disregard for the feedback and whistleblowing from citizens. Further highlighting the arrogance and sweeping aside of constructive comments by well-educated and concerned citizens merely displays an aloof and disrespectful attitude adopted towards Singaporeans, an attitude that has to go if we are to progress.<br><br>I sincerely hope that the ministers respond appropriately for Mr See has taken much time to compile and monitor most of the 'skeletons in the closets' happily locked away by our silent ministers.<br><br>Like a rotten apple with a polished surface.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On hindsight, it seems that open letters to our govt ministers may be the way forward as forum letters are published only at the whim of ST editors.<br><br>In fact, Mr See's approach was insightful. Perhaps realising that forum letters weren't getting through to the right ministers and govt institutions, he changed his own approach and adopted open letters to personalised emails or residences, thus being able to 'register' whether or not they responded.<br><br>Thus, this aspect could be further used as ammunition against aloof and despondent ministers who chose to remain silent, further cementing the truth that these overly paid civil servants are possibly complacent and lack humility to accept the views and suggestion by the local population.<br><br>In turn, without any openness and nationwide publishing of these open letters, people will be left to ponder the irony of whether we as citizens had done enough to pre-empt such a crisis before it happened, or choose to believe the govt that they had taken 'all the necessary steps' and 'preventative safeguards' to protect the people.<br><br>If See Leong Kit is not alone in this (as many can surmise), there may have been sufficient influx of ideas from the people to the govt, comments which were swept aside because of complacency and arrogance.</div>
