I can't agree with u more. Unless u possess certain skill sets that are scarce and in high demands, otherwise it is never easy to get a good job here in OZ. Trades skills like mechanic, plumbering, electrician are always in demand..even hairdressing.<br><br>At the end of the day, many asians started their own small businesses here like take aways, etc..<br><br>One golden rule, never burn the bridge after u crossed it. Even though u may have gotten PR, retain your pink IC..because..u never know...................</div>

And jobs are harder to come by. It is the same thing that we are facing in the other countries isn't it? Paul you seem to falliously think that singapore, china and india are welfare countries. By saying that "Singapore government's provision of..." The Singapore government pays for nothing. You slave for 30 years to pay off the HDB flat. You slave for the $3 to buy lunch. You slave for the repayments of the car. The government doesn't hand those out.<br><br>Hmm.. what company was that? So the company loses an unfair dismissal suit. The point is?? And when was the case heard? Who was involved and when was this? How does this show racial discrimination?<br><br>Yes there is competition, there is competition for jobs everywhere. And what makes you think your qualifications are recognised in Singapore?<br><br>I think with information freely available, i do not think that people would go there thinking that there are undiscovered gold mines. To migrate.. first of all.. you probably need a sponsor, lots of dough or skills that are recognised in that country. Least in Australia anyway.<br>I really doubt that people who migrate are not aware of what they are getting considering to even apply for migration costs a bit of money.</div>

You yourself said how easy it was to migrate in the 80s.<br><br>HAHHA.. then i suggest that your friend stays in Sg.. unfair dismissal cases are everywhere. There may be more than meets the eye. Or this could have never happened. If you're not in the situation, you do not know both sides of the coin.<br><br>Also if the shop that he rented is under a lease contract he cannot be kicked out. To be removed from a rental property (even when the 1 year or 6 months contract is over) you have to give at least 60 days notice to be removed. As a tenant you give 30 days notice to vacate the place. This applies to residential properties, i'm sure commerical leases are more giving than that. if this guy was trying to do dodgy stuff and didn't have a lease or was subleasing   illegally. Then there's no basis for an argument.<br><br></div>

It's not hard to get a job at all.. it's the same as any other country. Opportunities are there, would you take that job in Delifrance for $4? Well.. cash in hand jobs pay $10 per hour. This is undeclared.<br>How many of your friends are aussies. How many do you actually know? It depends on where you live and who you are associating with. Yes i've seen lots of trailer trash in my visitor services position. I also know lots of people who work 14 hours a day. Yes.. they are white. And yes, some asians (viets/HKs/chinese) are professional welfare cheats as well. So don't point the finger too soon.<br><br>Do not throw around the word "my government" without checking who my government is. It is the same as your government.<br>The one who supposedly has difficulty providing its citizens with houses. I better put my name down for the free house and food package that the government is giving out. No wonder your government has to borrow money from the world bank.<br>Hmm.. prepare for overnight economic reforms by some foreign body.</div>

Why would the Australian government be hitting the World Bank for a loan?  Is the value of the Australian dollar dropping?  If anything, Singapore is in more danger than Australia of going to hell in a handbasket.<br><br>But what's really funny is that I've seen heaps of Singaporean students blindly go to Australian universities with that "Australians are lazy" myth, only to be sent packing home with their arses handed neatly to them.<br><br>So you just go ahead thinking that Australians are lazy - meanwhile, they'll be using that illusion against you.

            <div class='col-md body'>paul, many Singaporeans, armed with their fancy degrees and oodles of work experience, go to Australia expecting to find a jobs paradise waiting for them when they migrate over. The fact is, like any mature economy, white collar jobs are not that easy to find. Not extinct, just difficult to find. Then again, our own country ain't no haven for white collar jobs too isn't it?<br><br>What Australia does not lack, which Singapore does, is opportunities. Opportunities to run a small business, without GLCs who use their fat wallets and forge a devil's alliance with regulatory bodies to shift the goalposts in their favour to the detriment of small businessmen.<br><br>And that fact that for the same amount of money which will see you living like a church mouse in Singapore with a 3 room pigeonhole which is NEVER yours, you'll get to live in a relatively nice house with a garden, not to mention a family car fo 2 to boot.<br></div>

Substitue "Australia" for "Singapore", brainiac - you just called yourself a lazy arsehole.  I don't know how true that is, but given your penchant for shooting yourself in the foot, you sure are dumb. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
