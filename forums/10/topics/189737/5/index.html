That was mentioned by SBST275,not me,i am just refuting what he said.<br><br>So because of govt policy that leads to high property prices,it is expect for these people to downgrade instead of maintaining? What happened to the proud HDB's claims over the years on its Flats ownership scheme for singaporeans<br><br>There are very strict criteria to be met b4 the HDB will even rent you a flat and it will at most be a very small 2 room flat.Also just because if people fall into hardship,you cannot expect them to sell away their flats as they may stand to lose out since they have to pay a amount of resale levy.Beside they may not even be able to rent one due to very strict criterias to be met.And add to the fact that it is a whole 20% segment of the population (=800,000= average 200,000 household).Does HDB has that many rental flats to cater to such a sizable amount of people even if they all pass the strict criterias?Do not compare yourself and other malaysians who come here to work,they may not be earning as little as this group of singaporeans and most of these malaysians rent a room for one person and not a flat for the average household of 4 person here. You make it seems as through it is that easy to just rent a flat from HDB,as if you have a family,you can just get the rental.I also know that you are a doctor so what you earn is definately not comparable,why use yourself to compare?<br><br><a href="http://app.sprinter.gov.sg/data/pr/20060303979.htm" rel="nofollow">http://app.sprinter.gov.sg/data/pr/20060303979.htm</a><br><br>except from article<br><br>HDB rental flats are another form of public housing subsidy.  They have to be funded from the same public housing budget that we use to provide subsidies for sold flats, upgrading and estate renewal programmes etc.  For this reason, we have strict eligibility criteria on citizenship, income, family nucleus and property ownership to ensure that rental subsidies are given to those who really need them, and who have not enjoyed their fair share of housing subsidies.<br><br></div>

Poor parents.. cant supervise their kids...cuz theyt are constantly out there looking for jobs..<br>Sinario1:<br>Kids look elsewhere for companionship and support....shotgun, unplanned teen pregnancies result... kids leave school to supprt their kids.. the cycle perpetuates....<br>Sinario 2:<br>Kids have to work while studying, unable to cope with work and study at such a young age, they do badly at school. Up to the point of secondary education.. this isnt tha much of a problem.. Tertiary educationis way too expensive for these guys.. Education hence takes a back seat. They take up low paying jobs due to poor certification... the cycle continues.<br><br>These are only 2 of the many sinarios ive noticed., where kids are born into adversity and are caught in a perpetuating poverty cycle. This is in singapore, mind u. It ssad but true.. only a hand few escape. The wider the income gap, the bigger the prob.</div>
