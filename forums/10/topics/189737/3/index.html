You pay downpayment of about S$3000 and then S$80 a month for 25 years and the house (not flat) and land is with your family for "eternity."<br><br>This then acts as a social safe guard.

In Thailand, the Government housing policy is this: Freehold. You pay downpayment of about S$3000 and then S$80 a month for 25 years and the house (not flat) and land is with your family for "eternity."<br><br>This then acts as a social safe guard. In bad times, everybody comes home and contributes to the household expenditure. Everybody in the family has a roof over their heads.</div></blockquote>well the problem with singapore is that we lack land,so freehold is definately not possible as land is always needed for future development.</div>
