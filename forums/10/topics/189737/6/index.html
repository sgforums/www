No,cost of every other thing went up instead, with critical area being the very daily transport neccessity,going up even when the company is already earning record profit.And no i am not whining about the cost of living as i have even agreed in some part of this thread that i know that rise in cost is inevitable.I am only concerned about the cost of living for the lowest 20% income bracket household,and that is what i had being talking about all this time in this thread that there is not enough being done to help this really really needy group.<br></div>

Not in the form of a direct price plan but what i have suggested in the form of coupons price discount for the really essential items like rice,that only after they are properly targeted to be really unable to cope with the cost of living will such coupons be given.Given that for most of such household,there will come a point in time where they will become better off (found a better paying job thru help after retraining,or maybe the children has finished their schooling and can help out in the household income),such a system can then be withdrawn from them.The main thing is that such a group should be closely tracked as i believe that most people of such a group are not lazy and if given adequate help,they may soon stand up on their own feet.<br><br>And about what you said of relocation,it is certainly irresponsible,these group of older workers contributed so much to what singapore is now.We really should not be encouraging them to leave for a cheaper country,they are still our fellow singaporeans.And to that,Mr Khaw Boon Wah certainly is very irresponsible by him claiming tht those who cannot afford the cost of living here will be given the choice to retire in retirement village in JB,Batam and bintan aka almost saying that if you cannot afford the cost here,you should go die else where</div>

What about transport, housing, healthcare and so on? Give out more welfare? Who's paying? Not me...<br><br>Those who cannot compete in a globalised economy will suffer a salary drop unless they emigrate to cheaper economies. That is a fact and unless people recognize the facts, you will not solve the problem.</div></blockquote>Well if the govt make better use of their tax collected,such an amount could actually be subsidied from there?eg the govt does so much unnecessary road work,digging up stuff and filling them in again,unnecessary changes to all the bus stops (there were quite a few such changes island wide a few years ago),spending unnessarily on plush goverment building,cutting back on minister's salary and lots more way that they govt did not make full efficient use of tax payer's money.<br><br>Also it is a fact that when GST was introduced,it shifted the tax burden of the country onto the poorer people,since in the first place when they were having very low income,they were not subjected to much income tax,so GST made them worst off,if cos of this,it subjected them to further hardship,should not more to made to help them?<br><br>Not solving the problem also does not means we should abandon our citizens who had worked hard during our Nation building years?</div>
