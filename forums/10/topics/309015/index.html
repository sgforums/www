              <p><strong>Desperate couple, drastic move <br>'Honey, quit work so we can buy flat'  <br>Reason: They won't exceed HDB's $8,000 income ceiling  <br>By Desmond Ng <br> <br>February 27, 2008</strong>       <br> <br>HE asked his wife-to-be to quit her job - just so that they could qualify to buy a new Housing Board (HDB) flat. <br>  <br>29 Jan, The New Paper <br>Sounds silly?</p>
              <p>Not if you consider today's HDB resale prices and the robust private property market.</p>
              <p>Right now, those with a household income above $8,000 would not qualify for a new HDB flat.</p>
              <p>Mr Christopher de Souza, Member of Parliament for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, cited the above example to The New Paper.</p>
              <p>He argued that the $8,000 income ceiling, which has remained unchanged for the last 14 years, should be revised.</p>
              <p>He declined to give more details about the couple.</p>
              <p>The 32-year-old lawyer said: 'Some people actually take the drastic step of making their wife-to-be stop work for a period so they can qualify for the ceiling.'</p>
              <p>He added that some people would accept a promotion at work, but declined a raise so they would remain below the income ceiling.</p>
              <p>'We need to address how realistic this ceiling is, considering that resale flats have become more expensive in recent years.'</p>
              <p>Mr de Souza raised this issue during the Budget debate yesterday and noted that many people in his age group have crossed the household income ceiling.</p>
              <p>He said: 'For a young couple, few things are harder or more ironic than having to slog for many years to pay off a huge mortgage for their first home, just because they worked hard and were given raises early in their careers.'</p>
              <p>Raising this income ceiling was one of Mr de Souza's three suggestions on how the Budget could achieve a better and more equitable distribution of the nation's wealth without discarding the principle of workfare and meritocracy.</p>
              <p>His other two suggestions were to invest resources to beautify Singapore's common spaces and to make the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme more sensitive to inflation rates.</p>
              <p>He noted that the last time HDB increased the income ceiling was in 1994, from $7,000 to $8,000.</p>
              <p>The Government's push to increase the population to 6.5 million by attracting new immigrants is creating a volatile property market where foreign buying or selling will affect prices, according to Citibank's Economics &amp; Market Analysis of June 2007.</p>
              <p>As can be seen with the HDB resale market, demand from foreign buyers trickles down the property chain, causing prices to go up for lower-end private property.</p>
              <p>Apart from rising property prices, another reason for reviewing the income ceiling is the growing number of households earning $8,000 or more per month, the MP said.</p>
              <p>FROM 11% to 20%</p>
              <p>Data from the General Household Survey shows that the proportion of households earning $8,000 and above has nearly doubled from about 11 per cent in 1995 to about 20 per cent in 2005.</p>
              <p>He asked: 'Is $8,001 per month per couple comfortable enough a wage to exclude them from subsidised first-time HDB property ownership, bearing in mind that the couple receives no WIS, less GST credits, faces a rising inflation rate and, more significantly, that the only other housing alternative is a pricey resale flat or private condo?'</p>
              <p>Mr de Souza questioned how a young couple could ever strive for 'work-life' balance if they are saddled with a back-breaking mortgage?</p>
              <p>He added: 'The husband and wife's pre-occupation will be to overcome the considerable debt and they are likely to decide that promotions at work are needed to achieve this.</p>
              <p>'Consequently, having children becomes a weaker priority than career.'</p>
              <p>The New Paper had questioned whether the $8,000 income ceiling should be raised in a report last month.</p>
              <p>The Housing Board replied then that it has no plans to raise the ceiling as the vast majority of Singaporean families qualified for subsidised public housing. <br> <br> </p>
