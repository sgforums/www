              <p>Btw according to Hongkong official statistics, their literacy rate is 94.5%. Calculated from the fact that 5.5% of the population has no education or pre primary schooling education.</p>

              <p>According to our statistics, our literacy rate is 95.7%.</p>
              <p>I dont know where does wikipedia got their stats but it seems like based on official statistics, our literacy rate is higher for those 15 years and above in 2007.</p>
              <p>Very simply put. This topic is stupid and pointless cos</p>
              <ol>
              <li>There is a difference between the official stats and wiki stats.</li>
              <li>Wiki stats are without reference.</li>
              </ol>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore there is no basis to compare and rank our system or unless the TS wanna go dig our official stats from different countries then rank them or get a list of ranking from a reputable source.</p>

              <p>Where did you get your figure of 225,000?</p>
              <p>So the BULK our 1950s immigrant generation are illiterate?</p>
              <p>But if you look back at the statistical tables year 2000, it shows 4.3% of 25-34 y.o. and 9.7% of 35-44 y.o. without qualification.</p>
              <p>25-34 y.o. without qualification = 4.3% = 24,013</p>
              <p>35-44 y.o. without qualification = 9.7% = 61,703</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So using 225,000 (your calculation), this figure already represents 38% of illiterates.</p>

              <p>My mistake 262 500 should be of illiterates from ur flawed stat by wiki. 7.5% of 3.5mil. Im not going to quote it again cos it is not accurate.</p>
              <p>Please share with me how u got ur figures?</p>

              <p>It's not the mistake of Wiki, it's your failure to understand which year the report was based and the population size (does it include citizens, permanent residents or non-residents). Do you know any of these? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>So you using 49.7% (2000 statistics) on which year's population size? My guess is you applied a year 2000 statistics on a year 2007 population size. You sure you had formal education in Singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>About the larger percentage of illiterates from 45-65 y.o., I thought I already explained that a large majority of these are from the early Chinese immigrant generation.</strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>This exclusion of immigrants and those not educated in English meant that, in the late 1940s, about one-half of Singapore's adult population was disenfranchised.</strong></p>

              <p>It's also not right to include the 45-49 y.o. as pre self governance era, because if they are 49 y.o. they would be 9 y.o. (school going age) when P4P won self governance (1959).</p>

This is because Singapore is a multi-ethnic society, and pressures from the Malays, another powerful group in the local setting who had a rivalry relation with the Chinese, hindered the British from being concessionary in Chinese school policy. In sharp contrast, in Hong Kong—a mono-ethnic Chinese society—the colonial regime, not under compulsion from other ethnic group, was more accommodating when dealing with Chinese schools.""</span></p>

              <p>Isn't it implicit in your statement that Hong Kong's success is due to effort from the British in promoting education there.</p>
              <p>e.g. Anthony was successful in his exams, Mr. Tan did very little to help Barry in his exams.</p>
              <p>From this example (similar to yours) it clearly shows that it's implicit that Mr. Tan help Anthony more than Barry, because it's in the same sentence.</p>
              <p>Then you post a totally non-relevant article from Emory to support a claim, to which I have yet to figure out.</p>

              <p>Growth rate of Singapore is 1.6% while HongKong growth rate was 1.0%.</p>
              <p>The local birthrate of Singapore is 10.0 per 1000 while the HongKong birthrates is 10.1 per 1000 people.</p>
              <p>The local death rate of Singapore is 4.5 per 1000 while hongkong is 5.6 per 1000 people.</p>
              <p>Considering that our birth rate is pretty similar with a difference of 0.1% and our death rate is lower by 1%, our growth rate by local residents birth alone would be similar (onli higher by a minute amount) than Hongkong's growth rate of 1.0% (for easy comparison, we ignore HK migration rate which is a natural pull. HK's is a modern city without attractive immigration policies. Anything more than HK's 1.0% while birth rate and death rate are nearly similar can be considered growth due to the extra pull factor by delibrately making immigration attractive.)</p>
              <p>Taking that our actual growth rate by birthrate and death rate is slightly above 1.0%, that means growth rate by migration to local residence status take account of onli slightly below 0.6% of that 1.6% growth. And of course, foreign talents whom are foreigners are out of the figures.</p>
              <p>Ur account on the rates are pretty inflated. While migration may play a role in the increase in literacy rate, it is not at such behemoth scale as u are trying to depict. </p>

              <p>Isn't it implicit in your statement that Hong Kong's success is due to effort from the British in promoting education there.</p>
              <p>e.g. Anthony was successful in his exams, Mr. Tan did very little to help Barry in his exams.</p>
              <p>From this example (similar to yours) it clearly shows that it's implicit that Mr. Tan help Anthony more than Barry, because it's in the same sentence.</p>
              <p>Then you post a totally non-relevant article from Emory to support a claim, to which I have yet to figure out.</p>

              <p>Sorrry for the misunderstanding. Using back the example, the reason for anthony success was never my aim to discuss.</p>
              <p>My point is simple. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr Tan did very little to help Barry in his exams</span></p>
              <p>The reason for anthony success was never my aim to discuss because even if to assume that Mr Tan helped anthony, we shouldnt expect the same result from Barry because of the very fact that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr Tan did little to help Barry</span>.</p>
              <p>To put the it another way.</p>
              <p>Even if to assume Mr Tan didnt help anthony but anthony was still successful. We shouldnt also rely on Mr Tan to make Barry successful because of the fact that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he didnt help Barry</span> and on another point that Anthony's success wasnt from Mr Tan.</p>

              <p><br>It was my error to have used total population in the literacy rate, I have enclosed calculations for approximate immigrants to Singapore adapted from the Department of Statistics. The figure is approximately 206,950 for 5 years (year 2001 to year 2006). What percentage composition does it play in our 2006 population? <strong>It's about 5.74% (206,950 / 3,608,500), this percentage exceeds the 3.5% increase in adult literacy rate from 2000 to 2007.</strong></p>
              <p>So my claim still holds, the increase in adult literacy rate is a result of mass influx of immigrants and not due to the good work of MOE. I can't deny that they were good in some way, but the 3.5% increase in adult literacy is just not due to their work.</p>

              <p>** At the time of doing up the spreadsheet, I wasn't aware that they also provided actual figures for crude birth rates and crude death rates, I only discovered the actual figures after I finished posting, I am too lazy to make all the necessary adjustments, both births and deaths are under declared in my calculations, I assume that they will cancel each other out. </p>

              <p><br>As shown above, the dramatic increase in adult literacy rate is a result of P4P's policy of increasing the local immigrant population, not a result of MOE's education policy within those 6 years.</p>
              <p>I am not discrediting the education system in Singapore, I am only giving credit when credit is due and credit is not due here because the increase in adult literacy is a consequence of mass immigration.</p>
              <p>Their policy of importing foreign immigrants is not a rarity, they have done so many a times in our sports sector. Have we not seen the import of foreign badminton players, table tennis players, soccer players and swimmers to boost the overall standard of the <strong>Singapore citizen team</strong>.</p>

              <p>Nobody's blaming the high adult illiteracy rate amongst the pre-1960 generation, I am merely suggesting that you shouldn't blame the high illiteracy rate on the British colonial government because these were immigrant generations. I think you look more self incriminating with your smiley after your request that we blame the older generation. A clear sign that MOE's education system failed to impart good social values consistent with respect for the elderly.</p>
              <p>Evidence to suggest that the British colonial government was not directly involved in the education of the pre-self governance generation, because these pre-1960s immigrants were here to seek work due to poverty in home country. The total population in 1947 was 938,100 and for 1957 it was 1,445,900, an increase of about 54% in population. </p>
