              <p>No maurizio. I think u misunderstand me. </p>
              <p>What i meant was that the chinese culture in China requires a different approach to Sex education as compared to the west. Liberal approach to sex education (which openly and unapologetically speak on the subject in lessons) as seen in the west may not yield the<strong> same result</strong> in china due to chinese conservatism. Therefore i was trying to point out that curiculum alone is not the sacred cow to the success of a education system. Social values held by the society plays a very important part too.</p>
              <p>I have here a news article to demostrate the impact of chinese conservative views on their sex education.</p>

              <p>I quote</p>
              <p><strong>''</strong>However, there is still <strong>much resistance against such education among parents even in some developed areas.</strong></p>
              <p>A random survey conducted by a local newspaper in Nanjing last December revealed that only 10 of 96 parents approved of sex education in school.<strong>''</strong></p>
              <p><strong>''</strong>A high school teacher in Beijing who requested anonymity admits most of her colleagues don't know or don't care about what students want on this topic. Many still feel the subject <strong>"too sensitive to handle,"</strong> she says.<strong>''</strong></p>
              <p>That piece news was reported in 2004 in which i believe situation is better now in China with more foreign influence.</p>
              <p>However the news article shows clearly that values hold by society must work hand in hand with the curiculum for it to work. The conservative view exist in the chinese society resulted in disapproval from the parents as while as the teachers whom cultural attitude resulted in the reluctance to discuss the topic openly therefore student got bored by their lessons.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>What makes you think we are not making headways in sex education? Do you have any empirical evidence to substantiate your claim? Is this snag a result of MOE's inability to properly train it's staff for the job?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I didnt say that sex education is not making headway. I said that moral education, national education and sex education are not moving far as anticipated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Perhaps this is where our MOE system failed because it's very rigid, it only prepares the individual to be successful without imparting moral, spiritual and cultural values.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Have u not learn anything from mother tongue classes and moral education lessons?Even in PE classes i learned the importance of teamwork and cooperation.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I believe the school and parents both have parts to play in the moral development of a child, it's not solely the responsibility of parents alone. The child spends 8-9 hours a days in school, whereas working parents will only get to spend 5-6 hours aday with the child.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>No i dont believe that the parents are solely responsible for the moral upbringing of the child too but i hold that the parent and society as a whole has a bigger responsibility than the school on the topic on morality.</p>

              <p><br>Can't help it if your write up is vague and subject to interpretation. What you have describe herein is a failure of implementation of the sex education syllabus, or maybe a failure of the syllabus, it's not a failure of the curriculum. Where do you think the ultimate failure lies in? The Chinese Education Ministry? Or in Singapore terms, the MOE. That's what you get when you get incompetent folks running the education machinery, they copy 100% the syllabus from other jurisdiction then implement it word for word without making adjustments.</p>
              <p>I quote from your source,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Also, "Nearly 70 per cent of them are not against premarital sexual experience, contrary to what is taught in class," the paper stated.</p>
              <p>The 17-year-old Lin, from Beijing's Huiwen High School, finds sex education classes boring, saying the teacher "just briefs us with terminology of sexual parts of the human body and then warns us not to engage in any love affair at such a young age."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Ask this of you? Do you not think there is a problem with the way sex education is implemented in schools? If there is a problem with the implementation of sex education, where does the fault lie. With the parents, society, students or the Ministry of Education?</p>
              <p>Parents belong to another era, a different era from their children and thus do not know about the sexual promiscuity of children these days. If you truly think that the parents were right in their views, then perhaps sex education should be scrap in China altogether. Too sensitive to handle? Then don't have sex education, no need to deal with STD, HIV, AIDS and unwanted pregnancy. If you think that the parents were wrong in their views and sex education should be implemented, then perhaps it's the implementation phase that lacks credibility, the fault of which lies with the Ministry of Education for not fostering teachers to deal with anticipated issues.</p>
              <p>I didn't know mother tongue (language) is equivalent to social studies. Sad to disappoint you, but during my time, there was no moral education. Teamwork and cooperation are not equivalent to moral or spiritual education. Teamwork and cooperation could also be learnt from copying your classmate's homework. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> But is it morally right.</p>

              <p>All of them plays apart in the teaching of sex education. As demostrated by my news article, the conservative value of the chinese society produced unsupportive parents, unmotivated teachers whom are uncomfortable in teaching the subject and students whom find the subject boring. If that social value will to change, we will see a whole new result with supportive parents at home doing the talking, eager and unapologetic teachers motivated to put up a interesting and engaging lesson and students benefiting from the attractive lessons.</p>

              <p>You blame the British administration on their attitude to local education? I don't know how this pan out, but do explain. As we know, the P4P government had a say in the educational process for the past 50 years. What has the British administration got to do with this?</p>
              <p>Do you have empirical evidence to claim that the British administration did not promote education in Singapore? You claim that the illiterates all belong to pre-independence generation. I already explain to you that both Singapore and Hong Kong adopted a British system, then Singapore under the guidance of MOE ended up with a lower adult literacy ratio than Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Isn't this similar to 2 Porsches initially running on Shell V-Power, one Porsche decided to stick on to Shell V-Power, while another switch to Caltex Techron. The Porsche still running on V-Power ended up travelling faster and further, whereas the Porsche running on Techron ended up slower and shorter. What can you tell from this analogy? The V-Power is a superior fuel compared to Techron. Similarly, the British system is superior to the MOE system.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Stupid - or smart?<br></strong>One view from Taiwan: They're good collectively, but individually they're lost. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Apr 23, 2006</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">SINGAPOREANS are affluent, educated, but are they really survival smart? <br>In a world of harsher living, this question that never dies has again grabbed the public focus here with a general election less than two weeks away. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">At the core of the debate: Without natural resources, the Singaporean increasingly has to depend on his own guile, not only a good education, to survive; has he got it? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It’s not a new debate. In the past decade, the Education Ministry has changed the education system to teach independent thinking and entrepreneurship to correct some fundamental defects in the average worker. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The average Singaporean is good at academic studies and works hard, but falls short on individual initiative and streetwise qualities, relying too much on the government for help. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Revisiting the debate is controversial Taiwan lawmaker Li Ao, who recently ranked Singaporeans rather lower in natural intelligence to the people in Taiwan and Hong Kong. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“Taiwanese are scoundrels, but lovable, Hong Kong people are craftier, (Chinese mainlanders are unfathomable) and Singaporeans are stupider,” he said, adding that it is partially due to genetics. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The original migrants who came here from China were of “poor stock”. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew once told Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping that the ethnic Chinese in Singapore were descendants of illiterate coolies and farmers from southern Fujian. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This had made them less able than the people of Hong Kong or Taiwan, whose ancestors were mainly businessman or technocrats. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Singaporeans could function well only as a group, not as individuals, Li told a Chinese newspaper. They would never be non-conformist or stand out above the crowd. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“If you ask me, other than Lee Kuan Yew, his son Hsien Loong, politicians aside, I can only think of a cute girl, (pop star) Stephanie Sun, there aren’t many other outstanding people. The impression that I get (of normal Singaporeans) is stupid”. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Singapore’s system, Li said, stemmed from the ancient Chinese political philosophy of legalism, which emphasised on the rule of law. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“Singaporeans do not break rules, but they also do not stand out,” he said in Mandarin. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">He said Lee Kuan Yew had wanted to build a British-style democracy but because the people were not up to scratch, they only knew how to toe the line. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">His report card on Singapore has shaken up the people at a time when election fever is rising, indirectly touching on a campaign issue – government control on society. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Predictably, Singaporeans have reacted angrily to the terms “stupid” and “poor genes”, dismissing them as a popularity stunt that takes no account of their successful, modern achievements. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This “genetic weakness” doesn’t aptly describe today’s diverse, more mature and worldly-wise generation. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But some critics say there is some truth in what Li said, but insist that the fault lies not in genes, but in years of political and social conditioning by a top-down government. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One writer however, said: “A better word to describe the Singaporean is naïve, which comes about because of a paternalistic and rather efficient government. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Everything is so structured and laid-out that the people do not need to fight for a living, blunting their ability to compete. They’re lulled into thinking the outside world also behave like Singapore.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Businessmen from Taiwan and Hong Kong are more alert to opportunities, as well as cheats, compared to even the capable Singaporeans, whose preoccupation is getting a high salary. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">They know where to take the short cuts when faced with a problem; Singaporeans will just sit and wait for better days. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Under the Lee Kuan Yew leadership, the collective good comes before the individual, so the republic’s success is a “collective creation”, Li added. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The individual is often lost on his own. It has led some critics to ask whether the Singaporean has an original viewpoint of his own beyond what the government says. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“I won’t say we are stupid. We are just not daring and street-smart,” commented a Singaporean studying abroad. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In his university, other Asian students would walk up to the microphone and talk about some cause, not the Singaporeans, he said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Li Ao is not alone in his views. Singaporean columnist Wong Lung Hsiang said it reflected what he heard in China that “Taiwanese are shameless, Hong Kongers are heartless, Singaporeans are ignorant”. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In Greater China, law-abiding Singaporeans have long been seen as gullible. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In a commentary in November last year, Wong advised Singaporeans to treasure their own system at home, “but when you are away, you should know how to adapt to others”. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What Chinese Singaporeans have inherited from their grandparents is peasant culture, explained “peasant judge” online. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“Peasants don’t care for much else except a bowl of rice on the table, a roof over their heads, and the chance to go out to the rice fields to do the daily back-breaking chores day in day out.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Politics, too, is affected. Almost everyone goes to the polls with his rice-bowl in mind. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It occupies the citizen’s mind a lot more than his counterparts in other countries, who are more passionate about issues like justice and equality. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“Just imagine, well-informed Singaporeans advocating a one-party rule, saying it is good for the future. If this is not stupidity, what is?’ asked redbean. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This could be a recipe for future trouble should a foreign predator one day use this character weakness to take over the country. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">All he needs to do to retain the people’s compliance is by keeping their stomach full and their mind empty. </span></p>

              <p>According to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Singapore has an adult literacy rate of 92.5% and is ranked 79th in the world. So Singapore has 7.5% of the population who are illiterate.</p>

              <p>Moreover, if you had an even higher literacy rate where folks are capable of engaging in critical and rational reasoning, this regime's survival would certainly come under grave threat. Hence, how can you expect the regime to shoot themselves in the foot?</p>

              <p><br>Robertteh, i believe the aim of paying our civil servant their high pay is so that the civil service is attractive enough to pull in a higher number of prospective civil servant and from this pool of candidates, they will choose the top talent. How it can actually prevent corruption is just perhaps a by catch of the main aim.</p>
              <p>True, our education system has produced antagonist such as wee shu mins but our education system has also produced people like gopalan, chee soon juan whom stand differently. Dont forget that our education system has produced particularly almost everyone of us here in Sgforums and education has a play on our thoughts, beliefs and aspiration.</p>
              <p>We may beg to differ on wee shu min ivory idea but we are the child of the same education system.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>All of them plays apart in the teaching of sex education. As demostrated by my news article, the conservative value of the chinese society produced unsupportive parents, unmotivated teachers whom are uncomfortable in teaching the subject and students whom find the subject boring. If that social value will to change, we will see a whole new result with supportive parents at home doing the talking, eager and unapologetic teachers motivated to put up a interesting and engaging lesson and students benefiting from the attractive lessons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Damm I didnt say that sex education should be scrap in China and neither did i say the parents were right. I said that social values should <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">work hand in hand</span></strong> with their curicullum to tackle the problem.</p>
              <p>See this as quoted:</p>
              <p>""However the news article shows clearly that values hold by <strong>society <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must work hand in hand</span> with the curiculum</strong> for it to work.""</p>
              <p> In fact, im calling the society to change it's mindset and work hand in hand with the new emphasis on sex education.</p>
              <p>U didnt learn values of fillial piety, respect, social responsibility in your chinese lessons? Your time has no moral education? I even have moral education examination and projects at secondary school damm.</p>

              <p><br>Suggest you read and understand what is the difference between a curriculum and syllabus before you make any more comments.</p>
              <p>The schools have a stronger role to play in imparting sex education to the students. You say the student's parents are unsupportive of sex education, the teachers unmotivated, how else would students know about sex education. You can't change the attitude of the parents, but you can change the mindset of the teachers, because they are under the control of the Ministry of Education.</p>
              <p>Well, from the way you are presenting your case, parents unsupportive, teachers unmotivated, how else do you intend to carry on the sex education drive.</p>
              <p>Social values take time to change, paradigms are not shifted overnight. Therefore a more likely course is to change the mindset of the teachers to teach sex education to students.</p>
              <p>You are "calling the society to change their mindset".  Alright, put in the the news and the Chinese will change their mindset overnight. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Even if the moral education was implemented, it does not mean 100% effective; way you have a course teaching Calculus, does it mean 100% will acquire the necessary skills.</p>

              <p>And for goodness sake, the administration is different in hong kong as compared to Singapore. We are on equal terms by name onli because the governor is different and their policies are different. The policy on education by the colonial masters in Singapore may be different from the masters in Hong kong. I have no details on hongkong's education policy during colonial time but by understanding that there is a difference in administration shows that there is no equal ground to compare.</p>

              <p><br>I think your dictionary definitions are right, but they are not complete. You only covered the learning areas (subjects) but not the values (morals &amp; ethics).

              <p>Ok. Then what makes you think that the British "didn't emphasized as much importance" of education? <strong>I do not have the statistics for the number of schools per population for the British period and MOE period, perhaps you could be so kind as to provide me with this information which you have obtained.</strong> The growth in schools now as compared to the past was a result of population growth, more population therefore more schools.</p>
              <p>Well, your <strong>guesstimate</strong> of the pre-independence generation making up the bulk of illiterates is <strong>wrong</strong>. Singapore Statistics has provided figures for the components of the highest educational attainment with age group. <strong>The post-independence generation illiterates (ages 35-44) makes up about 9.7% of the total population of Singapore in the year 2000. </strong>While those (post-independence generation) with primary school qualification make up 27.1% of the total population in the year 2000.</p>

              <p>Yes the British administration is different from the MOE's style; therefore doesn't this prove that the British Education system is far superior to MOE education system. Both Hong Kong and Singapore are quite similar, Singapore adopted MOE system whereas Hong Kong stayed they course with the British system till 1997. Hong Kong ended up with higher adult literacy rate than Singapore.</p>

              <p>U see any problems with the education here ? Frankly speaking I felt it is fine and people can get accepted in overseas university easily with the qualification u get from the studies here. If u talk about other form of education like taking care of yourself, I don't find singaporean stupid and cannot do tat. I think th problem is the longevity of singaporean is high, older generation r not literate and tat explains the figure. Otherwise u have to name me someone who is below 30 and cannot read and write. Personally, I don't know anyone who cannot read or write and is below 30</p>

              <p><br>Whether you know of anyone not being able to read or write is of little consequence to factual evidence from statistics. You only see a small portion of the 4.5 million population of Singapore, therefore your observation is not a true representation of the 4.5 million population. It's only a bias observation, because your social group is limited to your set of subjective criteria. <strong>Enclosed is the statistics of illiterates post-independence (ages 35-44 y.o.) for the year 2000, it shows that 9.7% of the total population in Singapore has No Qualification and 27.1% of the total population with Primary School Qualification.</strong></p>

              <p><br>Their inability to participate in critical and rational reasoning is prima facie that our education system if flawed. I guess this handicap works in the favour of the ruling P4P government, they should promote such handicap to ensure their continued dominance.</p>

              <p><br>It clearly shows that the curiculum alone cant do much impact without strengtening social values. In my opinion moral education is running up a steep slope in Singapore due to the erosion of social values.</p>
              <p>And if our syllabus is flawed due to the occurence of kids scolding their parents, then the british civic education system that u pointed out must be flawed too, they have their own share of problems which sure include petty things like ignoring their grandparents.</p>
              <p>just a link to demostrate the above point</p>

              <p>I like to ask which society doesnt have it's fair share of maid beating, rape, lack of filial piety and even treason? So i think it's wrong for u to conveniently label the syllabus just because we have some of the unfortunate occurence.</p>
