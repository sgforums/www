              <p>Well, your <strong>guesstimate</strong> of the pre-independence generation making up the bulk of illiterates is <strong>wrong</strong>. Singapore Statistics has provided figures for the components of the highest educational attainment with age group. <strong>The post-independence generation illiterates (ages 35-44) makes up about 9.7% of the total population of Singapore in the year 2000.</strong> While those (post-independence generation) with primary school qualification make up 27.1% of the total population in the year 2000.</p>

              <p>Please look at the table again.</p>
              <p>Look at the the year 1990. In 1990 about <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">50% of the people</span></strong> whose age is 45-54 (that means these group of people are of age <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">55 to 64 in 2000</span></strong>) are without education.</p>
              <p>Lets consider that that the pre independence generation would be above the age of 56 (considering them 5 years and above after 1957). We see that just between the age of 55 to 64, <strong>half of them are without education</strong>. Looking at how the figure for people without education rise up as age increase, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">figure will be higher for those that are 64 years old and above</span>.</p>
              <p>It clearly shows that the pre-independence group of people are significantly higher in terms of no education (49.7% for those 55 to 64 years old as compare to 19.8 for those 45-54 ) and thus brought forward my theory that they the pre independence people (56 years old and above) may form the bulk of the illiterates.</p>
              <p>Not only that, those figures shows that the <strong>proportion of educated individual increase as the age group lowers</strong>. <strong>It means that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more of the population had at least basic education after independence</span></strong>. Since the figures are of percentage, it has nothing to do to population growth and whatsoever.</p>
              <p>Why the percentage of educated individual in the population group grew exponentially after independence? <strong>Isnt it because the post independence govt place much more importance than the pre independence govt in the establishment of education?<br></strong></p>
              <p>An elder's view on this matter about the lack of british support for education during colonial days.</p>
              <p>A blog entry by the late Dr Lee Kum Tatt:</p>
              <p><strong>Education Policy in Singapore during the colonial era<br><br></strong>'''There was no education policy for development in Singapore and Malaya during my grandparents’, parents’ and my own early days. British policies during the colonial period in Singapore and Malaya were meant primarily to serve British interest. The demand for education was not widespread because of the cost which the poor could not afford. Parents prefer that their children work to supplement household income or do household chores, especially the girls. Still the supply did not meet the demand for more education. Under these conditions voluntarism had been an integral feature of British colonial education policy. The colonial government only set up a few primary and secondary schools for those who could afford or some, like my parents, who were prepared to make personal sacrifices for their children’s education.'''</p>

Both Hong Kong and Singapore are quite similar, Singapore adopted MOE system whereas Hong Kong stayed they course with the British system till 1997.

              <p><br>It clearly shows that the curiculum alone cant do much impact without strengtening social values. In my opinion moral education is running up a steep slope in Singapore due to the erosion of social values.</p>
              <p>And if our syllabus is flawed due to the occurence of kids scolding their parents, then the british civic education system that u pointed out must be flawed too, they have their own share of problems which sure include petty things like ignoring their grandparents.</p>

              <p>I like to ask which society doesnt have it's fair share of maid beating, rape, lack of filial piety and even treason? So i think it's wrong for u to conveniently label the syllabus just because we have some of the unfortunate occurence.</p>

              <p>Curriculum can't make impact unless social values are strengtened? In case you still can't grasp the idea, a school child's main source of influence are his school mates. They don't have many other sources of external influence. Almost 50% (8-9 hours) of their waking hours are spent in schools. How else do you suggest you change social values, other than to start them when they are young. It's harder to change values in adults because their values are already etched into their mind.</p>
              <p><br>Your points only seek to discredit the UK system, if their system has flaws, that doesn't mean our system of education surpassed them. The link you posted is also a moot point, there are people two sides in the argument, hardly conclusive. There must be distinction in your comparison between morality between the general population and morality between specific criminals.</p>

              <p>In year 2000, the percentage of adults with no qualification after P4P gain power. Singapore gained self government under the P4P government in 1959, they have the right to enforce policies except military (which was still under the jurisdiction of the UK government).</p>
              <p>The figures below are the perentages of age groups with no qualification after P4P gain parliamentary power and self governnance.</p>

              <p>35-44 y.o.-----9.7%</p>
              <p>45-49 y.o.-----9.9% (In 1960, those born in 1950 will be 10 y.o. primary 3-4) {approx}</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Shocking isn't it, MOE's system resulted in 10% of the population in 2 age groups without qualification. Maybe it's the result of teachers and principals, convincing the students to quit because they can't make the grades and might cause school averages to drop. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>More interestingly, why is there a 4.3% of 25-34 y.o. without basic education.</p>

              <p><br>Two system might be different, but it doesn't mean no comparison can be made; we are comparing the product (resultant) of the 2 system. Although a Mazda RX-8 and a Porsche 911 Carrera run on different types of engine, but we can make comparisons in handling, top speed, fuel consumption and century dash. I don't know the kind of education system you go through that forbids comparision between 2 different system.</p>
              <p>Gosh! With your kind of logic, we probably can't compare lots of other things. We probably can't compare GDP per capita between Switzerland and Singapore, because both have different system of governance. We probably can't compare the different level of creativity between Japanese students and Singapore students, because they have different education system. What's the point of all those Maths Olympiad? Don't they know that we can't compare the knowledge of these students in the many different system. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>35-44 y.o.-----9.7%</p>
              <p>45-49 y.o.-----9.9% (In 1960, those born in 1950 will be 10 y.o. primary 3-4) {approx}</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Shocking isn't it, MOE's system resulted in 10% of the population in 2 age groups without qualification.</p>

              <p>The table had shown the very significant. 49.7% for those 55 to 64 years old are without education (and mind u that this generation of people belong to the days of our colonial government).

              <p>Their ability to reduce the number of people without education from 50% to 10% in 8 years time (considering those 49 years old were 5 years old at that time from 1957 - the birth of MOE) is shockingly remarkable.</p>

              <p>An interesting finding for all on some mistakes.</p>
              <p>It seems like the british colonial leaders started their major education policy reform only after world war 2 in 1946 with a 10 year education programme. Considering that Singapore gain full internal independence in 1959, the drop in 50% to 30% is not entirely the work of MOE as believed by me. Got to give the british some credit in their policy reform in 1946 but some credit to MOE too as the age of the median portion in the group of 45-54 yo in 1959 (2 years from MOE birth) is 9 years old.</p>
              <p>As MOE under PAP started after 1959, i wont give all credit to the PAP leadership also.</p>
              <p>But if we look further into the chart, a drop from 19.8 % those without education in the 45-54 yo group to 9.7% in 35-44 yo group and the drop from 9.7% to 4.3% subsequent for the next 10 year is probably the work of MOE under PAP entirely.</p>
              <p>The initial 60% drop of 50% to 30% of the population by the combined effort of the british and the local independent government is good. Remarkable it is but it is a startup figure in which large changes after a vacuum are expected. The subsequent 50% drop from 19.8 % to 9.7% in the next ten years followed up a consistent 50% drop from 9.7% to 4.3% in the next ten years after is remarkable for a single government.</p>

              <p>Why the bulk of illiterates in Singapore could be from the generation under the british rule?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to wiki, 7.5% of our population are illiterates. That translate to 225000 people.</p>
              <p>According to our statistics, there are 305500 pple above 65 years old.</p>
              <p>Considering that sources available out there suggested that education policy was extremely poor to the extend of 'minimal'. <strong>305500 people alive today lived their youth during the time with minimal emphasis on education</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>If </strong>we will to say that a good proportion of that 305500 people are illiterates, they will form the bulk of the 225000 illiterates in our country today. I have no proof on that, but it is a possibility after looking at the above findings.</p>
              <p>It is strange to blame the PAP government for the amount of illiterates despite extensive effort to improve education in Singapore while keeping a blind eye to the lack of british support before 1946.</p>

              <p><strong>Education Policy in Singapore during the colonial era<br><br></strong>'''There was no education policy for development in Singapore and Malaya during my grandparents’, parents’ and my own early days. British policies during the colonial period in Singapore and Malaya were meant primarily to serve British interest. The demand for education was not widespread because of the cost which the poor could not afford. Parents prefer that their children work to supplement household income or do household chores, especially the girls. Still the supply did not meet the demand for more education. Under these conditions voluntarism had been an integral feature of British colonial education policy. The colonial government only set up a few primary and secondary schools for those who could afford or some, like my parents, who were prepared to make personal sacrifices for their children’s education.'''</p>

Go compare with other figures within the same chart, the <strong>largest difference</strong> within the same group over time is just 6%.

So now you want to compare political systems? What's your logic for bringing in political system? Care to elaborate.</p>

              <p>An interesting finding for all on some mistakes.</p>
              <p>It seems like the british colonial leaders started their major education policy reform only after world war 2 in 1946 with a 10 year education programme. Considering that Singapore gain full internal independence in 1959, the drop in 50% to 30% is not entirely the work of MOE as believed by me. Got to give the british some credit in their policy reform in 1946 but some credit to MOE too as the age of the median portion in the group of 45-54 yo in 1959 (2 years from MOE birth) is 9 years old.</p>
              <p>As MOE under PAP started after 1959, i wont give all credit to the PAP leadership also.</p>
              <p>But if we look further into the chart, a drop from 19.8 % those without education in the 45-54 yo group to 9.7% in 35-44 yo group and the drop from 9.7% to 4.3% subsequent for the next 10 year is probably the work of MOE under PAP entirely.</p>
              <p>The initial 60% drop of 50% to 30% of the population by the combined effort of the british and the local independent government is good. Remarkable it is but it is a startup figure in which large changes after a vacuum are expected. The subsequent 50% drop from 19.8 % to 9.7% in the next ten years followed up a consistent 50% drop from 9.7% to 4.3% in the next ten years after is remarkable for a single government.</p>

              <p>According to wiki, 7.5% of our population are illiterates. That translate to 225000 people.</p>
              <p>According to our statistics, there are 305500 pple above 65 years old.</p>
              <p>Considering that sources available out there suggested that education policy was extremely poor to the extend of 'minimal'. <strong>305500 people alive today lived their youth during the time with minimal emphasis on education</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>If</strong> we will to say that a good proportion of that 305500 people are illiterates, they will form the bulk of the 225000 illiterates in our country today. I have no proof on that, but it is a possibility after looking at the above findings.</p>
              <p>It is strange to blame the PAP government for the amount of illiterates despite extensive effort to improve education in Singapore while keeping a blind eye to the lack of british support before 1946.</p>

              <p>25-34 y.o. without qualification = 4.3% = 24,013</p>
              <p>35-44 y.o. without qualification = 9.7% = 61,703</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So using 225,000 (your calculation), this figure already represents 38% of illiterates.</p>

              <p>Your first link to Emory didn't provide any conclusive evidence that the British promoted education more fervently in Hong Kong than in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your second link was more interesting, you post the blog of this old man in his 70s 0r 80s, saying <strong>''There was no education policy for development in Singapore and Malaya during my grandparents’, parents’ and my own early days." </strong>It's currently 2008, less 75 years and less 22 for his parents and another 22 for his grandparents. It might be the same British colony, but is it the same century? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>In those days in the 1930s, I doubt there was any affirmative education system. In those days, I heard from my parents, education was free, you just have to get your butt to school. If you have a primary school education in those days, you should be quite proud of your achievements.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should also differentiate from the author's definition of "educational policy" and access to free public education.</p>
