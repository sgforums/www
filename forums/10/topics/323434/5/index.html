              <p>Nobody's blaming the high adult illiteracy rate amongst the pre-1960 generation, I am merely suggesting that you shouldn't blame the high illiteracy rate on the British colonial government because these were immigrant generations. I think you look more self incriminating with your smiley after your request that we blame the older generation. <strong>A clear sign that MOE's education system failed to impart good social values consistent with respect for the elderly</strong>.</p>
              <p>Evidence to suggest that the British colonial government was not directly involved in the education of the pre-self governance generation, because these pre-1960s immigrants were here to seek work due to poverty in home country. The total population in 1947 was 938,100 and for 1957 it was 1,445,900, an increase of about 54% in population. </p>

              <p>Im am putting the blame on the british colonial leader for their lack of education promotion in Singapore thus resulting in a low literacy rate in our elderly. Putting the blame on the elderly? U must be seriously joking. Look at my very first reply in this thread.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Not to say that our education system is the best. I like to ask which group do the bulk of our illiterates belong to. The post independence generation whom should benefit from MOE or elderly people whom are still alive<strong> but lived their youth under the leadership of a different time</strong>?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You should not find safe grounds in ur immigrant theory.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Singapore is a immigrant society with immigrants coming in since the early 19th Century. Many had resided in Singapore forming family and children. For the fact that there were at that time a number of privately aided school demostrated this point that there were born-in-Singapore generation at that time. The British in their lukewarm (overstatement) attitude with education in Singapore failed to educate the mass of this generation. This created a sizable education vacuum for a portion of those born (still alive today) in 1920 to 1945 because very weak education policy.</li>
              <li>Not all of the working immigrants pouring into Singapore that time were illiterates. The problem with china is that opportunities were little for all be it you have education or not.</li>
              <li>The exponential increase in population between 1947 and 1957 was due to the post war baby boom which was seen later as a problem. Migration play a part because of the destruction in China as well as subsequent civil unrest. But then again, not all migrants are illiterates and remember how many children each family unit can produce during that baby boom.</li>
              </ol>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if the immigration theory is true. The the bulk of illiterates in Singapore shouldnt be the result of our education system but the result of the large amount of illiterates migrating to Singapore during our pre independent time.</p>

              <p><br>As shown above, the dramatic increase in adult literacy rate is a result of P4P's policy of increasing the local immigrant population, not a result of MOE's education policy within those 6 years.</p>
              <p><strong>I am not discrediting the education system in Singapore</strong>, I am only giving credit when credit is due and credit is not due here because the increase in adult literacy is a consequence of mass immigration.</p>
              <p>Their policy of importing foreign immigrants is not a rarity, they have done so many a times in our sports sector. Have we not seen the import of foreign badminton players, table tennis players, soccer players and swimmers to boost the overall standard of the <strong>Singapore citizen team</strong>.</p>

              <p>I agree with u that migration had probably a large role in our latest literacy spike but i will still give alot of credit the MOE system considering that it have reduced the amount of iliterates by half every ten years for those post independent babys right up to 1983 as demostrated in this chart.</p>

              <p>I said that there is no point using the wikipedia's ranking  as a tool to discredit the system here and u said that you were not discrediting the education system.</p>
              <p>Let' see if your words are all that objective.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Singapore Best Education System Ranked 79 in Adult Literacy</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>the most important quote being very suggestive that our education system has a link to the low literacy rate (in which of course is outdated).</p>
              <p> A more objective statement would be <strong>'Singapore ranked 79 in Adult literacy, what went wrong?</strong>' isnt it?. U didnt, u directly linked the disappointing rate to our system, trying to disgrace it by turning a blind eye to our disadvantageous demographic and historical factors which  lead to a lower literacy rate than other countries.</p>
              <p>So lets look at other examples of how u try to disgrace the MOE.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Perhaps this is where our MOE system failed because it's very rigid, it only prepares the individual to be successful without imparting moral, spiritual and cultural values.</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p>Obviously the syllabus is flawed, because we have comments from forumers about kids these days scolding their parents, beating their maid and ignoring their grandparents.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You failed to realise that moral and civic education is part of our curicullum and was quick to say that MOE system failed. Then u still try to rob the repute of MOE by picking out superficial social problems as if are absent in other countries.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Their inability to participate in critical and rational reasoning is prima facie that our education system if flawed. I guess this handicap works in the favour of the ruling P4P government, they should promote such handicap to ensure their continued dominance.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>then later u conveniently bring in the personal flaw of forumners here to the failure of our education system while conveniently ignore the fact that you (i assume) in your high wisdom and those that supported you in your stand had a Singaporean education too.</p>
              <p>Of course u nv fail to pull in the PAP.</p>
