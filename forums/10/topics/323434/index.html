              <p>According to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Singapore has an adult literacy rate of 92.5% and is ranked 79th in the world. So Singapore has 7.5% of the population who are illiterate.</p>

              <p><br>Your initial contention was that of Singapore being under British rule, therefore it wasn't able to achieve a higher literacy rate, that's why I brought up Hong Kong (which was under British rule till 1997), it achieve a higher level of literacy rate than Singapore.</p>
              <p>Don't get confused with adult literacy rate with tertiary education, it's two totally different issues. I have no doubts that Cuba has more literate adults, but they might not be graduates.</p>
              <p>Literacy rate might not play a 100% role in a country's education system, but it does play some role in determining a country's education system. If say the percentages are 50%, would you still think that our country's education system is doing a good job?</p>

              <p><br>When you said issues like social education should be dealt with at home, you might be wrong. A holistic education system is one that encompasses a wide range of subjects, from learning to be healthy, being good citizens, playing a part in society, etc. Maybe that is what's wrong with our MOE system of education.</p>

              <p><br>Thank you for the curriculum. Your posts are always filled with good findings and information.</p>
              <p>I like to point out that while curriculum directs the education process, it is not a sacred cow in which it alone cannot shape the whole education result.</p>
              <p>For example, the liberal approach in the sex education curriculum seen in the west may not yield the same result if put in place in China. The curriculum may be shaped for the best interest of educating the society but the approach may not fit into the culture of the society. The conservative society of china may too apprehensive to accept that approach in teaching.</p>
              <p>Sex education, moral education, national education are not something new in our curriculum but yet we are not moving far as anticipated. My take is that our society is still way back in our cultural understanding. You can definitely teach students to give up their seats for the people whom need them most. These are little cultural introductions will work little by little within our generation but not in large broad steps because our society on the whole doesnt practise such courtesy. Learn all you can at school about giving ur seats but people around you including your family members are not practising it. How much impact can the school alone bring about on such issues?</p>
              <p>The curriculum and society must work hand in hand. As much as the school can teach us on courtesy, only our parents have the true authority to tell us to behave ourselves.</p>

              <p>Correct, GCE is an examination system. But the examination dictates our curicullum. Although some of the curicullum were modified for Singapore, we still follow the bulk which therefore link our education process somewhat to the british education system and not the american or the swiss.</p>
              <p>Hong kong and Singapore were under the british but were under 2 different administration so how to compare? For example by 1865 Hongkong was a financial focal point in Asia, what was Singapore doing? After independence, we struggle to stay afloat by ourselves while hong kong float with a british life raft, so i think it is very unfair to say that we have a common parentage.</p>

              <p>Sex education is subject to cultural bias no doubt. But are you saying that China should forsake sex education just because of cultural bias. China's inability to implement it's sex education is a result of the older generation inability to adapt to changes in attitude to sexual practices. It's an implementation problem, it's not a curriculum error. If they discover that it's due to teachers' inability to teach sex education to teenagers, then they should do some corrective action to rectify the fault and not simply throwing out the sex education syllabus for teenagers.</p>

              <p>Perhaps this is where our MOE system failed because it's very rigid, it only prepares the individual to be successful without imparting moral, spiritual and cultural values.</p>
              <p>MOE's system is very examination focused, the sole objective is to get good grades for exams. But the education of a child for the future goes beyond just having good grades. Something that MOE lacks foresight and understanding.</p>
              <p>I believe the school and parents both have parts to play in the moral development of a child, it's not solely the responsibility of parents alone. The child spends 8-9 hours a days in school, whereas working parents will only get to spend 5-6 hours aday with the child.</p>

              <p>Correct, GCE is an examination system. But the examination dictates our curicullum. Although some of the curicullum were modified for Singapore, we still follow the bulk which therefore link our education process somewhat to the british education system and not the american or the swiss.</p>
              <p>Hong kong and Singapore were under the british but were under 2 different administration so how to compare? For example by 1865 Hongkong was a financial focal point in Asia, what was Singapore doing? After independence, we struggle to stay afloat by ourselves while hong kong float with a british life raft, so i think it is very unfair to say that we have a common parentage.</p>

              <p>There is a difference between curriculum and examination?</p>
              <p>Examination is a subset of curriculum, curriculum is not a subset of examination.</p>
              <p>By saying that you are telling us that MOE only produces exam focused individuals with no regards for morals or society. It's scary to hear of such education system, who knows, we might produce another Hitler or worse still another LKY.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.pmetb.org.uk/fileadmin/user/Communications/Publications/PMETB_what_is_curriculum.pdf">As with most things in education, there is no agreed definition of ‘curriculum’, although it is generally agreed that ‘curriculum’ is not the same as ‘syllabus’. A syllabus is a statement of topics to be studied in the course. A ‘curriculum’ equally is not just a statement of intended outcomes, products, or competencies.</a></p>

              <p>I am comparing MOE system to the existing British system we would have adopted if not for LKY. We were under the British system before, Hong Kong continued with the British system till 1997. If our MOE's system had been superior in form and substance, wouldn't we have out ranked Hong Kong in their British system, instead we fall behind.</p>
              <p>But the crux of your argument lies with the post and pre indepedence.</p>

              <p>Not to say that our education system is the best. I like to ask which group do the bulk of our illiterates belong to. The post independence generation whom should benefit from MOE or elderly people whom are still alive but lived their youth under the leadership of a different time?</p>

              <p>FYI, the GDP per Capita for both Hong Kong and Singapore in the 1950s were approximately $2,500 (Singapore about afew hundred dollars less than Hong Kong). Perhaps if we had stayed our ground with the British our accomplishments would have surpassed that of LKY's administration. LKY's bid for independence from the British was akin to the adage, out of the frying pan and into the fire.</p>
