              Chee asks about YOG during walkabout, Bala evades      
              Sunday, 23 January 2011  
              Singapore Democrats
              
              During our weekend walkabout this morning at the Bukit Timah Food and Market Centre, the Singapore Democrats chanced upon a bunch of PAP ministers and members who were also out for their campaign. 
              
              Billed as a 'ministerial visit', no less than four ministers descended upon the Holland-Bukit Timah GRC to meet with the morning crowd. Joining Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Mr Lim Swee Say (who are MPs at the GRC) were Mr Ng Eng Hen (Education Minister) and Ms Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Minister of State for Community, Youth and Sports).
              
              Coursing through the tables at the hawker centre, the Ministers did their utmost to avoid a face-to-face encounter with the Democrats who were out selling our newspaper The New Democrat. 
              
              At one point, however, Minister for MCYS Dr Vivian Balakrishnan came in front of Dr Chee Soon Juan and the two men exchanged pleasantries. Dr Balakrishnan then asked if the SDP was going to contest in the GRC. 
              
              "It looks like it," Dr Chee replied. "I think there are some issues that the voters here would be concerned about, don't you think?"
              
              The PAP man did know what Dr Chee was referring to. 
              
              "I'm talking about the YOG and how you mishandled it so badly," Dr Chee clarified. 
              
              "We'll talk about it at the appropriate time," Dr Balakrishnan evaded. 
              
              "I'm sure we will," Dr Chee assured before resuming his rounds.  
              
              Also present were SPH reporters who were, of course, on hand to report on the ministers' rounds. Several asked if the SDP was going to contest Holland-Bukit Timah. 
              
              They also repeatedly asked if we knew that the ministers were visitng the area this morning. It may come as a surprise, but the SDP has its own programme which doesn't quite revolve around where the ministers go. The Singapore Democrats have been visiting the various areas in the Holland-Bukit Timah and Bishan-Toa Payoh GRCs for the last couple of years in preparation for the coming general elections. 
              
              We continue to work hard on the ground to get our message across to the electorate. Singaporeans need a party in Parliament that is not afraid to ask the hard and necessary questions about policies that harm the people and this nation. These include the continuing escalation of the cost of living in Singapore and the immigration policy that encourages the displacement of Singaporean workers by foreigners.

              <p>According to Online Citizen, Bala have been moved around like rubbish. This cannot do, that cannot do, and his crocodile tears for YOG volunteers, truly worthy of a hypocrite. He's good only in acting, starting criticizing gov policies then become minster. Should join MediaCorpse instead.</p>

              <p>Eh, if you are suggesting they talk about bread and butter issues, then these issues should be dealt with directly by the incumbent party since they are the government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fact that you raised these issues means that the government is not doing a good job in even the most basic of their responsibilities to the citizens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are always other issues that other parties can choose to focus on.</p>

              <p>Just because they don't raise certain issues does not mean they don't care about them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>If more alternative party members get voted into parliament this election, it will not be because of what the alternative parties do but rather what the incumbent party has done in the last few years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All the incumbent party had to do was listen to the people and serve the people better, but no, they decided to go for short term monetary gains.</p>

              <p><br>Nah.... no civil servants will lose their job overnight.  In fact, 90% of them could be very happy cos the remaining 10% who sit up there, do nothing, play golf and go spa everyday and yet get the fatest bonus, suffering from seriously real pay cut.</p>

              <p>How can singapore becomes what it is today if both the opposition and the government were shaking legs and did nothing??</p>
              <p>We are what we are today because the ruling party had ruled us for many decades. Many things were done, some were good, some screwed up, some i don't like, some you don't like, some others don't like.</p>
              <p>Singapore is prosperous now, but the gap between the rich and the poor are higher; properties prices, including HDB have been going up, it pleases the owners, but the first time house seekers say 'suck'; we got more aircon food courts now but the prices are higher than those days in hawker centers; we now got an extensive MRT networks but the car prices have gone high; we now got universal studio instead of amusement park but many think this is for tourists; we now have the prc cha bor to serve coffee 24 hr in copitiam so that the singaporean ah soh can watch tv at home, but many thinks we should stop the immigrants from coming in; many people don't even want to learn their mother tongue but continue to complain that singapore got no culture; .......</p>
              <p>The ruling party has done many things, some like them, some don't; Among the oppositions, some like Low, Chiam, and Sylvia have earned their respect, from the electorate AND the even the PAP, some oppositions, suck as CSJ have lost their pants....those who have anything to say, need to speak up, the people will decide if they can provide answers or if they even know what are the problem. </p>

              <p>i mean it the first time we held YOG, but generally the participants of YOG feedback is good.</p>
              <p>i means organising such a big events we shouldnt expect perfection. instead of grumbling over petty issues. maybe we should concentrate on tackling and holding the person who propose responsible what benefits it bring to singapore.</p>
