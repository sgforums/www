                  about this NMP. Just recently, a Swedish politician, Johan Skarendal,
                  was in town trying to finance certain political causes in Singapore.
                  And yes, you guessed it! This Swede met up with Kum Hong, Stuart Koe,
                  Leong Sze Hian, Peter Cuthbert Low and others, and promised to finance
                  their gay and other rights projects in our little red dot.<br> <br> This would not be a tale of guns for hire if Kum Hong and his posse had
                  righteously rejected the thick wads of money stuffed in the saddlebags
                  under their noses, cash that is so precious now when there is recession
                  doom and gloom looming over our heads. Our NMP, champion of gay rights,
                  defender of the marginalized, not only greedily accepted the offer, but
                  asked for more as he said his rights projects in Singapore are legion.<br> <br> Oh NMP, what have you done? Are you just a hired gun?" </span></span></p>
              <p> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Originally Posted by edmwcsi<br> So NMP Siew is not only involved with gay rights movement but also Chee and SDP's human rights movement?<br> <br> Finally SDP found a way to get one of their guys into Parliament! Through the back door NMP way (no pun intended!).  <br> <br> I dont know why you are intent on dragging the SDP down with Siew Kum Hong.<br> <br> The SDP has been working with Johan Skarendal since i believe 2003.
                  Siew kum hong has just popped into the scene only 2 yrs ago. Who is the
                  likely mole here?</span></p>

              <p>NMP Siew Kum Hong says it is not true and has made a Police report.</p>
              <p><a href="http://siewkumhong.blogspot.com/2009/05/line-has-been-crossed.html">http://siewkumhong.blogspot.com/2009/05/line-has-been-crossed.html</a></p>
              <p>The line has been crossed<br>The attacks have continued since my last posting on this blog. In particular, the latest attacks have alleged and/or insinuated that (a) I asked for and am receiving foreign funding from a Swedish politician, who allegedly funds the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) as well, and (b) I am involved or associated with the SDP and may be their representative or “mole” in Parliament.</p>
              <p>Both of these allegations are untrue and false. They are vile, vicious and malicious attacks on me, and nothing short of character assassination. I consider them extremely defamatory and criminal in nature.</p>
              <p>I did not at any time ask for, and have not at any time been offered or accepted, any sort of funding from any local or foreign entity, including the Swedish politician named in the latest attack. The only sources of income (or funding) that I have, are my employer and the Government of Singapore (in the form of my monthly NMP allowance). Furthermore, I am not involved or affiliated or associated, whether directly, indirectly or in any other way, with the SDP, and am certainly not their representative or “mole” in Parliament.</p>
              <p>While I have not previously taken any action in response to the attacks to me on the Internet, I feel that this latest attack crosses the line and goes beyond any attacks that I am willing to countenance as being fair game for a public figure. I do not think that it is appropriate or acceptable for any MP, including an NMP, to accept any funding, whether local or foreign.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, I made a police report on this matter tonight. I have also requested those forums that I am aware are currently hosting these falsehoods, to take them down.</p>
              <p>In the interests of full transparency, I did meet with certain Swedish gentlemen recently. Details of those meetings are set out in my statement to the police. I met them at their request, just as I have met other foreigners from time to time, including staff from the various High Commissions and embassies in Singapore (such as from Australia, the US, the UK and other EU countries) and visiting foreigners, such as academics doing research on aspects of Singapore. At these meetings, we discuss matters related Singapore, in particular current affairs and the political situation in Singapore. From my perspective, these meetings are to help the foreigners obtain a better understanding of Singapore. I do not think that there was anything wrong with those meetings, and I have nothing to hide.</p>
              <p>While I continue to believe that it is, on the whole, beneficial for Singaporeans to speak up for what they believe in, and I certainly hope that this wish and desire will continue and extend beyond the current discussions around the NMP re-nomination process and homosexuality, I also do believe -- and have always believed -- that rights and freedoms have limits.</p>
              <p>I have to date refrained from taking any legal action in response to the lies and falsehoods that have been levelled at me. But this latest attack goes beyond anything that a reasonable person could possibly perceive as being a valid or legitimate exercise of the right to free speech, and I certainly will not tolerate the latest rounds of character assassination from cowards hiding behind the perceived anonymity of the Internet.</p>
