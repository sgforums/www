Partly people themselves are often divided and lacking cohesive views about what is a good government. So they tend to split on minor issues and problems with different camps holding different views.<br><br>We the citizens are not taking over the government. We cannot hope to influence anyone to vote for us to form the government when we post here because we are just giving our two cents worth.<br><br>On certain occasions I feel that I need to give a substantial reply to debunk long-standing hypocrisy I will write long.<br><br>Other than this I will write short messages as I have done many times.<br><br>So please do not feel too sensitive about my views and just ignore them if not to your liking.<br><br>I do wish the government will change soon to be more people-friendly in all its doings so that we the citizens do not have to belabor so much here to try to correct their self-centredness and hypocrisy to get away from wrong doings or accountability to problems.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A leader who gets his way with wit and charisma is good to have on the first day of nationhood because apart from such external qualities and showmanship people cannot really judge how good a person is.<br><br>The problem is that we have gone through some 20 years with such charismatic leadership talk using a lot of concepts and assumptions which could not be proven but only hoped for without real substance. Rhetorics and conceptual leadership alone did not seem to be able to fulfill the next stage goals - to upgrade the economic competitiveness to value-adding technology-driven economy after the more dynamic action-oriented old guards were made to retire in power game.<br><br>What we have seen was only continuous empty talks about talents and leadership and all the taxing and charging back for everything until people are struggling with 3 meals and mortgages so something has seriously gone wrong.<br><br>Singapore has given many chances to the first-generation charismatic leadership based on concepts and assumptions but did not see results yet.<br><br>How to tell man from the boys and get more action men like Goh Keng Swee or Toh Chin Chye or Lim Kim San to transform the economic to value-adding technology-driven one talked about for years is now the real challenge.<br><br>If for last 20 years new talents came and went and many of them were unable to make the difference to the goals set - transformation to the next level.<br><br>Leaders cannot be judged all the time based on rhetorics and charisma. In a fast-paced global rat race the old tactics of covering NKF problems will waste our time and opportunities and will not work any more.<br><br>Wit, academic ability, presentation and charisma is important but these are mere starters or passports and leaders should be people offering continuous results from good performances that could be openly debated and judged.<br><br>I prefer to judge our leaders now for the second phase of nation building and I feel that we as a people cannot remain fixated by rhetoric or look-good academic qualifications alone.</div>

Unless of course our leaders are not able to delegate them to the lower levels and are too overly concerned with micro-management or nannying.<br><br>The most important and critical governing process is the overall functions and duties as spelled out in the constitutions and administering of these functions and roles. Good leaders should be capable of delegating these lower-level operational details to the respective rungs and not deviate from their major policy and implementation set-ups. If they cannot delegate them as are often the case then they are not efficient in delegation and governing that is all.<br><br>For a sample of such delegated management processes : see <a href="http://www.managefranchise.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">www.managefranchise.blogspot.com</a> for illustration or even details..<br><br>So we should not have to have MM Lee overly concerned with challenging the SIA union chief on the pilot wage issue if he has succeeded in delegating all the such detailed operational issues to the proper operational level.<br><br>The fundamental governing framework of democracy should concern with the election and structure of government, establishment of laws, rights and obligations of government and citizens and facilities for proper balanced functioning of the three governing bodies known as judiciary, legislative and executive of the nation.<br><br>In our case our government overshadow the first two i.e. the judiciary and legislative and that may be the reason why they are being caught with too much detailed issues and have to handle every issue themselves in which case I agree with you that the government will be slowing down their competitions at the operational level.<br><br>So however busy or central is our island or global are our ports or facilities, we should not expect the government to look after them every day. The detailed operations are often delegated to the respective organizations and private sectors to look after them through regulations and operational set-ups by delegations somewhere systematically without involvement of any ministers unless of course the ministers do not know how to set up the delegated processes as sampled in <a href="http://www,managefranchise.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">www,managefranchise.blogspot.com</a>.<br><br>There is no short-cut to having our ports bypassing government though when it comes to more critical and important issues of course but these are usually also well attended to by their respective boards or operators so there is no concern of the government to look over the shoulders of every entity to look after such mundane issues.<br><br>For example the modification of terminal facilities for arrival of A380 Airbus needs not be dealt with by the government or ministers. The enabling laws if any to allow widening of runway or facilities of course could be put up in advance to the relevant departments if necessary but usually in our governing system the higher authority is also involved unless the country does not have any framework except by some emperor who alone no matter how efficient cannot decide on everything anyway.<br><br>We will be slower if there is no delegated processes to determine the deailed issues but these depend on how efficient is the management and not the government.</div>
