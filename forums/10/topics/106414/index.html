Furthermore, market wages are lower during the past years due to recessions. Certain tax portions should have been collected for educations and government services. So why should HDB, hospitals and many government departments claim they are subsidising any costs and what are they comparing with?<br><br>So institutions of higher learning should only be justified in charging for consumption, and lower the administration costs and avoid charging on lands. Such details of costings should be provided to the students for accountability and transparency before asking for higher tuition fees.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's disappointing that autonomous education centres like our local universities have increased their student fees almost immediately after the worst of the economic downturn has passed.<br><br>This is definitely not in line with the coin "making education affordable" for everyone. The well-to-do in this generation have the monetary edge compared to weaker-income families which may be forced into burdening loans to support their children's dream of a graduate degree.<br><br>Has the operating cost of running a university suddenly risen? Has the administration unexpectedly improved the pay packages of their employees, thereby translating this surge in annual budget into high studying fees? I think all affected parties would be most interested in how the universities in question plan on justifying their positions.<br><br>With the shrinking market, widespread down-sizing of labour intensive firms and rapid decline of dot.com companies, a degree is no longer a passport to security and stability. Instead, graduates are expected to accept a lower salary coupled with an enormous job scope, prompting questions on how a rising undergraduate fee will help the current situation improve?</div>
