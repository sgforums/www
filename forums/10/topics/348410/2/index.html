              <p><br>It also pursue a policy of foreigner go first if there is a retrenchment, as a country lack of natural resources, we depend much on FDI, we are good in working, good in infrastructure, good in production, but we are lacking in labours. Therefore we must open up to let NTS and not just malaysian to work here, that is what the EDB recommended to the Govt that Foreign investors feels that they may not get enough labourers to sustain their business or production here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The idealogy of NTS is not depend on one nation entirely, what if one day all malaysians decided to go back and we are in deep shit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The internet boom has bring about globlisation, even opposition had find an opportunity to voice their opinons away from the mainstream media, and globlisation bring about an open global market, the paradigm change from local manufacturing to global services. Therefore when the global economy suffered, we are first to take the downturn, but when the global economy boom, we will be the first one there. And without the FT or FL here, companies would had long moved out, and when they moved out, we singaporeans also end up with no jobs/ or perhap with only low end local jobs.</p>
