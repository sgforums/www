              <p>Me too, i go out with muslim Malay frens too, visit their homes, share culture, i found singapore muslim malays are a happy lots, tho they may not excel so much as the chinese do, they are cool and always come with a smile, unlike chinese, some are so stressed and kiasee that you look at them like looking at a working robot.</p>
