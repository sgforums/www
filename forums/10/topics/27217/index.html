            <div class='col-md body'>Not to be mislead, the reason im posting this message has nothing to do with racism! Rather Im puzzled and 'll like to have some insights into this trend.<br>The area im staying in or even that of most neighbourhood sees a mark rise of malays ( mostly in the teens ) spending most of their time playing soccer, guitar hanging around in the day. Not that people of other race dun however the ratio to that of other race is significantly more. That is fine as long they do not create any social problems but if you would to take anotice of thier behaviour, most are quite ruly, making a din. Personally social interaction is fine to me as long it does not create problems to the surrounding areas.<br>Also I 'll like to know if there are any curbs  or guidediance handed by their Guardian to help control this disturbing trend cos' they do not seem to be rather effective ( pardon ) judging from their sheer amount ( usually the trouble makers are the same people )</div>

Mummbling along, without paying attention to the words?<br><br>"We the citizens of Singapore, pledge ourselves to be a one united people, REGARLESS of RACE, LANGUAGE or RELIGION....."<br><br>You comments are directed at the Malay community only....could you dare not agree your comments is racist? Each race also got rowdy kids, can you name me a race that don't?<br><br>You are like a horse with blinkers on...can only see straight...but not the side. Before commenting, put some thoughts into your words before shooting them off.....Singapore is a multi racial society...Insensitive remarks can destroy the very frabic of friendly co-existance built up over the years.

            <div class='col-md body'>Please,<br><br>Shawnshank was just trying to figure out why there are many Malays being so rowdy, I'm sure he will not be that silly to openly declare himself as a racist or make us read between the lines just to figure that he's a racist (which he is not!). Well, Shawnshank what<br>I want to say to you is that there are actually Chinese Ah Bengs who create trouble as well. What you are seeing is actually the way Malays live their normal life. Basically, if Malays were better well off (no offence) the majority would be spending their time playing computer games at home or doing something else. You must understand that this the Malay culture, they love the brotherhood and bond between their friends and them. That is why when they gather in big groups, they might feel the group supremacy and sometimes go out of the way (i'm sure u know how it feels too). This is not a perfect society, there are bound to be troublemakers everywhere, from every different race. So... why not you just let them be? For me, I normally play street soccer with my group of Chinese friends every Saturday and Sunday of the week. Being the only group there among a 90% majority of Malays, my friends and i feel out of place. Like when we fall they laugh, they tackle hard, they don't let us into the court sometimes. So you see, it's actually when there is a dominant race group, there will definitely be some racial discrimination. I write this because i know how you feel too. Want to know where racial discriminance is present too? In my school that is. Nobody realizes that our pledge said on Fridays in mother tongue is always in Chinese, and they have not said it once in either Bahasa Melayu or Tamil. Do you think that one person from a single race would dare to openly be rowdy amongst a crowd of another race? Therefore, i would like to conclue, and kindly ask you not to continue this subject, and just let life be... as harmonious Singaporeans.<br>I hope i have not offended anyone through this reply, because i am still tender of age (14 yrs).</div>
