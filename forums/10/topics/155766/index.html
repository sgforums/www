Arguments challenging the state's ban on same-sex marriage were made before the Washington Supreme Court last March. The case involves eight same-sex couples who were denied marriage licenses in King County.<br><br>In August, King County Superior Court Judge William Downing said that the Washington State Constitution guarantees basic rights to lesbian and gay people - and that those rights are violated by a state law prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying.<br><br>Downing's ruling went on to say that the couples must be given marriage licenses. One month later, a court in Thurston County ruled similarly.<br><br>The Supreme Court typically issues its rulings on Thursdays and same-sex couples have been anxiously checking the court's web site weekly for months.<br><br>Equal Rights Washington, the state's largest LGBT rights group, says it expects if the suit is successful gay and lesbian couples could immediately apply for licenses. The first weddings would take place following a three-day waiting period, which would make it a Sunday.<br><br>Equal Rights is optimistically looking forward to winning the case. It's prepared a check-list for couples who are prepared to Marry "Anything that can be taken care of ahead of time, so it's not just a scramble," Fran Dunaway, executive director of Equal Rights Washington told the Seattle Times. "There'll be dresses to buy; suits to iron, flowers to be picked up. It would be a powerful experience for a lot of people."<br><br>Legal experts say the court could rule in any of three ways: It could declare DOMA unconstitutional and grant same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexuals, uphold DOMA, or ask the Legislature to resolve the issue.<br><br>A conservative group opposed to same-sex marriage is already calling for an amendment the state constitution. The Supreme Court of New Jersey will hear a similar bid for gay marriage in the Garden State in this session and New York's highest court is likely to get a third case later this year.<br><br>Seven same-sex couples in New Jersey are suing to marry. (story) Represented by Lambda Legal, they argue that the New Jersey Constitution guarantees them the right to wed. In New York, arguments were made this month in a mid level appeal of a ruling that the state's ban on gay marriage was unconstitutional. The case, and two others in the Empire State, is likely to end up in New York's highest court - the Court of Appeal.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Archbishop supports new book that challenges church line on gays<br><br>Gays and the Future of Anglicanism published this week</strong><br>The Archbishop of Wales has welcomed a Â‘cogentÂ’ new book by 22 leading<br>theologians that argues for gay peopleÂ’s inclusion within the Anglican<br>ministry. Written by Â‘some of the finest theological mindsÂ’, it<br>challenges the moratorium on gay consecrations and same-sex blessings<br>of the Anglican Communion. Â‘This book throws down a formidable<br>challenge to the Anglican Communion. It cannot afford to ignore itÂ’ he<br>commented.<br><br>The Archbishop, Dr Barry Morgan, who was himself one of the people<br>responsible for the Windsor Report, which recommended the moratorium,<br>made it clear that the issue is far from settled: Â‘The arguments<br>advanced for including gay people [in the church] deserve to be read<br>and pondered by all who are involved in the debate about human sexuality.Â’<br><br>The book, says the Archbishop, Â‘shows up the superficiality of<br>previous Anglican discussion of this subjectÂ’ and should Â‘give the<br>Anglican Church in many places cause for penitence for the way it has<br>treated and thought about gay people.Â’<br><br>The book Gays and the Future of Anglicanism, edited by Oxford<br>theologian Andrew Linzey and Richard Kirker, Director of the Lesbian<br>and Gay Christian Movement will be published by O books at the end of<br>September. Among the 22 contributors are Archbishop Rowan WilliamsÂ’<br>successor at Oxford, Dr George Pattison, the Lady Margaret Professor<br>of Divinity.<br><br>Responding to the ArchbishopÂ’s statement (full text below), Professor<br>Linzey said, Â‘This is a welcome sign of a rethink. We were always told<br>that Windsor was a process not a judgment Â– it is excellent to have<br>confirmation of thatÂ’. Some fear that the Windsor Report will lead to<br>the exclusion of all gays from the Church. Â‘Preposterous as it sounds,<br>some people want to make attitude to gays the criterion of being an<br>AnglicanÂ’, added Professor Linzey. Â‘The book is really a devastating<br>critique of current church policyÂ’.<br><br>The book contains 22 chapters by major theologians from the UK and the<br>US. Eight of the contributors are theologians from Oxford: Marilyn<br>McCord Adams, Philip Kennedy, Christopher Lewis, George Pattison,<br>Martyn Percy, Vincent Strudwick, Keith Ward and Andrew Linzey. Regius<br>Professor of Divinity at Oxford, Marilyn McCord Adams calls upon the<br>Anglican Communion to apologize for its Â‘rude reception of gay<br>clergyÂ’, and Dr Philip Kennedy, Senior Tutor of Mansfield College,<br>Oxford, maintains that Â‘Neither God nor Jesus can be convicted of gay<br>bashing. The same could hardly be said for many of their devoteesÂ’.<br>The book marks the first major engagement by Anglican theologians with<br>the gay issue since the publication of Windsor last year.<br><br>Statement of the Archbishop of Wales, Dr Barry Morgan, on the publication of<br>Gays and the Future of Anglicanism:<br><br>There are three things which characterise this book.  It is quite<br>hostile to the Windsor Report (I write as one of the people<br>responsible for that report); it argues cogently for gay peopleÂ’s<br>inclusion within the Anglican Communion and its ministry; and the<br>essays are by some of the finest theological minds in the Communion.<br>The Windsor Report, whatever its shortcomings Â– is at least remarkable<br>in that its seventeen members from across the whole Communion, and<br>from widely different backgrounds and theological viewpoints, did at<br>least manage to achieve unanimity.  Its aim was to find a way of<br>enabling different theological perspectives within the Communion to<br>co-exist with tolerance and patience that is usually characteristic of<br>Anglicanism whilst respecting the autonomy of churches on the one hand<br>with the need for mutual inter-dependence and accountability on the<br>other, but without the setting up of a central curia.  But perhaps I<br>protest too much.<br><br>The arguments advanced for including gay people within the church and<br>its ministry deserve to be read and pondered by all who are involved<br>in the debate on human sexuality.  They deal in depth with the issue<br>from the perspective of scripture, tradition and experience, by<br>scholars who know what they are talking about.  The arguments advanced<br>here show up the superficiality and even the shallowness of the 1998<br>Lambeth plenary on the same topic and should also give the Anglican<br>Church in many places cause for penitence for the way it has treated<br>and thought about gay people.  We desperately need a listening and<br>study process on this topic in the Communion as has long been<br>recommended to no avail and it is good that the ACC at its meeting<br>this year has now agreed to gather material from across the Communion.<br>It might find, as the WCC found when it gathered material from all<br>its member churches and as this book demonstrates that sexual sins are<br>not the only sins and are not even the main sins according to<br>scripture; that theology has to be open to the possibility of<br>encountering GodÂ’s revelation of truth in new and novel ways Â– thatÂ’s<br>what the doctrine of the Spirit means and that what is often lost in<br>the so called debate about human sexuality is the fact that we are<br>talking about real persons with real feelings.  This book throws down<br>a formidable challenge to the Anglican Communion.  It cannot afford to<br>ignore it.<br></div>
