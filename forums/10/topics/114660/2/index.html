If they don't want to apologise for their mistakes, just let them be. 21st century is a great time to be Chinese. Nowadays people from all over the world are emigrating to China in huge numbers!

            <div class='col-md body'>During the ancient stages of the Japanese dynasty, they used to send scholars to China for studies and importing culture and trends to populate the Japanese courts.. like Go, language,  religion, technology, etc etc. Almost all the court ethics, fashion or trends were derived from China.
