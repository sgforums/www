            <div class='col-md body'>The Jews have the recognition of war crimes against them because of a powerful jewish lobby in united states and their money ( jews own billion-dollar properties such as the former terrorised world trade center).<br><br>What the japanese done to the Chinese in Unit 731 and nanjing massacre is beyond any horrific words I know. Even the nazis in china who witnessed the massacre called the japanese "a violent killing machine" and they couldn't stand it so much that they tried to save as many chinese as they could by setting up a "safety zone" . To these men, many chinese descendents owe their existence to him.<br><br>The reasons why japan refuses to recognise the war are politically and economically induced .<br><br>Political - because they are heavily entrenched in worshipping their royals and they do not have the inclination to paint them in another light . There was an uproar when there was a proposal to change the textbook to recognise the validity of the nanjing massacre.<br><br>Economic - because they would have to  compensate families for their loses and they did kill alot of chinese.<br><br>China is still growing , and she is now an economic superpower. The japanese are in fear of her military prowess and the potential damage she can cause. Japan is no longer that same militant japan in WW2.<br><br>China has no reason for action since war will affect her economically but I don't think China forgets what Japan did to her. Wait and see , you have japanese companies (like sony) setting up shop in china - I don't think china will give them an easy time once China consolidates her power in the world.<br><br>We will probably see a new China with a stranglehold on the japanese economy . The japanese are not stupid either - there is a growing lobby in Japan who knows about what happened and recognised that it happen. We just have to wait for the "old school emperor worshipping" japanese generation to past and watch what the next generations of japanese plan to do about it.  Some of the new generation population know in order to get along with a superpower China - they  will have to apologise to China for the atrocities commited in the past. It is just a matter of wait and see.<br><br>As Chinese ourselves, be it overseas or mainland , some of our ancestors were forced to flee China at that time.  It doesn't matter where our loyalties are - Let's just remember the Chinese in asian countries (Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia) at that time were  ruthlessly persecuted by the Japanese of the past. The Japanese of the past viewed Chinese as less than superior and human. So NEVER EVER FORGET THE FORGOTTEN HOLOCAUST because it is the worst slight our of many slights against our ethnicity.</div>

Well, let's not talk about the numbers of death and casualties. Let's talk about the length of the period the Japanese anexed Korea.  Korea is the nearest nation to Japan in Geographical location. So it's the first target and it's the longest nation to be anexed and taken over by Japan.<br><br>When you Chinese are busy fighting one and another, we Koreans have already been the first target of those Japanese morons. And even as the second world war ended, the Koreans suffered another blow of the cold war.<br><br>And guess what? Chinese are helping the communists in attacking Korea. Those Northern Koreans also got influenced by communist bastards and their stupid doctrines, turned against the Southerners. All these s h i t comes from none other than Mao Tze Tung, that son of a b.i.t.c.h.<br><br>However, thank God for Korean Pride that keeps us together!<br><br>Dae Han Min Guk!!!<br><br>S.H.I.N.</div></blockquote>communism, democracy and incompetent emperors have ruined the chinese race, we should go back to the age of wise emperors. thats is why i am ashamed to say that us chinese will never achieve great things given the divisions and conflicts..and that is one thing i admire koreans despite me hating your kim chii and music... koreans can band together to achieve success and beat the competition in their own game like hyundai, samsung and LG...im glad to say that the japanese monopoly on the home electronics market is declining thanks to you guys. and yes mao is a sonnamabitch</div>

LG, phillips are producing sleeker and better tvs than toshiba and sony, samsung has already overtaken NEC , sony and fujitsu as the main manufacturer of PC monitors.mandrin signs have already been errected in most major tourist attractions to cater to the growing affluence of china's new rich. many chinese now own huge luxury cars, private planes and helicopters while hardly anyone in japan and singapore can afford a rolls royce.as for the lazy europeans...germany has been pushed to roughly 5th place from the former 2nd place in the 60s and 3rd place from the 60s onwards..it is now behind japan and india in terms of GNP. if we all boycott japanese goods and buy korean goods instead..i dare say that japan's economy would be reduced to rubble. i personally feel that LG's products look much better and sleeker..and are equally if not more advanced than those produced by japanese companies like sony.</div>
