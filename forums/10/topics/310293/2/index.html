              <p>well, at least accord me the basic courtesy of answering my question to you. Are you from a local U?</p>
              <p>I don't doubt you. I got a place at USC as well but I choose to study local becos after calculation, "bo kow lui"....ppl all choose their U for various reasons. I would agree readily with you too that some of the angmo Us are good, if not better than NUS/NTU/SMU.</p>
              <p>But don't trivalize about the ease of getting into the current 3 sinkapore U now. It is not that easy. Like I said, if you are in one, then u r entitled to your opinion. otherwise, you have not 1 iota of credibility to write the things you wrote above.</p>

              <p>I know people in army with reasonably good A level and diploma results. Most A level grads upon receiving their A level results followed the norm of applying a place in local unis quickly to secure a place so they can serve NS with a piece of mind. however in army there was this friend who told me his dad advised him to apply at an overseas uni cos his parents wanted him to learn how to be independent and experience a different education culture.Since his family finances allow such a choice, he took his dad advice.  </p>
              <p>I also have friends who wanted to study at overseas unis to experience such a culture but due to lack of funds, family &amp; friends attachment, work or gf commitments choose to apply at local unis instead.</p>

              <p>3) study at pte local unis where they can choose between PT or FT studies so they can find a job and be truly financially independent.</p>
              <p>I believe not everybody is able to work PT or FT and study for a PT/ FT degree concurrently without compromising academic grades or job responsibilities.</p>

              <p>i am not exactly peeved, but it is the way you trivalize it that bothers me. i m not saying us local graduates are the best of the crop, me and some of my frens in NUS crapped out too at times. but uni days are the best times of my life by far.</p>
              <p>you have not answer me, but i gather pretty much that you are not from the local U.</p>

              <p>My advise for those with qualification and looking hard for a job:</p>
              <p>Expand your horizon, Singapore is not the only place you must work in.  Venture overseas.</p>
              <p>It is easier than you think it is.  Bear in mind your advantage is not just a world-wide recognized degree/diploma, you have a valuable qualification called bi-lingual that happened to be the two most essential languages in the world and the future to come.</p>
              <p>Internet is a good source for overseas job hunting. Straits times recruitment page often advertised job for overseas companies. Talk to friends or relatives who are working overseas and be friendly to a foreigner in Singapore you never know he or she could be your future employer.</p>
              <p>Do not have doubt about leaving Singapore.  Life is alot better overseas. You have richer experience both in your job and personal encounters.  Don't think Singapore is the safest place on earth, the impression you formed about danger of other countries is just media selling news.</p>
              <p>Diversify away from Singapore, leave your family for the time being. Who knows when Singapore is no longer a place to stay, you can move your whole family to where you work.</p>
              <p>I said these because I've been there.  I only worked for one year in Singapore after graduation, and ever since I am living and working happily overseas for the past 12 years.</p>

              <p>the higher paper qualification you have the more complacent you become (sounds abit like MM). You think you are smart therefore you must be successful.  You use your head and forget to develop your guts, intuition or acumen.  When you want to implement a policy you always refer to peter drucker, if you want to buy a stock you flip abraham graham security analysis.</p>

              <p>Thety are studying books and books and more books, such a mode of study will not stay fresh in your mind  for a long time.</p>

              <p>My education is Aus has done me more good than if i was in Singapore</p>
              <p>I did my pri/sec/poly education in singapore and my Uni in Aus and there is a vast difference between  these 2  periods of my studying life</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore: U are being spoonfed, given books which are told to study with what-to-do next chapters and so on and u just memorise them by hard to pass the exams. Rote Learning and practicals are a farce. Practicals just re-teach u what u studied in the textbooks</p>
              <p>Aus: U are given a set of materials are designed to  actually draw u into the studying and to know what exactly u are studying. Supplemental notes are given for you to compare the Book version with it   personal learning, comparative and analytical approach. It just like exploration...  which is done by you alone. Practicals are thrown in right on the spot for u to practice what u studied, and not re-teach what u studied.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>many people have this idea that studying overseas is easier when</p>
              <p>in fact its just as hard as in Singapore if u prefer the rigid system in singapore. It easier cause there is not much emphasis on rote learning but for some ppl the research and practicals part may kill them since their minds are so narrow in scope thy find it overwhelming.</p>
              <p>. The difference is that such studying style is suited for a ease of mind and to open it up to a broader knowledge</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i am wondering if u also studied overseas cause the last sentence u sporuted looks like u are just another bookworm nerd in Singapore</p>

              <p>In NUS, no more spoon feeding. You are given some notes and the lecturers just babble about his routine talk. The lecturer is usually more interest in publishing journals articles than teaching you. The university emphasizes on thinking if you are taking science or engineering subjects. Exams will test you on your knowledge and you wont get anywhere by pure memorising. I have some friends who stayed and studied in school 15hours a day for 5-7days a week and they still end up getting many C grades at NUS.</p>

              <p>Seriously, not listening to lectures doesn't mean you cannot score; lectures are basically useless half of the time. Most of the time I'm in lectures, I surf sgf. Only when the lecturer does mention something more interesting do I listen a bit.</p>
              <p>But my information on the subject comes a lot from google. Ultimately, it isn't about the spoonfeeding, but about how you approach it. By the time you are in university, you are no longer a kid. You can think; you have a mind of your own. It doesn't mean that if someone spoonfeeds you with notes, you must take all the info.</p>
              <p>I study in NUS, and have been on a student exchange to a German university for a semester. The method of teaching is similar, notes and lecture. However, it is only the method of testing that is different; the test includes verbal testing. <br><br>But from what I hear about Southampton university in England from my friends, the way of testing is very similar to Singapore's, just do exam papers.</p>
