              <p>But one thing that puzzles me in taiwan is that the private bus companies in Taipei can make a profit charging  a flat rate of $0.70 cents for a bus ride. The $0.70 cents allows a passenger to take from one bus Terminal end to the other. On the other hand, our Public Transport Council have to hike our fares time after time. One wonders why.</p>

              <p>We would only appreciate the good things about a country when are not in them. Singapore has it share of good points just like Taiwan. I just dont like the local state media for  portraying Taiwan as some african state in chaos. They have the"If Singapore is like Taiwan, we are doomed" mentality.</p>
              <p>i couldnt google any statistics, but i dont think Taiwan has a higher crime rate. It is the free and open media that sensationalise the news of murder and robbery. Japan for example has one of the lowest crime rate in the world but if you read their daily news, their media has a perversion for reporting rape, murder and robbery on a daily basis.</p>
