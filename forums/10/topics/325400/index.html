              <div>STOMPer <strong>Vanessa Lim </strong>says
                      in Taiwan, the people queue up in an orderly way at train stations, on
                      the escalator and when waiting for the bus, and wonders if such a
                      practice can be followed in Singapore. <br> <br> Said the STOMPer: <br> <br> "In Taiwan, if people are waiting for the MRT (subway), they all queue
                      in a line and allow passengers to alight first before boarding the
                      train. <br> <br> "Same goes to escalator; all will keep to the right and allow those in hurry to use the left lane.<br> <br> "The most amazing situation I see is when commuters wait for the public
                      bus, they are queuing orderly in a straight line even though there is
                      plenty of space where they could just hang around. <br> <br> "I wonder which other part of the world practices such system and most importantly, the people follow the system."</div>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Check out my earlier post on a trip to taiwan in 06. My only regret is that i didnt take photos for the things i mentioned.<br></span></p>
              <p>http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/225768</p>
              <p>Last month i went to Taipei, a under a supposed "inferior form
                                              of governance" for a short holiday, I was surprised that it was
                                              better than Singapore in many ways.<br> <br> 1.The streets are relatively free of litter despite the fact it
                                              does not have fines for littering.<br> <br> 2. The transport system is relatively good and cheaper than
                                              Singapore.<br> <br> a) The bus has a Flat fee of 15 Yuan ($0.70) which you can take
                                              from one end to another end.<br> <br> b) MRT fare starts from 20 Yuan ($0.95)<br> <br> There can be further discounts if you use an Ez link card like
                                              Singapore.<br> <br> 3. The service standard is better. The sales staff are polite and
                                              every 7-11 Store you go, they would greet you with "Huan Yin Kuan
                                              Ling" This could be due to cultural influence from Japanese.<br> <br> 4. The Taiwanese give seats to elderly readily. When using
                                              escalators, people naturally keep to one side, to give way to those
                                              who want to climb. When entering the MRT doors, the people give way
                                              to passengers who are leaving.<br> <br> 5. Because Taiwanese do not legislate laws at their whim and
                                              fancies, the authorities are better at persuading its people to
                                              change. They get celebrities like Jolin Tsai and Lin Yilain to
                                              record Radio ads to persuade people to give seats to elderly.<br> <br> 6. Taiwan has a more entrepreneur friendly environment. Because
                                              they are a little more chaotic, its easier to set up a street
                                              stall and be rich from doing small business. In Singapore, the
                                              hawkers and shops owners give most of their takings away in rent.
                                              Its also easier and cheaper to make your business known as
                                              billboards are plastered all over the country.<br> <br> 7. Taipei is the first Asian city that has a comprehensive wireless
                                              nationwide network while Singapore is playing catch-up.<br> <br> Can good governance produce these results? Or when the day good
                                              governance cannot fine our people, the country will be filled with
                                              litter?</p>

              <p>ya, I was surprised the last time I went Taiwan.</p>
              <p>But to be fair, it is usually the elder generation, or the very small kids, or what I saw before, some Banglas, that still block the way when pple exit. Can't blame them though... the elderly might not even hv read the 'teachings', the kids might not even have bothered, and the banglas might not understand the language properly... Other than that, I can usually see people giving way to exiting passengers at train stations, so overall still not too bad la.</p>

              <p>Who do you think profits from the super normal profits?</p>
              <p>SMRT, SBS, Taxi Companies.</p>
              <p>Ultimate shareholder is Temasex.</p>
              <p>It's interesting to note that countries like Australia, maybe Hong Kong also, have monthly fare cards where fares are charged lower than what commuters would have to pay daily (they are priced much lower to help the working class commuters). SMRT has not implemented such a scheme. Why? Simple, it will erode their profits, the main objective of Temasex is to make lots and lots of money.</p>

              <p>if u see something that's good for singapore, u'll wish that it's how it is in singapore. although its a fact, I don't deny. But we're talking about good things we can learn from.</p>
              <p>since you say that, means that we shouldn't use anything that's non-singaporean inspired, isn't it? then even chinese pop or what, can don't watch taiwan dramas or jacky shows liao. just watch the channel 8 or what lo. watch what epl or world cup? watch s league lo. standard lousy? singapore is singapore, other country is other country. is it?</p>
