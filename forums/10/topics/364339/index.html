              <blockquote>But there's a problem with turning Singapore into a sexy pin-up for health care wonks: <span style="color: #ff0000;">it breaks a lot of rules</span>. Conservatives should hate it because the government <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_Singapore"><span style="color: #006699;">regulates supply and sets prices</span></a> and forces <span style="color: #ff0000;">all its citizens to put money into a health care savings account</span>. More liberal reformers should be irked by its famously <span style="color: #ff0000;">high co-pays to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>help the government recoup money</strong></span></span>, because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">too-high co-pays are supposed to discourage the less fortunate to seek preventative care when the illness can be more cheaply treated</span>. As Watson Wyatt <a href="http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850"><span style="color: #006699;">sums up</span></a>, it's a bizarre combination of a public option and private special care where "the private healthcare system competes with the public healthcare, which helps contain prices in both directions."
              <div><br></div>
              <p>When you take stock of the compulsory savings accounts, the mandatory payroll reductions and the copays, you've got something quite weird: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A largely government-run program that is ultimately funded mostly by private spending</span></span>. Indeed, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">as a percent of total expenditures, private spending on health is higher than the United States and three times greater than the UK and Japan</span></span>.<br><br><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; margin: 0pt auto 20px; display: block;" src="http://business.theatlantic.com/Picture%206.png" alt="Picture 6.png" width="552" height="356"></span>So where will Singapore fall in the health care discussion? Probably close to nowhere, unfortunately. Singapore is an extraordinary hodgepodge of health care principles, but it's also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a city-state whose health care system is comprised of fewer than 30 hospitals</span>. Still, perhaps it deserves a place in the summer-long blockbuster discussion that begins with "What are we paying for, exactly?"</p>

              <p>Can Singapore Health Care System be comparable to the USA ?</p>
              <p>A tiny red dot with a population of only 4.5 million ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From the report, it clearly expose the lamentable fact that the Singapore Government is making a profit by charging Singaporeans for the use of the Health Care Services - whose infrastructure was built from the Citizens' money in the CPF.</p>
              <p>The citizens are forced to save the money in the CPF, the government use the CPF to build the infrastructure of a Health Care System, and the Government will charge full market rates before giving a "discount" as a subsidy.</p>
              <p>Where is the Government subsidy when the infrastructure was built with the Citizen's money ?</p>
              <p>Where is the subsidy when the charges are based on "full market rates" based on the charges of similar services performed by private hospitals operated on commercial basis ?</p>

              <p><br>Actually the cost are you referring to? The cost of subsidies from the government or the cost to US citizens?</p>
              <p>When something is privatised, the cost of that service will escalate as compared to when it is under the premise of the government.</p>
              <p>If a person can't afford to pay subsidised rates through medicare, then what makes one thing that he can afford to take a plane to Singapore, live in a hotel for afew days, go through a SG$25k to $50k operation, convalesce in the hospital ward for a week.</p>
              <p><a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070619135151AAplSv1">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070619135151AAplSv1</a></p>
              <p>If you look at the US census, the majority of folks who can't pay the medicare rates are the indigenous Indians, Blacks and Hispanics. Seriously, the medicare rates are similar to the medishield rates, if you have a proper job, you shouldn't have any problem paying it. Do you know the occupation for these three races? Do you think these folks have the financial resources to fly to Singapore for an operation? All these under privilege folks are not neglected (like what most would think), they have charitable hospitals for these folks to seek medical treatment.</p>
              <p>Seriously, the quality of service between US and Singapore is different. It's also difficult to compare the cost levels, because both countries are at different stages of economic development.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Consider the cost of public hospitals in Hong Kong and Singapore. Why is the cost in Singapore so much more than in Hong Kong? Don't you think that you have been suckered by the regime? Both countries are similar in terms of resources, demography and economic development. But cost of medical services in Hong Kong is a fraction of Singapore's. Looking at the budget every year, it's strange that Singapore hospitals have no income whatsoever, but every year in the budget there is an apportionment of cost to health services.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Hong Kong Hospital Charges (With an exchange rate of HK$ 1 = SG$ 0.188)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>A&amp;E = SG$18.80</strong></p>
              <p><strong>In-patient (General acute beds) = SG$28.20</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Day procedure at Oncology and Renal Clinics = SG$15.04</strong></p>
              <p><strong>General out-patient = SG$8.46</strong></p>
