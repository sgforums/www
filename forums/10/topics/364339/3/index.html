              <p><br>We are really good, i mean PAP aside. You cannot find such a good framework of medical care all over the world. No doubt other countries may often cheap or better price due to exchange rates, but for medical care, nothing beat Singapore. If you visit Raffles, Elizabeth, thomson, gleneagle and all those private hospital, you can bet half or more of their patients are foreigners, some even sold all their property to come and seek medical attention here, cos afterall health is wealth</p>

              <p>Not really, I have experienced myself on many occasions, private healthcare in Singapore is more competent than public.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Afew months ago, I had a viral infection, ended with a swollen lymph nodes. I went to a private GP on the first occasion was prescribed with augmentin, it didn't recover. So I went to a polyclinic, I told the doctor about my swollen lymph nodes (even pointed it out to her with my fingers), she told me she can't feel it, I had to point to her a second time.</p>
              <p>In the polyclinic, I have encountered another case where a doctor gave a wrong prescription to the pharmacist, I overheard her talking on the phone with the pharmacist when I was in the room, apparently she OD the patient 10 times, 0.5 tablets was written as 5 times, luckily the pharmacist noticed the error.</p>
              <p>Once I took my dad to SGH because of his arthiritis, the first senior specialist we saw said my dad doesn't need an operation because it's a minor case, told my dad to take some test and look for him again after the test. My dad went for the test, came back to the room, the senior specialist was attending to another patient, so we saw another junior specialist. This junior specialist told my dad to go for an operation, then I said your senior consultant said earlier on there was no need for operation, then I requested to him that I want to see the senior consultant because I think he is more competent.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Recently a friend of mine (we’ll call her ‘Esther’) was admitted to the Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) department of the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">General</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hospital</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (SGH). </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Esther had earlier seen her GP who recommended that she consulted doctors at SGH to determine the cause of her illness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Day One</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Registration – </span></em></strong><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">8.40pm</span></em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The registration at the triage section of the A&amp;E’s Isolation Ward (IW) was smooth and swift and went without a hitch. The triage nurse was courteous, friendly and apparently highly efficient. We thanked her and took our seats at the waiting area for Esther’s number to be called by the doctor on duty that night.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">It was about </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">8.40pm</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The consultation with the doctor eventually took place at around </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">10pm</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> – after some 1 hour 20 mins later. Esther was told that she had to be admitted for overnight observation so that more tests could be done to ascertain the cause of her illness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">So, we returned to the waiting area and waited for Esther to be assigned a ward and a bed. In the meantime, a nurse told us that they would find a bed in the IW for Esther to rest temporarily, instead of sitting on the chairs in the waiting area, which was an exercise in endurance for someone who is ill.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">It turned out to be a frustrating, excruciating and a very long wait indeed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">At </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12.20am</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, some 3 hours and 40 mins after Esther had registered at the A&amp;E, I approached the triage nurse and asked if they were aware that Esther was waiting for a bed in the IW. (In all those 3 hours 40 mins, we were not informed or updated about when a bed might be available.) </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The nurse was very understanding and explained that there were no beds available and that there was nothing they could do. And so the wait continued.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12.50am</span></em></strong><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> – 4 hours 10 mins</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">At </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12.50am</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> – 4 hours and 10mins after registration – we were finally informed that a bed was available in the IW’s Fever Zone. The relief – and exhaustion – on Esther’s face was evident. She would be able to rest her tired self finally.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The “Fever Zone”, where the temporary beds were, is a small section within the Isolation Ward. It has two rooms – one for male patients and one for female patients. Each room could hold about 6 to 7 beds. The Fever Zone is the place where patients who have to be warded are temporarily placed while waiting to be admitted to the wards of their choice. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Esther had opted for a B2-plus ward (5 patients in an air-conditioned room).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">We were hopeful that we wouldn’t have to wait just as long for Esther to be assigned a bed in the B2-plus ward. The IW ward has its television and lights on 24-hours and patients are wheeled out to the wards and new ones wheeled in, a situation which doesn’t really allow one to rest properly amidst the noise and the comings and goings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Our hope was misplaced.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The long wait was to last till the next day. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Day Two</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">9pm</span></em></strong><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> – 24 hours 20 mins</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">At about </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">9pm</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> on Day Two – 24 hours 20 minutes after registration – Esther was informed that a B2 bed was available and the nurse asked if she wanted it. As a B2 ward is non-air conditioned, as opposed to a B2-plus ward, Esther declined. (See <a href="http://www.sgh.com.sg/ForPatientsnVisitors/HospitalCharges/InpatientCharges/"><span style="color: #990000;">here</span></a>)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The reason why she declined is because we suspected that Esther might have to stay quite a while in the hospital (as she already had 2 previous unsuccessful blood tests, one at a private hospital and the other with her GP) and because of her constitutional sensitivity to warm temperatures we decided to wait for a B2-plus bed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Thus, we waited a further 3 hours.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12.50am</span></em></strong><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> – 28 hours 10 mins</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">At about </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12 midnight</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, a nurse informed us that a B2-plus bed was available. Preparation was then made to transfer us to the ward. Esther was put on a wheelchair and wheeled to the corridor of the IW. We were so tired from all the hours of waiting. It was only 15 minutes later that we heard the nurse informing the ward, through a phone call, that Esther was ready to be transferred. A further 12 minutes later, a male nurse arrived to wheel Esther to the B2-plus area of the hospital. Esther had waited for about 30 minutes in the corridor. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">It was </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12.50am</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> on Day Two before Esther finally managed to put her head down on a bed in a B2-plus ward.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">All in all, from registration to being admitted to a B2-plus ward, it took <strong><em>28 hours and 10 minutes. </em></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Nurses were patient, courteous and professional</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Now, before you think that my frustration is directed at the nurses on duty that night, let me say that they were very patient, courteous and professional in their duties. Although they could have done better in some areas – such as keeping us informed of the situation with the availability of the bed – it is understandable as the A&amp;E is a very busy place to work in. The nurses also had to tend to many patients.<br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I would like to mention, particularly, the nurses at the IW’s Fever Zone. They were compassionate and understanding. This is especially commendable when one considers that most of the patients in the IW that night were elderly and weak. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">One of the nurses explained to Esther that the situation has been such since the Chinese New Year. She also said that the wards in </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Tan</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Tock</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Seng</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hospital</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> were fully occupied and patients were being directed to SGH. Hence the shortfall of beds there.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">A serious problem</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Esther was not the only one who had to wait so many hours for a bed. But perhaps she is luckier than others who had had to wait in wheelchairs in the waiting area for hours and hours on end that night we were there – for even the number of beds in the IW is limited.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">While MM Lee may be right that “within one-and-a-half to two hours flat, you’d know what went wrong” (even though in Esher’s case the cause of her illness is still unknown 5 days after admission to SGH), the other important thing is the availability, or the squeeze, on the number of hospital beds.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">According to the nurses there, this is not a sudden or a temporary hiccup. It has been like this since the Chinese New Year, as earlier mentioned.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">While we trumpet the excellence of our clinical healthcare service (and I don’t disagree with this), it is what happens on the ground to each patient that needs to be looked at.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Waiting for more than 28 hours for a bed is simply unacceptable.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I hope that the Minister for Health, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, will put some effort into solving this problem – especially now that he has been called “the best Health Minister Singapore has ever had” by none other than SM Goh himself. (<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_222196.html"><span style="color: #990000;">Straits Times</span></a>)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">When you are sick and weak, you shouldn’t be made to endure a frustrating and excruciating 28 hours just for a bed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">And I am sure that Esther is not the only one who has had this experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Perhaps the new <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/276541/1/.html"><span style="color: #990000;">Khoo Teck Puat</span></a> hospital in Yishun, scheduled to open in 2010, will help to alleviate the situation. But that is left to be seen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">One can only hope that </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">’s healthcare system will not become what MM Lee said of the system in the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">UK</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, where he experienced “restlessness and unhappiness” when waiting for 45 minutes for an ambulance:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“There’s no connection between those in the system and the patients..” </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span>-<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">MM Lee,<strong> </strong>(<a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw03/031103to.htm"><span style="color: #990000;">TODAY</span></a>)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">From Esther’s experience, one could say the same for </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">’s system as well.</span></p>

              <p>The day after, after going out for lunch, I went to the toilet. What I saw really scared me... there were some spots of blood... I didn't know what to do. I don't have an OB-Gyn yet, and I haven't been to any hospitals here. Plus in the office, only my team lead knows I'm pregnant. So while waiting for my team lead to return, I was panicking... I can't sit still! I called up all the OB-Gyns recommended to me, but no one answered. So I called up hospitals, asking them if I should go the hospital or what. The first hospital I called was Singapore General Hospital. The hospital staff told me to go to their A&amp;E. As soon as my team lead appeared again in the office, I told him it's an emergency and I need to go to the hospital. So I took a taxi &amp; went to the hospital.</p>
              <div><br><strong>When I got there... the waiting time is 3 hours!</strong> Omaygulay! Actually I didn't know SGH is a public hospital... wahahaha! I should have gone to a private hospital instead... I still stayed there, paid the $90 fee and waited. Lloyd arrived in the hospital a few minutes later. Since I really can't sit still anymore, I asked one of the nurses if there is a special case for pregnant women who's spotting. So she told me to go straight to the nurses cheking the BP, temp, etc. So I went there and they wheeled me inside (I don't know what's it called). <strong>From there, wait again! I think I was inside that room for an hour or so. </strong>This time Lloyd's not with me... he's not allowed inside.</div>

              November, 2003</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Recently a friend of mine
              (we’ll call her ‘Esther’) was admitted to the Accident and
              Emergency (A&amp;E) department of the</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">General</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">Hospital</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">(SGH).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Esther had earlier seen
              her GP who recommended that she consulted doctors at SGH to
              determine the cause of her illness.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Day
              One</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Registration
              –</span></em></strong> <strong><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">8.40pm</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The registration at the
              triage section of the A&amp;E’s Isolation Ward (IW) was smooth and
              swift and went without a hitch. The triage nurse was courteous,
              friendly and apparently highly efficient. We thanked her and took
              our seats at the waiting area for Esther’s number to be called by
              the doctor on duty that night.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">It
              was about</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">8.40pm</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The consultation with the
              doctor eventually took place at around</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">10pm</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">– after some 1 hour 20
              mins later. Esther was told that she had to be admitted for
              overnight observation so that more tests could be done to ascertain
              the cause of her illness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">So, we returned to the
              waiting area and waited for Esther to be assigned a ward and a bed.
              In the meantime, a nurse told us that they would find a bed in the
              IW for Esther to rest temporarily, instead of sitting on the chairs
              in the waiting area, which was an exercise in endurance for someone
              who is ill.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">It
              turned out to be a frustrating, excruciating and a very long wait
              indeed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">At</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">12.20am</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">, some 3 hours and 40 mins
              after Esther had registered at the A&amp;E, I approached the triage
              nurse and asked if they were aware that Esther was waiting for a
              bed in the IW. (In all those 3 hours 40 mins, we were not informed
              or updated about when a bed might be available.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The nurse was very
              understanding and explained that there were no beds available and
              that there was nothing they could do. And so the wait
              continued.</span></p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">12.50am</span></em></strong> <strong><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">–
              4 hours 10 mins</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">At</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">12.50am</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">– 4 hours and
              10mins after registration – we were finally informed that a bed was
              available in the IW’s Fever Zone. The relief – and exhaustion – on
              Esther’s face was evident. She would be able to rest her tired self
              finally.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The “Fever Zone”, where
              the temporary beds were, is a small section within the Isolation
              Ward. It has two rooms – one for male patients and one for female
              patients. Each room could hold about 6 to 7 beds. The Fever Zone is
              the place where patients who have to be warded are temporarily
              placed while waiting to be admitted to the wards of their
              choice.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Esther had opted for a
              B2-plus ward (5 patients in an air-conditioned room).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">We
              were hopeful that we wouldn’t have to wait just as long for Esther
              to be assigned a bed in the B2-plus ward. The IW ward has its
              television and lights on 24-hours and patients are wheeled out to
              the wards and new ones wheeled in, a situation which doesn’t really
              allow one to rest properly amidst the noise and the comings and
              goings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Our hope was
              misplaced.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The long wait was to last
              till the next day.</span></p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Day
              Two</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">9pm</span></em></strong> <strong><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">–
              24 hours 20 mins</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">At
              about</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">9pm</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">on Day Two – 24 hours 20
              minutes after registration – Esther was informed that a B2 bed was
              available and the nurse asked if she wanted it. As a B2 ward is
              non-air conditioned, as opposed to a B2-plus ward, Esther declined.
              (See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sgh.com.sg/ForPatientsnVisitors/HospitalCharges/InpatientCharges/"><span style="color: #990000;">here</span></a>)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The reason why she
              declined is because we suspected that Esther might have to stay
              quite a while in the hospital (as she already had 2 previous
              unsuccessful blood tests, one at a private hospital and the other
              with her GP) and because of her constitutional sensitivity to warm
              temperatures we decided to wait for a B2-plus bed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Thus, we waited a further
              3 hours.</span></p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">12.50am</span></em></strong> <strong><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">–
              28 hours 10 mins</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">At
              about</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">12
              midnight</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">, a nurse informed us that
              a B2-plus bed was available. Preparation was then made to transfer
              us to the ward. Esther was put on a wheelchair and wheeled to the
              corridor of the IW. We were so tired from all the hours of waiting.
              It was only 15 minutes later that we heard the nurse informing the
              ward, through a phone call, that Esther was ready to be
              transferred. A further 12 minutes later, a male nurse arrived to
              wheel Esther to the B2-plus area of the hospital. Esther had waited
              for about 30 minutes in the corridor.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">It
              was</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">12.50am</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">on Day Two
              before Esther finally managed to put her head down on a bed in a
              B2-plus ward.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">All in all, from
              registration to being admitted to a B2-plus ward, it took
              <strong><em>28 hours and 10 minutes.</em></strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Nurses were patient,
              courteous and professional</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Now, before you think that
              my frustration is directed at the nurses on duty that night, let me
              say that they were very patient, courteous and professional in
              their duties. Although they could have done better in some areas –
              such as keeping us informed of the situation with the availability
              of the bed – it is understandable as the A&amp;E is a very busy
              place to work in. The nurses also had to tend to many
              patients.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I
              would like to mention, particularly, the nurses at the IW’s Fever
              Zone. They were compassionate and understanding. This is especially
              commendable when one considers that most of the patients in the IW
              that night were elderly and weak.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">One of the nurses
              explained to Esther that the situation has been such since the
              Chinese New Year. She also said that the wards in</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">Tan</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">Tock</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">Seng</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">Hospital</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">were fully
              occupied and patients were being directed to SGH. Hence the
              shortfall of beds there.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">A serious
              problem</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Esther was not the only
              one who had to wait so many hours for a bed. But perhaps she is
              luckier than others who had had to wait in wheelchairs in the
              waiting area for hours and hours on end that night we were there –
              for even the number of beds in the IW is limited.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">While MM Lee may be right
              that “within one-and-a-half to two hours flat, you’d know what went
              wrong” (even though in Esher’s case the cause of her illness is
              still unknown 5 days after admission to SGH), the other important
              thing is the availability, or the squeeze, on the number of
              hospital beds.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">According to the nurses
              there, this is not a sudden or a temporary hiccup. It has been like
              this since the Chinese New Year, as earlier mentioned.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">While we trumpet the
              excellence of our clinical healthcare service (and I don’t disagree
              with this), it is what happens on the ground to each patient that
              needs to be looked at.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Waiting for more than 28
              hours for a bed is simply unacceptable.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I
              hope that the Minister for Health, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, will put some
              effort into solving this problem – especially now that he has been
              called “the best Health Minister Singapore has ever had” by none
              other than SM Goh himself. (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_222196.html"><span style="color: #990000;">Straits
              Times</span></a>)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">When you are sick and
              weak, you shouldn’t be made to endure a frustrating and
              excruciating 28 hours just for a bed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">And I am sure that Esther
              is not the only one who has had this experience.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Perhaps the new <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/276541/1/.html"><span style="color: #990000;">Khoo Teck
              Puat</span></a> hospital in Yishun, scheduled to open in 2010, will
              help to alleviate the situation. But that is left to be
              seen.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">One can only hope
              that</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">’s
              healthcare system will not become what MM Lee said of the system in
              the</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">UK</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">, where he experienced
              “restlessness and unhappiness” when waiting for 45 minutes for an
              ambulance:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">“There’s no connection
              between those in the system and the patients..”</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>- </span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">MM Lee, (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw03/031103to.htm"><span style="color: #990000;">TODAY</span></a>)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">From Esther’s experience,
              one could say the same for</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">’s
              system as well.</span></p>
