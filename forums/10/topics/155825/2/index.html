I mean, we all have our own preferences with regards to our romantic partner and they include height, looks, colour (tan, fair etc, not the colour you are thinking about) and very often, race, though I am loathe to use that word. The term 'racist' is more usually used to describe a person who actively discriminates against people of a particular race by the use of offensive words or actions.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from straits times forum.<br><br>WITH the publication of the third racist blogger case ('3rd racist blogger convicted but may avoid jail term'; ST, Oct 27), I feel compelled to share my concern. I restrained myself after the first two cases were reported. Now, I think this concern deserves an airing.<br><br>I think there are grounds to investigate whether the Chinese majority - especially the youths - do not get sufficient interaction with minority races in Singapore.<br><br>While I appreciate government reminders for Malays to mingle with mainstream society, I am conversely concerned if the majority Chinese do not mingle enough with every stratum of society.<br><br>I would be even more concerned if this situation was not on the Government's radar screen to begin with.<br><br>I do not suggest that interaction alone will foster stronger racial harmony. Familiarity can breed contempt as much as it does understanding.<br><br>Education and upbringing are most important. Yet these will be ineffective without interaction.<br><br>What I suggest is that it is much easier for the majority to miss the point that it does not interact sufficiently with the minority races.<br><br>This is simply because the minority races stick out like a sore thumb when we behave in an insular manner. Whereas the insularity of the majority is hidden by the presumption that it is the mainstream of society.<br><br>The mathematics of our demographics support my point. It is more likely for the 75 per cent majority to be deprived of interaction with the 25 per cent minority than the other way round - even if the majority tries hard to interact.<br><br>It is more likely for the minority to brush shoulders with the majority, even when we make no attempt to try. It is more likely that we understand, tolerate and accept the ways of the majority, than the other way round, unless proactive action is taken.<br><br>Fine, this is all mathematical probability. So, for a reality check, I offer one piece of anecdotal evidence to support my point. I hope the powers that be will gather statistical and other evidence to verify or nullify it.<br><br>Perhaps then we will know for sure and take the right action.<br><br>A year ago, my wife met a fellow social worker from a different agency. She was a 35-year-old Chinese Singaporean graduate of a local university. She came with her Indian colleague.<br><br>Before they parted, she made a sincere unsolicited remark to my wife: 'Wah, today I am very happy. At last I can say I have one Malay friend and one Indian friend.'<br><br>I have not missed the point that this woman developed such a harmonious attitude despite her lack of inter-racial interaction.<br><br>As I said earlier, education and upbringing are most important.<br><br>I hope readers don't miss the point that a typical Chinese woman may be deprived of interaction with minority races despite 35 years of living and being educated locally.<br><br>If this is typical, proactive measures are needed to check the trend.<br><br>Osman Sidek<br></div>
