Singapore is going to have a casino!<br><br><blockquote>[:: <strong>Quote from ChannelNewsAsia article</strong> ::]<br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said Singapore will go ahead with plans for two integrated resorts with casinos.<br><br>One will be built at Marina Bayfront, and the other at Sentosa.<br><br>Speaking in Parliament, Mr Lee said that when the idea was first mooted, he was personally against one.<br><br>But the environment has changed, particularly in the tourism industry.<br><br>While Singapore's tourism numbers have been increasing, market share has been falling.<br><br>He said realising the ideas to make Singapore a place that has 'buzz' is not so easy and that Singapore cannot stand still.<br><br>Singapore cannot afford to lose out in the tourism game as many jobs are at stake, even Singapore's position as an airhub.<br><br>Many cities around the world are reinventing themselves, including New York, London and Paris and Singapore cannot to stay still, he said.<br><br>The third point he wanted to make was that the casinos will be in integrated resorts, and a small but essential part of the project which makes it feasible.<br><br>And because of this, there is no need to have government grants for the resorts, he said. - CNA /ct<br></blockquote>That a few segments of society does not want a casino does not mean that the rest of the country need to bend to their wishes. This is a victory for the people who want a casino, who are in the majority. Though the process is suspiciously un-democratic, the fact remains that the popular view have been taken up.</div>
