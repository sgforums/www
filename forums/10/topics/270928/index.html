But total operating expenses still rose $2.1 million or 1.4 per cent to $153.3 million due to higher energy costs and other operating expenses.<br><br>Higher electricity costs for trains were offset by stronger MRT revenue, which grew $8.9 million, or 9.1 per cent, to $106.8 million. This was thanks to average daily passenger numbers rising 6.9 per cent to 1.2 million and, to a smaller extent, the fare increase from Oct 1, 2006. Operating profit grew 13 per cent to $32.0 million.<br><br>Relatedlinks:<br><br>Click here for SMRT's news release<br><br>Financial statements<br><br>Presentation material<br><br>Other corporate results reported on July 27<br><br>Consolidated corporate results table<br><br>Electricity and diesel costs rose by $3.6 million, or 19.7 per cent, to $21.8 million.<br><br>Bus revenue inched up 3.3 per cent to $48.3 million, resulting in an operating profit of $500,000 compared with a loss of $500,000 in the same quarter last year.<br><br>Taxi revenue improved by 11.4 per cent to $17.9 million and the operating loss narrowed to $300,000 compared with a loss of $3.2 million in the corresponding quarter.<br><br>Staff and related costs were down $2.2 million or 3.4 per cent to $62.4 million mainly because of the deconsolidation of Transit Link's staff cost.<br><br>Earnings per share rose to 2.5 cents from 1.8 cents in the same quarter last year. The group's net tangible asset per share was 42 cents, up from 39.6 cents three months earlier.<br><br>SMRT said it expects Q2 operating expenses to be higher than the same period last year because of more scheduled repairs and maintenance and the rise in employers' CPF contribution<br><br></div>

What is most infuriating if they are going to increase the fare again in October is that, first, they cut down on the frequency of MRT and secondly, they are still making bucks and bucks of money.  Thus it is not justifiable  for any more increase from them!  Having said this, I believe the damn ruling party will still support whatever crap reasons that the transport companies come out with to allow them to go ahead with the increase.  With the increase in fares the sickening money minded gahmen benefit as well.<br><br>To solve the problem, not only the constant increment in transport fares but in other areas as well is to get the ruling party out of power.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
