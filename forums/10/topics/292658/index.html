'It all depends on how well it heals.'<br><br>Mr Ng, who was breathing through a tube inserted into his throat, was conscious when The New Paper visited him yesterday.<br><br>The doctors had to create a tracheostomy - an opening at the base of the throat - to help him breathe as his windpipe was also injured.<br><br>Mr Ng, the only child of divorced parents, could read the newspapers and respond to people by shaking or nodding his head.<br><br>Initially, the couple communicated by typing messages on their handphones, but they stopped after being told they were not allowed to use handphones in the ICU.<br><br>NOTES<br><br>They now communicate by writing on pieces of paper provided by the nurse.<br><br>'The first thing he wrote to me was to tell me he was sorry for making me worried,' said Miss Hwee.<br><br>'I had been crying all the time since the accident and he said he was very worried about me when he was being wheeled into the operating theatre.'<br><br>-- Pictures: SHIN MIN DAILY NEWS<br>The terror of the accident is still fresh in her mind. At first, she was so shaken that she froze in shock.<br><br>She recalled: 'I was so shocked to see my boyfriend's throat slit open and blood gushing out that I could only sit on the road and cry for help.'<br><br>It was only when other motorists stopped to help that she regained her composure and called 995, she said.<br><br>Then, she ran into Thomson Medical Centre which was just nearby to ask for help.<br><br>Two nurses accompanied her to the scene. They were followed soon after by a doctor.<br><br>By then, an ambulance had also arrived.<br><br>Miss Hwee said Mr Ng was worried about the hospital bills and his job.<br><br>She said he takes home less than $2,000 a month. He lives with his 80-year-old grandmother and an aunt in a three-room HDB flat.<br><br>'He has to support his grandmother, so we don't know if he can cope with the hospital bills,' she said.<br><br>They also fear the accident might cause him to lose his job.<br><br>'We are worried that it will affect his taste buds which are crucial in his job as a cook,' she said.<br><br>Miss Hwee said Mr Ng has been trying to be strong so as not to worry her.<br><br>'But I feel the pain for him because I know that when he's alone at night in the ward, he must be imagining things and possibly thinking of the worst,' she said.<br><br>She said Mr Ng had obtained his Class 2B licence in February this year.<br><br>Her parents and two younger brothers, who had grown attached to Mr Ng during their courtship, had discouraged him against riding.<br><br>'But boys will be boys. He went ahead because he had a passion for riding,' she said.<br><br>Since the accident, Miss Hwee has not returned to the scene as she doesn't want to be reminded of what happened.<br><br>'My parents told me that when they passed by the place around 7pm that day, it appeared to have been fixed,' she said.<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkred;">FORCE OF NATURE </span></strong><br><br>Land Transport Authority (LTA) spokesman Suhana Kharudin said the overhead pedestrian bridge was struck by lightning late Sunday afternoon, 'causing the lightning conductor to be dislodged and a section of the conductor to dangle onto the carriageway'.<br><br>'When alerted, LTA immediately sent its staff to repair the lightning conductor,' she said.<br><br>Miss Suhana added that all overhead pedestrian bridges have lightning protection systems which are <span style="color: red;"><strong>'inspected on a yearly basis'</strong></span>.<br><br>The Traffic Police is investigating the incident.<br><br>Ms Hwee said that she and Mr Ng often go to karaoke chains to sing.<br><br>But they might not be able to do that anymore.<br><br>'I would give anything to hear his voice again. But even if I don't, I will not leave him because of this,' she said.<br><br></div>
