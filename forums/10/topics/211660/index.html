As for Asean liking to be like EU in the long run, i see it still really has a long way to go given that Asean nations operate differently the way EU does. the so called 'u bo chap me ok? and i will bo-chup u no matter what you are doing' attitude in the ASEAN only stands to further discredit us.</div>
