              <p>".......The defendants were flabbergasted and rose to remind the Judge that the allotted time for the hearing was three days until 28 May 08 (tomorrow). Only one day had elapsed.<br><br>Judge Belinda Ang ruled in the plaintiffs' favour.</p>
              <p>Then came a bigger surprise. At around 12 noon, Mr Lee Kuan Yew walked into the courtroom, just when Mr Lee Hsien Loong's cross-examination was coming to an end. <br><br>Mr Davinder Singh then told the court that the Minister Mentor had just arrived to testify. But he also had an “important matter” to attend to in the afternoon and wanted the session to continue through lunchtime to end at 2:15 pm.<br><br>What about lunch? Too bad. Everybody just had to wait until Mr Lee senior finished testifying.<br><br>"This is bizarre," Dr Chee objected to no avail. “At least tell us what this important matter is.”<br><br>Mr Singh refused to tell and Judge Ang did not ask. Again, she ruled in the plaintiff's favour. <br><br>Mr Davinder Singh then told the court that the Minister Mentor had just arrived to testify.

              <p> </p>
              <p>".....During the cross-examination of Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Dr Chee repeatedly asked him to not hide behind his lawyer and answer the questions put to him. <strong>Mr Singh objected to almost every question put to his client, questions regarding the GIC, HDB, CPF, NKF, ministers' pay and so on. Judge Ang upheld them.</strong> (A list of the questions the Prime Minister avoided answering will be published in due course.)<br><br>“You can tell your lawyer right here and now that you want to answer my questions,” Dr Chee pointed out. <strong>The Prime Minister stole a glance at Mr Singh and remained silent.<br></strong><br>“Let me warn you Mr Lee that you and your father's moral standing to rule Singapore is at stake. I ask that you re-consider your application to impose a guillotine time,” Dr Chee added.<br><br>At one point, Mr Singh, probably out of desperation, interjected: “As counsel, I made the decision!”<br><br>“Without your client's approval how can you do that?” Dr Chee replied, adding that Mr Singh was putting his client in a bad light.<br><br><strong>Mr Lee Hsien Loong remained stoic and silent."</strong><br></p>

              <p>* Dr Chee's full quote to Mr Lee Hsien Loong was: "I don't hate you. To hate someone, that someone must do something big and controversial. <strong>Your only claim to legitimacy is that you are Lee Kuan Yew's son.</strong> So don't flatter yourself. You are not worth the time and the effort."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>* Dr Chee's full quote to Mr Lee Kuan Yew was: "I don't hate you, I really don't. I feel sorry for you, I think you cut a pitiable figure. But no, I don't hate you. I feel sorry for you because I think that you derive much pleasure in what you do but find little joy in life."</p>

              <p>How sad that The SPH and CNA are reporting this selectively. They just put whatever is favourable to the Lees and damaging to the Chees. Thank heavens for the presence of internet. The entire coverage of the court proceedings is way too skewed!</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For one who seem to claim the ability to read the intention of the Lee's you are brilliant with your interpretation of events that simply show you riding on the fringes between fantasy and lunacy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If MM LKY accuse CSJ of being a pathological lunatic, he somehow had also missed you as being one hooting on his side of the fence.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If Singh know better than Lees how to handle cross exam - ''why did the lees need to be smarter than SC Singh in court ?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If MM LKY has been awarded double honor from Cambridge 60 years ago, he must be stupid to continue doing the dirty job himself in his MM position that is equivilanet of the MAFIA God Father.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Does the God Father make a decision and execute the decision himself ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely, it will be a long way before you can be the King with your own pride that allow you to continue your own genetic line - meanwhile, all you can do is continue being a "noisy lion" and hope that you still know what to do if a lioness can be attracted by you before you get mauled by another stronger and noisier lion.</span></p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Has CSJ reached God Frather status ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even MM has called him a ''political juvenile'' - and yet he has instructed SC Singh to work overtime to ensure that CSJ do not have any room to ask all the necessary questions that will embarrass both the Lee's.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">At least, CSJ will have the courage and honesty to take the responsibility of breaching the restrictive court procedurial guidelines that were purposefully placed to prevent him and his lawyer from doing a more effective job.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">At least, CSJ had the honesty and courage not to let his lawyer take the risk of being reprimanded, while he carry the burden of his own defense by going against the restrictive court instructions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you know how to hunt for your own food, or only be a useless ''noisy lion'' to depend on the lioness to hunt for you, and you wait to get the first bite even as you do not contribute any energy to place the food at your filthy paws ?</span></p>

              <p>Chees asked Lees to answer questions even Singh objected.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">SC Singh is an MP, as well as the Lee's - and they are claiming that their personal reputations and that of the Government has been impugned.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now who pays for the legal fees ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Does the State pays for the legal fees to restore the reputation of the Government and both the Ministers ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do the two ministerial individuals pay part of the legal fees that went to restore their personal reputation ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If Singh do not object - and has been reported to be constantly jumping up like a jack rabbit to object to every questions asked by CSJ - do you think that Singh will continue to practise law if he give a poor performance of himself with the double honors Lee watching his every move ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">3.I appeal to Lees and Chees to apply to court to release</span></p>

              <p>orders,folding arms etc.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, please do give your noisiest lion efforts to have make possible the release of the entire ''vidoe recordings in court'' - and WITHOUT any censorship that let us see only the snippets that place CSJ in bad ways, and cutting out all the embarrassing moments that CSJ had placed the Lee's in.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can you do so without raising your "figure pointing", and raising voice in your usual noisy lion manner ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is doubtful that you can even get the Judge to shake her heads 3 times or less.</span></p>

              <p>In an interview with Time magazine in 2005, LKY said, "If you defame us, we're prepared to sue you, go into the witness box and be cross-examined. You can brief the best lawyers and demolish us. If I'm involved, I go to the witness box. <strong>And you can question me, not only on the particular defamatory issue, but all issues in my life</strong>."</p>
              <p>And now everything is an objection in court.</p>

              <p>If LKY has the power to appoint the Judicial Supremo, surely Belinda Ang can do little but pander to his whims and fancies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So is this a joke? The Chief Justice appointing the judge to preside over a case where his own boss is involved.</p>
