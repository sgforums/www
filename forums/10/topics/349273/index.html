              <h2>Change (in rhetoric) we can believe in.</h2>
              <p>I've said all along that whatever good changes might occur in regard
              to non-foreign policy issues, such as what's already taken place
              concerning the environment and abortion, the Obama administration will
              not produce any significantly worthwhile change in US foreign policy;
              little done in this area will reduce the level of misery that the
              American Empire regularly brings down upon humanity. And to the extent
              that Barack Obama is willing to clearly reveal what he believes about
              anything controversial, he appears to believe in the empire.</p>
              <p>The Obamania bubble should already have begun to lose some air with
              the multiple US bombings of Pakistan within the first few days
              following the inauguration. The Pentagon briefed the White House of its
              plans, and the White House had no objection. So bombs away — Barack
              Obama's first war crime. The dozens of victims were, of course, all bad
              people, including all the women and children. As with all these
              bombings, we'll never know the names of all the victims — It's doubtful
              that even Pakistan knows — or what crimes they had committed to deserve
              the death penalty. Some poor Pakistani probably earned a nice fee for
              telling the authorities that so-and-so bad guy lived in that house over
              there; too bad for all the others who happened to live with the bad
              guy, assuming of course that the bad guy himself actually lived in that
              house over there.</p>
              <p>The new White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, declined to
              answer questions about the first airstrikes, saying "I'm not going to
              get into these matters."<sup><a id="link-1" href="http://www.killinghope.org/bblum6/aer66.html#note-1">1</a></sup> Where have we heard that before?</p>
              <p>After many of these bombings in recent years, a spokesperson for the
              United States or NATO has solemnly declared: “We regret the loss of
              life.” These are the same words used by the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
              on a number of occasions, but their actions were typically called
              “terrorist”.</p>
              <p>I wish I could be an Obamaniac. I envy their enthusiasm. Here, in
              the form of an open letter to President Obama, are some of the "changes
              we can believe in" in foreign policy that would have to occur to win
              over the non-believers like me.</p>
              <h3>Iran</h3>
              <p>Just leave them alone. There is no "Iranian problem". They are a
              threat to no one. Iran hasn't invaded any other country in centuries.
              No, President Ahmadinejad did <em>not</em> threaten Israel with any
              violence. Stop patrolling the waters surrounding Iran with American
              warships. Stop halting Iranian ships to check for arms shipments to
              Hamas. (That's generally regarded as an act of war.) Stop using Iranian
              dissident groups to carry out terrorist attacks inside Iran. Stop
              kidnaping Iranian diplomats. Stop the continual spying and recruiting
              within Iran. And yet, with all that, you can still bring yourself to
              say: "If countries like Iran are willing to unclench their fist, they
              will find an extended hand from us."<sup><a id="link-2" href="http://www.killinghope.org/bblum6/aer66.html#note-2">2</a></sup></p>
              <p>Iran has as much right to arm Hamas as the US has to arm Israel. And
              there is no international law that says that the United States, the UK,
              Russia, China, Israel, France, Pakistan, and India are entitled to
              nuclear weapons, but Iran is not. Iran has every reason to feel
              threatened. Will you continue to provide nuclear technology to India,
              which has not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, while
              threatening Iran, an NPT signatory, with sanctions and warfare?</p>
              <h3>Russia</h3>
              <p>Stop surrounding the country with new NATO members. Stop looking to
              instigate new "color" revolutions in former Soviet republics and
              satellites. Stop arming and supporting Georgia in its attempts to block
              the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhasia, the breakaway regions
              on the border of Russia. And stop the placement of anti-missile systems
              in Russia's neighbors, the Czech Republic and Poland, on the absurd
              grounds that it's to ward off an Iranian missile attack. It was
              Czechoslovakia and Poland that the Germans also used to defend their
              imperialist ambitions — The two countries were being invaded on the
              grounds that Germans there were being maltreated. The world was told.</p>
              <p>"The U.S. government made a big mistake from the breakup of the
              Soviet Union," said former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev last year.
              "At that time the Russian people were really euphoric about America and
              the U.S. was really number one in the minds of many Russians." But, he
              added, the United States moved aggressively to expand NATO and appeared
              gleeful at Russia's weakness.<sup><a id="link-3" href="http://www.killinghope.org/bblum6/aer66.html#note-3">3</a></sup></p>
              <h3>Cuba</h3>
              <p>Making it easier to travel there and send remittances is very nice
              (if, as expected, you do that), but these things are dwarfed by the
              need to end the US embargo. In 1999, Cuba filed a suit against the
              United States for $181.1 billion in compensation for economic losses
              and loss of life during the almost forty years of this aggression. The
              suit held Washington responsible for the death of 3,478 Cubans and the
              wounding and disabling of 2,099 others. We can now add ten more years
              to all three figures. The negative, often crippling, effects of the
              embargo extend into every aspect of Cuban life.</p>
              <p>In addition to closing Guantanamo prison, the adjacent US military
              base established in 1903 by American military force should be closed
              and the land returned to Cuba.</p>
              <p>The Cuban Five, held prisoner in the United States for over 10
              years, guilty only of trying to prevent American-based terrorism
              against Cuba, should be released. Actually there were 10 Cubans
              arrested; five knew that they could expect no justice in an American
              court and pled guilty to get shorter sentences.<sup><a id="link-4" href="http://www.killinghope.org/bblum6/aer66.html#note-4">4</a></sup></p>
              <h3>Iraq</h3>
              <p>Freeing the Iraqi people to death ... Nothing short of a complete
              withdrawal of all US forces, military and contracted, and the closure
              of all US military bases and detention and torture centers, can promise
              a genuine end to US involvement and the beginning of meaningful Iraqi
              sovereignty. To begin immediately. Anything less is just politics and
              imperialism as usual. In six years of war, the Iraqi people have lost
              everything of value in their lives. As the Washington Post reported in
              2007: "It is a common refrain among war-weary Iraqis that things were
              better before the U.S.-led invasion in 2003."<sup><a id="link-5" href="http://www.killinghope.org/bblum6/aer66.html#note-5">5</a></sup> The good news is that the Iraqi people have 5,000 years experience in
              crafting a society to live in. They should be given the opportunity.</p>
              <h3>Saudi Arabia</h3>
              <p>Demand before the world that this government enter the 21st century
              (or at least the 20th), or the United States has to stop pretending
              that it gives a damn about human rights, women, homosexuals, religious
              liberty, and civil liberties. The Bush family had long-standing
              financial ties to members of the Saudi ruling class. What will be your
              explanation if you maintain the status quo?</p>
              <h3>Haiti</h3>
              <p>Reinstate the exiled Jean Bertrand Aristide to the presidency, which
              he lost when the United States overthrew him in 2004. To seek
              forgiveness for our sins, give the people of Haiti lots and lots of
              money and assistance.</p>
              <h3>Colombia</h3>
              <p>Stop giving major military support to a government that for years
              has been intimately tied to death squads, torture, and drug
              trafficking; in no other country in the world have so many progressive
              candidates for public office, unionists, and human-rights activists
              been murdered. Are you concerned that this is the closest ally the
              United States has in all of Latin America?</p>
              <h3>Venezuela</h3>
              <p>Hugo Chavez may talk too much but he's no threat except to the
              capitalist system of Venezuela and, by inspiration, elsewhere in Latin
              America. He has every good historical reason to bad-mouth American
              foreign policy, including Washington's role in the coup that overthrew
              him in 2002. If you can't understand why Chavez is not in love with
              what the United States does all over the world, I can give you a long
              reading list.</p>
              <p>Put an end to support for Chavez's opposition by the Agency for
              International Development, the National Endowment for Democracy, and
              other US government agencies. US diplomats should not be meeting with
              Venezuelans plotting coups against Chavez, nor should they be
              interfering in elections.</p>
              <p>Send Luis Posada from Florida to Venezuela, which has asked for his
              extradition for his masterminding the bombing of a Cuban airline in
              1976, taking 73 lives. Extradite the man, or try him in the US, or stop
              talking about the war on terrorism.</p>
              <p>And please try not to repeat the nonsense about Venezuela being a
              dictatorship. It's a freer society than the United States. It has, for
              example, a genuine opposition daily media, non-existent in the United
              States. If you doubt that, try naming a single American daily newspaper
              or TV network that was <em>unequivocally</em> against the US invasions
              of Iraq, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Panama, Grenada, and Vietnam. Or even
              against two of them? How about one? Is there a single one that supports
              Hamas and/or Hezbollah? A few weeks ago, the New York Times published a
              story concerning a possible Israeli attack upon Iran, and stated:
              "Several details of the covert effort have been omitted from this
              account, at the request of senior United States intelligence and
              administration officials, to avoid harming continuing operations."<sup><a id="link-6" href="http://www.killinghope.org/bblum6/aer66.html#note-6">6 </a></sup></p>
              <p>Alas, Mr. President, among other disparaging remarks, you've already
              accused Chavez of being "a force that has interrupted progress in the
              region."<sup><a id="link-7" href="http://www.killinghope.org/bblum6/aer66.html#note-7">7</a></sup> This is a statement so contrary to the facts, even to plain common
              sense, so hypocritical given Washington's history in Latin America,
              that I despair of you ever freeing yourself from the ideological
              shackles that have bound every American president of the past century.
              It may as well be inscribed in their oath of office — that a president
              must be antagonistic toward any country that has expressly rejected
              Washington as the world's savior. You made this remark in an interview
              with Univision, Venezuela's leading, implacable media critic of the
              Chavez government. What regional progress could you be referring to,
              the police state of Colombia?</p>
              <h3>Bolivia</h3>
              <p>Stop American diplomats, Peace Corps volunteers, Fulbright scholars,
              and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, from spying and fomenting
              subversion inside Bolivia. As the first black president of the United
              States, you could try to cultivate empathy toward, and from, the first
              indigenous president of Bolivia. Congratulate Bolivian president Evo
              Morales on winning a decisive victory on a recent referendum to approve
              a new constitution which enshrines the rights of the indigenous people
              and, for the first time, institutes separation of church and state.</p>
              <h3>Afghanistan</h3>
              <p>Perhaps the most miserable people on the planet, with no hope in
              sight as long as the world's powers continue to bomb, invade,
              overthrow, occupy, and slaughter in their land. The US Army is planning
              on throwing 30,000 more young American bodies into the killing fields
              and is currently building eight new major bases in southern
              Afghanistan. Is that not insane? If it makes sense to you I suggest
              that you start the practice of the president accompanying the military
              people when they inform American parents that their child has died in a
              place called Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>If you pull out from this nightmare, you could also stop bombing
              Pakistan. Leave even if it results in the awful Taliban returning to
              power. They at least offer security to the country's wretched, and
              indications are that the current Taliban are not all fundamentalists.</p>
              <p>But first, close Bagram prison and other detention camps, which are worse than Guantanamo.</p>
              <p>And stop pretending that the United States gives a damn about the
              Afghan people and not oil and gas pipelines which can bypass Russia and
              Iran. The US has been endeavoring to fill the power vacuum in Central
              Asia created by the Soviet Union’s dissolution in order to assert
              Washington's domination over a region containing the second largest
              proven reserves of petroleum and natural gas in the world. Is
              Afghanistan going to be your Iraq?</p>
              <h3>Israel</h3>
              <p>The most difficult task for you, but the one that would earn for you
              the most points. To declare that Israel is no longer the 51st state of
              the union would bring down upon your head the wrath of the most
              powerful lobby in the world and its many wealthy followers, as well as
              the Christian-fundamentalist Right and much of the media. But if you
              really want to see peace between Israel and Palestine you must cut off
              all military aid to Israel, in any form: hardware, software, personnel,
              money. And stop telling Hamas it has to recognize Israel and renounce
              violence until you tell Israel that it has to recognize Hamas and
              renounce violence.</p>
              <h3>North Korea</h3>
              <p>Bush called the country part of "the axis of evil", and Kim Jong Il a "pygmy" and "a spoiled child at a dinner table."<sup><a id="link-8" href="http://www.killinghope.org/bblum6/aer66.html#note-8">8</a></sup> But you might try to understand where Kim Jong Il is coming from. He
              sees that UN agencies went into Iraq and disarmed it, and then the
              United States invaded. The logical conclusion is not to disarm, but to
              go nuclear.</p>
              <h3>Central America</h3>
              <p>Stop interfering in the elections of Nicaragua, El Salvador and
              Guatemala, year after year. The Cold War has ended. And though you
              can't undo the horror perpetrated by the United States in the region in
              the 1980s, you can at least be kind to the immigrants in the US who
              came here trying to escape the long-term consequences of that terrible
              decade.</p>
              <h3>Vietnam</h3>
              <p>In your inauguration speech you spoke proudly of those "who have
              carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom ...
              For us, they fought and died, in places like ... Khe Sanh." So it is
              your studied and sincere opinion that the 58,000 American sevicemembers
              who died in Vietnam, while helping to kill over a million Vietnamese,
              gave their life for our prosperity and freedom? Would you care to
              defend that proposition without resort to any platitudes?</p>
              <p>You might also consider this: In all the years since the Vietnam War
              ended, the three million Vietnamese suffering from diseases and
              deformities caused by US sprayings of the deadly chemical "Agent
              Orange" have received from the United States no medical attention, no
              environmental remediation, no compensation, and no official apology.</p>
              <h3>Kosovo</h3>
              <p>Stop supporting the most gangster government in the world, which has
              specialized in kidnaping, removing human body parts for sale, heavy
              trafficking in drugs, trafficking in women, various acts of terrorism,
              and ethnic cleansing of Serbs. This government would not be in power if
              the Bush administration had not seen them as America's natural allies.
              Do you share that view? UN Resolution 1244, adopted in 1999, reaffirmed
              the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the former Federal
              Republic of Yugoslavia to which Serbia is now the recognized successor
              state, and established that Kosovo was to remain part of Serbia. Why do
              we have a huge and permanent military base in that tiny self-declared
              country?</p>
              <h3>NATO</h3>
              <p>From protecting Europe against a [mythical] Soviet invasion to
              becoming an occupation army in Afghanistan. Put an end to this
              historical anachronism, what Russian leader Vladimir called "the
              stinking corpse of the cold war."<sup><a id="link-9" href="http://www.killinghope.org/bblum6/aer66.html#note-9">9</a></sup>.
              You can accomplish this simply by leaving the organization. Without the
              United States and its never-ending military actions and
              officially-designated enemies, the organization would not even have the
              pretense of a purpose, which is all it has left. Members have had to be
              bullied, threatened and bribed to send armed forces to Afghanistan.</p>
              <h3>School of the Americas</h3>
              <p>Latin American countries almost never engage in war with each other,
              or any other countries. So for what kind of warfare are its military
              officers being trained by the United States? To suppress their own
              people. Close this school (the name has now been changed to protect the
              guilty) at Ft. Benning, Georgia that the United States has used to
              prepare two generations of Latin American military officers for careers
              in overthrowing progressive governments, death squads, torture, holding
              down dissent, and other charming activities. The British are fond of
              saying that the Empire was won on the playing fields of Eton. Americans
              can say that the road to Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and Bagram began in
              the classrooms of the School of the Americas.</p>
              <h3>Torture</h3>
              <p>Your executive orders concerning this matter of utmost importance
              are great to see, but they still leave something to be desired. They
              state that the new standards ostensibly putting an end to torture apply
              to any "armed conflict". But what if your administration chooses to
              view future counterterrorism and other operations as not part of an
              "armed conflict"? And no mention is made of "rendition" — kidnaping a
              man off the street, throwing him in a car, throwing a hood over his
              head, stripping off his clothes, placing him in a diaper, shackling him
              from every angle, and flying him to a foreign torture dungeon. Why
              can't you just say that this and all other American use of proxy
              torturers is banned? Forever.</p>
              <p>It's not enough to say that you're against torture or that the
              United States "does not torture" or "will not torture". George W. Bush
              said the same on a regular basis. To show that you're not George W.
              Bush you need to investigate those responsible for the use of torture,
              even if this means prosecuting a small army of Bush administration war
              criminals.</p>
              <p>You aren't off to a good start by appointing former CIA official
              John O. Brennan as your top adviser on counterterrorism. Brennan has
              called "rendition" a "vital tool" and praised the CIA's interrogation
              techniques for providing "lifesaving" intelligence.<sup><a id="link-10" href="http://www.killinghope.org/bblum6/aer66.html#note-10">10</a></sup> Whatever were you thinking, Barack?</p>
              <h3>Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi</h3>
              <p>Free this Libyan man from his prison in Scotland, where he is
              serving a life sentence after being framed by the United States for the
              bombing of PanAm flight 103 in December 1988, which took the lives of
              270 people over Scotland. Iran actually financed a Palestinian group to
              carry out the bombing — as revenge for the US shooting down an Iranian
              passenger plane in July, killing 290 — not Libya, which the US accused
              for political reasons.<sup><a id="link-11" href="http://www.killinghope.org/bblum6/aer66.html#note-11">11</a></sup> Nations do not behave any more cynical than that. Megrahi lies in
              prison now dying of cancer, but still the US and the UK will not free
              him. It would be too embarrassing to admit to 20 years of shameless
              lying.</p>
              <p>Mr. President, there's a lot more to be undone in our foreign policy
              if you wish to be taken seriously as a moral leader like Martin Luther
              King, Jr.: banning the use of depleted uranium, cluster bombs, and
              other dreadful weapons; joining the International Criminal Court
              instead of trying to sabotage it; making a number of other long-overdue
              apologies in addition to the one mentioned re Vietnam; and much more.
              You've got your work cut out for you if you really want to bring some
              happiness to this sad old world, make America credible and beloved
              again, stop creating armies of anti-American terrorists, and win over
              people like me.</p>
              <p>And do you realize that you can eliminate all state and federal
              budget deficits in the United States, provide free health care and free
              university education to every American, pay for an unending array of
              worthwhile social and cultural programs, all just by ending our wars in
              Iraq and Afghanistan, not starting any new ones, and closing down the
              Pentagon's 700+ military bases? Think of it as the peace dividend
              Americans were promised when the Cold War would end some day, but never
              received. How about you delivering it, Mr. President? It's not too late.</p>
              <p>But you are committed to the empire; and the empire is committed to war.  Too bad.</p>
