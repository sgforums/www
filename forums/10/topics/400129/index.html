Help us to have ears to hear so that we will hear everything. Pour out Your love &amp; power. </span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">"I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other.16 So, because you are lukewarm - neither hot nor cold - I am about to spew you out of my mouth." 17 You say "I am rich, I have acquired wealth &amp; do not need a thing." But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked. 18 I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; &amp; white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see. 19 Those whom I love I rebuke &amp; discipline. So be earnest &amp; repent. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">Nita saw a vision of a white horse (she has seen it 5 times since 1990) bringing separation &amp; the cycle of judgment in S'pore. The cycle of separation has begun &amp; will increase. The cycle of judgment is like the wet snowball that becomes larger &amp; sweeps people in its path until God has done a thorough work. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">In the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">US</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">, the cycle of judgment has been in existence for 13 years. Some are still having difficulty accepting that there is a cycle of judgment. But there have been tornados that destroyed 2 to 3 cities, earthquakes, hurricanes that destroyed billions of $ of properties, drought, Sep 11. In 1990, the Lord showed Nita that the destruction of Pentagon is judgment from God. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">God's judgment has come to the church leaders, states, nations. US has suffered much. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">Canada</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> has moved to a degree of cycle of judgment. Now the judgment has come to S'pore. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">First thing God will do is to deal with the church. God showed Nita the problem with S'pore church is pride. Although S'pore is a very small island, God has blessed S'pore, put a rainbow around the island &amp; poured down blessings. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">But we have taken the blessings of God into ourselves in a wrong way &amp; have become lifted up with pride. If left unchecked, we believe that we are invincible &amp; that whatever we do, God is with us. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">A very large % of the churches are full of pride. God is patient with us for a while. Because He is longsuffering, we think He is approving. When we least expect it, we find that we are swept by the cycle of judgment. God is watching over the S'pore church and checking out. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">We must weep for the sins that we see in the S'pore churches. We must weep with pain, grief &amp; repentance that God will purge His church. When leaders go astray, we have to pray that God will have mercy &amp; bring them out of deception. Judgment is swift and hard to bear. If we believe that we have been blessed, than the blessings must go where it needs to go. e.g. to bless the poor &amp; needy. We should not just acquire wealth &amp; increase in wealth. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">Nita has seen mega churches been judged and became almost empty within one day. It is not wrong to build big churches to support big congregation but extravagance is wrong. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">We must realize our need for kingdom power and authority. When we honestly examine our heart conditions, we are not rich in spirit. May God shake His church &amp; shake us awake. We need to hunger for Christ &amp; see His kingdom power, beauty. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">We need to be broken before God in prayer. We must pray for revival &amp; outpouring of His Holy Spirit, His righteousness. If we do not pray, we will not see revival. Pray for restoration. </span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">Nita was given a vision of the scene of a stormy sea where there was a large ship that looked like a tall freight. A Trojan horse was seen walking in the water towards the ship. The Trojan horse continued to walk and stood next to the ship. The ship did nothing. It was not concerned. The horse found the neck of the ship, took a huge bite &amp; the ship sank. On the side of the ship Nita saw the name </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> and the name </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">China</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> was written on the Trojan horse. </span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">The day will come if God cannot have His way with </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">, He will allow </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">China</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> to take over </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> &amp; there will be great devastation. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">Just as in </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">America</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> when they were all so sure of their peace, safety &amp; saying all is well despite the prophets telling US to repent, Sep 11 happened &amp; no one was prepared for that. There was a breach of covering from the Lord because of their sins. God loves </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">America</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> but Satan hates it &amp; wants to destroy it. </span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">God loves </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> but Satan hates it &amp; wants to create breaches.

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">God is dealing with S'pore's pride &amp; pride of the church. When one has pride, he/she is the last person to know it. The pride in S'pore's church is monstrous. God is very displeased that we have exalted ourselves. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">When pride &amp; self idolatry goes up, holiness goes down. When the church is filled with pride, God can send a prophet but they will not listen. </span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">The Lord wept when the Jews were destroyed in the holocaust when there was pride &amp; a haughty spirit. One year before </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">Africa</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> was swept by Islam &amp; the churches destroyed horrendously, the Lord wept through Nita (40 mins) in a lamentation for the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">church</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> of </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">Sudan</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">. </span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">If the church is not walking in holiness, humility, righteousness, walking in its knees in prayers, any nation is subjected to the forces of the enemies. We must live a life of holiness, brokenness &amp; on our knees. We cannot be up to the standard if we are not praying. </span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">There must be prayers, more prayers, weeping, more weeping, brokenness, contrition, pouring out of our hearts over our sins and the sins of our nation over and over again until pride is broken. Build altars of humility. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">We must weep until the curse of pride is broken. Those that God loves He will reprove. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">The prophetic future of S'pore is not good. There is an urgency to weep &amp; pray. Nita has been pleading with the Lord to give us time because we are a baby nation. This year when she is in S'pore at Cornerstone (Tue-Sun), the Lord has not allowed her to sleep more than 2 hrs each night. When she went to <span class="SpellE">Petaling</span> <span class="SpellE">Jaya</span> she could sleep but when she returned this week to S'pore it has been sleepless nights weeping over S'pore. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: gray; font-family: Verdana;">Nita sense that something is about to occur &amp; will be fulfilled if we do not go on our knees to pray and intervene it. This is the <span class="SpellE">kairos</span> moment when God will listen. We have to weep so that S'pore can be spared &amp; given time to repent.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">The LORD is very concerned for</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">.

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">Prayer: Father we long to hear from You what You are saying to S'pore so that the church can bear Your passion &amp; Your concern.

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">Rev 3:15-19</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">"I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other.16 So, because you are lukewarm - neither hot nor cold - I am about to spew you out of my mouth." 17 You say "I am rich, I have acquired wealth &amp; do not need a thing." But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked. 18 I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; &amp; white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see. 19 Those whom I love I rebuke &amp; discipline. So be earnest &amp; repent.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">Nita saw a vision of a white horse (she has seen it 5 times since 1990) bringing separation &amp; the cycle of judgment in S'pore. The cycle of separation has begun &amp; will increase. The cycle of judgment is like the wet snowball that becomes larger &amp; sweeps people in its path until God has done a thorough work.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">In the</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">US</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">, the cycle of judgment has been in existence for 13 years. Some are still having difficulty accepting that there is a cycle of judgment. But there have been tornados that destroyed 2 to 3 cities, earthquakes, hurricanes that destroyed billions of $ of properties, drought, Sep 11. In 1990, the Lord showed Nita that the destruction of Pentagon is judgment from God.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">God's judgment has come to the church leaders, states, nations. US has suffered much.</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">Canada</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">has moved to a degree of cycle of judgment. Now the judgment has come to S'pore.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">First thing God will do is to deal with the church. God showed Nita the problem with S'pore church is pride. Although S'pore is a very small island, God has blessed S'pore, put a rainbow around the island &amp; poured down blessings.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">But we have taken the blessings of God into ourselves in a wrong way &amp; have become lifted up with pride. If left unchecked, we believe that we are invincible &amp; that whatever we do, God is with us.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">A very large % of the churches are full of pride. God is patient with us for a while. Because He is longsuffering, we think He is approving. When we least expect it, we find that we are swept by the cycle of judgment. God is watching over the S'pore church and checking out.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">We must weep for the sins that we see in the S'pore churches. We must weep with pain, grief &amp; repentance that God will purge His church. When leaders go astray, we have to pray that God will have mercy &amp; bring them out of deception. Judgment is swift and hard to bear. If we believe that we have been blessed, than the blessings must go where it needs to go. e.g. to bless the poor &amp; needy. We should not just acquire wealth &amp; increase in wealth.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">Nita has seen mega churches been judged and became almost empty within one day. It is not wrong to build big churches to support big congregation but extravagance is wrong.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">We must realize our need for kingdom power and authority. When we honestly examine our heart conditions, we are not rich in spirit. May God shake His church &amp; shake us awake. We need to hunger for Christ &amp; see His kingdom power, beauty.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">We need to be broken before God in prayer. We must pray for revival &amp; outpouring of His Holy Spirit, His righteousness. If we do not pray, we will not see revival. Pray for restoration.</span></p>

A Trojan horse was seen walking in the water towards the ship. The Trojan horse continued to walk and stood next to the ship. The ship did nothing. It was not concerned. The horse found the neck of the ship, took a huge bite &amp; the ship sank. On the side of the ship Nita saw the name</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">Singapore</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">and the name</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">China</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">was written on the Trojan horse.</span></p>

There was a breach of covering from the Lord because of their sins. God loves</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">America</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">but Satan hates it &amp; wants to destroy it.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">God is dealing with S'pore's pride &amp; pride of the church. When one has pride, he/she is the last person to know it. The pride in S'pore's church is monstrous. God is very displeased that we have exalted ourselves.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">When pride &amp; self idolatry goes up, holiness goes down. When the church is filled with pride, God can send a prophet but they will not listen.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">The Lord wept when the Jews were destroyed in the holocaust when there was pride &amp; a haughty spirit. One year before</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">Africa</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">was swept by Islam &amp; the churches destroyed horrendously, the Lord wept through Nita (40 mins) in a lamentation for the</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">church</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">of</span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">Sudan</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">If the church is not walking in holiness, humility, righteousness, walking in its knees in prayers, any nation is subjected to the forces of the enemies. We must live a life of holiness, brokenness &amp; on our knees. We cannot be up to the standard if we are not praying.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">There must be prayers, more prayers, weeping, more weeping, brokenness, contrition, pouring out of our hearts over our sins and the sins of our nation over and over again until pride is broken. Build altars of humility.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">We must weep until the curse of pride is broken. Those that God loves He will reprove.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">The prophetic future of S'pore is not good. There is an urgency to weep &amp; pray. Nita has been pleading with the Lord to give us time because we are a baby nation. This year when she is in S'pore at Cornerstone (Tue-Sun), the Lord has not allowed her to sleep more than 2 hrs each night. When she went to <span>Petaling</span> <span>Jaya</span> she could sleep but when she returned this week to S'pore it has been sleepless nights weeping over S'pore.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: gray;">Nita sense that something is about to occur &amp; will be fulfilled if we do not go on our knees to pray and intervene it. This is the <span>kairos</span> moment when God will listen. We have to weep so that S'pore can be spared &amp; given time to repent.</span></p>
