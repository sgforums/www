The streets are clean, the food is good, the people well-off. Four million of them live on that small island, yet the traffic flows and public transport is excellent. It seems like a Western city in Asia.<br><br>But the Nguyen Tuong Van case reminds us that Singapore is very different from us. Why would a government not only allow a death penalty to be imposed on any drug traffickers, but make it mandatory for judges to do so?<br><br>It's about control. In Australia, ultimately, the people control the government. In Singapore, the government controls the people.<br><br>I was reminded powerfully of that one afternoon. Stepping out of Singapore's state-of-the-art subway system, I rode the escalator into a small park. There stood an unkempt old man with a small pile of books for sale. It was former opposition leader J. B. Jeyaretnam.<br><br>In 2001, JB was declared bankrupt after losing a series of libel cases to government figures from Lee Kuan Yew down. Now he was banned from Parliament and reduced to selling his own books to live.<br><br>It is a strategy routinely used by Singapore's ruling People's Action Party to shut up the opposition. The courts in Singapore are an arm of government. In this case, JB's final crime was to accuse the organisers of the Tamil Language Week of being "government stooges". He was penalised more than $A500,000 in damages and court costs. It ended his political career.<br><br>Lee and his successor, Goh Chok Tong, then sued another opposition leader, Chee Soon Juan. An American-trained neuropsychologist, Chee is already banned from the next election after suggesting that Malay schoolgirls should be allowed to wear headscarves to school. The courts ruled that that was speaking on religion, a forbidden topic.<br><br>In a separate defamation action, they then ordered Chee to pay Lee and Goh $A400,000. If he fails to do that, he too will be made bankrupt.<br><br>One last example: in August, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made one of his occasional gestures of liberalisation, saying Singapore must become more "open" and "inclusive". Yet days later, the thought police ordered filmmaker Martyn See to hand over his video camera and his new documentary on Chee, Singapore Rebel for Singapore law bans films "directed towards any political end". See now faces a possible two-year jail term and an $A80,000 fine.<br><br>Welcome to Singapore, Asia's Western city.<br><br>In economic terms, Singapore today is very much a Western country. In real national income per head, the World Bank ranks it just behind Australia. In the past 25 years, its output per head has almost trebled, rising 171 per cent while Australia's rose 67 per cent. Unemployment has averaged 3.3 per cent.<br><br>And while Australia spends more than it earns, borrowing heavily from the world and running a current account deficit of 6 per cent of GDP, Singapore earns far more than it spends. It invests heavily in the rest of the world, not least in Australia, and runs a current account surplus of 25 per cent of GDP.<br><br>That success grew out of decades of world's-best economic policies aimed at making Singapore a great place for multinationals to invest in. The government suppressed consumer spending through heavy social security taxes and used the money to build state-of-the-art infrastructure to lure foreign investors.<br><br>Singapore became not only South-East Asia's main port, but a heavyweight manufacturer in electronics, pharmaceuticals and petroleum products, and the services hub of the region.<br><br>Since the 1997 Asia crisis, however, that growth strategy has taken a battering. China now attracts the foreign investors that used to go to South-East Asia. Lower-cost Malaysia is luring away visiting ships and corporate offices. Yet Singapore's economy still grew by 8.4 per cent last year, and by 7 per cent in the year to September. Its aim now is to restructure itself as a centre for the knowledge economy: finance, R&amp;D, medical sciences, education, the lot.<br><br>But how does that fit with a strategy of suppressing free speech, a free press, and independent courts? No developed country is remotely like Singapore in this. On press freedom, Reporters without Borders ranks it 147th out of 167 countries, five places below the Democratic Republic of the Congo. All other developed countries are in the top 60.<br><br>Yet for all the disgust Australians feel about the hanging of Nguyen, the ties between the two countries are too important for our Government to publicly embarrass Singapore. It is our key ally in the region, and played a big part in getting Australia invited to join the regional clubs: the Asian Regional Forum, the ASEAN free trade area, and now the inaugural East Asia Summit. In diplomatic terms, we owe it favours, not vice versa. John Howard and Alexander Downer are right not to capsize that relationship.<br><br>But there is one thing they might look at. The key issue in the relationship now is the campaign by government-owned Singapore Airlines to bust the high-priced Qantas-United Airlines duopoly of flights to the US. Cabinet is due to decide on this next month, and the odds are that this time Qantas will lose out to cheaper fares.<br><br>Politically, however, that would be an unpopular decision right now. Cabinet might adopt a very Asian tactic: just put the whole issue off for a year or so, to politely let Singapore feel the costs of its disregard for human life.<br><br>Tim Colebatch is economics editor.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A last sunrise, then a day of farewells</strong><br>Email Print Normal font Large font By Connie Levett and Steve Butcher, Singapore<br>December 1, 2005<br><br>NGUYEN Tuong Van will see his last sunrise today. By the time the sun breaks the South China Sea horizon and touches Changi Prison tomorrow, the 25-year-old Australian will be dead.<br><br>In Singapore they say "hanged at dawn", but in fact Nguyen will go to gallows at 6am, before sunrise.<br><br>Today will be the long goodbye, with final visits from his close friends Kelly Ng and Bronwyn Lew, and painful farewells with his mother Kim and twin brother Khoa.<br><br>Who Nguyen Tuong Van sees on his last day is very much in his own hands. He will be allowed at least four hours of outside visits.<br><br>His Australian lawyers, Lex Lasry, QC, and Julian McMahon, are expected to make a final visit, with Nguyen's Singaporean barrister, Joseph Theseira . Now based in Melbourne, Mr Theseira said he was returning to Singapore last night to fulfil a promise to his client.<br><br>There are other matters Nguyen must face today. He will receive a visit in his cell from the hangman, still expected to be Darshan Singh despite questionable claims this week from the 74-year-old that he had been sacked.<br><br>"Darshan Singh has not been 'sacked' and continues to be a contract officer engaged by the Prisons Department. There is no change to his status," the department said in a statement.<br><br>The executioner will weigh Nguyen to calculate the precise length of rope needed to break his neck when the trapdoor drops from under him.<br><br>Visiting hours finish at 5pm. What to do in the remaining time? Pray and write, say those closest to him.<br><br>When Nguyen's appeal was dismissed last October, his mother said outside the court: "He is good, he is always praying."<br><br>Today Nguyen, a Catholic and prolific letter writer, is expected to pray and keep penning words of comfort and farewell. Nguyen has told his friends he is determined to answer as many of his supporters' letters as possible.<br><br>Prison chaplain Gregoire Van Giang, who will accompany Nguyen to the gallows, will spend time with him. Prison officials will prepare a special evening meal for him.<br><br>"They find out details of the person's tastes," said M. Ravi, a human rights lawyer who has defended other men on death row. "They will find out if you like extra garam masala in your curry, that sort of detail."<br><br>Outside the prison tonight, Nguyen's family, friends and supporters are expected to attend vigils in his honour.<br><br>Madam Lechumi, the mother of Nguyen's late death-row neighbour Shanmugam Murugesu, will say prayers for her son and Nguyen at midnight. Shanmugam, in his last days, asked that though he was sure to die, his family do everything they could to stop Nguyen's execution.<br><br>At 2am, a prisons car will collect the hangman from his home. At 4am, a prison guard will knock on Nguyen's door to rouse him if he is sleeping.<br><br>"They will offer him breakfast but whether he can eat is another question," Mr Ravi said.<br><br>He will bathe a final time before he is handcuffed and takes the short walk from his cell to the gallows inside the prison.<br><br>After the execution, an autopsy will be performed to establish the cause of death. Mrs Nguyen must collect her son's body by 1pm or the Singaporean authorities will cremate him.<br><br>The Australian high commission is expected to arrange the return of his body to Melbourne.<br><br>At lunchtime, the family plan to attend a church service to commemorate Nguyen's life. They will fly out of Singapore, probably tomorrow evening. They will have no reason to stay.<br></div>
