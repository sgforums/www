Is it really so hard to understand that when you're in someone else's place, you jolly well follow their rules? Which part of that statement do you not understand? So if someone comes to your house and craps on your bed, you're not going to make a fuss of it?

Rather, it was Nguyen himself who started all this controversy, not us. He fully knew what he was doing was illegal and he knew about the possible consequences if he got caught. He was the one in control of his own life, and he chose to take the really stupid path.<br><br>Enough said, I'm wasting my breath on you. I want to continue addressing you, but I've got better things to do.
