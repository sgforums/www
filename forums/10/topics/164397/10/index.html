In 1992, the Special Rapporteur for the UN on Summary, Extrajudicial and Arbritrary punishments delivered a crushing criticism on that in her report to the General Assembly, to which our arrogant govt refuted by charging her with  demeaning the credibility of her office. Apart from this incident, Agencies like Amnesty International and the USA State Department have also continually criticised the mandatory Death Penalty, although regretfully the USA didn't make that a subject of discussion when Prresident Reagan visited us in the 1980s.<br><br>As for Ngyuen, I believe you and your pals are sensationalizing the strapping of drugs to his body. Btw, do you think it is possible at all to flush drugs down an <span style="font-style: italic;">airplane</span> toilet?<br><br>the (disbelieving) pikamaster</div></blockquote>why not? It was stated in the news that the drugs were found strapped to his body.. not me.<br><br>too much liberalism is not good for a country, look at america, with so much civil liberties... and look at the chaos that the country is in. In Singapore, we have a very small country with a high population density, if we allowed the same civil liberties as in US or australia, imagine our country today? Singaporeans have it good, but they do not know how good. Try living in the states or in australia for a while and you will begin to appreciate all the things that Singaporeans take for granted.<br><br>Open your eyes pikamaster, there things that are permissible, but they may not be beneficial. The situation in Singapore needs very careful handling. The government has charted a good path to date.</div>

I had worked and lived in China and Australia before, I really appericate Singapore much more after my overseas stints. Some compliants that there is no freedom, Singapore is too small but at least we are still progressing and our streets are safe.<br><br>Regarding political freedoom, I do not think US or Australia system can anyway work for us as we are too small a country to have multi parties system. Our advantage is that we a majority one party to steer the country in a new direction in the shortest possible timeline.<br><br>Now imagine, we have a 2 parties system and facing a crisis and need to pass certain emergency directive. The parties may fight for political gain and delay the motions. This is what had happened in a lot of "democratic" countries,<br>Germany for instance need to wait for months to form a new government and their current unemployment rate stand at 11%.<br><br>I am not saying that Singapore have a perfect system, I do not totally agree with all the government actions, espcially in transports issue but generally they did a good job.<br><br>Different countries need different mode of governance.<br><br>Multi-parties may work for large country with many states, for brainstorming and chartering and can with stand the impact better (economic of scale). The failure can be narrowed down to a particular state (Pauline Hasen, Queensland) and not a total setback for the country. This is not the case for Singapore, We only have one state and one city, any failure is a failure for the nation and the impact will be huge.</div>
