            <div class='col-md body'>Turn our backs on the island of death<br>22 November 2005<br><br>SINGAPORE is a serial killer. In recent years, hundreds of its<br>citizens and quite a few foreigners have been executed. When it comes<br>to state murder, on a per capita basis, the sterile, claustrophobic<br>Singapore exceeds the dubious records of China, Russia and governor<br>George W. Bush's Texas.<br><br>Recently China has started to rein in regional magistrates, bringing<br>the decision-making on the death penalty back to Beijing. Those<br>accounts of instant executions - of prisoners being dragged from the<br>dock to be shot behind the ear and their families being charged for<br>the bullets - have become too embarrassing.<br><br>The US is also losing enthusiasm for the death penalty. Too many<br>cases have displayed the gross inequities of the system. Too often<br>DNA evidence has belatedly proven the verdicts unsafe. How many<br>victims have been proven innocent after the switch has been thrown,<br>the pellets dropped, the needles shoved in the veins?<br><br>But despite the sales pitch that it's the Switzerland of Asia,<br>Singapore keeps its hangman very busy. The incumbent holds the world<br>record for executions; he is proud to have killed more than 500 of<br>his fellow human beings. His portrait on the front page of this<br>newspaper last month (see inset) was unforgettable: so gross, so<br>boastful, so cheerful of grin and philosophy. "I send them to a<br>better place."<br><br>He may be right about that. For all its glitz, Singapore is a harsh,<br>authoritarian society. Yet of all our near neighbours, Singapore is<br>the least criticised. Malaysia is recalcitrant, Indonesia corrupt.<br>But we like Harry Lee's airline, the airport, the duty-free shopping.<br>(Better than Dubai, say the frequent fliers.) Few Australians look<br>behind the glamour of Singapore's airport at the grim realities of<br>neighbouring Changi prison, to the fact that sophisticated,<br>squeaky-clean Singapore is a parody of democracy. As in Mahathir<br>Mohamad's Malaysia, it takes bravery to express dissent, while formal<br>political opposition can lead to prison.<br><br>To a very crowded prison, for Singapore has among the highest levels<br>of incarceration on earth. Yet my last column on this city-state,<br>with its overworked hangman, provoked a flurry of letters to the<br>editor defending the place, saying we must respect Singapore's system<br>of laws.<br><br>No thanks, and to hell with Harry Lee's line on Asian values.<br><br>Singapore's death penalty is overwhelmingly applied to drug couriers<br>and is clearly a total failure, as it is wherever the penalty is used<br>as a strategy in that lost cause called the war on drugs. Nothing<br>stops the trafficking. Singapore could hang thousands - it probably<br>will in due course - and there will be just as many poor fools ready<br>to risk their lives for big money or a pittance. Despite all the<br>publicity about Indonesia's firing squads, you can still recruit<br>Australian teenagers for $500 and a free holiday.<br><br>In this form of capitalism, capital punishment doesn't count. Thanks<br>to free market forces, it just ups the ante and the price.<br><br>But let's be fair; Singapore is rethinking the death penalty. It's<br>going to abandon the noose and trapdoor, replacing them with the<br>needle and gurney. That's progress.<br><br>For just as it matters little how many drug couriers you kill, it<br>hardly matters how much heroin you intercept. Seize 100 tonnes<br>instead of 100g and there'd be little more than a hiccup in the<br>distribution system. The street price would rise and the warlords<br>we've returned to power in Afghanistan would simply increase the<br>poppy crop to protect their 80per cent world market share. Drug<br>seizures are like dipping buckets in the ocean.<br><br>Australian Federal Police chief Mick Keelty's appalling contribution<br>to the death penalty debate has been to talk of thousands of young<br>Australians who'd have died had the Bali nine smuggled all that<br>heroin into Australia. This is specious. Keelty should admit that,<br>were heroin legally available to addicts, there'd be a hope of<br>controlling quantity and quality. That would save lives. And if he<br>were really worried about young Australians dying of drugs, we'd hear<br>him attack what's responsible for more than 90per cent of<br>drug-related deaths: grog and tobacco. Far more Australian lives are<br>destroyed by petrol sniffing than heroin.<br><br>I despise drugs and, jazz notwithstanding, have little enthusiasm for<br>the drug culture so enthusiastically marketed by everyone from those<br>nice Beatles to the thugs of hip-hop. (Half the pop songs in the past<br>30 years have been advertising jingles for the drug de jour, from LSD<br>to crack cocaine.) But equally I despise the hypocrisy of this war on<br>drugs. Add the moral horror of the death penalty or the monstrous<br>nonsense of an Australian girl arrested in Denpasar for possessing<br>two ecstasy tablets and we're living in a world gone mad.<br><br>Not so along ago, the French saved one of their citizens from the<br>noose - that other version of the Singapore sling - by threatening to<br>break off diplomatic relations. Yet Canberra doesn't dare to<br>criticise Singapore. It's too important to our economy. Singapore's a<br>big shareholder in companies such as Optus. And the PM wants our<br>airlines to merge. And we love the shopping.<br><br>(The Australian)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What a silly load of bollocks.<br><br>There are only two points in that article that pertain to the issue at hand - the rest is just fluff.<br><br>The first pertinent point is the problem with the death penalty being is irreversibility in the case of a misjudgement.  Unfortunately, the guy's right there - let's face it, if evidence turns up later that the defendant was innocent, we jolly well can't say, "Sorry old boy, we'll bring you back to life now", can we?<br><br>On the other hand, the seconds pertinent point is utter tripe.  So the death penalty hasn't been proven to stop the drug trade altogether.  Then again, nothing has been proven to be 100% effective either.  What shall we do then, sit down, wring our hands and say, "Oh dear" and then do nothing about it?<br><br>Some people simply don't understand that it's ridiculously easy to stand against something.

Don't bother fighting the drug menace, cos it's useless.<br><br>What nonsense. I didn't know that surrendering to the devil is such a good thing.<br><br><blockquote> saying we must respect Singapore's system<br>of laws.<br><br>No thanks, and to hell with Harry Lee's line on Asian values.</blockquote>In Rome, do as the Romans do. If you come to our place, you will respect our laws. If we go to your place, we'll respect your laws. Fair and square. Just what is it about you that makes you above our laws? An Aussie passport still makes you as much human as any one of us, yah?<br><br><blockquote>Singapore's death penalty is overwhelmingly applied to drug couriers<br>and is clearly a total failure, as it is wherever the penalty is used<br>as a strategy in that lost cause called the war on drugs. Nothing<br>stops the trafficking. Singapore could hang thousands - it probably<br>will in due course - and there will be just as many poor fools ready<br>to risk their lives for big money or a pittance.</blockquote>Our laws are harsh, no doubt about it. However, if we have deterred just one person from being stupid enough to bring drugs to our shores, then I'd say the law has worked. No doubt there will always be fools who will still try to risk it. So we make an example of these fools to convince other intelligent people to do the right thing and stay away from drugs.<br><br><blockquote>Keelty should admit that, were heroin legally available to addicts, there'd be a hope of controlling quantity and quality. </blockquote>Drug addicts will do anything just to get their fix, turning to theft, robbery, and even murder just to get it. If you were to control the quantity of drugs and deny them their drugs once they've had their fill, they'd simply turn to the black market to get it. In other words, controlling the quantity won't eliminate the black market for drugs - it'll flourish instead.<br><br>And what does he mean by 'quality'? Refine the drugs to highly pure and refined form? The more drugs the addicts take, the more addicted they simply become. It's a vicious cycle - they need more and more drugs as their bodies become numb to its effects. You increase the quality, and the addicts will slip deeper and deeper into addiction.<br><br>Besides, the very fact that he said there'd be a 'hope' shows an underlying pessimism in his own stand. What if they fail? Then they would have loads of new addicts and a thriving black market. Good luck to them.<br><br><blockquote>Add the moral horror of the death penalty or the monstrous<br>nonsense of an Australian girl arrested in Denpasar for possessing<br>two ecstasy tablets and we're living in a world gone mad.</blockquote>No, man, I'd say the world has gone mad when we start lobbying for harmful drugs to be legalised and say that conviction for possession of illicit drugs is considered 'monstrous nonsense'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Now they are saying Singapore is hyprocite!!</strong><br><br>Singapore 'hypocritical' over drugs<br>Email Print Normal font Large font By Connie Levett and Rachel Kleinman<br>November 23, 2005 - 10:14AM<br>Page 1 of 2<br>Advertisement<br>AdvertisementCriticism of Singapore's trade with Burma, a major global supplier of heroin, is mounting as the execution of Australian convicted Australian drug smuggler Nguyen Tuong Van draws nigh.<br><br>Human rights campaigner and former Federal Court judge Marcus Einfeld this morning accused the island nation of hypocrisy because of its substantial trade with Burma.<br><br>Burma, led by a military junta, was one of the world's worst regimes and one of the largest heroin traders, Justice Einfeld said. Attacks on the economic links also came from the Singapore Opposition and academics.<br><br>Singapore should not remain one of Burma's major trading partners while it was proceeding with plans to execute Nguyen for drug smuggling, Justice Einfeld said.<br><br>"It is quite hypocritical of the Singaporeans, on the one hand, to sustain this regime which won't let (Burmese democracy leader) Aung San Suu Kyi out of house arrest after years and years," he told Channel Nine.<br><br>"It's one thing to keep that regime going, as Singapore helps to do, but (not to) then pick up a young man for a serious offence and then want to execute him."<br><br>Opposition speaks out<br><br>Singapore's opposition Democratic Party leader Chee Soon Juan said Singapore needed to focus on the Burmese drug lords rather than drug "mules" if it was serious about keeping Singapore clean of drugs.<br><br>"This Government keeps going on about having to take a tough stance on drugs and what a scourge illicit drugs are in our society. Fine, but go and get it at its source," Dr Chee said.<br><br>"What's the point of getting the mules? You know these drug lords are just going to find new people to get the drugs."<br><br>Justice Einfeld said the international community could bring pressure on Singapore, particularly countries represented at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Malta.<br><br>Dr Chee said Singapore's continuing policy of investing more than $US1 billion ($A1.35 billion) in government funds in Burma despite the regime's complicity in the opium trade was hypocritical.<br><br>"The Singapore Government has access to the Burmese military, it needs to ask them hard questions: what are you doing on the drug lords?" said Dr Chee, who opposes the death penalty.<br><br>Heavy investment<br><br>Bertil Linter, who has written extensively on Burma's drug trade, said Singapore was the first country to invest heavily in Burma when the regime reopened its borders to foreign investment in the 1990s.<br><br>"The main issue was the Traders Hotel, which was built by Asia World, a construction company owned by the Lo family Lo Hsien Han and his son Steven Law, in conjunction with Singapore interests," Mr Linter said. Lo Hsien Han is widely recognised as one of the most powerful drug lords in Burma and was a frequent visitor to Singapore until recently. His son Steven Law, who has been barred from entering the US on suspicion of involvement in drug trafficking, has an office in Singapore.<br><br>The Singapore Government's joint venture with the drug lord came through the Myanmar Fund, set up to channel investment into Burma, which has since been shut down. Singapore's involvement was through its billion-dollar Government Investment Corporation.<br><br>Professor Desmond Ball, of the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, said many Burmese drugs lords used Singapore for banking.<br><br>"Some of Burma's closest economic relations are with Singapore," Professor Ball said "A lot of electronic transaction services in Burma are run through Singapore."<br><br>Singapore Technologies, a quasi-government agency, also supplied a wide range of services to Burma's ruling junta. "Internet monitoring, telephone monitoring is done with Singaporean equipment and assistance and the cyber warfare office in Rangoon is built and maintained by Singaporeans," he said.<br><br>Professor Garry Rodan, from Murdoch University's Asia Research Centre, said the relationship appeared to be one purely of economic gain. "Over the years (the drug issue) has not bothered Singaporean investors a great deal," he said.<br><br>- with AAP<br><br></div>

His son Steven Law, who has been barred from entering the US on suspicion of involvement in drug trafficking, has an office in Singapore.<br><br>The Singapore Government's joint venture with the drug lord came through the Myanmar Fund, set up to channel investment into Burma, which has since been shut down.

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting article:<br><br>By Connie Levett, Singapore<br>November 23, 2005<br>Page 1 of 2<br>YOU can learn a lot about Singapore from the toilets at Changi International Airport. Spotlessly clean, the cubicles are half a metre longer than a standard stall, giving passengers ample room to bring their luggage without having to perform gymnastics to close the door.<br><br>The toilets are self flushing and the basin taps turn on automatically. As with many things in this proud, productive little nation, it's well thought out Â— you don't have to think.<br><br>The self-flushing toilet also masks another side of Singapore, the punitive side. Locals call Singapore a fine city, there is a fine for everything Â— even failing to flush the toilet attracts a $S150 ($A120) fine for a first offence, rising to $S1000 for a third offence.<br><br>Doubtless the design of the toilets was lost on Nguyen Tuong Van as he marked time at Changi airport on December 12, 2002. He waited 4Â½ unsettling hours in transit for his connecting flight, Qantas QF10 to Melbourne. Passing through security at boarding gate 22 he set off an alarm and a search revealed a packet of heroin strapped to his back and another in his backpack.<br><br>Since then, he has had almost three years to focus on Singapore's contradictory nature. Next Friday, barring an unprecedented backdown by the Singapore Government, the 25-year-old will be hanged at Changi prison.<br><br>Despite the groundswell of opposition to the hanging in Australia, his case has generated barely a ripple in Singapore. Ask a local whether the Government should hang the Australian and they say: "If they don't hang him, people will say it's not fair. How many people did he kill? Two?"<br><br><strong>Actually, that's Michael McCrea, the Briton extradited from Australia in September. He won't face the mandatory death penalty for the murder of two people in Singapore because the Australian Government would not hand him over until the death penalty was waived. There will be no such clemency for Nguyen. There is no tolerance, in Government or a well-schooled public, for drug crimes. The Government has convinced its citizens that going soft on drugs will bring down this wealthy little society.</strong><br><br>The state-controlled media have largely ignored Nguyen's fate, only highlighting the case when the Singapore Government speaks out to defend its own position. The church in Singapore is also absent from the debate because of unspoken markers that keep religious groups from commenting on Government policy. In Singapore, the Government works hard to ensure the death penalty is never humanised.<br></div>

No, I'm not talking about the records industry which probably got a boost from Singapore Idol, but about the other segments of arts, such as novels and drama. Local dramatists hardly earn anything. Novelists cannot be full-time like Rowling or Tolkien. Singapore doesn't have a reading culture. Look at how stressful and competitive our education system is. I wonder if that's not one of the reasons our youth consume drugs in the first place. C'mon, there are youth suicides too, although certainly not as many as Japan  or China. But then, do we wish to aim to be like those two? Like theirs, our economic success has come at a high socio-cultural price.<br><br>Always remember to read the fine print.<br><br>3) We achieved what they achieved economically, but politically and socially, we are far behind any of them, e.g. Scandinavia.<br><br>4) Listen to what I say carefully: The government has done a good job, but it is not doing a good job. The education system is relevant to this discussion because its lack of change-in-the-core is one of the starling examples of conservatism in policy-making. The changes that have been made to it so far either enhance the stress level of students or merely provide salad dressing e.g. The merging of EM1 and EM2, the introduction of IB in ACSI (wonder why it hasn't spread to other schools yet).  After 1990, the govt seems to be resting on its laurels.<br><br>5) Famous tactic #1: Evasion. The issue we are discussing is whether we should end this stringent policy by ourselves or not, not whether we should allow a foreign country to force us to change this policy. To Australia's credit, apart from polite letters to our Foreign Office, she hasn't imposed sanctions or even striked against us. So, she has not used any measure of force as yet. Hence, now, it can still be considered a voluntary choice and not "caving in to western demands" if we were to grant Ngyuen clemency. IMHO, I'm not sure which world you live on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Ngyuen might have alrready provided alot of information, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have more to share (if he weren't being executed that is).<br><br>6) This is not pride, this is arrogance. make no mistake. *sigh*<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>the (sad) pikamaster<br><br>P.S.: btw, you guys can gloat now, since Ngyuen is being hanged anyway. heck! what a bunch of sadists!</div>

But when it comes to alcohol, almost 60 per cent were given their first drink by a relative.<br><br>The findings are part of an Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report released yesterday. Overall, 7.6 per cent of 12 to 15-year-olds said they had used an illicit drug. But more than 95 per cent in that age group had never smoked and almost two-thirds had never had a full alcoholic drink.<br><br>The author of the report, David Batts, said older teenagers engaged in more drug-taking than those aged 12 to 15. More than 20 per cent of 16 and 17-year-olds and more than 30 per cent of 18 and 19-year-olds had taken illicit drugs in the preceding 12 months.<br><br>"When you compare the 12 to 15-year-olds to the 16 and 17-year-olds the comparison is most interesting, because 16 and 17-year-olds are smoking, drinking and trying illicit drugs to a much greater extent than the 12 to 15-year-olds," he said.<br><br>Turning Point Drug and Alcohol Centre director Nick Crofts said the figures were "a great worry" but had been for some time. "Some people will start using drugs at a very young age, but they're people who have all the predictable risk factors Â… that decrease the ability of children to resist drugs," he said.<br><br>"It's not about the drug, it's about the social circumstances in which kids find themselves because normal life is not fulfilling their needs."<br><br>Professor Crofts said the underlying social causes needed to be looked at, rather than just drug use. Better social services needed to be provided, schools needed to be better resourced to help teenagers and there needed to be more support for children who came from broken families, "rather than allowing them to slide into the scrap heap".<br></div>

Like theirs, our economic success has come at a high socio-cultural price.<br><br>Always remember to read the fine print.<br><br>3) We achieved what they achieved economically, but politically and socially, we are far behind any of them, e.g. Scandinavia.<br><br>4) Listen to what I say carefully: The government has done a good job, but it is not doing a good job. The education system is relevant to this discussion because its lack of change-in-the-core is one of the starling examples of conservatism in policy-making. The changes that have been made to it so far either enhance the stress level of students or merely provide salad dressing e.g. The merging of EM1 and EM2, the introduction of IB in ACSI (wonder why it hasn't spread to other schools yet).  After 1990, the govt seems to be resting on its laurels.<br><br>5) Famous tactic #1: Evasion. The issue we are discussing is whether we should end this stringent policy by ourselves or not, not whether we should allow a foreign country to force us to change this policy. To Australia's credit, apart from polite letters to our Foreign Office, she hasn't imposed sanctions or even striked against us. So, she has not used any measure of force as yet. Hence, now, it can still be considered a voluntary choice and not "caving in to western demands" if we were to grant Ngyuen clemency. IMHO, I'm not sure which world you live on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Ngyuen might have alrready provided alot of information, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have more to share (if he weren't being executed that is).<br><br>6) This is not pride, this is arrogance. make no mistake. *sigh*<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>the (sad) pikamaster<br><br>P.S.: btw, you guys can gloat now, since Ngyuen is being hanged anyway. heck! what a bunch of sadists!</div></blockquote>1) Hmmm  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>2) Singapore does not have a reading culture, but neither does the UK, australia or many of the so called western cultures for that matter. Blame TV,, PS, Xbox etc not drugs... if any of our novelists produce good work, I am sure that they could do it full time. Anything is possible if you set your mind on it. Maybe our so called budding novelists did not try hard enough? For every one of the JK Rowlings out there, do you know how many others did not make it or are still trying to make it? With the Singapore system, you may be in the system, but you can always choose to do things differently within the system, it is not that we don't get the opporutnity, but we don't or dare not take the opportunity. You cannot blame the government for all of your problems, life is what YOU MAKE OF IT. If you fail, you only have yourself to blame...<br><br>3) Why do you value the supposed social and cultural progress of the western nations so highly? The are actually regressing rather than progressing, with all the social problems that they have in their countries, drugs, prostitution, the dole.. etc. So far you can only list Scandinavia... but have you lived there? Anything can be written in a report, and fiscal facts and figures can always be fudged. You never know. What makes another place better than Singapore? As the saying goes, the grass is always greener on the other side.<br><br>If anything, the government has let us down by not remembering well our roots and our own unique culture that makes us who we are.<br><br>And remember the fine print can be read both ways...<br><br>4) Whether the government is doing a good or bad job is also a very subjective one. I think that they are doing the best they can, as with every world government. It is easy for us who do not run the country to just sit back and criticise. Try running a corporation, same sort of pressures on a smaller scale. Unless you are doing that now or have done that, I don't think that you have a clue.<br><br>But just look at the "mighty" usa, when hurricane Katrina hit, they reacted to it like a thrid world country, so much for western supremacy...<br><br>5) The issue is whether we should end this stingent policy ourselves, correct, but I guess that the government has decided that they don't want to. You miss the point still, even if we gave in now, and even though it was a voluntary choice on our part, it wouldn't look like that to the rest of the world.<br><br>If you are so at odds with Singapore, then if are living there, then may I suggest you migrate to Australia? Get real, which planet are you living on? It is tantamount to a Singaporean committing a crime in Australia and the Government of Singapore asking Australia to pardon him... same thing. Please don't bring in the but Australia does not have the death penalty thing... our laws were not created yesterday, they have been in place for so many years, many of our own citizens have died under this law as well, are you telling me that their lives are somehow worth less than Nguyen's?<br><br>6) It is not arrogance, it is called national security.</div>
