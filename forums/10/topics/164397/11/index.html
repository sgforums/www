Yes, of course we all know "how drugs have destroyed many families and so many lives". But, we should still be objective and ask: Did the drug traffickers actually attempt to FORCE the drugs down their potential consumers' throats? Apart from the nature of the good they are selling, any other tactic they use can't really be classified as anything other than hard selling tactics, which many MNCs use, or that your average hawkers use.<br><br>I thought of a very good analogy to show the hypocrisy of convicting drug traffickers: The Slim 10 Saga. The drug traffickers are in the same position as the friend of D' Cruz or the retailer which sold Slim 10 to him. Given the great damage Slim 10 did to its consumers' bodies, shouldn't its manufacturer have received the Death Penalty. The side effects of Slim 10 after all, happen to be identical to the effects of ecstasy or heroin. Yet, I think the company just got off with a hefty fine.<br><br>We should always remove the plank in our eye before removing the splinter in others'.<br><br>The (dissappointed) pikamaster</div>

(your line under the convenient cloak of "too much liberalism will kill a country") Why not look at other most liberal countries like Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland (to include a multiethnic country)?

You break them, you pay. Yes clemency can be given, but it is an option olny and not one that has to be followed. If you overturn this particular decision, then from the worlds view point we have "caved in" to the westerners... if we decided to grant clemency without foreign intervention, that would be another matter altogether.
