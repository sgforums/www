You have been brainwashed that heroin trafficking in the worst crime in the world. It is not something that is good but by far from the most evil crime. A courier is not a pusher and in this case had no intent to pollute Singaporean soil.  The most evil crime is a country that commits state sponsored murder which singagpore does. Discards it's scum. No better than Saddam, no better than Hitler. If you do not follow international law this is how your country will be branded. Your choice.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Heroin trafficking may be bad, but allowing dirty money into the country is no better. Singapore should get tough on money laundering on her soil by drug barons from all over the world.</span><br><br>5th...The hangman. You look like cowards here. You say it is your right to enforce this penalty yet they cannot find a Singaporean to actually do it. They bring in a contract killer from malaysia to kill an Australian.

How come you never hear a single aussie who comment, if you look in your aussie newspaper there are tons of comments.  We never racism it is just comment on the ideas put forward which are ridicluous and not appreciated, and who call us barbaric??<br><br>2nd) You are such an ignorant person, if singapore law is a joke, aussie's law will be even be a bigger joke, from ancient days to pauline hanson and till now.  Every country will have a joke whether it printed on the t-shirt or other material, so please dun act innocent on this issue.<br><br>3rd)  Who is fair and who is not, it is the people living in the country decides, it is not you to decide our law.<br><br>4th) Are you the druglord who make such a statement, so hilarious, thinking that pusher is has no guilt.  It is people like you that creates chaos in this world, condoning all the wrongs.<br><br>5th)  who does not engage people from outside their domain, why you need to make such a comment when obviously a hangman from anywhere as long he is paid he do the job.  I do not see any problem in that.<br></div>

All I can say is that you are being coup up in your world downunder.

There is no allowance in the system to even consider this may be the case. You hang if you have the drug on your possession. You are guilty until proven innocent. You have no legal representaion for up to 2 weeks. The whole problem with this system is that it is mandatory, it does not allow for excuse so if your neighbour on a plane plants the stuff in your bag then you will hang. End of story. No-one will ever know if there maybe a chance of your innocence because you have it you are guilty. So how can you have anything but a hypothetical?</div>
