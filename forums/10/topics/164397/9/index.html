            <div class='col-md body'>Activists in tightly controlled Singapore are planning a last-ditch vigil in support of Australian drug trafficker Nguyen Tuong Van, who is set to be hanged on December 2.<br><br>The protest - which would be the second this month - will likely be held this weekend, Sinapan Samydorai, spokesman for rights group Think Centre, said today.<br><br>Details have yet to be finalised, but the gathering will almost certainly be held indoors as open-air gatherings require a police permit.<br><br>"The form of expression in Singapore is limited because I don't think we can protest in public, you need a licence, and that would not be given," Sinapan said.<br><br>Nguyen, 25, was arrested at Changi Airport in December 2002 with almost 400 grams of heroin in his hand luggage and taped to his body.<br><br>After being convicted and losing his appeal, Singapore has rejected all appeals for clemency from his family, the Australian government and the Catholic Church.<br><br>Nguyen's mother Kim and his twin brother Khoa arrived in Singapore overnight for a final series of visits before the death-row inmate in hanged.<br><br>It was not clear exactly when they would see the condemned man.<br><br>The government "we are dealing with do not want him to have a second chance," Sinapan said. "The punishment is disproportionate."<br><br>Singapore law imposes the mandatory death sentence for drug trafficking, murder, kidnapping and a range of firearms offences.<br><br>In consistently rejecting appeals for clemency, the Singapore government has said that hanging traffickers helps to keep the country safe.<br><br>Amnesty International has said Singapore probably executes more people relative to its size that any other country worldwide.<br><br>Sinapan's Think Centre is one of very few civil society groups in Singapore.<br><br>It regularly calls for the government to allow greater freedom of expression and assembly. It also campaigns against the death penalty.<br><br>The death penalty, like torture and slavery in the past, should be rejected by all and has no place in a civilised society, the group has said.<br><br>Sinapan and other local activists held a first vigil for Nguyen November 7 at a downtown hotel.<br><br>The event was attended by about 100 people, a rare show of protest against government policy here.<br><br>The next planned gathering will be "in solidarity with him and his family", Sinapan said.<br><br>"It'll most probably be an indoor vigil or prayer. We are going to call something like that," he said.<br><br><strong>PROTEST???</strong></div>
