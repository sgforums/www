There was a reason too to why Hitler passed the Enabling Act in the 1930s. Does that make all reasons correct by default? And what is the real reason anyway? Are politicians hiding the real reason from us?<br><br>2) We are lucky that we have our neighbours kindly (no embargoes/ wars yet)  ponting out our msitakes; it is now up to us whether to accept we are worng or not, or be as stubborn and arrogant as you and Chennooi are.<br><br>3) If the review process is flawed, we should be ready to change it.<br><br>4) Such a reason is given by dictators like Saddam Hussein and the President of Sudan.

Ther are Game Rules to ensure that all players are protected from abuse and to ensure every player gets his / her due. Likewise, there is a Game Master - The ICJ - to settle disputes over the Game Rules so that no player gets taken advantage of by another.<br><br>If Australia had considered this to be a breach of International Law, it shouldn't have declined bringing it to the ICJ for them to decide.

It's like having a house and keep having neighbours coming to your house and tell you how they want your kids to be when the parents should have their own responsibilty. They can comment on the system but still, the definition lies within the citizens.<br><br>3) The review process itself is too long. That I think is the biggest flaw in jurisdication.<br><br>4) What is the point of having a house when your neighbours have the say on what you do?<br><br>5) The House have the last say when it comes to games. When you entered into another nation's territory, you are to respect their laws. This is the power of the House. Perhaps you lack intelligence on what House meant.<br><br>6) They can show their unhappiness with the law, the truth is, I'm not really concerned by their enthusiasm.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Also, in the argument for the abolishing of the death sentence based on this scenerio alone, would not carry much weightage in my humble opinion.<br><br>The presumption of law has always been this way whether by reduction the mandatory death sentence to life imprisonment or not. It is only the latter that when a person who has been later found to be wrongfully imprisoned, then justice can be rightly returned. In this case, there is a delayed in justice. One may argue that sometime evidences only surface out a few years later after the crime had been committed but this is more applicable to murder cases than any clear cut drug trafficking case that we are debating on.<br><br>Let me analyse your given scenerio from two sides of view, namely the defendant and the drugs ring.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Defendent</span><br>The following can be vital clues to prove the motive of whether the defendent did committed drugs trafficking.<br><br>1.

Particulars of defendent<br>(i) Social standing<br>(ii) Financial status<br>(iii) Family values<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drugs Ring</span><br>1. Is it wise to implant millions dollars worth of drugs on the surface of an unknown vehicle since the interior is out-of-bound.<br>2. Where should the drugs be planted at given the limited of storage space on the exterior of a car.<br>3. Should the planting take place in broadday light or night-time?<br>4. Are the drugs readily available anytime for the planting?<br>5. How to confirm whether the planted car is returning back home and not going elsewhere?<br>6. Who is suppose to mann the car after it had been planted?<br>7. How many cars for tailing are needed to be efficiently carried out?<br>8. What are the chances of getting busted?<br><br>Hence, is it wise for the drug rings to gamble with their drugs which are worth millions dollars as stake with so many unknown factors at hand.<br><br>The argument I have given is only based on legal principles and the psychological prospective of the drugs ring for your scenerio. It does not neccessarily support or denial the abolishing of death sentence where in my opinion, political and social impacts play a more crucial role.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
