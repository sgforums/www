For this instance, the one to be hanged has admitted his guilt and he get what he reserved.  Sorry that he is going to be hanged but no respect as he is deemed as a crimminal.

Easy to say now that you won't plead guilty, perhaps even right up till the day of the trial.  But when your ass is on the line, what will you choose at crunch time?
