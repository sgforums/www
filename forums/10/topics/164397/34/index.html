But have you ever wondered why the laws are made? "Silly" laws are made not to be ridiculed by foreigners, but to set as a warning to potential offenders who may create nuisance/chaos in our society. There are many things in Singapore that can be done, but there are not a lot of things that you cannot do, or should'nt have done. Only "problem-kids" like Michael Fay, who fully understood the severity of vandalism in Singapore and wanted to challenge our laws, got what he deserved.<br><br>Singapore don't hang drug addicts; Drug traffickers are hanged instead.<br><br>Anyway, is it a proud thing to be a drug trafficker/ drug addict? Furthermore, Australians are now in negative limelight bout drug trafficking (Mauritius, Indonesia, Vietnam) and they try to make a matyr out of him. Its a surprise that the Australian government and the press is willing to spend so much time and money and resources to save a convicted drug trafficker rather than educating and preventing the thousands of drug addicts in Down Under.<br><br></div>

At the end of the day Man is just an animal like the rest of the creatures that creep and crawl and is thus prisoner to the base instincts that drive all of them: survival, fear and the need for security. The Caveman mentality is still alive in all people today, not just Singaporeans.

Since when has it been any other way?<br><br>The Australians whom you hold in such high esteem are not immune either, no matter how holy they profess to be. Witness the lack of hue and cry over the sentencing of the Bali bombers and their active participation in the War on Terror. They are doing exactly as you accuse Singapore of doing, killing or condoning killing to make themselves feel safer.
