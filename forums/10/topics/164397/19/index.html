            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by pikamaster:</div><div class="quote_body">breytonhartge,<br><br>1) I'm talking about Singapore, not M'sia, China, Japan etcetc. Asia is not as homogeneous as Europe, possibly because there was never one moment in history where all of Asia was under one empire; Except for Russia, Most of Europe came under the Romans.<br><br>2) Actually, I'm finding this point strange, because Australia is not really asking us to change our laws; it wants us to make an exception in Ngyuen's case.<br><br>3) Culture is a transient object; it changes with the time. Roots tell us where we came from; they do not tell us where to go from here. If you wanted to look at roots the way you are looking at them, then you should say too that we should all be wearing ponytails; after all, that is in our roots too.<br><br>Dependence on Roots is a double-edged sword: they keep us firmly in the ground, but they also prevent us from moving forward.<br><br>The Westerners are irrelevant for this point. We are talking about our country singly, not in relation to other nations.<br><br>4) I think Ngyuen should pay a penalty, only that the penalty should not be death. Jail would be acceptable, term decided by a free judge. Perhaps community service (which does not seem to exist in Singapore) may be a better option. After all, his intention was to gain money to help his family, not to cause anybody's death. Notice he was unarmed when he entered Changi Airport.<br><br>The Election Results of the PAP are another issue altogether. I would say that given the phenomenal number of walkovers and citizens in walkover constituencies since the Anson by-election in the 1970s, the true level of support the people have for the government is pretty dubious. I mean, you can't assume all of them support the govt.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> Oh, and I guess this gives the reason why Singaporeans don't "give the opposition a chance to go": they have no chance to.<br><br>How many promises are fulfilled by the Opposition? Well, you can't really tell because they don't have the numbers to push any policy through period. How many promises are fulfilled by the PAP though? That is the question we all ought to ask. Especially, how many "fulfillments" are merely election carrots?<br><br>I did not deny the PAP's good track record. I merely pointed out that the good track record lasted from independence till 1990. Since then, there's not really been much of a track record.<br><br>Anyway, the terms "track record" and "good governance" are very vague. Depending on the measure used, the track record will be different:-<br><br>-&gt; On economics, it is stellar.<br><br>-&gt;  On education, it is stellar ... in terms of academic results; Not so stellar if you look at it from the point of the students' lives, including stress and all that. Not so stellar also if you look at the character of Singaporeans: Education hasn't removed snobbishness, lack of care for the environment, poor moral values etcetc. Education as a system is also far from stellar if we consider the depression, anxiety and disillusionment caused to students who don't fit the streaming system. Or how about the development of the arts scene?<br><br>-&gt; On Health, Stellar possibly, or then...<br><br>-&gt; On Defence, Stellar.<br><br>-&gt; On Community Development, questionable. Job discrimination, ethnic separation, still pretty common. Neighbourliness doesn't seem to be a developed trait. For the matter, the birthrate has not increased very much either. Although of course, how much monetary incentives will achieve is a question to ask in itself. And of course, drug consumption, partying etcetc, not to mention what ills the ICR will bring. Did you see "drug consumption"? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>-&gt; On Sports, if Singapore fans choose EPL over S-League, what does that show? And why were our olympic players Susilo and his gf both foreigners?<br><br>-&gt; On arts, well little really has to be said. Just consider how many people choose arts over science... FYI, I'm an arts student. Anyway, the Esplanade seems to host more foreign performances than local performances. I welcome the chance to be corrected on this point.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>-&gt; On Fundamental Liberties/ Adherence to Constitution/ Human Rights, not very good certainly. 140th in Press Freedom, (still had the cheek to argue), Caning and Mandatory Death Penalty, government-controlled Trade Unions, 3rd-world income structure, ISA, changes to Constitution on whim, political intimidation through defamation suits, GRC system, ban on student unions, banning religious groups like Jehovah's Witnesses and Falun Gong and proclaiming respect of Freedom of Religion.<br><br>5) Some people would think of UK or Switzerland, I think. Anw, in this issue, people are thinking of Australia. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>6) Read my previous posts in this thread again. Since 1970s in fact.<br><br>7) And Australia wants it any more than we do? Perhaps you should realize: we are here arguing on whether we should apply the mandatory death penalty to the crime of drug trafficking. We are not here to debate on whether we should legalize drugs/ or even let Ngyuen go scot-free. None of us wants drugs in the country. Not you, not me, not Laser Lordz, not the PAP, not the Aussie govt, not the UN, not the Archbishop of Sydney who interceded the Pope to pressure the PAP, not Amnesty International even. Every single party mentioned here condemns the drug trade. To AI, it is as pressing a problem as abuse of women. For the UN, eliminating drug trade is in its top ten priorities. The Archbishop of Sydney believes that Ngyuen should be punnished, but with grace that's all. The Aussie feds are enthusiastic in eradicating the druglords, which is why they turned to Ngyuen for assistance. Ngyuen's family want fairness in his case. The Aussies are merely against the Death Penalty.<br><br>ya well,<br>nitez<br>the pikamaster</div></blockquote>Pikamaster,<br>I take the liberty to say something on your points:<br><br>1) How can you compare Asia and Europe where it is of different in size and culture?  In fact none of europe countries are homogenous, neither can you say that under Romans they are homogenous, the europe history is as messy full of corruptions, deception and slavery.<br><br>2) We cannot be lienent at this point because we need to answer to our people.<br><br>3) How can you trace back to wear ponytails, chinese history is long, chinese do not started off with ponytails, please get the chinese history right.<br><br>4) You cannot help your family at the expense of other people's life.  Other people also got mother who borned them, so conscience is important, if you never break the laws you will not be punished, simple as that.</div>

No doubt Mr Whitlam feels frustrated by the case, as we all do," he said.<br><br>Advice on challenge<br><br>Acting Prime Minister Mark Vaile says the Government expects to receive advice later today on a legal challenge to the execution, but was not hopeful of success.<br><br>One of the lawyers providing advice to the Government, Sydney University's Professor Don Rothwell, said today avenues were still open for taking the case to the ICJ.<br><br>Mr Vaile said Australia would not use trade sanctions to put pressure on the Singaporean Government, but was still discussing the possibility of an ICJ challenge.<br><br>"We are getting advice on that and we hopefully will have that back to us today," he told the Nine Network.<br><br>"But we don't believe that offers an option to pursue in this matter."<br><br>Prime Minister John Howard said yesterday the Singapore Government would go ahead with the execution and "I do not believe what is now being said is going to make any difference".<br><br>Mr Whitlam yesterday criticised Singapore as he called for Prime Minister John Howard to raise Nguyen's case at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta<br><br>Mr Howard has said he will not use CHOGM to pressure Singapore, but Mr Whitlam told The Age newspaper it was the right platform.<br><br>"If CHOGM is any use then it should be raised there, because it concerns many other countries, some larger, some smaller than the rogue Chinese port city," Mr Whitlam said.<br><br>He was "never surprised" at Singapore's neglect of human rights, he said.<br>Mr Hawke declined to reveal the contents of a letter he sent to Mr Lee, saying it was "a private communication".<br><br>In Singapore, The Straits Times described the looming execution has been "churning up a wash of angst from across the seas".<br><br>It recommended that "Australians should take an objective look at the crime, not only the punishment".<br><br>"The drugs trade is a destroyer of lives and society, vividly so in this region. Australians who have an imperfect understanding of this can only learn to educate themselves."<br><br>The editorial praised Howard's "polite" diplomacy, but it also recited the city-state Government's position that it is up to Singapore to choose its criminal justice system.<br><br>"As much as Singaporeans make no judgment on the value of jurisprudence which has served the Australian Commonwealth well, Australians show their breeding by learning to accept what the Singapore situation requires."<br><br>- AAP<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">pikamaster,<br><br>this post is not directed at me but I can't help but noticed some points worth "highlighting", to put it very mildly.<br><br>1. Bashing singapore, calling for boycott is between "demanding" and "threatening", it is not "asking". Fundamentally, law is fair only if it applies to all human being, making an exception for someone because of his nationality renders the law unfair, and such a demand is a clear illustration of arrogance.<br><br>2.  since when do overseas chinese trace our roots to those who wear pony tails? chinese wear pony tails is a century old ang moh impression of Chinese in China. you are obviously not a chinese. Culturally and ethnically, if you don't know where you are, you can't possible know where you are heading.<br><br>3. judges will always have to make judgement based on facts, laws, intentions, what is good for society, .......and all considerations, he should never be "free" to make judgement as he likes or based on his own opinion. Who is to say "jail would be acceptable"? of course, anybody can pass a judgement and call himself "free judge" for he will not be paid for his judgement, or is it because his judgement is worth nothing? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>4. How can being "unarmed when he entered the singapore airport" be an argument to prove his intention?<br><br>5. 1970s? I was born only in the mid 70s, haha, didn't know you are that old, no wonder never serve NS. If you have been repeating the same things since the 70s, its about time to accept some new ideas. I know, the older you get, the harder it is for you to forget about the past. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>have a good day.</div></blockquote>Sgdiehard,<br><br>you are getting a little irritating.<br><br>2) The boycott was asked by 1 Australian MP, not by the Victorian people as a whole.<br><br>3) Well, if we were to trace as far as possible, we would get to that point. That is after all part of the history of our culture. Or do you restrain our roots to the 20th century? But anyway, the point was to show how foolish using our roots to determine what we should be can be sometimes.<br><br>4) The judge has of course to be constrained by the facts of the case. "What is good for society" is somethign very subjective. Laws can also be very subjective; after all, they were made by people. Judges should only be constrained by the facts of a case, not by any unnecessary legislation. After all, if a law makes the punishment decision for the judge than what is the use of the judge? By a "free judge", I mean a judge who can decide the severity of the crime and hence, the level of punishment for that crime. Our CJ complained recently that he did not feel the Murgasu case (another drug-trafficking case) did not deserve the Death Penalty, but since the Penalty was mandatory, he had to regretfully pass the sentence. I advise you to research more on the duty of a judge before you make any more rash comments.<br><br>5) If he had arms, that shows that he placed his primary concern on getting the drugs through the country at any cost i.e. he was acting professionally, since the arms would be there to protect his possession of the drugs.<br><br>6) *sigh* have you been reading anything I posted to other people. I am a decade younder than you, brother! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>the pikamaster<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aussie's forum<br><br>Nguyen affair inspires hasty sidestepping<br>Email Print Normal font Large font November 25, 2005<br>Page 1 of 2<br><br>Who would want to be an Australian - especially an Australian in strife abroad? What with Messrs Howard, Ruddock and Downer in charge of the shop back home, prospects for any meaningful humanity are dim to non-existent.<br><br>In particular there's the mealy-mouthed response to Nguyen Tuong Van, who is on death row in Singapore. His plight has been met with elaborate displays of hand-wringing from the three Australian humanitarians, yet nowhere in the stream of well-worn official federal condolences has there been sustained outrage at the barbaric, disproportionate penalty being imposed on one of their fellow citizens.<br><br>Just listen to the Foreign Affairs Minister, Alexander Downer, on the ABC's Lateline on Wednesday night: "Lex Lasry [Nguyen's lawyer] has been going around and finding lawyers with different ideas and we've been putting them to our lawyers, one after the other, and I've sat at my own desk and scratched my head and tried to think up other different approaches. But you know, we are desperate. I mean, we're in a situation now where it seems to us there's nothing much more we can do."<br><br>Then there was the Prime Minister's interdiction on Tuesday: "The only people who can stop the execution are the Government of Singapore. There is nothing illegal in what they have done [sentenced Nguyen to death]."<br><br>It's pretty unhelpful when young Alex is at his desk scratching his head for fresh legal ideas and up the passageway the PM is saying it's all perfectly proper.<br><br>Downer's mantra is we don't want to do anything to "hold out false hope to people". John Howard's constant message is that he feels "desperately sorry" for the condemned man's mother.<br><br>Both have given little Nancy Reagan lectures about the evils of drugs and the cruel finger of fate that awaits smugglers of forbidden substances in Asian countries.<br><br>That's all very well, but utterly half-baked. What about a full-blooded statement along the lines that the Australian Government thinks the execution of one of its citizens is brutish and uncivilised, that it is intolerable and that Singapore would be regarded with the greatest displeasure by Australia if it should proceed. You look at the reams of government comment about this case and nowhere can a clear, unequivocal statement be found.<br><br>As far as an effort in the International Court of Justice is concerned, the Commonwealth has simply thrown up its hands. Even if it is found that the court ultimately cannot save Nguyen, you'd think a sincere government here would give it a determined try.<br><br>The Attorney-General, Philip Ruddock, has already arrived at a decision: "Singapore is not bound to submit to the ICJ in relation to determinations in this matter."<br><br>Howard also has pre-emptively declared the court has no jurisdiction. How can he be so certain in the face of strong countervailing legal opinions without even knocking on the door?<br><br>It has been a disgraceful piece of humbug from the Government but we should not be surprised. After all, it was only in August 2003 that Howard was calling for a "debate" in Australia on the death penalty. Of course, he did not personally support capital punishment "for pragmatic reasons" but he said a lot of people were in favour of it. A lot of those people are supporters of the Coalition, according to the most recent opinion poll on the topic.<br><br>All of that got a good ventilation when Amrozi was sentenced to death by Indonesia for his part in the first Bali bombings.<br><br>Feelings naturally were running high, with 56 per cent of those polled wanting the death penalty for terrorists in Australia. More broadly, Howard then floated a few thoughts about capital punishment: "I respect the fact that a lot of people are in favour of the death penalty, a lot of people who are close to me are in favour of the death penalty."<br><br>In an interview in August 2003 Howard said: "I know a lot of Australians who believe that the death penalty is appropriate and they are not barbaric, they're not insensitive, they're not vindictive, they're not vengeful. They're people who believe that if you take another's life deliberately then justice requires that your life be taken." But of course that's not vengeful, vindictive, etc.<br><br>The opinion poll at the time showed 40 per cent were "strongly" in favour of the death penalty, per se. Of those, 64 per cent were Coalition supporters.<br><br>It seems as though throughout the Nguyen case a fair amount of dog whistling has been going on.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a comment from an aussie:<br><br>Al Svirskis Mount Druitt<br><br>Nguyen Tuong Van was attempting to bring in almost 400 grams of heroin into Australia. According to our Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, that's 26,000 doses of heroin, 26,000 possible heroin addicts, 26,000 possible deaths from overdose, 26,000 possible grieving families - all due to the decision of one man. People say Singapore does not value life. We do.<br><br>Nguyen Tuong Van is not innocent. He knowingly participated in an act that could have resulted in 26,000 deaths.

            <div class='col-md body'><br>In insisting that Singapore is run by an authoritarian government, Australia has effectively discredited and discounted ALL the citizens of Singapore! Branding them as sheep and mindless (spineless?)!<br><br>I do not think that I am afraid of my own Government, I do not that that I live in fear! I do not voice anything in dissent of the Government is because i AGREE with most of the policies and initiatives that the Singapore Government has carried out. I really believe in the reason and logic behind each decision and I DO think them through myself before coming to an agreement or not!<br><br>I am insulted that the Australia constantly belittles me and my fellow citizens. It seems that it is inconceivable to them that others do not think like them. What Australia has been indulging recently in her attacks on Singapore smells suspiciously like racism, intolerance and discrimination.<br><br>Well, I would like to tell Australia that I agree with the verdict and the sentence given to Nguyen and I believe in the death penalty! Now, are you going to try to "convert" me? To try to "preach" and spread your own "gospel"?<br><br>But I have my rights! Singapore is a democratic and free country and I have my rights to my own thoughts and opinions, my own belief system. So, in this aspect, Australia has NO say in HOW I THINK! Australia has NO say in HOW I LIVE MY LIFE IN SINGAPORE!

That is after all part of the history of our culture. Or do you restrain our roots to the 20th century? But anyway, the point was to show how foolish using our roots to determine what we should be can be sometimes.<br><br>4) The judge has of course to be constrained by the facts of the case. "What is good for society" is somethign very subjective. Laws can also be very subjective; after all, they were made by people. Judges should only be constrained by the facts of a case, not by any unnecessary legislation. After all, if a law makes the punishment decision for the judge than what is the use of the judge? By a "free judge", I mean a judge who can decide the severity of the crime and hence, the level of punishment for that crime. Our CJ complained recently that he did not feel the Murgasu case (another drug-trafficking case) did not deserve the Death Penalty, but since the Penalty was mandatory, he had to regretfully pass the sentence. I advise you to research more on the duty of a judge before you make any more rash comments.<br><br>5) If he had arms, that shows that he placed his primary concern on getting the drugs through the country at any cost i.e. he was acting professionally, since the arms would be there to protect his possession of the drugs.<br><br>6) *sigh* have you been reading anything I posted to other people.

There are stuff older than confucianism and taoism, we can go on tracing backwards forever and ever.

There are stuff older than confucianism and taoism, we can go on tracing backwards forever and ever.

In fact none of europe countries are homogenous, neither can you say that under Romans they are homogenous, the europe history is as messy full of corruptions, deception and slavery.<br><br>2) We cannot be lienent at this point because we need to answer to our people.<br><br>3) How can you trace back to wear ponytails, chinese history is long, chinese do not started off with ponytails, please get the chinese history right.<br><br>4) You cannot help your family at the expense of other people's life.  Other people also got mother who borned them, so conscience is important, if you never break the laws you will not be punished, simple as that.</div></blockquote>Soloken,<br><br>1) No matter how heterogeneous Europe is, it is comparably more homogeneous than Asia. After all, the boundaries of Asia were determined by the Europeans: simply put, what did not have a majority white population, was not Africa, and was not the New World bame known as Asia.<br><br>2) That's 1 point tt makes me confused: The politicians who claim that they will not "bow down to public sentiment to do what is right" still believe in "answering to the people"? How more hypocritical could it possibly be?<br><br>3) Read my replies to Sgdiehard on this issue.<br><br>4) I am always puzzled with the phrase "at the expense of other people's lives".  Unlike the normal murder victim or abused wife/child/parent/maid, the "victims" of drug-trafficking only *seriously* have themselves to blame for their own habits. If they hadn't purchased the drug in the first place, they wouldn't have any harm done to themselves. It's like a fat person who sues Hershey's for producing chocolates. The difference between durg-addicts and pre-drug-addicts and their other victims, is that they *chose* the abusive agent. Kids, maids and wives who are abused don't ask for the beatings or burnings they receive from their employers or relatives, but there is an industry for drug-trafficking because most people who become addicts ASK to have the drug or ACCEPT it from a friend. It is never too late to quit a drug, unless of course you have been killed by it.<br><br>Anyway, I think that this tirade of a tough stance against drug-trafficking is merely a colossal excuse, as colossal as the legalizing of drugs. Colossal excuse for any government, not merely our own, just to show that I'm not biased against the government particularly. It is a colossal excuse to divert citizens' attention from the govt policies e.g. stressful, results-focused examination system, which are the toot determinants of DEMAND for the drugs.<br><br>Cheers,<br>the (unconvinced) pikamaster</div>

Chinese written history began about 3000 yrs ago when scripts on tortoise shell or animal bones were discovered. Now I know why chinese words are written the way they are.

Religion is part of culture, not The culture! bearing in mind, religions are universal, accepted by all races all over the world, religions do not change the culture or ethnicity of the believers.  The Bible was translated into hundreds of different languages, the Bible does not force the believers to speak latin or greek. Why are the ppl in spain called Spaniard, not Turks?? why do they continue to speak spanish not turkish?? this is because the spaniard were holding on to their roots, the spanish culture!! what is your point?  do you think by accepting christianity you can become italian, vatican, israelis or what??<br><br>It is the root from where you grow, but it is not just the biology,  it involves your own mentality, in choosing what you think is good for you, in discarding your roots passed down from yr parents, it involves your ability, if you can finally become what you want to be and finally it involves the environment, how others look at you and accept you.
