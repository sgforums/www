            <div class='col-md body'>Risking bileteral relationships and welfare ( economical boycotts?!! ) of the society because of A drug trafficker. Not very wise. A waste of time, money and jail space. Similarly, deporting him might just be a waste of time, money and fuel for transportation.<br><br>Furthermore, dragging the issue might result in the extension of the initial effects of the drug itself. Foolish behavior indeed, what are politicians thinking ? "Leadership for the sake of leadership" or "Leadership to guide the masses(mankind) to greater satisfaction and achievement" ?<br><br>In retrospect, if the issue does get to international court and frees the condemned person, what ensues ? Respect for the Australian counterparts -showing competence in saving the life of a drug trafficer-  that slowly and menancingly subsides to allow for the man to carry on making mistakes ? or a greater image to bolster their control over the country that is, as previous comments have shown, infused with unapprehended drug abusers ?<br><br>The influx of attention given to this man is a sign of the lack of aspiration towards human excellence. Correct me if i'm wrong but the great leaders of macrological perception on world/national issues seem nowhere to be found. Perhaps i am just not receptive to the greater issues at hand.<br><br>On the contrary, this man is young (older than I) and has hope of changing to contribute to society. The pharmeceutical faculty perhaps ? In any case, I believe whether or not this man faces capital punishment, it should be enforced by the jurisdiction within geographical confinements(Singapore). His crime happens to encompass rudiments of a distinctive national threat. Distinctive because drug trafficking  is the act of introducing and smuggling drugs into the country.<br><br>So Australia, dont kay poh la... not worth the trouble.. let us handle the fate of this guy -that threatens our national stability-  in the most brutal, cruel and uncomprimising way. and then 'gudday mate!'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another typical show of colonialism at work here. They still think we are living in the 1900s. Just think why they want it to go International Courts? (more white people??) I am utterly disgusted by the fact they are willing to do so much without even thinking of the grave crime the man has done. Howard should ask if he is willing to let free a man who is going to supply drugs to his children. Death penalty is a mandatory deterrence for these people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah really cb lah...<br><br>ceecookie: I'd so love to see the file which ISD has on you now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  It's really not like me to say this, but please stop blabbering utter crap. Use your brain to think what Singapore would be like now without the tough laws that have been implemented since our Independence. You'd probably be staying in some hut chasing kampung chickens all day, which of course, in my opinion, is a much better use of your time (than for you to spend it here).<br><br>ditzy: Love your comments. Sounds like rubbish, but painfully true!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Would be great if you could go into detail regarding the their telcos fiasco, and how Sg could benefit if Singtel were to pull out.<br><br>IMHO, if the biggies in Australia continue to push hard for this case to be brought to The Hague, which is most likely to happen, Nguyen might very well receive a postponement, subject to the result of the review by the ICJ. After which, Singapore will fight for their decision, without backing out on it. If this case is going to be continued to be well publicised, and done in a bad light for us, it might very well affect the Asian community living there. The average Aussie won't be able to/won't bother to differentiate one asian with another, and more likely than not, we'll see an increase in the racial problems.<br><br>If, however, in the very unusual and unlikely case that Singapore backs down, on the basis of having to maintain good foreign relations, the Singaporeans won't be happy about it. PAP will have their image as the no-nonsense ruler tarnished badly, and even more people will start speaking out against them. Of course, within very tight limits.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Let's see what the others think, state what you would do if you were the Singapore Government.<br><br>Cheers.</div>
