Many Australians support Sinagpore stand. But when you question them they seem to presume the law is as with ours. That is in any country with similar laws death sentance is the maximum penalty. It is a huge cultural difference here. they do even start to comprehend that anyone except hardened criminals would get the death sentance so they presume Nyugen is a real bad person but they put faith in a system that doesn't actually exist in Singapore. Even in Indonesia they had some choice and chose not to apply the maximum sentance in a recnt case regarding an Australian so they have much fairer laws even though they still do impose the death penalty.<br><br>So if he was on an aircraft and heard the warning he still may not have been aware of the nature of your death penalty laws because it is such a foreign concept to us. We presume the death penalty is how they apply it for example in the US. So discrimiante it does between a local and a foreigner.<br><br>Also wanted to ask. If a drug courier on a plane did hear the announcement on a flight and panicked and stuffes the drugs into a neighbours bag why shoud that innocent person die ?<br><br>It is an abscene law.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>You are just making a hypothetical assumption. We will then have the jurisdiction to find out the real person.<br><br>You can only have hypothetical scenariowhen you have such laws. There is no allowance in the system to even consider this may be the case. You hang if you have the drug on your possession. You are guilty until proven innocent. You have no legal representaion for up to 2 weeks. The whole problem with this system is that it is mandatory, it does not allow for excuse so if your neighbour on a plane plants the stuff in your bag then you will hang. End of story. No-one will ever know if there maybe a chance of your innocence because you have it you are guilty. So how can you have anything but a hypothetical?</div></blockquote>Sorry mate, should I call you mate?  We are not talking about a hypothetical scenario here, it is an offence which the guilty has admitted, so punishment is serve with our laws and not your laws.  Please respect our laws as we did not meddle yours as well.  You can put your comment but you cannot degrading the people that agree with the law.</div>

They would bring in the dogs to sniff your car only if they receive tipoff. Nobody knows exactly how much has been smuggled in.

            <div class='col-md body'>A letter from Australia:<br><br>Misplaced empathy<br><br>THE impending execution of Nguyen Tuong Van has created a wave of misplaced empathy within the popular Australian imagination. Church leaders and politicians are falling over themselves to save him. He has even been described by some people, as quoted in the daily papers, as a "compassionate" young man with "so much to offer". We all know what Nguyen had to offer: 26,000 street doses of heroin. Did he ever exhibit compassion for those who would have ended up dead or hopelessly addicted to his loot?<br>Our disproportionate sympathy for Nguyen continues as we are now considering a minute's silence on Friday to commemorate his death, as if he were somehow on an equal par with fallen soldiers who died in battles in Gallipoli or the Somme or in the jungles of Borneo fighting for ideals such as democracy or freedom. Nguyen is none of these; he is a heroin trafficker. May his God rest his soul.<br>John Williams, Thornbury<br><br></div>

Thou'lt come no more,<br>Never, never, never, never, never.<br><br>FOUR hundred years after they were written, Shakespeare's words (King Lear, V, iii) still resonate in 21st-century Australia.<br><br>Since hanging is the most common method of suicide in Australia, there must be many people experiencing vicarious trauma in the current crisis of Nguyen Tuong Van's impending sentence. Those of us who have witnessed the aftermath of a hanging know how deeply it assaults our psyches and are aware of what a barbarous and brutal method of death it is.<br><br>When I read the article "The precision of ritual in the gallows' shadow" ( The Age, 24/11), I wept. The article triggered my memory of finding a loved one hanged many years ago. Unlike Nguyen, my partner took his own life when suffering serious depression. The sight of his corpse so traumatised me that the memory of his face remained blocked for a long time.<br><br>The amnesiac veil that protected me from that violation was ripped away some years later, when I held a severely injured but still struggling animal as it was being put down by a vet. The animal's violent struggle was frozen on its face after death. For me, that evoked the memory of the grotesque appearance of my beloved partner's face when I found him.<br><br>The psychological damage that image inflicted on me does not ever fully go away. It may recede for a time but is easily re-activated by events such as Nguyen's looming execution. The grim reality of this method of death is life-changing for those who witness it.<br><br>So, as well as the politics of capital punishment, it is the actual manner of death by hanging that I find offensive. This utterly depraved practice should have no place in a civilised society. Such a death in a state-sanctioned, cold-blooded and mandatory sentence is an obscenity.<br><br>Perhaps it should be mandatory for those who sentenced Nguyen Tuong Van to watch his execution. And may that experience haunt them for the rest of their lives, if that is what it takes to remove this abomination from the statutes of all nations forever.<br>Name and address withheld<br></div>
