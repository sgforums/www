Back then organised crime was still rampant, and tt was not uncommon to hear of armed robberies and kidnap attempts on businessmen like CK Tang. The implementation of the death penalty for possession and sale of arms in 1973 was not for the purpose of deterrence, but to physically reduce the frequency of armed crime by literally killing off offenders while working to curb the import of arms from Indonesia and Malaysia.  At this point in time, the death penalty was no deterrent to crime- since criminals had as much chance to die in a shootout as to swing from a noose, many died in gun battles with the police during the course of their crimes. Also discovered were that most of the crimelords involved were repeat offenders- everytime the police foiled a robbery they would retreat to a offshore kelong and recoup their losses for another attempt.<br><br>The death penalty as a deterrent to armed crime remained ineffective until gun trafficking was stopped in the 80s, due to it being made impossible and unprofitable to bring weapons into the country.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rexdriver:</div><div class="quote_body">A strange new concept of homicide.<br></div></blockquote>What term would you use then? You insist that drug related deaths are not premeditated and therefore can't be classified as murder. Fine. But you are tacitly ignoring the reality that most drug traffickers are aware of the fact that their wares can and do take lives. According to Singapore law, you have committed culpable homicide if you cause death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, <strong>or with the knowledge that you are likely by such act to cause death.</strong><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rexdriver:</div><div class="quote_body">And hello, nobody asked for drug traffickers to be completely absolved of fault.

The death sentence is a self-defensive measure taken by the state in order to protect potential victims against a criminal whose actions endanger society, and whose crime is considered too henious to be allowed to rejoin society. Before 1996, there was no other way to keep such criminals permanently out of circulation other than the death sentence.

The point is that no exception should be made for any foreigner. Not for Flor Cintemplacion or Michael Fay and certainly not for Nguyen Van Tuong. If Singaporeans are punished accordingly for their crimes, I don't see why they should not.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LazerLordz:</div><div class="quote_body">Anyway, most of the opposition against the death penalty come from religious groups.Forgiveness has taken the place of retributive judgement.</div></blockquote>I have an explanation for that as well. Organised religon usually becomes milder and more open minded in liberal countries- partly due to the rub-off from society, but also to become more palatable and thus survive in the new environment. Hardline religous societies are apt to have harsher laws. Hence the difference in a cleric from the UK and one from Iran, and why hands get chopped off in Saudi Arabia and not Algeria. You can even see this difference in First World countries between the more religous and conservative US and the more secular and liberal Europe.</div>

The closest crime to which it can be related is a culpable homicide, since it is not a murder. To cause a death is commit a homicide. To knowingly cause one without intention makes you culpable. Open and shut.<br><br>The alternative is to acknowledge that drugs do not cause death and that drug peedlers are unaware that their drugs can cause death. Which to my understanding are false assumptions.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rexdriver:</div><div class="quote_body">And your classification of the death penalty as "self-defensive" is something I don't understand.

Therefore I believe that it is quite obvious that religion would be highly relevant to the discussion.<br><br>It is also only a theory, and a personal one btw.
