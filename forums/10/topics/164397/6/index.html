            <div class='col-md body'>actually if sanction is imposed, Australia will loose out, Singapore will no longer buy pork from them, what else did we import from there...<br><br>Vice versa, Singapore being  the trading hub, will definetely impose higher tax for aussie to buy anything out of singapore, doesn't  that make them loose out? As aussie will not take advantage of the FTA that singapore has with so many countries especially US.</div>
