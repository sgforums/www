But to spare his life may unravel  lot of things that Singapore stand for. For instance, we will signal to the drug kingpins that Singapore can now be used as a place of drug transhipment. Transhipment of drug will increase through Singapore.

Many have posted this suggestion to our presumptous leaders before. If we impose harsh laws and death sentence, we have got to achieve the intended results. If there is nothing to back up the presumptuousness that death penalty would eliminate drug, the problem would be a much larger one requiring greater understanding and total solution.<br><br>It is not wise to pass a lot of harsh laws like we have presumably intended to control certain problems but at the end these harsh laws did not quite solve the problems. It is using a sledge hammer to swat a fly.<br><br>Let citizens debate, parliament review all the harsh laws. Why keep assuming crimes or consequences which are not properly backed up with hard facts of cause and effect. Top-down leadership is full of such assumptions and presumptuousness. Drug law is only one typical instance to show that leaders can be terribly wrong in their autocratic assumptions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by robertteh:</div><div class="quote_body">Good point !!! Many have posted this suggestion to our presumptous leaders before. If we impose harsh laws and death sentence, we have got to achieve the intended results. If there is nothing to back up the presumptuousness that death penalty would eliminate drug, the problem would be a much larger one requiring greater understanding and total solution.<br><br>It is not wise to pass a lot of harsh laws like we have presumably intended to control certain problems but at the end these harsh laws did not quite solve the problems. It is using a sledge hammer to swat a fly.<br><br>Let citizens debate, parliament review all the harsh laws. Why keep assuming crimes or consequences which are not properly backed up with hard facts of cause and effect. Top-down leadership is full of such assumptions and presumptuousness. Drug law is only one typical instance to show that leaders can be terribly wrong in their autocratic assumptions.</div></blockquote>The harsh laws u mentioned are those who keep you/your house safe at night.</div>
