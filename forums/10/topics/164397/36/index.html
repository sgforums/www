I always like to use the analogy of Singapore as a Christmas tree (and how apt too, given tt Christmas is coming fast<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">). From 1965-1985, LKY's PAP planted the seed and watered it and watched it grow, then decorated the tree with ornaments. Since 1985, the tree has begun to rot, but the PAP is only interested in changing its ornaments. It's doing essentially what Ex-DPM feared/ fears Singapore would do: extrapolating from the present to the future, instead of transforming the core.<br><br>the (cheerful) pikamaster</div></blockquote>Hi Pikamaster<br><br>Tht's why I say, I don't support some of their policies. Atually I do find that you are the most rational so far. I also believe that the current education needs an overhaul and more emphasis should be placed on arts and creativity. Of course. it's out of topic to discuss all these in this thread. And I hope its just a debate, not a flaming war.</div>

So, pray tell, what makes Australian law the holy grail of legal jurisprudence? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Barringthe fact that the issue was never about law to begin with, let's humour you. Australia is unique in being the only nation in the region to protest death sentences on the grounds of morality. At least Indonesia and the Phillipines are honest about it- when we hang one of theirs, they tell us that they are unhappy because we are hanging one of theirs. Australia claims high ground and fabricates an elaborate tale of love for human rights and similar such rubbish, all in the name of the lofty crusade of 'opposing the death penalty', while tacitly supporting its use in areas beneficial to themselves.<br><br>What makes it right?

It was never about law, otherwise the enlightened Australian nation would have rushed to the ICJ instead of hopping on one foot. It was nationalism, pure and simple. Australia attempted to force its will onto another country, and failed spectacularly.</div>

Nothing in the above paragraph has any relevance to the situation. True, the Constitution protects the fundamental rights of the individual- one of which is that no person can be <strong>"deprived of his life or personal liberty."</strong> However, in the very same sentence, comes <strong>"save in accordance with law. "</strong> While the ultimate law of the land, the Constitution is not the only one- and this is stated explictly in the same section:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">(6) <strong>Nothing in this Article shall invalidate any law Â—</strong><br><br>(a) in force before the commencement of this Constitution which authorises the arrest and detention of any person in the interests of public safety, peace and good order; or<br></div><div class="quote_body">(b) relating to the misuse of drugs or intoxicating substances which authorises the arrest and detention of any person for the purpose of treatment and rehabilitation</div></blockquote>Nothing in the Constitution contradicts the Misuse of Drugs Act in any way.
