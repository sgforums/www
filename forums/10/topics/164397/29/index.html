Don't use them, don't touch them, don't carry them, don't traffic in them and don't imagine for a moment Â— for a moment Â— that you can risk carrying drugs anywhere in Asia without suffering the most severe consequences."<br><br>Mr Howard said he felt sympathy for Nguyen's mother, whom he met in secret in Sydney a few weeks ago.<br><br>"I feel desperately sorry for this man's mother. I met her, she was understandably in a very distraught condition, she obviously felt responsibility for what had happened."<br><br>He said he was opposed to capital punishment because of the deinite nature of the sentence.<br><br>ICJ appeal was 'worth a try'<br><br>Federal Opposition leader Kim Beazley still believes an attempt could have been made to challenge Nguyen Tuong Van's death sentence in the International Court of Justice.<br><br>Mr Beazley, who attended a Catholic mass this morning at Sydney's St Mary's Cathedral as Nguyen was being prepared for execution, said it was difficult to judge whether the Australian government had done enough to try to save Nguyen.<br><br>"I do know they did a lot. And they did a lot for a long time'', Mr Beazley told ABC radio.<br><br>"I started taking this up myself when I went to visit Singapore months ago now, and I became conscious when I did so of a plethora of approaches, for some considerable time, by the commonwealth government on behalf of Mr Nguyen.<br><br>"So they have actually been engaged for some time.<br><br>''(But) I suppose you could say it would have been worth a try in the International Court of Justice and that didn't happen.<br><br>"They (the government) had their own internal arguments on that.''<br><br>Hulls condemns hanging<br><br>Victoria's Attorney-General Rob Hulls said the campaign to end the death penalty in Singapore would continue despite Nguyen's hanging.<br><br>Mr Hulls made a personal appeal to Singapore's justice minister last week after delivering a letter from Premier Steve Bracks pleading for mercy for the young Victorian.<br><br>The attorney-general, who is currently in Europe, issued a statement through his media adviser soon after Singapore confirmed the execution of Nguyen just before dawn at 6am (9am AEDT) today.<br><br>Mr Hulls expressed his condolences to the Nguyen family and said his thoughts were with them today.<br><br>"For a first-world country to be imposing a third-world penalty by executing this young man, it diminishes the lives of all of us,'' he said.<br><br>"The Singapore government must understand that killing this young Australian will not kill the fight against the mandatory death penalty.''<br><br>Premier Steve Bracks is expected to issue his own statement shortly.<br><br>Australia 'could have done more'<br><br>Prominent Victorian QC Robert Richter says more could have been done by the Australian government and lawyers to save the life of death row prisoner Nguyen Tuong Van.<br><br>Mr Richter was part of a vigil held by members of the Victorian Criminal Bar Association (CBA) who gathered outside Melbourne's County Court to mark the moment that convicted drug trafficker Nguyen Tuong Van was to be hanged in Singapore at 9am (AEDT).<br><br>"I believe a lot more could been done both legally and otherwise, by that I mean politically," he told the Today show.<br><br>"We know that the Singapore government is susceptible to pressure, it has not been pressured at all."<br><br>Mr Richter said the US and French governments had both successfully intervened when their own citizens were about to be subjected to corporal punishment in Singapore, but the Australian government had failed to apply pressure.<br><br>He also said that the federal government should have sought Nguyen's extradition from Singapore to Australia weeks ago.<br><br>And he described Justice Minister Chris Ellison's remarks that Australia was unable to intervene for extradition as "absurd".<br><br>"He says it's a matter for the state, it is not ... it was a federal offence," he said.<br><br>"By seeking to take extradition proceedings it would have marked the fact that ... Australia as the intended victim does not want this man hanged but wants him dealt with according to Australian justice. He was only in transit in Singapore."<br><br>- theage.com.au, with AAP<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkred;">It rains to weep a life is loss, but it also weep because of the boy's wrongdoing.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cavinkoh:</div><div class="quote_body">Singapore is a very small country and a young population. therefore everything we do, we have to calculate our risks. Enforcing strict laws and punishment are crucial to acheive stability required in our society. Singapore's economy and social status is at stake here. We cannot afford big mistakes to happen to our society, because it will take even greater efforts to repair it. We are less than 10% of land mass and population of any SEA countries, but we are the richest and most sucessful of all of them. We are competing on a global scale with only 4 million people, compare to 400 milion in US, 1 billion in china and anohter billion in india. We are nothing to them, peanuts. We are not even a speck on their GDP. But yet we are noticed, and we have their trust!<br><br>We have to ask ourselves what is more important, individual pleasures or the continued sucess for our nation. There are many other countries that would take in Singaporeans as their citizens because we come from a society that is known to be hardworking, law abiding, trustworthy and intelligent. and would be a great asset to their country.<br><br>But yet, we are here in this forum agruing about civil liberties which can potentially create chaos and tear the fabric of our nation. We should stand behind our government as the choice they have made is the right one. Have you guys read the patriot act? how about Europe and their current riot and terrorist problems. Do we wait for problems to evolve into something much more terrible and drastic, or would you belive in the pervention of such events.<br><br>We do not have oil, land or other resources that we can use to help us gain money for our country. Only our ports, economical stability and human resources that drive this country. if we lose that we would have nothing, and we will just be like the rest of SEA, but much worst off.<br><br>What our government has done for Singapore has been unbelievable in just 40 over years. They have put us on the map and given every singapore the tools to be sucessful and compete in a global scale. Can you imagine if we were a part of malaysia speaking malay? where would we be now? It is the choices we have to make and the sacrifies (which are not that many or important unless you are a druggie or a street bum) we have to give up to acheive sucess. The government has already changed for the better, and it has been slowly evolving. you have to understand these changes cannot happen overnight, also there are some things that cannot change.<br><br>We live in a country where the population is better off than 90% of the rest of the world, the rest of the world that's a lot of people. would you want to give that up just for a death penalty of a person that is not even from singapore?<br><br>As JFK puts it;"ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country"<br><br>I love singapore, there is no place like it, it is my home and my family. I hope you love your country too. </div></blockquote>cavinkoh,<br><br>I most dislike "nationalists" like you.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>1) We have their economic trust, but social/political trust? that's another matter. Yes, we need to enforce strict laws, but how strict?<br><br>2) Success has many means of measure.<br><br>3) blablabla... the propagandist spout again. I have read the Patriot Act, and estimating opinion on American newspapers and on the BBC, have come to the conclusion that a sizeable proportion of Americans reject the Act. Besides, we have our ISA as its equivalent, or even as it's "big brother" of sorts.<br><br>Civil Liberties don't tear apart national fabric and/or create chaos by themselves; Look at Scandinavia and Switzerland instead of USA and Taiwan.<br><br>5) Agree with your points, but this has nothing to do with the issue. Do you happen to be in the wrong thread?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>6)  Nobel Laureate Amaryta Sen did say that every nation should achieve 2 pillars: liberty and economy. We have achieved economy, but not liberty. As I said in my previous posts, our government has achieved much in the economic field, but not in much else unrelated to economics in other fields.<br><br>I don't see "much better" in its political attitude for instance. I still remember that Michael Backman was sacked for making objective comments on our local press freedom in 2003. Our government still enjoys lambasting the reputable Amnesty International and Reporteres Sans Frontieres, both of which are associations recognized by the UN. I see scant consideration of public feedback over the IR issue, again still going for money over public welfare. MOE, as always, refuses to treat student stress as a problem, and their recent curriculum changes have been very haphazard for the student. Their "opening up" merely allows bar-top dancing and bungee-jumping, which sounds more like it's meant to give Singaporean economy a glitz, not truely open up the environment for locals.<br><br>I accept that changes cannot be made overnight, but I'm worried because no serious changes e.g. removal of Mandatory Death Penalty for non-violent crime and removing the streaming system/ GEP have not been done yet. I'm equally disturbed that some of the changes that HAVE been done are not entirely positive, such as the adding in clauses to attack "defamatory" online statements, the "online equivalent of the ISA", which are just as vague as the provisions in the parent document the ISA, even the introduction of the IP, which is not the bed of roses ST likes to porray it as; My juniors inform me that IP is not much different from the main curriculum, save that it is more confusing nad has a jumble-of-somethings called philosophy, which it appears Singaporean (or at least Rafflesian) teachers can't teach.<br><br>7) Once again, you go out of scope. Or in fact, your entire post has been out of scope. Ngyuen was on transit to Australia, not intending to sell any drugs in Singapore. In this particular case, we are not even talking about the normal (chaotic) civil liberties such as freedom of speech and freedom of expression, or even freedom of religion. We are talking about the most basic Right, without which the above would be irrelevant: the Right to Life. Everybody accepts that Ngyuen is wrong. Everybody, even the Australian Transport Union who threatened a strike, accepts that he should be punished for his crime, and that he should be punished by Singapore.<br><br>However, the Australians and their Singaporean and foreign supporters don't believe that executing him is the right way to go. We are not here to free Ngyuen; we all understand he needs to atone for his mistake. But does the atonement have to be his life? It's not like he laid a knife on anybody. I bet that if drug manufacturers were to be caught, the maximum they would face is lifetime imprisonment for the manufacture of Harmful Substances. Sure then, a lifetime imprisonment would be atonement enough for Ngyuen? After all, the poor young Vietnamese immigrant just happened to pick the wrong job to support his poor family with.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by soloken:</div><div class="quote_body">Why Nguyen must die<br>Singapore's decision to execute Nguyen Tuong Van for drug trafficking is correct and responsible.<br><br>ALTHOUGH opinions in Australia are not unanimous, many Australians strongly oppose Singapore's decision not to commute the death sentence on Mr Nguyen Tuong Van for drug trafficking. I respect these views, which spring from a deep sense of human compassion. However, the outcry has also made it difficult to separate fact from fiction.<br><br>Fiction No. 1: Singapore has breached international law.<br>There is no international agreement to abolish the death penalty. Capital punishment remains part of the criminal justice systems of 76 countries, including in the United States, where it is practised in 38 states.<br><br>We respect Australia's sovereign choice not to have capital punishment. We hope Australia will likewise respect Singapore's sovereign choice to impose the death penalty for the most serious crimes, including drug trafficking. The overwhelming majority of Singaporeans support this.<br><br>Fiction No. 2: The death penalty has not deterred drug trafficking.<br>This logic is flawed. The death penalty has not completely eliminated drug trafficking, but it has certainly deterred drug trafficking. Since the introduction of tough anti-drug laws in the mid-1970s, drug trafficking and drug abuse in Singapore have come down significantly. Potential traffickers know that, once arrested, they face the full weight of the law.<br><br>Fiction No. 3: Mr Nguyen is an unsuspecting victim<br>Mr Nguyen may not be a hardened criminal, but he is not an unsuspecting victim either. He knew what he was doing and the penalty if he was caught. Had he succeeded, he would have made a lot of money. If we let off a convicted courier because of age, financial difficulties or distressed family background, it will only make it easier for drug traffickers to recruit more "mules", with the assurance that they will escape the death penalty.<br><br>Fiction No 4: The punishment does not fit crime.<br>Mr Nguyen was caught with 396 grams of pure heroin, enough for 26,000 "hits", with a street value of more than $A1 million.<br><br>Yes, he was transiting Singapore, and not smuggling drugs into the country, but Singapore simply cannot afford to allow itself to become a transit hub for illicit drugs in the region.<br><br>Fiction No. 5: Mr Nguyen can testify against Mr Bigs.<br>All drug syndicates assume that some of their couriers will get caught. They never let the couriers know enough to incriminate themselves. The information that Mr Nguyen provided to the Singapore authorities was of limited value, and was, in fact, intended to mislead and delay the investigation.<br><br>Fiction No. 6: Singapore connives with drug lords.<br>This is an old falsehood propagated by Dr Chee Soon Juan (Singapore opposition leader). He has alleged that the Singapore Government had invested in projects in Myanmar (Burma) that supported the drug trade. When this first surfaced in 1996, the Singapore Government explained that its investment in the Myanmar Fund was completely open and above board. The fund held straightforward commercial investments in hotels and companies. Other investors in the fund included Coutts &amp; Co, an old British bank, and the Swiss Bank Corporation. The Singapore Government offered to set up a commission of inquiry so Dr Chee could produce evidence to prove his wild allegations. Unfortunately, Dr Chee never took up the offer.<br><br>Fiction No. 7: Singapore has treated Australia with contempt.<br>Singapore highly values good relations with Australia and with Australian leaders. We share a common belief in the sanctity of the law. The Singapore cabinet deliberated at length on Mr Nguyen's clemency petition. It considered all relevant factors, including Mr Nguyen's personal circumstances, and the many public and private appeals from Australian leaders. Unfortunately, finally the cabinet decided that it could not justify making an exception for Mr Nguyen. It had to treat Mr Nguyen consistently with similar past cases, and apply the law equally to Singaporeans and foreigners.<br><br>Singapore's leaders have taken pains to explain our decision to Australian leaders, both in writing and in person. Singapore's Foreign Minister had also informed Foreign Minister Alexander Downer confidentially in advance of when the family would be notified of the execution date, and explained to Mr Downer that that the family should be the first to learn of the execution date. So when Singapore's Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, met Prime Minister John Howard in Busan, he could not inform Mr Howard of the execution date either. Mr Lee did not know that the letter of notification had by mistake already been delivered to Mrs Kim Nguyen, one day early. Once Mr Lee discovered what had happened, he promptly apologised to Mr Howard.<br><br>Australians who oppose the death sentence on Mr Nguyen will not agree with everything I have said. But I hope they will accept that the Singapore Government has a responsibility to protect the many lives that would otherwise be blighted and destroyed by the drug syndicates, and to prevent Singapore from becoming a conduit for illicit drugs in the region. We are all touched by the pain and anguish of Mr Nguyen's mother, but if we waver in our firm position against drug trafficking, many more families will be shattered.<br><br>Joseph K. H.

Her are the real fictions:-<br><br>FICTION-1 : SIngapore has not breached international law.<br><br>The international law Singapore has technically breached is the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). UDHR was probably ratified when Singapore joined the UN. ICCPR has conspicuously not been ratified by Singapore.<br><br>FICTION-2: the mandatory death penalty has caused a decline in drug-trafficking and drug-addiciton from the 1970s.<br><br>Singapore society changed alot in wealth and social condition from the 1970s on. How certain is it that the change in crime statistics is due SOLELY to the mandatory death penalty?<br><br>FICTION-3: If we let off drug-mules, drug-traffickers will be more assured in hiring mules.<br><br>Are they really any less assured? Or are they just laughing at our stupid laws?<br><br>FICTION-4: The punnishment fits the crime.<br><br>A most horrendous judgement. He is merely a courier, and a transiting courier at that. He could be jailed for life; that would be a better punishment and still have the same deterrent effect. The Death Penalty fits violent crime, where people are involuntarily physically hurt. In the case of Ngyuen, any drugs he could have carried, id consumed, would be voluntarily consumed by a addict seeking the drugs. Drug sellers don't FORCE addicts to buy drugs, and certainly Ngyuen doesn't seem like the kind of guy who would. Besides, his role was only that of an intermediary, not a low-man. Technically, he's not even a mule.<br><br>FICTION-5: The information provided by Ngyuen was intended to mislead investigators.<br><br>What a spurious judgement! No wonder we never catch druglords / drug manufacturers! The Aussie Feds themselves testified that the information was valuable to them and had helped them to some extent. Of course, we remember that the drugs Ngyuen had were meant for Australia.<br><br>FICTION-6: Singapore's conniving with druglords is a fiction constructed by Dr Chee Soon Juan.<br><br>It was not constructed by Dr Chee. In fact, it is part of an AP and BBC news report in 2000. Western investigative journalism is not usually incorrect. Anyway, "Conniving with druglords" is not limited to investing in the Myanmar Fund. What about supporting child companies of Burmese druglords and allowing these companies positions on the Register of Companies? Why are we being penny-wise, pound-foolish?<br><br>FICTION-7: Singapore has not treated Australia with contempt<br><br>Ermm... why the need to compare with precedent? Why not treat each case as independent?<br><br>The worst sign of contempt was when the order of the Death Penalty was passed in the midst of negotiations on whether Ngyuen should be given the Death Penalty or not. This is a serious violation of diplomatic trust.<br><br>the (abolitionist) pikamaster<br><br></div>
