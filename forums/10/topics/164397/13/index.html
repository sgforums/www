You are going to need money and lots of it!!!!<br><br>No point being poor with all these ideas. You can only influence people if you are in a position of power to do so. Forgive me for wanting to be a quintillionare... at least I know what I want to do with the money, make a difference. There are plenty of hungry, starving people in the world, you supposed moral and socio reform platforms mean nothing to them when they cannot even meet the basic necessities of life!<br><br>Quit whinging about whether Nguyen is going to die or not, put your voice to more important things like the starving in africa, the little girls sold into prostitution at very young ages to satisfy the appitites of the white man. They degrade our society and us as a people and you still want to stick up for them? We are all equal, no one better than the other, if there has been an injustice in the world it is that the whites have screwed it up! They have been around for so long and have not proven that they can do one thing right. Singapore became independent and we have flourished outside of white rule. Before that where was Singapore?<br><br>We have done great and I for one am proud of that! If you cannot be proud of who you are and where you come from then what does that say about you? Always trying to be someone you are not and something you will never be. You cannot be white.. unless you already are.<br><br>Even then a lot of the aussies don't think that Singapore has overstepped her boundaries, they say, who are we to meddle, he committed the crime in Singapore and so he just has to face the music.</div>

What above the law and order they uphold, what about the Justice they talking about and what about the respect!!!!  This is getting absurb, they actually encourage to find loopholes in law.

The penalty was mandatory for murder and offences against the president, and was discretionary for a number of other offences.<br><br>In 1975 the Misuse of Drugs Act was amended to make the death penalty mandatory for people caught trafficking a certain amount of drugs (the amount varies depending on the drug). For heroin it is more than 15 grams. Nguyen was convicted of trafficking 396 grams.<br><br>The Arms Offences Act was also later amended to provide a mandatory death sentence for a range of firearms offences.<br><br>The mandatory death penalty for drug offences was introduced because "in the 1960s and 1970s the drug problem in Singapore assumed alarming proportions", according to the judgement in Nguyen's final appeal.<br><br><strong>By comparison, Iranian law provides a mandatory death sentence where the trafficking only involves more than 10 grams of heroin.</strong></blockquote><br><br>The compare Sg with Iran.What did they want to imply??</div>
