And yes I am a Singaporean who can't see his own country insulted by the minority Australian extremists who loves condemning Singapore but not condemning China and US even though they have capital punishment.<br><br>Singapore hang drug traffickers not to reduce/fight the drug trade, but to PREVENT TRAFFICKERS FROM ENTERING SINGAPORE! The drug trade is rampant throughout the world, and of course there is literally no effects on the overall drug trade, but at least Singapore have prevented potential drug traffickers from entering and harming Singaporeans.<br><br>Obviously the Australians have long given up the fight against drug. They see a drug trafficker like Ngyuen as somebody who deserve a second chance. Obviously they have never thought of the consequences of young Australians who receive those drugs from the many so-called first-time drug peddlers. Furthermore, a first-time offender like Nguen doesn't mean this is the first time he tried to smuggle! HE COULD HAVE BEEN SMUGGLING 100 TIMES AND TOO BAD, justice caught up with him and he has to receive the punishment.<br><br>Not only do the majority of the Singaporeans agree with the local government stance, there are a significant amount of Australians who applaud Singapore's action. I think these Australians are the people who can understand the entire situation. The whole farce has been blown out of proportion by the Australian press. I don't see or hear them complain bout Singapore hanging other convicted drug traffickers.<br><br>The entire episode is more of a political scam. The only two parties who stand to gain are the Australian press and the opposition party in Australia. Cuz the opposition party has managed to stir up anti-Howard feelings, which could stand them to good faith for the next election.</div>

In am sure most people will know that almost all crimes are committed because they have motives. Most robbers rob becuase they are desperately short of cash and they can't turn to other people. So does that mean the law will make an exception for him? If you feel the Singapore law is too harsh, the best thing is not to break the law!<br><br>How bout murderers who are under influence of drugs? So if a murderer stabs your family member and claimed he is nder the influence of drug, can he be pardoned since he has a logical reason (for not being able to think clearly)?<br><br>For Nguen, he is just a drug trafficker who would like to harm more fellow  Australians and causing even more social chaos. I am surprised not many Australians are thanking Singapore for executing an evil person like him.</div>

Justice involves two things: holding people accountable for their actions and making them "face the music", and also ensuring that they are treated fairly and given a chance to reform and become better people. The Death Penalty achieves the first aspect very well certainly, but fails completely in the 2nd. Therefore, the Death Penalty is not a just punishment. Since Justice is the essence of Law, therefore the DP is not lawful either.<br><br>True, we need to talk with reason; sadly, whenever the DP is mentioned, emotion is whipped up about "sadistic suckers". Retentionists are never calm and cool when talkign about the DP.<br><br>the pikamaster</div></blockquote>Hi,<br><br>Its good that you provided us a reason how the law should be. Remember, it is only in theory. Have you ever wondered why the Singapore law is harsh? Do you know why Singapore practises so-called Draconian laws such as caning illegal immigrants?<br><br>A few years ago, there is a documentary that shows convicted illegal immigrants who would rather risk their lives to enter Singapore illegally rather than stay back at their homeland (Indonesia). To them, a lengthy sentence in Singapore prison is far better because a meal down there is a thousand times better off than starving in their homeland. If Singapore does not cane theese illegal immigrans and set a stern deterrent to other potential illegal immigrants, can you imagine how many hndreds or even thousands of them would try to enter Singapore illegally? Those lucky ones would enter Singapore and commit crimes to create social chaos, while unlucky ones would serve their "chalat-sentence" in prison while wasting us tax-payers money.<br><br>Since the law cannot just bend to accomodate  aparticular group of people, our law has to be consistent, and that includes Australians, Americans, etc.</div>
