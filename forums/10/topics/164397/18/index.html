            <div class='col-md body'>breytonhartge,<br><br>1) I'm talking about Singapore, not M'sia, China, Japan etcetc. Asia is not as homogeneous as Europe, possibly because there was never one moment in history where all of Asia was under one empire; Except for Russia, Most of Europe came under the Romans.<br><br>2) Actually, I'm finding this point strange, because Australia is not really asking us to change our laws; it wants us to make an exception in Ngyuen's case.<br><br>3) Culture is a transient object; it changes with the time. Roots tell us where we came from; they do not tell us where to go from here. If you wanted to look at roots the way you are looking at them, then you should say too that we should all be wearing ponytails; after all, that is in our roots too.<br><br>Dependence on Roots is a double-edged sword: they keep us firmly in the ground, but they also prevent us from moving forward.<br><br>The Westerners are irrelevant for this point. We are talking about our country singly, not in relation to other nations.<br><br>4) I think Ngyuen should pay a penalty, only that the penalty should not be death. Jail would be acceptable, term decided by a free judge. Perhaps community service (which does not seem to exist in Singapore) may be a better option. After all, his intention was to gain money to help his family, not to cause anybody's death. Notice he was unarmed when he entered Changi Airport.<br><br>The Election Results of the PAP are another issue altogether. I would say that given the phenomenal number of walkovers and citizens in walkover constituencies since the Anson by-election in the 1970s, the true level of support the people have for the government is pretty dubious. I mean, you can't assume all of them support the govt.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> Oh, and I guess this gives the reason why Singaporeans don't "give the opposition a chance to go": they have no chance to.<br><br>How many promises are fulfilled by the Opposition? Well, you can't really tell because they don't have the numbers to push any policy through period. How many promises are fulfilled by the PAP though? That is the question we all ought to ask. Especially, how many "fulfillments" are merely election carrots?<br><br>I did not deny the PAP's good track record. I merely pointed out that the good track record lasted from independence till 1990. Since then, there's not really been much of a track record.<br><br>Anyway, the terms "track record" and "good governance" are very vague. Depending on the measure used, the track record will be different:-<br><br>-&gt; On economics, it is stellar.<br><br>-&gt;  On education, it is stellar ... in terms of academic results; Not so stellar if you look at it from the point of the students' lives, including stress and all that. Not so stellar also if you look at the character of Singaporeans: Education hasn't removed snobbishness, lack of care for the environment, poor moral values etcetc. Education as a system is also far from stellar if we consider the depression, anxiety and disillusionment caused to students who don't fit the streaming system. Or how about the development of the arts scene?<br><br>-&gt; On Health, Stellar possibly, or then...<br><br>-&gt; On Defence, Stellar.<br><br>-&gt; On Community Development, questionable. Job discrimination, ethnic separation, still pretty common. Neighbourliness doesn't seem to be a developed trait. For the matter, the birthrate has not increased very much either. Although of course, how much monetary incentives will achieve is a question to ask in itself. And of course, drug consumption, partying etcetc, not to mention what ills the ICR will bring. Did you see "drug consumption"? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>-&gt; On Sports, if Singapore fans choose EPL over S-League, what does that show? And why were our olympic players Susilo and his gf both foreigners?<br><br>-&gt; On arts, well little really has to be said. Just consider how many people choose arts over science... FYI, I'm an arts student. Anyway, the Esplanade seems to host more foreign performances than local performances. I welcome the chance to be corrected on this point.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>-&gt; On Fundamental Liberties/ Adherence to Constitution/ Human Rights, not very good certainly. 140th in Press Freedom, (still had the cheek to argue), Caning and Mandatory Death Penalty, government-controlled Trade Unions, 3rd-world income structure, ISA, changes to Constitution on whim, political intimidation through defamation suits, GRC system, ban on student unions, banning religious groups like Jehovah's Witnesses and Falun Gong and proclaiming respect of Freedom of Religion.<br><br>5) Some people would think of UK or Switzerland, I think. Anw, in this issue, people are thinking of Australia. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>6) Read my previous posts in this thread again. Since 1970s in fact.<br><br>7) And Australia wants it any more than we do? Perhaps you should realize: we are here arguing on whether we should apply the mandatory death penalty to the crime of drug trafficking. We are not here to debate on whether we should legalize drugs/ or even let Ngyuen go scot-free. None of us wants drugs in the country. Not you, not me, not Laser Lordz, not the PAP, not the Aussie govt, not the UN, not the Archbishop of Sydney who interceded the Pope to pressure the PAP, not Amnesty International even. Every single party mentioned here condemns the drug trade. To AI, it is as pressing a problem as abuse of women. For the UN, eliminating drug trade is in its top ten priorities. The Archbishop of Sydney believes that Ngyuen should be punnished, but with grace that's all. The Aussie feds are enthusiastic in eradicating the druglords, which is why they turned to Ngyuen for assistance. Ngyuen's family want fairness in his case. The Aussies are merely against the Death Penalty.<br><br>ya well,<br>nitez<br>the pikamaster</div>

He indicated he would not use CHOGM to pursue the issue, believing nothing more could be done.<br><br>Mr Whitlam said he was "never surprised" at Singapore's neglect of human rights, and various other Commonwealth nations also practised capital punishment.<br><br>"If CHOGM is of any use then it should be raised there, because it concerns many other countries Â— some larger, some smaller than the rogue Chinese port city," he told The Age.<br><br>Mr Hawke, who has a good relationship with Mr Lee's father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's founding prime minister, confirmed he sent a letter but declined to elaborate on its contents. "It's not proper to say publicly what I've said privately to the Prime Minister. It's a private communication," he said.<br><br>Mr Hawke's public restraint is at odds with his approach as PM, when he declared "barbaric" the execution of drug traffickers Kevin Barlow and Brian Chambers in Malaysia in 1986.<br><br>The debate over how to deal with Singapore intensified as hope for Nguyen evaporated. Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs Ho Peng Kee reaffirmed at a meeting with Victoria's Attorney-General Rob Hulls in Singapore yesterday that the Government saw no further grounds to review Nguyen's death sentence.<br><br>Mr Howard said trying to involve Britain, Canada or other Commonwealth countries in pleading Aus<br><br>tralia's case over Nguyen would not "be the least bit appropriate". It would merely stiffen Singapore's resolve to carry out the hanging, set for next Friday, he said.<br><br>"We have to give ourselves a reality check," Mr Howard said after arriving in Malta for CHOGM. "If Australia starts running around trying to drum up the support of other countries to change the mind of the Singapore Government, the Singapore Government's attitude is going to harden even more."<br><br>Mr Howard said the Singapore Government would go ahead with the execution and "I do not believe what is now being said is going to make any difference".<br><br>Mr Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello strongly rejected a call from Liberal MP Bruce Baird to take the execution into account when cabinet considers Singapore Airlines' bid to fly the lucrative Pacific route to the US West Coast from Australia.<br><br>"I don't support linking the two things and they won't be linked," Mr Howard said. "That would not be in Australia's interests. It would not be good policy."<br><br>Mr Costello said airline policy should not be run "as an arm of criminal law policy". "I do not think it would work, and at the end of the day I do not think it would help Australia," he said.<br><br>Despite the Government thinking the end of the road had been reached, Opposition Leader Kim Beazley has written to Mr Howard proposing a bipartisan appeal to the Singapore Government. He said Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and Labor spokesman Kevin Rudd should visit Singapore next week "to make one last appeal to save this young man's life".<br><br>"A united representation from Australia will send the strongest possible message to Singapore about the concerns of Australians that the Singapore Government should commute the mandatory sentence," he said.<br><br>Mr Downer said that in 1968 the Indonesians had burned down the Singapore embassy over an execution, but "it didn't stop the execution taking place".<br><br>Nor, in the 1990s, had the Philippines' cancelling Singapore Airlines flights and taking other measures stopped the execution of a Philippine citizen.<br><br>- With CONNIE LEVETT<br><br>Mr Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello strongly rejected a call from Liberal MP Bruce Baird to take the execution into account when cabinet considers Singapore Airlines' bid to fly the lucrative Pacific route to the US West Coast from Australia.<br><br>"I don't support linking the two things and they won't be linked," Mr Howard said.

No doubt Mr Whitlam feels frustrated by the case, as we all do."<br><br>The Federal Government is awaiting legal advice today on the possibility of a legal challenge to the execution in the International Court of Justice.<br><br>Mr Whitlam yesterday criticised Singapore as he called for Prime Minister John Howard to raise Nguyen's case at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta.<br><br>Mr Howard has said he will not use CHOGM to pressure Singapore, but Mr Whitlam told The Age newspaper it was the right platform.<br><br>"If CHOGM is any use then it should be raised there, because it concerns many other countries, some larger, some smaller than the rogue Chinese port city," Mr Whitlam said.<br><br>He was "never surprised" at Singapore's neglect of human rights, he said.<br>Mr Hawke declined to reveal the contents of a letter he sent to Mr Lee, saying it was "a private communication".<br><br>Nguyen, a 25-year-old Melbourne salesman, faces execution next Friday after being caught with almost 400 grams of heroin at Changi airport in late 2002.<br><br>Advice on challenge<br><br>Acting Prime Minister Mark Vaile says the Government expects to receive advice later today on a legal challenge to the execution, but was not hopeful of success.<br><br>One of the lawyers providing advice to the Government, Sydney University's Professor Don Rothwell, said today avenues were still open for taking the case to the ICJ.<br><br>Mr Vaile said Australia would not use trade sanctions to put pressure on the Singaporean Government, but was still discussing the possibility of an ICJ challenge.<br><br>"We are getting advice on that and we hopefully will have that back to us today," he told the Nine Network.<br><br>"But we don't believe that offers an option to pursue in this matter."<br><br>Singapore adamant<br><br>Singapore's Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs, Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, said he realised many Australians are upset at the death sentence but it could not be changed.<br><br>Associate Professor Ho's comments came after he met Victoria's Attorney-General, Robert Hulls, who made a desperate plea for clemency for Nguyen.<br><br>Professor Ho assured Mr Hulls the decision not to grant the convicted drug smuggler clemency was not taken lightly.<br><br>"Singapore recognised that many Australians are disappointed with our decision, but Singapore also had to protect the interests and welfare of our citizens," a statement from the Law and Home Affairs Ministry said.<br><br>International case possible<br><br>Professor Rothwell said the ICJ challenge was being taken seriously by the Government.<br><br>"We were impressed by the sincerity with which the Government was coming to the table in this matter and it was quite clear to us that they were very seriously looking at the legal options we'd put on the table to take this matter to the International Court of Justice," Professor Rothwell told ABC radio.<br><br>The issue of jurisdiction had been resolved by finding treaties to which both Australia and Singapore were parties, he said.<br><br>It was now a question of finding a dispute under the treaties that could be taken to the ICJ.<br><br>Prime Minister John Howard said yesterday the Singapore Government would go ahead with the execution and "I do not believe what is now being said is going to make any difference".<br><br>- AAP, with Michelle Grattan and Connie Levett<br><br></div>

Roots tell us where we came from; they do not tell us where to go from here. If you wanted to look at roots the way you are looking at them, <strong>then you should say too that we should all be wearing ponytails; after all, that is in our roots too.</strong><br><br>Dependence on Roots is a double-edged sword: they keep us firmly in the ground, but they also prevent us from moving forward.<br><br>4) I think Ngyuen should pay a penalty, only that the penalty should not be death. <strong>Jail would be acceptable, term decided by a free judge</strong>. Perhaps community service (which does not seem to exist in Singapore) may be a better option. After all, his intention was to gain money to help his family, not to cause anybody's death. <strong>Notice he was unarmed when he entered Changi Airport.</strong><br><br>6) Read my previous posts in this thread again. <strong>Since 1970s in fact.</strong><br><br>the pikamaster[/b]</blockquote>pikamaster,<br><br>this post is not directed at me but I can't help but noticed some points worth "highlighting", to put it very mildly.<br><br>1. Bashing singapore, calling for boycott is between "demanding" and "threatening", it is not "asking". Fundamentally, law is fair only if it applies to all human being, making an exception for someone because of his nationality renders the law unfair, and such a demand is a clear illustration of arrogance.<br><br>2.  since when do overseas chinese trace our roots to those who wear pony tails? chinese wear pony tails is a century old ang moh impression of Chinese in China. you are obviously not a chinese. Culturally and ethnically, if you don't know where you are, you can't possible know where you are heading.<br><br>3. judges will always have to make judgement based on facts, laws, intentions, what is good for society, .......and all considerations, he should never be "free" to make judgement as he likes or based on his own opinion. Who is to say "jail would be acceptable"? of course, anybody can pass a judgement and call himself "free judge" for he will not be paid for his judgement, or is it because his judgement is worth nothing? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>4. How can being "unarmed when he entered the singapore airport" be an argument to prove his intention?<br><br>5. 1970s? I was born only in the mid 70s, haha, didn't know you are that old, no wonder never serve NS. If you have been repeating the same things since the 70s, its about time to accept some new ideas. I know, the older you get, the harder it is for you to forget about the past. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>have a good day.</div>

Or maybe they have everything to loose because they are not in control of the state-owned beneficial gains such as the SIA, SP initiatives in Australia,  or maybe their interest in other companies that competes are loosing out.<br><br>You can obviously know that it is out of political intent of the oppositions not so much of saving Ngyuen.
