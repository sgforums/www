            <div class='col-md body'>TUONG Van Nguyen will be allowed to order a takeaway meal Â– to the value of $8 Â– as a last grim treat before he is hanged on Friday. A strict price was put on a prisoner's final meal, former Changi warders said.<br><br>"The prisoner's last meal could be anything, but it had a specific price Â– and that was up to $S10," said a death row officer who retired about three years ago.<br>Such a takeaway meal could include a hamburger, chips, desert and jumbo soft drink; or roast duck and noodles.<br><br>Nguyen's last meal will be served tomorrow night, just hours before he is hanged at 6am on Friday (9am Melbourne time).<br><br>The condemned Melbourne drug trafficker will also have the choice of usual prison fare Â– Malay, Singaporean, Chinese, or even European food.<br><br>Friends Bronwyn Lew and Kelly Ng, who visited Nguyen yesterday, said he was remarkably composed.<br><br>Ms Lew said he told them: "If you're going to cry, please cry in front of me so that we can through this together."<br><br>The friends joined Nguyen's mother Kim and twin brother Khoa for the death-row visit.<br><br>They were able to pass on letters, photos and CDs from supporters.<br><br>Again they were separated from Nguyen by glass, but Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer has implored Singapore to allow Mrs Nguyen to hug her son before he dies.<br><br>Providing a macabre backdrop to farewells for 25-year-old Nguyen were comments by Singapore hangman Darshan Singh.<br><br>Singh said if he carries out the execution it will be quick and efficient.<br><br>"With me, they don't struggle. I know the real way," he said.<br><br>"If it's a raw guy (an untried hangman), they will struggle like chickens, like fish out of the water," Mr Singh said at his spacious apartment, as his baby granddaughter played at his feet.<br><br>Mr Singh, 74, has carried out more than 800 executions in 45 years.<br><br>But it has not been confirmed he will execute Nguyen, sentenced to death after being caught at Singapore airport in 2002 with nearly 400 grams of heroin.<br><br>Mr Singh said on Sunday he had been sacked by jail authorities after his identity was revealed.<br><br>But Singapore's prison department said yesterday Mr Singh had not been fired and was still a contract officer.<br><br>Officials would not confirm whether Mr Singh or a replacement would undertake the grim task for a standard fee of $320.<br><br>Mr Singh said he had developed close relationships with some condemned prisoners.<br><br>"They became my friends and wanted me to hang them. One of the fellows even asked me to give him his final haircut," he said.<br><br>Murderers and drug-traffickers deserved to die, Mr Singh said, and their punishment was a means of "complete rehabilitation".<br><br>"I'm changing their character to a different one because I believe in rebirth and they will be better men next time."<br><br>Foreign Affairs Minister Downer said the hangman's comments were completely inappropriate and he should keep them to himself.<br><br>Nguyen's lawyer Lex Lasry said the debate about who would execute Nguyen and the efficiency of hanging techniques was grotesque.<br><br>"It adds a bizarre feature to what is already a shocking injustice," he said. "It's revolting, frankly. If our client must die I want him to die a painless death."<br><br>One former Changi officer said a typical death cell comprised a mat on the concrete floor where the prisoner slept, a toilet and a sink.<br><br>"No windows, just a barred door," he said.<br><br>He said the gallows were about 100m from the cell block, and when asked to describe the scaffolding, he said: "Something out of an old Western movie."<br><br>What kind of tar-pau meal can S$10 buy nowadays? At most Nguyen will only be able to order hawker food or some fast food.<br><br>source: otr forum</div>
