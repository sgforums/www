            <div class='col-md body'>Fact of the matter is that the Australians have more cause to want this guy hung, since the drugs were headed for Melbourne and not Singapore.

If anybody's getting their knickers into a twist about Australians being drug-loving devil-may-cares, check the facts and get it straight.<br><br>That does not change the fact that for whatever reason, this fellow is going to die very soon.

            <div class='col-md body'>Nguyen lawyers in last-ditch bid<br>Email Print Normal font Large font By Dewi Cooke<br>December 1, 2005 - 10:09AM<br>Lawyers for condemned Melbourne man Nguyen Tuong Van will make one last attempt to argue his case to the Singapore Government today, despite conceding his hopes of clemency are "almost non-existent".<br><br>Lex Lasry, QC, who has led the fight to save the 25-year-old from the gallows, said he was not confident the government would grant them an audience.<br><br>"We've just sent a request through that they be prepared to talk to us sometime today, it went through the High Commissioner...they haven't actually said that they will see us," he told theage.com.au.<br><br>Mr Lasry said the legal team were clinging to the hope that the Singapore authorities would at the last minute change their mind but accepted "the prospect of that is very, very low, almost non-existent".<br><br><strong>Mr Lasry expressed his admiration for his client. He said Nguyen was in good shape emotionally and had been spending many hours in prayer.</strong><br>"I saw him yesterday morning and he was good, he was strong, he was composed, concerned for his family and the people around him," he said.<br><br>Visiting hours at the prison will close around 5pm today. From that point on, Nguyen will be alone.<br><br>Mr Lasry and his colleague, Julian McMahon, will visit Van this morning, as will his friends Kelly Ng and Brownwyn Lew.<br><br>The two young women have campaigned tirelessly to save their friend's life and Mr Lasry said the emotional stress leading up to their final goodbye had started to show.<br><br>"They were emotional, obviously, at the end of the day yesterday but I think they are enjoying the visits. So they're coping but it's difficult for them, I mean they're young and they're obviously vulnerable to that sort of emotional stress involved."<br><br>He did not know whether they had been able to show Nguyen some of the thousands of letters of support generated through their Reach Out campaign.<br><br><strong><br>What else can the boy do except for praying, admiration for what...it is the onl thing that he can do, to repent himself.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dec 1, 2005<br>The Straits Times<br><br>CANBERRA - AUSTRALIAN Foreign Minister Alexander Downer yesterday described as 'pointless' possible work bans by transport workers in protest against the imminent hanging in Singapore of Australian drug trafficker Nguyen Tuong Van.<br><br>He was speaking before Transport Workers Union (TWU) leaders held a meeting to decide whether to take action against Singapore Airlines (SIA) in retaliation against the scheduled execution in Changi prison tomorrow of the 25-year-old Melbourne man.<br><br>The Sydney Morning Herald quoted a spokesman for the New South Wales branch of the TWU, which represents airport refuellers and baggage handlers, as saying: 'The federal committee of management is meeting today in Melbourne to discuss a whole gambit of possible options.<br><br>'One of those possible options is a possible action of some sort against Singapore Airlines.'<br><br>The newspaper said it understood this could include restrictions on baggage handling and refuelling.<br><br>Mr Downer said action by the TWU would achieve nothing.<br><br>'It's a pointless thing to do,' he told Southern Cross Broadcasting.<br><br>'I think they should, you know, get on with their job and protect the interests of their members as the unions do but not start straying into international politics.<br><br>'I don't think it's going to be productive at all.<br><br>'I can absolutely assure you it will do nothing to help Van Nguyen.'<br><br>Mr Downer repeated that the Australian public opposed the execution but he believed it would now proceed.<br><br>'I think the general mood of the Australian public is that poor old Van Nguyen did something terribly wrong but we're very sorry that it's going to end with him being hanged,' he said.<br><br>Supporters of Nguyen have also conceded there was virtually no chance of obtaining a reprieve for the condemned man, who is scheduled to go to the gallows at dawn tomorrow.<br><br>'I've never really believed that the Singapore government, which prides itself on its strength, on not changing its mind, was ever going to change the decision and provide clemency as a result of public pressure,' former prime minister Malcolm Fraser told public radio.<br><br>South Australian Premier Mike Rann, in the meantime, has added his voice to those who have warned anti-capital punishment activists against 'glamorising' a convicted heroin dealer.<br><br>Mr Rann, who reaffirmed his opposition to capital punishment, labelled calls for a minute's silence across Australia to mark the execution as 'deeply offensive' to war veterans.<br><br>Like many others, he said Nguyen knew the risks he was running when he attempted to smuggle drugs through Singapore.<br><br>'People know what the laws are in Singapore and they take the risks, they choose to play a form of Russian roulette,' Mr Rann told reporters.<br><br>Opinion polls show many people still support capital punishment although Australia outlawed the death penalty decades ago, Reuters news agency reported yesterday.<br><br>It cited the headline of a letter published in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Tuesday: 'Friday is the time to remember heroin's victims.'<br><br>'My heart goes out to Nguyen's parents...But get real Australia. This man, like all drug dealers, was prepared to trade the lives and future of a thousand of our children for a few miserable dollars,' G. Ward wrote in a letter.<br><br>A cartoon in Sydney's Daily Telegraph yesterday depicted a heroin addict, on the street in front of scores of needles, saying: 'What a shame he's being executed.'<br><br>The Telegraph has covered the Nguyen story extensively but it has consistently made the point that Nguyen is a drug smuggler.<br><br>'The suggestion that the nation should observe a minute's silence is both morbid and offensive,' the Daily Telegraph said in an editorial yesterday.<br><br>Those pleading for clemency for Nguyen held a mass and prayer vigil in St Mary's Catholic Cathedral in Sydney last night.<br><br>'Two wrongs don't make a right. Taking a human life is not a way of solving a problem,' the chancellor of the Sydney Archdiocese, Father John Usher, was quoted as saying.<br><br>Vigils organised by Catholic and Anglican cathedrals were also due to be held in Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide, according to Reuters.<br><br>In earlier developments, Australia's Greens party on Tuesday called for a minute's silence at 9am Sydney time tomorrow to mark the execution while the Senate passed a motion opposing state executions.<br><br>Nguyen, 25, who had admitted acting as a drug courier, was sentenced to death last year after being found guilty of trafficking in 396g of heroin, found on him at Changi Airport in December 2002.<br><br>That amount works out to 26,000 doses on the street.<br></div>

I think those who say that should be send to Singapore to be hang, why they are the drug dealers ... for they are the only one who gain from that. First by scantioning and stopping trade, you are removing the alternative mean of honest living from the local. You are forcing them all back to growing opiums instead.<br><br>Next, Burma military government may not be the ideal, but it is the only one capable of holding the country together. Yes force freedom to it now, what you have is people freedom to chao and civil wars. After that what ? All boat load of refugees will be send to australia to be in refugees camp ?  After that what you want the Burmese to talk about ? Freedom in refugee camps in Australia . Maybe then Burmese can sue Aust for freedom<br></div></blockquote>just over two years ago, Iraq was in a similar position. THen George Bush decided to invade Iraq and his actions resulted in Saddam Hussein's removal. Whether his actions hinged on dubious intelligence gathered, it was carried out for the good of the Iraqi peasants. No doubt the American occupation of Iraq allowed the rise of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, but sooner or later, he will have no more excuse to carry out his atrocities.<br><br>Today, the Iraqis have much more rights than what they had in the era of Saddam's dictatorship. Burma needs a dose of regime change in a similar style.</div>

Ravi, a human rights lawyer who has worked on death penalty cases and campaigned to save Nguyen, said he could not fathom Singapore's decision.<br><br>"To say you can't hug is abominable. I am lost for words," he told AAP in Singapore.<br><br>"How can you just restrict it to the hand and not have bodily contact?"<br><br>Pressure on Singapore to allow a contact visit before Nguyen's execution had gathered strength in recent days, with Foreign Minister Alexander Downer lobbying the city-state's government.<br><br>Nguyen's lawyer Lex Lasry QC had said it would be inhumane if Singapore did not allow Kim Nguyen to hug her son one last time.<br><br>"It's inconceivable that there could be any valid reason why that wouldn't happen," he said today, ahead of Singapore's announcement.<br><br>Kim Nguyen, distress etched on her face and a handkerchief clutched tightly in her hand, arrived at Changi prison this afternoon for a final visit with her son.<br><br>She got to the prison gates at 12.35pm local time (3.35pm AEDT), looking drained and tired.<br><br>Very slowly, she walked the 10 metres from her car to the gates, aided by staff from the Australian High Commission in Singapore.<br><br>- AAP<br><br>A little compassion was given  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br></div>

"I believe that if he does so then Singapore is then treaty-bound to comply with the request. I believe that it would place the responsibility on Singapore to comply with its treaty or to, in defiance of the treaty, carry out its sentence."<br><br>Mr Walters has charged  Nguyen with two offences under Commonwealth law Â— one count of attempting to import heroin into Australia and one count of conspiring to import the drug into Australia Â— and one count of conspiring to traffic heroin under Victorian law.<br><br>"I think there's a realistic legal possibility that this could work," Mr Walters said. "The political realities are that Singapore is very reluctant to bend in relation to this but Singapore ought to be asked the question and I don't think we should die wondering."<br><br>The summons issued for Nguyen requires him to attend Melbourne Magistrates Court on February 2 next year.<br><br>Federation of Community Legal Centres executive director Pauline Spencer said a private prosecution was rarely used but was a mechanism available to any member of the public.<br><br>"They are just issued at the counter. They are filed as documents, nothing is proven and there is no prima facie case," Ms Spencer said.<br><br>"The government has been saying that without charges an extradition cannot happen.<br><br>"Now this has been delivered to the Justice Minister Chris Ellison he can move to seek extradition."<br><br>Mr Walters said there was enough time for extradition proceedings to be started and therefore to stay Nguyen's execution tomorrow.<br><br>- theage.com.au, with AAP<br><br></div>

This is not about downplaying his crime and it's not about making a saint out of him, it's about making a fundamental point that he should be punished in a way that does not amount to such a cruel and inhumane violation of his human rights."<br><br>In Singapore,<br><br>Jacob George of the Singapore Anti-Death Penalty Committee, said about 12 people would gather to mark the hours before Nguyen's execution at 6am (9am AEST).<br><br>"We see the punishment really does not fit the crime and he is so young, only 25, he's really not a hardened criminal," he said.<br><br>"We are of course sad and upset that it will go through.
