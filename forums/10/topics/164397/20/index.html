Chinese written history began about 3000 yrs ago when scripts on tortoise shell or animal bones were discovered. Now I know why chinese words are written the way they are.

Religion is part of culture, not The culture! bearing in mind, religions are universal, accepted by all races all over the world, religions do not change the culture or ethnicity of the believers.  The Bible was translated into hundreds of different languages, the Bible does not force the believers to speak latin or greek. Why are the ppl in spain called Spaniard, not Turks?? why do they continue to speak spanish not turkish?? this is because the spaniard were holding on to their roots, the spanish culture!! what is your point?  do you think by accepting christianity you can become italian, vatican, israelis or what??<br><br>It is the root from where you grow, but it is not just the biology,  it involves your own mentality, in choosing what you think is good for you, in discarding your roots passed down from yr parents, it involves your ability, if you can finally become what you want to be and finally it involves the environment, how others look at you and accept you. Your choice.<br><br>Ginseng roots is good for vitality, lotus roots is good for soup, is you roots good for nothing?? or you don't know?<br><br>ENOUGH ABOUT ROOTS, back to hanging the drug traffickers.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   </div></blockquote>Sgdiehard,<br><br>well, it happened to be YOU who started this argument over roots. I have no comment. Ya, let's get back to the proper issue. But just to conclude...<br><br>1) Banpo Culture is the root because it is one of the first records of Chinese Civilization in history. So it is when the Chinese started settling down into communities proper. There is actually an earlier Longshan Culture, but its information is scarce.<br><br>2) Vatican is Italian too.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Israelis are Israelis because of their religion, it happens; of course, though, there are Jews who live in other parts of the world. And your example of Spain doesn't hold water. Spain did have a culture long before Rome conquered it, and that was a different sort of culture, a nomadic, pagan, sun-worshipping Culture, a tribal clan culture. (Note that I'm not just equating religion with culture here.)<br><br>I'll concede one thing to you though: Religion alone does not make up culture. Culture refers to a set of practices and social norms and these change with time and geographic region.<br><br>In my Spanish example, you must take note that the Muslim conquerors brought more than just their religion. The Muslim world had a culture which was more than just worshipping Allah 5 times a day. They brought religious tolerance, maths, astronomy and their Arabic literature over, as well as their Muslim architecture, art in itself. Spain may have converted back to Christianity, but it kept all those other cultural stuff bequeathed to it by the Muslims. The Roman Catholic Spain after the conquests was different from the Roman Catholic and Pagan Spain before the conquests. So the Muslim culture became assimilated into modern Spanish and European culture, even if the religion did not.<br><br>3 &amp; 4) Now is this not the most confusing paragraph I have seen! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> How someone develops is dependent on the influences he receives. Influences from the parents do not necessarily just include roots; they include other things which the parents have encoutnered and thus model in their behaviour. In fact, the parents themselves might have discarded some of their own roots. The same thing applies for grandparents and other elders.<br><br>Plant roots and historical roots are 2 different things. Plant roots are pre-determined anchors (unless you uproot the plant of course). Historical roots are bits that float around; They only constrain you if you allow them to. Your roots determine where you came from, or where you are coming from, the mentality bit perhaps, but they don't constrain where you go.<br><br>Perhaps a better analogy than Ginseng and Lotus is the grape vine. The roots of the grape vine are used to prop the vine on the tree, rock or fence it grows on, but they don't prevent the vine from climbing/ growing out in any direction it desires. The roots themselves aren't used for the same purposes as the roots of the Ginseng or Lotus, but everybody knows what its fruits - growing on a stem supported by the roots and external supports - are made into : wine, raisins, medicines for heart disease. The roots are used to cling on to external supports to provide stability that allows the vine to grow outwards toward the sun. Similarly, a person has his historical roots so that he find others with similar roots and have a stable base to begin his growth. But once he starts to grow, he carries those roots along with him, and absorbs other influences from elsewhere; he should not allow the roots to keep him static and unchanging. Where we come from does not determine where we will go.<br><br>5)  Ya Ya, I will welcome such a transition... *phew*<br><br>the pikamaster</div>

It seems that it is inconceivable to them that others do not think like them. What Australia has been indulging recently in her attacks on Singapore smells suspiciously like racism, intolerance and discrimination.<br><br>Well, I would like to tell Australia that I agree with the verdict and the sentence given to Nguyen and I believe in the death penalty! Now, are you going to try to "convert" me? To try to "preach" and spread your own "gospel"?<br><br>But I have my rights!

            <div class='col-md body'>Nguyen Tuong Van reveals the pain of missing his mother.  Mark Russell reports.<br><br>With five days to go before his execution in Singapore, letters written by Nguyen Tuong Van reveal a young man's monumental struggle to come to terms with his fate.<br><br>In letters obtained by The Sunday Age, Nguyen, 25 Â— who is due to be hanged on Friday Â— tells of his innermost thoughts and the pain he feels at missing his mother since being condemned to die on March 20 last year for drug smuggling.<br><br>He writes openly about his feelings when told he would be hanged and his disappointment at not having done everything he wanted to do in life. But also about how he tries to look on the bright side.<br><br>"The surrealism surrounding the verdict had me mute," Nguyen says in one letter to a Melbourne friend written soon after being told he would hang.<br><br>"Out of the docks, down the steps, a smile Â— of shock Â— takes hold as I walk the corridor. I prayed. God listened. I'm numb."<br><br>When Nguyen is taken to death row, he describes it as "my new home away from home".<br><br>"My predicament. A view to die for? Hmmm Â… At the least many things has been put in perspective for me. Fundamentals and the such.<br><br>"Do we really need what we think we do? Questions I would never have encountered surface, arising in every situation.<br><br>"I brave and find myself. Walking. Talking. Thinking. Taking stock of the life I lived only makes room for disappointment. So many things I should have done. And should not have. Now I have this chance. An opportunity to make a difference, to avail."<br><br>Nguyen, who has become such a prolific letter writer that he can measure time by Biros that last from 16 to 18 days, writes that life is what you make it. No matter what tribulations you face, looking on the bright side makes an inexplicable difference. The grass is greener on the other side Â… "<br><br>Nguyen then turns to his deep feelings about his mother, Kim.<br><br>"The pain of missing her is by far sharper than anything physical I have ever felt.<br><br>"With aching comprehension I come to terms with the loss I feel without Mum Â… "<br><br>In a second, more formal letter sent to the Singapore President pleading for a reprieve and signed Caleb, the name he has taken since being baptised, Nguyen claims he is beginning to learn the meaning of life.<br><br>"Recognising and understanding my offence, the ramifications and subsequent repercussions as a result of my callousness has been crucial, essentially the turning point for my remorseful transformation; an opportunity of self-discovery made possible upon my conception of God and Jesus Christ into my life," Nguyen writes.<br><br>"Amidst these score of painful revelations an unspoken truth was exposed. I found myself in deep sorrow for the true victims; the families of those whom suffer as a result of losing a loved one to drugs. This truth has put many things in perspective for me."<br><br>In another letter, written on Sunday, October 23 Â— after his clemency plea was rejected and he was told he had only days to live Â— Nguyen said he was not surprised. He was sad for his mother and twin brother Khoa and all his loved ones. But he had known this was his fate for a long time. "Sailo (a name he uses for himself in the third person) was just awaiting my day of judgement and I am glad and ready to go now. I believe by then God's purpose will have been achieved.<br><br>"Fear has yet to set in and (I) pray may God's strength in me be enough to ward off any doubts I may have."<br><br>Nguyen said he went through his normal routine in prison after being told of his looming execution and slept from 7pm to 7am.<br><br>"So 12 solid hours Â… did me a world of good. This (letter) gonna be short because Sailo's got quite a number of comfort letters to write.<br><br>"God blessed me with so many beautiful beings who have loved me unconditionally so it's only befitting I write to and console each one."<br><br>Chaplain to give last rites<br><br>Father Gregoire Van Giang, a Singapore prison chaplain who assists Nguyen and other inmates, will join the former Melbourne schoolboy in prayers and walk with him from his cell to meet the hangman.<br><br><strong>Bless him....</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think we should make exceptions. What he did was wrong, and no excuse can change that. He smuggled close to 400g of heroin for god's sake. Enough for about 26000 doses, and enough for the law to kill him 20 times over. He deserves what he's getting. I mean, if you don't wanna die, but wanna smuggle drugs into a country that punishes drug smugglers by death, THEN DON'T SMUGGLE. Even if the case got taken to the ICJ, i doubt singapore would lose. Have you guys seen the arguments for smuggler btw? The reasons give for sparing him are weak. Could you imagine how many people he could've killed with all that heroin?</div>

All these things we have been able to do for him, but ultimately they were also for me and that's been selfish.<br><br>"I personally haven't had time to reflect. The battle (to save his life) is still on, but this week is going to be the last week that we will see him."<br><br>The women arrived with bundles of letters, CDs and photographs from Nguyen's friends. One wrote that he could "rest your heart because I'll make sure everyone who loves you will be taken care of after you are gone".<br><br>The political battle to save Nguyen continued on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Malta, where Prime Minister John Howard made what is almost certainly his last attempt on Saturday to persuade Singapore leader Lee Hsien Loong to stop the hanging.<br><br>Mr Howard asked Mr Lee if Singapore would accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in the Nguyen case, but to no avail. If Singapore refused to accept the jurisdiction of the court, "on all the legal advice available to the Government" Australia could not mount a case, Mr Howard said.<br><br>However, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer's office confirmed yesterday that the Federal Government was considering making a written request for Singapore to have the execution referred to the court.<br><br>"We are examining it," said a spokesman for Mr Downer. "It is certainly an option for consideration."<br><br>Nguyen's legal team wrote to Mr Downer yesterday seeking formalisation of the request, so at least Singapore would have to detail its stance in writing.<br><br>Mr Howard also warned Mr Lee of "lingering resentment on the part of many Australians" over the execution. Although he had said on Wednesday he would not raise the execution formally at the Commonwealth leaders summit, the Prime Minister said he had "quite a talk" with Mr Lee.<br></div>

One day, we might have more spats with other countries like China, Indonesia or Malaysia again.

            <div class='col-md body'>RSL opposes minute's silence for Nguyen<br>Email Print Normal font Large font November 28, 2005 - 4:20PM<br><br>RSL has protested about proposals for a minute's silence across the country on Friday to mark the execution of drug smuggler Nguyen Tuong Van in Singapore.<br><br>RSL National president Bill Crews said the special moment was reserved for commemorative services honouring those who gave their life while serving their country, normally in conflict.<br><br>"It's totally inappropriate to start using the moment's silence for any other circumstance," Major General Crews said.<br><br>"We are strongly opposed to a one-minute silence."<br><br>The RSL statement followed a call by Liberal MP Bruce Baird for Australians to observe a minute's silence at 9am (AEDT) on Friday "to express our compassion for this young Australian and our opposition to the imposition of this barbaric sentence".<br><br>Nguyen is almost certain to hang at dawn on Friday after the failure of numerous clemency appeals, including a fifth and final plea yesterday by Prime Minister John Howard.<br><br>The 25-year-old Melbourne man was caught with almost 400 grams of heroin at Changi airport in late 2002.<br><br>Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said today the Government may consider the request for an official minute's silence to mark Nguyen's hanging.<br><br>"Those are matters that people will look at in terms of considering the request but I wouldn't want to pre-empt any proper consideration of that," he told ABC radio.<br><br>Maj Gen Crews said the tribute had perhaps been used appropriately to honour those killed in terrorist attacks, such as the Bali bombings, or other major catastrophes.<br><br>"But extending it to individuals in quite different circumstances is not appropriate," he said.<br><br>He said that although it was a personal choice for those who wanted to honour Nguyen's hanging with a private silence, the tribute should not be used at any public events.<br><br>"I wouldn't prescribe what people should personally do, the RSL doesn't have a particular view about this case," he said.<br><br>"But we are opposed to calling the nation or the parliament to a moment's silence. We wouldn't even want it to be done publicly at all.<br><br>"People can make up their own mind what they want to do, but to make some some sort of national or parliamentary move to recognise the event is totally inappropriate."<br><br>The proposal for a minute of silence has been supported by church leaders and Greens Senator Bob Brown, with federal Labor deeming the gesture appropriate.<br><br>Earlier today Mr Howard, speaking to ABC radio from Malta where he has been attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), said he had not heard of a call for a minute's silence.<br><br>"Let me think about things like that. I don't want to pre-empt how I might respond. I've not heard of any such call," he said.<br><br>- AAP<br><br></div>
