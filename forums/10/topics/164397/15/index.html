However, as history has shown, we asian need to be disciplined and if it prove to be the right method and the people accepted it, then be it.  I will be disappointed if the state gives the right and freedom to smoke crack as it will definetely be a deterrent to the progress of our society.

I do not see drugtrafficking falling under either category.<br><br>Furthermore, bear in mind that drug trafficking is just the supply side of the drug problem.

I'd want to know why a person succumbed to drug addiction.<br><br>A drug smuggler is not in the same league as a murderer or a rapist.  And the reason for that is as you have pointed out.  The drug smuggler's victim has a clear choice in making himself a victim.  That makes a world of difference in terms of criminal culpability.<br><br>Yes, I agree that Nguyen was a fool.  He chose to dance with the devil in pale moonlight (?).  As much a fool as you would be if you trespassed upon my garden to pick my rambutan tree notwithstanding the warning signs posted outside that I have deathtraps all around.  But does that justify me taking such drastic steps to deter would-be rambutan thieves?<br><br>The concept of Justice goes beyond what is written on legislative paper.  There must be a defensible moral position behind each and every law.  Otherwise, the law will lose its legitimacy in the eyes of society.  One of the key tenets is that punishment must be commensurate with the crime.  Did the rambutan thief deserve to die?<br><br>It has sadly been sold to us here in Singapore that drug trafficking is a most heinous crime.  I don't agree, for the reasons that I have stated in my previous posts.  Drug trafficking is clearly not more heinous than, for example, rape.  Yet, that brutal twisted rapist who single-mindedly violated your daughter and destroyed her entire life for the sheer joy of it gets to live.  In the meantime, that fool of a Nguyen who thought only to make a quick buck goes to the gallows regardless of the circumstances compelling him to smuggle drugs.<br><br>Isn't it way past time that we revisit the law?</div>
