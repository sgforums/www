With the Singapore though, you are penalised if you choose to do things differently; seriously, read the letters sent to the press. The Penalization comes from society, and our type of society was built by our govt. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> It is easy to make an individual the target of blame of failure; it's not so easy so blame a mass of individuals for a common failure, especially in something that does not require cooperation of any sort.<br><br>3) Scandinavia is not a country; it is a group of countries, a region if you want to use that term. Scandinavia comprises Iceland, Finland, Denmark, Norway. You are most correct in stating that reports can say anything and that fiscal facts and figures can be fudged, but let me ask you, why don't you apply that to Singapore as zealously as you apply it to foreign countries and reputable international organizations e.g. the UN? Is that not hypocrisy? What makes Singapore so much better than Western countries? As the Chinese say, the fly before its own eye is bigger than the elephant in the next field. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>And if you choose to treat Australia as the fly, take heed: Flies never visit an egg that has no crack. (another Chinese proverb) FMI, why are you quoting an English proverb if you dislike the West so much? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>4) Please, making a country more humane does not deprive its people of their roots, or unique culture in any way. In fact, it could remind us of ancient values lost in this consumerism-ridden world, values that also happened to be shared by the West. As truth, ponder: He who governs by his moral excellence may be compared to the Pole star which abides in its place while all other stars bow towards it. Since this is a Chinese proverb, I guess it is related to our roots. part of them, at least. Asia, after all, is not homogeneous. The Indian is as similar to the Chinese as the White man is to the African.<br><br>5) Hmmm...<br><br>6) As the Chinese say, Men in the game are blind to what men looking on see clearly.<br><br>7) USA is presented to us as a country, but in reality it is merely a microcosm of the UN. And anyway, USA isn't the whole of the West.<br><br>8 ) The "Rest of the world"?  Perhaps the press in M'sia and China and perhaps Iran and NK, but certainly not the entire world. I would vouch that BBC would present a more optimistic view. And certainly, AI's demeanour would change quite a bit. The Australian press would certainly show Ngyuen's parents thanking not only their own government, but our government as well. The Aussie government for its part would certainly publish a formal letter of thanks. We are not living in the colonial era where the White Man reigned supreme.<br><br>9) I do recall the recent case of the journalist convicted of espionage in China...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anw, did you read my last post? They have been complaining; it's just that Singapore has not been listening.<br><br>10) The Malays say, "Hendak Seribu daya, tak Hentak seribu dalih." : "If you want something, you'll do a thousand things to obtain it.But if you don't want something, you'll give a thousand excuses to refrain from it". IMHO, Australia is not invading us or anything. I fail to see the connection national security has to this issue. Don't use the term too loosely.<br><br>the pikamaster <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div></blockquote>pikamaster,<br><br>To answer:<br><br>2) Isn't it true, everywhere is the same for blaming indivdual.  I guess this is the basis of human nature, as such, it requires jurisdictions, law and order for things to be set right in the begining.<br><br>3) It is a quite a blanket statements that Singapore is better than western countries.  Indeed Singapore is better than some western countries and it is only through strivation of progress, that Singapore can be even better.<br><br>As to your point of using western or chinese proverb, it has no relation as Singapore is a multicultural country and if the proverb is meant to convey the right message then it is acceptable.  What we say in chinese is also prick a needle and you see blood.<br><br>4) Not quite agree on the "The Indian is as similar to the Chinese as the White man is to the African." if you are comparing to ancient.  In history, Indian and Chinese has almost equal standing, respected each other as a territorial supremancy.  But the African has a history of being slavery to the white..so how can it be the same??<br><br>5) The other way round is that if you are not in the game, you will never know what is going on.<br><br>6) True, so that bring back to point 3, why aren't Singapore better than certain western country then.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">hmmm<br><br>10) No security threat la..it is more of respecting each other soverignity.<br><br></div>

And certain programs that work can also be applicable to other countries. Eventually, we will learn how the drug problem is spread, how it can be fought and prevented. This is important so we don't have to reinvent the heel."<br><br>Delegates will not be confined to just exchanging views, they will be making visits to Singapore's prison system, drug rehab centres and a halfway house.<br><br>- CNA /ls<br><br>We are not alone in fighting drugs...</div>
