Please don't make any exception if you want to condemn all countries using the death penalty.<br><br>"Criminals are human beings too"<br>To me, a hardcore criminal deserve no sympathy. They are not human beings at all, so they are depried of the rights to live in this world.<br><br>"Why vindicate our own faults by reference to others?"<br>What faults are you referring to? The death penalty itself? To see how "barbaric" we are and what trend the Sg government are following, we need comparison. So we compare with other countries. Strangely enough, there are still countries that practise death penalty. So if you wish to label Singapore as barbaric, by all means but please do lebal other countries that practise death penalty.<br><br>"Drug traffickers do not harm your drug addicted loved ones - your loved ones harm themselves"<br><br>If the source of drugs from drug traffickers is reduced, would the probability of your loved ones taking drugs be reduced? Is the rights of allowing a human being taking drugs more important, or (government) removing that right for the sake of potential drug addicts more important?<br><br>"There are varying degrees of criminality"<br>Of course. Singapore don't hang rapists or frauds, etc.<br><br>"Be careful not to let the government propaganda, which makes running the country easy for them, be used as a tool to deprive you of your individual rights"<br><br>They deprive me of living in a potentially full-of-drug environment (considering the fact that Singapore is a convenient stop for would-be drug traffickers) and I need to thank them, though I am not a fervent PAP supporter.<br><br>The government took away our rights to free-speech, etc when the PAP took over power. Their economy-first, society-above-society has helped transformed Singapore from third-world to first. If you want to know the effects of human rights and democracy for third-world countries, please do take a look at the Phillipnes and India.<br><br>Now Singapore has progressed rapidly. It is gradually allowing us more rights. Slowly but surely.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div></blockquote>Erwin_Rommel,<br><br>1) USA has a peculiar position, because each of its states have relative autonomy. In countries like France and Malaysia, the states are under tight central control, whereas USA is kind of a microcosm of the UN. Its "General Assembly" is the Congress and its "Security Council" is the Senate and White House. Half od the States in the USA have abolished the Death Penalty, whilst the other half (mostly the strong evangelical (protestant) states, the "Bible Belt" ) haven't.<br><br>2) This is a very extreme view. The Yin-Yang principle of Taoism, a philosophy misconstrued as a religion that is used as a front for practicing folk religion, states that in a pool of evil, there is always one drop of good, just as in a pool of good, there is always one drop of evil. History tells of many individuals who transformed radically after being forgiven.<br><br>But anyway, it is unfair to judge Ngyuen as a "hardcore criminal". To label one as hardcore, the person must have committed many crimes many times; In Ngyuen's case, it was his first time.<br><br>3) But the fact remains that the majority of countries in the world have abolished it in law, and a larger percentage have abolished it in practice (i.e. not executed  criminals for at least 10 years). And most of the countries with the Death Penalty - in fact, I believe USA is the only exception to this rule - are countries which one would not want to be associated with: Iran, Russia, Syria, Egypt, Sudan, DPRK, China (follow its economics, not its politics). These are countries which stifle political dissent to a horrendous degree, quell peaceful protests with military force, have constant ethnic and tribal conflicts, practice torture, and so on.<br><br>4) The source of drugs is not drug traffickers - it is the druglords.<br><br>5) Interestingly, rape and manslaughter have a more direct physical impact on the victims than drug-trafficking...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>6)<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>7) But we are no longer a third-world country now, and IMHO, most third-world countries do not have the Fundamental Freedoms anyhow.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Rights to what? bar-top dancing? Reverse-Bungee? These are not real rights. THese are only decorations.
