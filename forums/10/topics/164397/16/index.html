Blame TV,, PS, Xbox etc not drugs... if any of our novelists produce good work, I am sure that they could do it full time. Anything is possible if you set your mind on it. Maybe our so called budding novelists did not try hard enough? For every one of the JK Rowlings out there, do you know how many others did not make it or are still trying to make it? With the Singapore system, you may be in the system, but you can always choose to do things differently within the system, it is not that we don't get the opporutnity, but we don't or dare not take the opportunity. You cannot blame the government for all of your problems, life is what YOU MAKE OF IT. If you fail, you only have yourself to blame...<br><br>3) Why do you value the supposed social and cultural progress of the western nations so highly? The are actually regressing rather than progressing, with all the social problems that they have in their countries, drugs, prostitution, the dole.. etc. So far you can only list Scandinavia... but have you lived there? Anything can be written in a report, and fiscal facts and figures can always be fudged. You never know. What makes another place better than Singapore? As the saying goes, the grass is always greener on the other side.<br><br>If anything, the government has let us down by not remembering well our roots and our own unique culture that makes us who we are.<br><br>And remember the fine print can be read both ways...<br><br>4) Whether the government is doing a good or bad job is also a very subjective one. I think that they are doing the best they can, as with every world government. It is easy for us who do not run the country to just sit back and criticise. Try running a corporation, same sort of pressures on a smaller scale. Unless you are doing that now or have done that, I don't think that you have a clue.<br><br>But just look at the "mighty" usa, when hurricane Katrina hit, they reacted to it like a thrid world country, so much for western supremacy...<br><br>5) The issue is whether we should end this stingent policy ourselves, correct, but I guess that the government has decided that they don't want to. You miss the point still, even if we gave in now, and even though it was a voluntary choice on our part, it wouldn't look like that to the rest of the world.<br><br>If you are so at odds with Singapore, then if are living there, then may I suggest you migrate to Australia? Get real, which planet are you living on? It is tantamount to a Singaporean committing a crime in Australia and the Government of Singapore asking Australia to pardon him... same thing. Please don't bring in the but Australia does not have the death penalty thing... our laws were not created yesterday, they have been in place for so many years, many of our own citizens have died under this law as well, are you telling me that their lives are somehow worth less than Nguyen's?<br><br>6) It is not arrogance, it is called national security. </div></blockquote>breytonhartge,<br><br>1) Take your time to think over it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>2) The West does have a creative-arts aspect though, and a much more active one than a mere reading culture. With the Singapore though, you are penalised if you choose to do things differently; seriously, read the letters sent to the press. The Penalization comes from society, and our type of society was built by our govt. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> It is easy to make an individual the target of blame of failure; it's not so easy so blame a mass of individuals for a common failure, especially in something that does not require cooperation of any sort.<br><br>3) Scandinavia is not a country; it is a group of countries, a region if you want to use that term. Scandinavia comprises Iceland, Finland, Denmark, Norway. You are most correct in stating that reports can say anything and that fiscal facts and figures can be fudged, but let me ask you, why don't you apply that to Singapore as zealously as you apply it to foreign countries and reputable international organizations e.g. the UN? Is that not hypocrisy? What makes Singapore so much better than Western countries? As the Chinese say, the fly before its own eye is bigger than the elephant in the next field. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>And if you choose to treat Australia as the fly, take heed: Flies never visit an egg that has no crack. (another Chinese proverb) FMI, why are you quoting an English proverb if you dislike the West so much? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>4) Please, making a country more humane does not deprive its people of their roots, or unique culture in any way. In fact, it could remind us of ancient values lost in this consumerism-ridden world, values that also happened to be shared by the West. As truth, ponder: He who governs by his moral excellence may be compared to the Pole star which abides in its place while all other stars bow towards it. Since this is a Chinese proverb, I guess it is related to our roots. part of them, at least. Asia, after all, is not homogeneous. The Indian is as similar to the Chinese as the White man is to the African.<br><br>5) Hmmm...<br><br>6) As the Chinese say, Men in the game are blind to what men looking on see clearly.<br><br>7) USA is presented to us as a country, but in reality it is merely a microcosm of the UN. And anyway, USA isn't the whole of the West.<br><br>8 ) The "Rest of the world"?  Perhaps the press in M'sia and China and perhaps Iran and NK, but certainly not the entire world. I would vouch that BBC would present a more optimistic view. And certainly, AI's demeanour would change quite a bit. The Australian press would certainly show Ngyuen's parents thanking not only their own government, but our government as well. The Aussie government for its part would certainly publish a formal letter of thanks. We are not living in the colonial era where the White Man reigned supreme.<br><br>9) I do recall the recent case of the journalist convicted of espionage in China...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anw, did you read my last post? They have been complaining; it's just that Singapore has not been listening.<br><br>10) The Malays say, "Hendak Seribu daya, tak Hentak seribu dalih." : "If you want something, you'll do a thousand things to obtain it.But if you don't want something, you'll give a thousand excuses to refrain from it". IMHO, Australia is not invading us or anything. I fail to see the connection national security has to this issue. Don't use the term too loosely.<br><br>the pikamaster <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Right now the fuss about her is that the moment she was released, she dropped the Muslim clothing and switched to a cropped tank top and tight jeans.  A lot of people here are saying that she's a hypocrite and that she's insulted Islam.  On top of that, a lot of trashy publications are offering her money for her story, and there's public objection to her making profits from this fracas.<br><br>I don't think anybody's giving her a hero's welcome, and the media coverage she's been given is more a case of public outrage and disgust.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by pikamaster:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: red;">Pikamaster, </span><br><br>1) Take your time to think over it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>2) The West does have a creative-arts aspect though, and a much more active one than a mere reading culture. With the Singapore though, you are penalised if you choose to do things differently; seriously, read the letters sent to the press. The Penalization comes from society, and our type of society was built by our govt. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> It is easy to make an individual the target of blame of failure; it's not so easy so blame a mass of individuals for a common failure, especially in something that does not require cooperation of any sort.<br><br><span style="color: red;">And we asians don't? Just check japan, china, korea, malaysia, thailand etc... please... </span><br><br>3) Scandinavia is not a country; it is a group of countries, a region if you want to use that term. Scandinavia comprises Iceland, Finland, Denmark, Norway. You are most correct in stating that reports can say anything and that fiscal facts and figures can be fudged, but let me ask you, why don't you apply that to Singapore as zealously as you apply it to foreign countries and reputable international organizations e.g. the UN? Is that not hypocrisy? What makes Singapore so much better than Western countries? As the Chinese say, the fly before its own eye is bigger than the elephant in the next field. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>And if you choose to treat Australia as the fly, take heed: Flies never visit an egg that has no crack. (another Chinese proverb) FMI, why are you quoting an English proverb if you dislike the West so much? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="color: red;">I never said I disliked the west, I just don't agree with some of their policies and don't think that they have a right to interfere with our laws. It is like singapore changing a law in Australia to suit one of our citizens. </span><br><br>4) Please, making a country more humane does not deprive its people of their roots, or unique culture in any way. In fact, it could remind us of ancient values lost in this consumerism-ridden world, values that also happened to be shared by the West. As truth, ponder: He who governs by his moral excellence may be compared to the Pole star which abides in its place while all other stars bow towards it. Since this is a Chinese proverb, I guess it is related to our roots. part of them, at least. Asia, after all, is not homogeneous. The Indian is as similar to the Chinese as the White man is to the African.<br><br><span style="color: red;">And how have the westerners governed by moral excellence? There is no clear proof that they are any better than us in their political decisions. Just have a look at the social problems rampant in the west. including the european countries, not just america. Please remember that in our roots, the penalty for some crimes is death... </span><br><br>5) Hmmm...<br><br>6) As the Chinese say, Men in the game are blind to what men looking on see clearly.<br><br><span style="color: red;">So we both see clearly. there are always two view points, we can go on about this forever... neither one is absolutely right and neither one is absolutely wrong, this is all subjective opinion informed by our individual life experiences. I think that Nguyen should pay the penalty, unfortunately, it is death, would you not also agree that he should be punished for violating our laws? lets say the penalty was life in prision, would you be making so much noise then? You think otherwise, but neither of us have an absolute. All these are only viewpoints on a long continuum of what could be. There is support for both, but what is ultimately best for our country? We have elected the Singaporean Govt, the PAP for so long, if you don't want them to lead us and you think the oppositon are credible enough, why don't so many singaporeans make the choice to give the opposition a go? People in singpore have it good, inspite some of the inconveniences we may have to put up with like censorship etc... but I think that many Singporeans are not willing to gamble what the current government provides for a slim chance at a maybe that the opposition seems to always hint at, after all, politicians are the worst crooks right? They give so many promises, but how many are actually fulfilled? The PAP has a track record, you cannot deny that. Unless you have lived outside of singpore in another country for a significant period, you cannot say that singapore is really that bad or good can you?  </span><br><br>7) USA is presented to us as a country, but in reality it is merely a microcosm of the UN. And anyway, USA isn't the whole of the West.<br><br><span style="color: red;">But it is the model that people think of when the west is mentioned... </span><br><br>8 ) The "Rest of the world"?  Perhaps the press in M'sia and China and perhaps Iran and NK, but certainly not the entire world. I would vouch that BBC would present a more optimistic view. And certainly, AI's demeanour would change quite a bit. The Australian press would certainly show Ngyuen's parents thanking not only their own government, but our government as well. The Aussie government for its part would certainly publish a formal letter of thanks. We are not living in the colonial era where the White Man reigned supreme.<br><br>9) I do recall the recent case of the journalist convicted of espionage in China...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anw, did you read my last post? They have been complaining; it's just that Singapore has not been listening.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Since when? This has only increased in the last few weeks. Did you not read, the Aust Fed Police have said that Nguyen did not come forward with anything... so there goes that theory... </span><br><br>10) The Malays say, "Hendak Seribu daya, tak Hentak seribu dalih." : "If you want something, you'll do a thousand things to obtain it.But if you don't want something, you'll give a thousand excuses to refrain from it". IMHO, Australia is not invading us or anything. I fail to see the connection national security has to this issue. Don't use the term too loosely.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Hence we don't want drugs in our country. So we do much to achieve this. </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">brey </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div></blockquote><span style="color: #444444;"></span><span style="color: #444444;"></span><span style="color: #444444;"></span><span style="color: #444444;"></span><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>
