What we are fighting now is Nation soverignity and it can never and will never be override.  If we give ways, where and when ever will Singapore be able to stand up again.  All our 40 years effort of nation building will be wasted.  We can sympathise but cannot condone something that is harmful to the nation and we have to answer to the people if our soverignity is under question.<br><br></div></blockquote>I think there is actually a lot of academic discourse on the distinction between human and social rights.  But whatever it is, I think there is clearly a difference between the State being sanctioned to mandatorily mete out the death sentence and the State giving the people the right and freedom to smoke crack.<br><br>As for the sovereignty issue, I agree that we should not give in to this specific request.  We should instead re-look our laws on drugtrafficking.  Drug abuse is no longer, and unlikely to be, a rampant problem in Singapore.  The existing punishment reflects either a medieval mindset in our society and/ or a lazy one.</div>
