To them, a lengthy sentence in Singapore prison is far better because a meal down there is a thousand times better off than starving in their homeland. If Singapore does not cane theese illegal immigrans and set a stern deterrent to other potential illegal immigrants, can you imagine how many hndreds or even thousands of them would try to enter Singapore illegally?

But I still believe these people are the minority.<br><br>2) Maybe I should explain clearly. Singapore's location as a convenient stopover for transit means we could be vulnerable to drug problems. Please do remember that the drug trade is rampant and Singapore has absolutely no control of this trade outside her jurisdication. What the government can only do is to prevent the drugs from entering Singapore.<br><br>3) So is it alright for everybody to commit any type of crimes, since first-time offenders should always be pardoned?

Mr Howard has done everything he could to help Ngyuen without damaging bilateral ties. Most Ngyuen's supporters feel Mr Howard has not done enough.

Please do correct me if I am wrong. So is that a clash of values?<br><br>The main preachers of Human Rights-- USA also have capital punishment. Contradicting? Furthermore, their law and order is something that is left much to be desired. Why did a large number of Americans agreed with Singapore's stance that Michael Fay should be caned?<br><br>The Human Rights Declaration is definitely a good thing. But can it really be applied to all human beings, knowing that there will be a few bad sheep who could be potentially cold-blooded criminals? It is sometimes better to put the good of society above that of the individual to protect the majority. Maybe that's why the USA still have capital punishment.</div>

Their phlight is definitely heart-breaking and they are mostly forced by circumstances outside their control.<br><br>But remember, the Singapore government should not show compassion to them. The only message sent to would-be illegal immigrants would be that getting caught would just merely be deportation if your argument is to be valid. This will only serve as an encouragement that being caught for illegally entering Singapore is a minor offence. There should be a sterner way to warn would-be illegal immigrants.

Forumners in theage.com forum has been divided: Those who supported Singapore's stance and those who condemned. I won't post those colourful words here. But I still believe these people are the minority.<br><br>2) Maybe I should explain clearly. Singapore's location as a convenient stopover for transit means we could be vulnerable to drug problems. Please do remember that the drug trade is rampant and Singapore has absolutely no control of this trade outside her jurisdication. What the government can only do is to prevent the drugs from entering Singapore.<br><br>3) So is it alright for everybody to commit any type of crimes, since first-time offenders should always be pardoned? These crimes could involve the smuggling of drugs to drug addicts, who have the potential to create chaos in society. Or pardoning criminals who commit crimes against your love-ones?<br><br>4) and 5)<br><br>Seriously, this entire episode is political. Mr Howard has done everything he could to help Ngyuen without damaging bilateral ties. Most Ngyuen's supporters feel Mr Howard has not done enough. Knowing fully well that Mr Howard has done what he could possibly do, their opposition members launch stinging remarks at us like "rogue Chinese city port" or threatening to boycott, etc. Is that a well-calculated political move?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Maybe that's why they are still the opposition.<br><br>So was the outcry by the Phillipines over the hanging of Flor contamplacion a political move?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Erwin-Rommel,<br><br>Good to see that you are cool-headed after all. *PHEW* (JIC FYI, I don't like Mr J's attitude either, even though I am an abolitionist)<br><br>1) 46% ain't a minority if u consider the 7% which are undecided. 1% diff ain't much.<br><br>2) Perhaps if we took a tougher stand against Myanmar and Cambodia's opium production... It's not that we totally have *no* control; it's just that we like being seen as the weaklings so that we can justify our policies. For example, I was watching Discovery Channel's documentary on the History of Singapore on Sunday. It reminded viewers that Singapore justifies NS with the claim of rogue Muslim neighbours, when in actual fact the real military threat to us is rather low.<br><br>Similarly, did u read TODAY yesterday? There was a commentary which pointed out that Australia was as concerned about stopping the drug trade as Singapore is. The Aussies agreed that Ngyuen should be punished, just as they agreed McCrea should be punished. What they - a significant 46% of them at least - objected to was the form of punishment. Your statement kind of implies - maybe unintentionally - that Australians wished Ngyuen to be set free. Not even the most extreme abolitionist would ask for that.<br><br>By just siezing the drugs and jailing Ngyuen for life, we would equally have kept the drugs from harming other innocents.<br><br>3) There is nothing about pardoning the criminals here; you , like other retentionists around here, blow the issue out of scope.<br><br>4) That comment wasn't very nice, but neither have our comments of the Australians been either. Although I concede that Mr Robinson could have used a more diplomatic phrasing, nonetheless we mustn't forget that "rogue" (or a synonym of it) were what PAP and its supporters (not all Singaporeans, as retentionists like to generalize) used against Australia; I mean, look at this forum alone.<br><br>And anyway, Mr Robinson wasn't the only person who condemned the death penalty. The Pope himself wrote a letter to Mr Nathan pleading for Ngyuen's clemency, and certainly the Pope is (hopefully) in no way politically-motivated, as he is representing the values of his faith. Please differentiate the Australians from the Australian government, ruling or opposition.<br><br>5) Nope, it wasn't a political move, just as this wasn't a political move. Singaporeans need to learn how to differentiate between "social" and "political", although politics is a subset of sociology.<br><br>the pikamaster</div>
