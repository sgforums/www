Those that live in cities often earn a fair bit, like those working in banks in New York.<br><br>In some sense of the word, CPF is the most cost effective solution for a government that wants to spend as little as possible on its citizens, while maintaining a huge treasury for its own uses. How the money is used is a good question, and the opposition has never managed to get answers. It is quite likely to be pooled with the money that GLC and Temasek use. Our reserves are estimated to be 100-330 billion in total. I doubt all the surpluses will ever account for that.</div>

Where does it come from? Our yearly surpluses aren't so large to fill up 330 billion in a couple of decades.</div>
