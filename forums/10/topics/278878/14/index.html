You do not care what the fund does as long as it makes a good return to you. Lets say you invest $100million in the fund. The fund manager invests it in a portfolio of 2 stocks with equal weights. Stock A appreciates and rises from $50 million to $90 million. However stock B depreciates from $50million to $30 million. The value of your total portfolio of 2 stocks are now worth $120 million. Having made a 20% return on your capital,  do you fault the fund manager of having lost $20million on stock B ?<br><br>This scenario is possible. It is also possible that Temasek is a sham. Its up to believe what you want.</div></blockquote>The distinction between the example you cited above and Temasek stems from the source of its funds.<br><br>Honestly, if your family had a thrillion bucks to spare and chose to invest blindly and burn a couple of billions, what business is it of anyone to even question your course of action? That said, are you for a moment suggesting an investment vehicle that's effectively funded by public money is actually exonerated from the same degree of accountability as it would be in the case of private investors?</div>
