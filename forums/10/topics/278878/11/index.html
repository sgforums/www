The fact that they're in the midst of enforcing mandatory annuity purchase just drives home this point.<br><br>A pension, by commonplace definitions and comprehensible consensus, is a stipend handed out periodically for life. This regime merely disburses what is your money till your balance in the state-orchaestrated scam is exhausted - after which, you're left to fend for yourself. Suffice to say, the gnomes who implemented this policy have just awakened to the fact that such a scam wouldn't adequately cover the basic living expenses for an average person who lives to an age commensurating with the average lifespan for this regime - needless to say, to cover the innate flaw in the scam which is nothing more than forced extortion, they have devised the grand scheme of making the purchase of annuities compulsory.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

This regime merely disburses what is your money till your balance in the state-orchaestrated scam is exhausted - after which, you're left to fend for yourself. Suffice to say, the gnomes who implemented this policy have just awakened to the fact that such a scam wouldn't adequately cover the basic living expenses for an average person who lives to an age commensurating with the average lifespan for this regime - needless to say, to cover the innate flaw in the scam which is nothing more than forced extortion, they have devised the grand scheme of making the purchase of annuities compulsory.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Quite frankly, the annuities scheme is extraneous.
