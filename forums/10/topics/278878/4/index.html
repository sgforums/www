            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The economy sizzles quarter after quarter.</strong><br><br>However, this doesn't translate to more wealth for Singaporeans<br><br>The middle class has stagnated for years. The lower income are struggling to cope with inflation. Only the rich get richer because these are the highly paid professionals and businessmen.<br><br>Thr rich poor divide is evident in all developed countries but Singapore is worsening at a rate worse than many other contemporaries.<br><br><strong>There are more jobs created year after year.</strong><br><br>The govt were questioned on the details of the report. How many jobs went to Singaporeans and how many to foreigners. Till now, there has been no response.<br><br>Something to hide? Most likely, Singapore's population has been growing at a staggering pace for a few years now, one of the fastest among developed nations. This is due to the massive influx of foreigners who were invited here to drive the economy.<br><br>To sum it all up, it seems that the economy's performance and Singapore's world standing matters more to this governance than domestic priorities.<br><br>It is foolhardy to expect opposition parties to come up with ideas when these suggestions are either "stolen" or dismissed as rubbish. Opposition has only 2 seats out of 88 in parliament; the voice is akin to a squeak. Only when the presence has grown, then may they broach concrete proposals. Who then can blame that opposition can only criticise as their roles at this stage are only effective to this extent?<br><br>Criticism may give many the impression that it is armchair talk but at least it keeps the govt on their toes. Just like the booming Singapore political blogosphere which ensures that the govt is accountable to us citizens.<br><br>Even PAP did not have much of an idea too when Singapore "suddenly" achieved its independence. "Merdeka" was never expected nor desired. However, economic experts were hired and Singapore started off on the right track then.<br><br>Opposition should be given their chance when voting time comes.<br><br></div>
