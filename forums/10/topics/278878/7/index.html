So i thought you might want to read WP's Manifesto and make a view for yourself. Personally, i feel that the question of yours can't be answered.<br><br>With regard to the manifesto i think that it is a good effort albeit too vague. There are a few proposals that run concurrent with PAP ideals as well...like the attraction of international talent and the development of the finance industry, including attraction of funds of high net worth individuals.<br><br>I would like to see them work along these lines. I'm pretty bored of people saying that Singaporeans should vote for the opposition because PAP blah blah blah. I'm waiting for the day that maybe people can say that vote for WP because of blah blah blah.<br><br>Whether the economy will be good or bad is anybodys guess. Chee Soon Juan has said PAP reneged on its election promises as the economy was bad post 98 till 2003. Raymond Lim asks if we have progressed from 5 years ago. Why compare a period where there were external factors like the Asian economic crisis and SARS ? I must admit that we were not raped when the things were not looking good for the region and when globally things picked up, we moved along as well. Guess that is the minimum we expect.<br><br>As for the original topic of the thread, keep yourself updated on the WP's manifesto and ideals. Maybe one day you'll find something you like. Perhaps there are other things outside the economy that will make you want to vote for the opposition.</div>
