MOF owns Temasek by means of being it's shareholders. Theoretically Temasek is charged with investing that seed money/assets it was given. It is possible that MOF does not influence Temasek's decisions in anyway even though they are the shareholders and HC is LHL wife.<br><br>Now imagine you are an investor with heaps of cash and entrust a fund to invest it for you. You do not care what the fund does as long as it makes a good return to you. Lets say you invest $100million in the fund. The fund manager invests it in a portfolio of 2 stocks with equal weights. Stock A appreciates and rises from $50 million to $90 million. However stock B depreciates from $50million to $30 million. The value of your total portfolio of 2 stocks are now worth $120 million. Having made a 20% return on your capital,  do you fault the fund manager of having lost $20million on stock B ?<br><br>This scenario is possible. It is also possible that Temasek is a sham. Its up to believe what you want.</div>
