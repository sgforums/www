              <p>An egalitarian society can be defined as one which looks after its poor and treats them with dignity, actively discourages all forms of discrimination, widely shares the benefits of rising national productivity, allows its workers an adequate say in the workplace on matters affecting their wellbeing, and strives hard to achieve 'equality of starting opportunity' (i.e. where income and quality of life differentials in the market place are due overwhelmingly to differences in personal capacities, skills, attitudes to risk, motivation - rather than to low parental family income, inadequate education, poor location or inadequate access to affordable public services).</p>

              <p><br>Does the Singapore Government treat drug abusers any better - when the drug abusers are labelled as "drug pusgers" in the same way that the noisy pussy has preferred to call them ?</p>
              <p>With a smaller land mass compared to Australia, what has the Singapore Government done with the vast BILLIONS collected from Singaporeans over the years in looking after Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Has the Singapore Government built hospitals and offer Singaporeans the same standards of medical services that Singaporeans can afford with the meagre cash reserves in the Family ?</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have been forced by politically designed circumstances to depend on the State for all essential services that are making these essential services the CASH COWS to generate even more revenues for the Government.</p>
              <p>Instead of plowing the accumulated cash reserves to provide more affordable services to Singaporeans, the Government had instead lost US$100 BILLION to bail out failed overseas banks, private corporations and dubious investments.</p>
              <p>The US$100 BILLION if returned to the 3.5 MILLION Singaporean Citizens - will mean that each Singapore adult and child would have received US$28,571.43 each.</p>
              <p>Instead, older Singaporeans are forced to look for alternative means to spend their twilight years looking for alternatives that include living in old folks home in Johor, young Singaporeans have to delay marriage and starting families, middle-age Singaporeans have to work even harder to find smart ways to make ends meet - while costs for Singaporeans continue to rise even as Government make loud announcements of charges being lowered.</p>
              <p>Have you checked your utility bills that are supposed to enjoy a lowering of utility charges ? Quite a few have complained that despite electrical charges that were supposed to see a reduction of at least 7% - had instead seen their bills climbed even when the best efforts have been made to reduce electrical use.</p>
              <p>It is disgusting when the noisy pussy throw mud at a third country when ignoring the mud that Singaporeans are forced to live with in our own backyard.</p>
              <p>The noisy pussy must be having more mud in his backyard than everyone else here, as seen in his generosity in slinging all his mud at Oz.</p>

              <p>It's equivalent to somebody posting "Do you think that Singapore can be a Fair Society" and some moron posting "<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/420957/1/.html">Deaths from Rojak in Geylang Serai Food Stall</a>", "<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/421088/1/.html">Singaporean Woman having Sex with 13 y.o</a>." and "<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/420991/1/.html">Two Brothers Sentenced to Death for Murder</a>".</p>

              <p><br>Sensor lighting is debatable, though. The bulbs spoilt more easily and have to be replaced more often. So is the energy saved by the sensor lighting offset by the energy from manufacturing the bulbs you have to replace?</p>

              <p><br>Objectively that is not enough to go on with. Can you be more detailed, because you say family of 4 but you say 2 of them went to stay in dorms but the end result is 2 adults and a nine year old kid.</p>
              <p>Without a full understanding or observation of their daily usage it's impossible to make the conclusion that 2 adult + 1 child would neccesarily = less power consumption.</p>
              <p>Computers for one are massive energy hogs, eating up more power the more advanced they are (To feed the power supply for the graphics card, coolers..etc).</p>
              <p>Also, the placement of furnitures play a part because it is possible to make an argument that their current house arrangement makes it difficult to shut off the main power outlet than their previous furniture arrangement. This is significant, because i cut off $20 off my bills by shutting down everything reachable.</p>
              <p>But these are only different ways of looking at the scenario, it's certainly better than just the HDB is out to get us.</p>
              <p>Not saying there isn't the possibility, but i think i can confidently say i'm more objective than you right now.</p>

              <p>The following was from details received from a close associate planning to embark on a research to determine if there are any discriminatory rates applied to different household types - as this measure has so often been used by this Government.</p>
              <p>In 2008, the household utility bill for a Family of four living in an HDB Maisonette was approximately S$300+ to S400 a month before the 2 teenages decided to live on Campus.</p>
              <p>The bulk of the bill was made up of the electrical billings.</p>
              <p>With the recent revisions to the Electricity Rate, and with two teenagers already living in hostels away from home even on weekends, it is surprising that electricity bills should rise by another 15% to 30% - despite the best efforts to minimise the use of electrical appliances, and even shutting down those normally placed on stand-by with the red light glowing.</p>
              <p>The most common item that is left running in the home is the Refrigerator, and even if the largest unit is purchased its consumption, the compressor motor for a domestic unit cannot exceed 0.75HP.</p>
              <p>Light bulbs was said to have been changed to the energy saving types since these were first available in Singapore back in the mid-1980s.</p>
              <p>Water-heaters are the instantaneous heater, and not the electric-guzzling water storage heater type - and the electrical rating is no more then 1.0kW heaters.</p>
              <p>The shower can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 20 minutes depending on how fastidious the person is - with the actual water not running all the time.</p>
              <p>Can Desk-top Computers be huge electric-guzzling monsters when the transformer is no more then 500watts, and the LCD screen is rated at no more then 68watts when turned on and only 2watts on Stand-by ?</p>
              <p>The largest Plasma TV at 65" consume about 600+Watts, and a 42" LCD unit consumes only 300+Watts - usage per day is on average 10 hours.</p>
              <p>On most evenings, the kitchen light consisting of one energy saving flourescent tube 45Watts is left on for no more then 4 hours.</p>
              <p>Living and Dining Rooms consisting of two energy saving light bulb consuming 40watts - while producing 100watt luminence - is left on for 5 hours.</p>
              <p>Lighting in two bedrooms consist of only three desk lamps with energy saving bulbs, each consuming 18watts - with one turned on for 8 hours daily, and another for about 3 hours on average.</p>
              <p>Airconditioning Unit - consisting of 1+3 Model - is turned on for 8 to 10 hours daily, with the adult room turned on for the longer hour.</p>
              <p>Hot water kettle rated at 1.0kW is used twice a day - and water filled into a non-heated vacuum flask.</p>
