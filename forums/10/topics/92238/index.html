US president is not dictatorial or abusing his position as such.<br><br>Remember that US president may not do many other stuff to bypass their systems as due processes are well laid down. At the top, he is held accountable by constitution to do or not to do certain things. This is called accountability and transparency.<br><br>In many other systems, all are grey areas allowing parties in power to interpret everything according to policies and whims and fancies.

Can't see how the american democracy can help.<br><br></div></blockquote>I suppose there are many views and opinions as to which democracy model Singapore should best follow.<br><br>One thing is for certain, if we do not base our democracy on something basic and fundamental we will not be getting anywhere.<br><br>The basic and fundamental values we can work for which I believe few will dispute are: (a) election of leaders by popular votes, (b) checks and balances (c) Independent judiciary not controlled or beholden to the executive and a professionally reliable civil service (d) Accountability and transparency in all policy and executory processes (e) rule of laws (f) caring and compassion attitude towards the people (g) equality of opportunity (i) Doable work processes. (j) entrepreneurship (k) basic rights and freedoms of citizens enshrined in constitution etc.<br><br>If we are not going to anchor to some reliable and holistic democratic practices and system of US which one is the most suitable?<br><br>Indonesia and Philippines, Korea or Japan might have some variations of their own but basically I believe theirs are anchored at least to a large extent on US model. Never mind about British or Australian or some other which might not follow US in exact manner but the fundamental feature of election, rights and others are all present.<br><br>In our many discussions, too many people jump to the conclusion that US's democracy is flawed. Can they say which is better? If not, why can't we adopt US as model and reserve the right to modify certain features and make them accountable and transparent. Have our system in Singapore achieved all these desirable accountable and transparent processes? Have we tried not to interfere the working of basic tenets of democracy by making them work better? Have we tried not to sue political opponents for defamation because this is like a pandora box. One can sue opponents and when opponents got the power they will sue again their opponents.<br><br>Look at the whole picture of democracy from such wider perspective and arrive at our model to benefit all and correct past errors. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Self-righteous democracies<br>By Phar Kim Beng<br><br>MR BILL Clinton made the promotion of democracy the centrepiece of his foreign policy when he was president of the United States. President George W. Bush, especially after Sept 11, did the same, looking to democracy as a means of reforming Arab/Muslim societies and awakening them to their faults.<br><br>But do democracies admit their errors? Do they confront unsavoury aspects of their own past?<br><br>British historian Eric Hobsbawm once said that the 20th century was an age of extremes. Western democracies, however, have hardly given any thought to the destruction they have wrought in World War I, World War II and the Cold War.<br><br>When asked by throngs of journalists 'if he slept well' after ordering the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, US president Harry Truman, for instance, answered in the affirmative, without even batting an eyelid.<br><br>Across the Atlantic, as World War II came to an end, Winston Churchill could counsel magnanimity even as he tried to restore the status quo ante, with Britain retaining its colonial empire.<br><br>What is amazing about the US or Britain is not only their unwillingness to confront their unsavoury pasts, but also their ability to remain innocent despite that past. The capacity of democracies to repeatedly claim innocence is one reason why their histories often have an aseptic quality.<br><br>America, for instance, almost obliterated Native Americans, both before its War of Independence and after. Americans, however, remain effectively oblivious of this.<br><br>In the case of Britain, it controlled at one stage up to 80 per cent of the world's surface. Colonialism is still seen as a sign of English genius, not a cruel infliction on non-Western peoples.<br><br>What is at issue here is not self-censorship. It is certainly not a case of enforced amnesia, with textbooks rewritten to whitewash or erase an unsavoury history. The nasty facts of history can be found - in libraries, government archives and academic publications - if citizens were so inclined to find them.<br><br>Rather, what repeatedly distinguishes these democracies is their conviction, in the teeth of all the evidence, that their motives are always pure.<br><br>As Professor Richard Falk, an international law don at Princeton University, once wrote: 'One of the most harmful features of global dominance, Western-style, is the perpetual rediscovery of its own innocence'.<br><br>No amount of abuse and exploitation, however catastrophic its consequences for non-Western victims, seems able to erode this sense of innocence.<br><br>There are perfectly logical reasons why democratic leaders, as well as the laity, can feel unremorseful about their past. For one, democracy is a brilliant instrument for reclaiming innocence.<br><br>Though democracy as such does not necessarily lead to moral prevarication, it allows for more than one idea to prevail at any one time. Its very ability to allow for a contest of ideas and policies makes it easy for it to abandon ideas and decisions that turn out to be wrong or tragic.<br><br>The very ability of democracies to criticise and dismiss their own errors enables them to also emerge from moral crises smelling like the proverbial rose.<br><br>In the case of the US, charges of war atrocities in Vietnam or Korea - or even in World War II, the 'good' war - for example, failed to dent its mantle. Each president, like every generation of Americans, can begin with a new slate. Policy errors and tragic mistakes can be ascribed to one particular political segment, and dismissed.<br><br>Still, there is a downside to the sense of perpetual innocence that democracies exhibit. When such a beatific belief shapes the mindset of the decision-makers in democracies, democracy can quickly congeal into a system that feeds on its own righteousness.<br><br>The war on terror, for example, though justly prosecuted to eliminate evil - in the words of President Bush, to rid the international community of vengeful 'malcontents and murderers' - ignores the root causes of terrorism.<br><br>As such, the negative consequences of US policy in the Middle East - in particular, America's one-sided support of Israel and its support of oppressive Arab regimes - are ignored. Americans, convinced of their moral purity, cannot acknowledge their guilt.<br><br>Their claim of innocence renders them oblivious to America's past foreign policy derelictions in the region, making Washington almost unable to change its present behaviour.<br><br>The writer is an analyst at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies in Kuala Lumpur.<br></div>

Colonialism is still seen as a sign of English genius, not a cruel infliction on non-Western peoples.<br><br>What is at issue here is not self-censorship. It is certainly not a case of enforced amnesia, with textbooks rewritten to whitewash or erase an unsavoury history. The nasty facts of history can be found - in libraries, government archives and academic publications - if citizens were so inclined to find them.<br><br>Rather, what repeatedly distinguishes these democracies is their conviction, in the teeth of all the evidence, that their motives are always pure.<br><br>As Professor Richard Falk, an international law don at Princeton University, once wrote: 'One of the most harmful features of global dominance, Western-style, is the perpetual rediscovery of its own innocence'.<br><br>No amount of abuse and exploitation, however catastrophic its consequences for non-Western victims, seems able to erode this sense of innocence.<br><br>There are perfectly logical reasons why democratic leaders, as well as the laity, can feel unremorseful about their past. For one, democracy is a brilliant instrument for reclaiming innocence.<br><br>Though democracy as such does not necessarily lead to moral prevarication, it allows for more than one idea to prevail at any one time. Its very ability to allow for a contest of ideas and policies makes it easy for it to abandon ideas and decisions that turn out to be wrong or tragic.<br><br>The very ability of democracies to criticise and dismiss their own errors enables them to also emerge from moral crises smelling like the proverbial rose.<br><br>In the case of the US, charges of war atrocities in Vietnam or Korea - or even in World War II, the 'good' war - for example, failed to dent its mantle. Each president, like every generation of Americans, can begin with a new slate. Policy errors and tragic mistakes can be ascribed to one particular political segment, and dismissed.<br><br>Still, there is a downside to the sense of perpetual innocence that democracies exhibit. When such a beatific belief shapes the mindset of the decision-makers in democracies, democracy can quickly congeal into a system that feeds on its own righteousness.<br><br>The war on terror, for example, though justly prosecuted to eliminate evil - in the words of President Bush, to rid the international community of vengeful 'malcontents and murderers' - ignores the root causes of terrorism.<br><br>As such, the negative consequences of US policy in the Middle East - in particular, America's one-sided support of Israel and its support of oppressive Arab regimes - are ignored. Americans, convinced of their moral purity, cannot acknowledge their guilt.<br><br>Their claim of innocence renders them oblivious to America's past foreign policy derelictions in the region, making Washington almost unable to change its present behaviour.<br><br>The writer is an analyst at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies in Kuala Lumpur.<br></div></blockquote>This article was probably written to serve Malaysian Prime Minister's foreign Policy of the time - lambasting of US as a power-crazed western country.<br><br>If Western/US democracy was at fault, the Malaysian and many Asian leaders would not have introduced so many features of western democracy to run their countries.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew had in the beginning adopted socialism but had abandoned it in favor of Westminister System of democracy. Westminister and US democracies are not at fault for western countries's hegemony of Asian countries.<br><br>What is at fault is the ability of people under democratic system to make advances in science and technology. So Mr. Phar might be wrong in his underlying assumptions that democracies were responsible for suffering of people all over the world.<br><br>Hitler was not a democrat but a dictator. He started the world war I and at the end had to be stopped by democratic alliances. Democracy therefore had done the rest of the world a big favor.<br><br>Japanese joined World War II with the ambition to colonise Asian countries like Malaysia and Indo-China and China. Japanese was not a democratic countries at that time but democracy came to the rescue of Malaysia but dropping the H-bomb that stopped the war. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir should thank USA president Mr. Harry Truman instead of getting Mr. Phar to write to criticise US democracy.<br><br>The current topic was about whether Singapore should emulate US democracy as posted earlier. There were many fundamental goodness and advantages as opposed to small price that such a system has to pay - like individualism, freedom to sue government or fellow citizens and power plays within the system.<br><br>Power play may exist in any systems whether democratic or otherwise. Individualism may generate a certain problem but all these are far better than govenance based on a few men who called themselves leaders with bigger brains or talents who might not be held accountable at the end leading to great suffering. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Qitai,<br><br>If Singapore is to make further progress, it has to refine and improve its past performances in all areas.<br><br>To your question : "not willing to define democracy", I have posted a new thread "Definition of True Democracy" just a while ago. I hope all Singaporeans are not divided into pro- or anti-government groups and will give their true contributions from the bottom of their heart (sincerity) without any ulterior motives or private agendas.<br><br>By now, the government should realize that people are not antagonistic when they speak up or give critical views.

            <div class='col-md body'>There's actually a lot of pork barrel politics going on behind the scenes. With the high costs of running election and re-election campaigns, most candidates running for congress, the senate, for president etc end up receiving funding from special interest groups/lobbyists e.g. oil companies, the NRA,  with the understanding that they will work to further the interests of whoever funds their campaigns and if they do a good job during their terms, they can count on continued financial support from them to fund their re-election.<br><br>The ad campaigns Bush and Kerry have been running against each other look rather nasty to me. Previous elections have seen similar tactics. Both sides try their best to dig up dirt on each other and more often than not find plenty to launch smear campaigns on each other.<br><br>BTW, I've always been under the impression that the US is a constitutional republic, and not a democracy.

Look up alternate sources of information, check your facts and check them again, compare sources etc. Better yet, speak to some Americans and find out what they think of their own electoral system as well as the brand of democracy practiced by their leaders. Your rose-tinted view of American politics is so simplistic and naive it is painful to read. The political system in America is hardly as perfect as the picture you are painting. Like Singapore, it has its faults, loopholes and room for abuse. For starters, take a good look at what happened during previous presidential elections, what happened to the voters whose names were removed from the rolls in the state of Florida,  American foreign policy over the last few decades, the treatment of the minority groups including the original Native Americans, the true origins of Thanksgiving, the drawing up of the Constitution and what it meant, whether the founding fathers truly intended for  the United States to be a liberal democracy. Do some research on their Social Security program, as well as the time bomb that is the American healthcare system, due to the escalating costs of insurance. The United States has its fair share of problems. Go ahead, learn more about the country you're trying to put on a pedestral here.<br>[/i]</strong></div>
