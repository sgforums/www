            <div class='col-md body'>There is a duty of care on the part of LTA to all owners of surrounding lands and under this duty, appropriate protective measures should be taken to avoid causing damage.<br><br>Short notice may be justifiable now due to danger but LTA might have caused its own delays in taking protective measures on this property. It should give details on delays of its own and not give any excuses such as the Nicol Highway stoppage. Should such an excuse be given the Hock Kee residents have the right to rebut it and ask for enhanced compensation.<br><br>Compensation should not be limited to moving expenses but fairly valued taking into account the delays or negligence of LTA to provide for enhanced compensation.<br><br>The Kim Keat Church land at dispute was finally valued as car park lots reversing earlier valuation based on road resere after appeal due to public outcry. Like in the NKF case people know their rights and if their rights have been ignored sooner or later there would be an outcry and demand for justice.<br><br>Facts assumed by government valuers can be wrong. LTA should be more transparent now and not seek to deny affected residents of justice. It should try to value the site for compensation fairly taking into account potential commercial puirpose to which such a strategic MRT land might be put to use in the future by LTA.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was this case where a young couple bought a landed property for $1,500,000.00 at Paya Lebar with their CPF and Bank loan. When LTA TOOK OVER THE PROPERTY because of the MRT line, they were compensated by LTA using the LTA approved valuer. The final outcome? The compensation paid was returned to CPF and bank. However the amount was greatly below the purchase price. The couple was forced by the bank to pay the difference and would be made a bankrupt if they cannot repay the loan. Their plight was made known to the government.<br><br>We do not really know what happened to them but this is definetely the case of bullying by LTA.<br></div>

To be realistic, moving from one location to another, be it for commercial or residential purposes, definitely takes more than one month. If you were looking for a new office or home, it would be very reasonable to take at least 4-5 months just scouting around, not to mention getting the right unit and to negotiate a good price for it.  How in the world can the LTA expect it to be done within 1 month?<br><br>Even by some miracle that you can locate an alternative site within 1 month, LTA should give a higher compensation higher than previously as unreasonable time was given to the Hock Kee residents to move. Imagine the opportunity costs incurred by the residents! I'm sure some of the residents still owe the bank for their housing loans. Insuffucuent compensation will incur losses for the residents!<br><br>Nsdef, I think you should put yourself in their shoes before making such a statement. I know that it is important to think of the bigger picture, but since LTA needed their help to move in such a short notice, more should be done to help all those inconvenienced by this incident.   </span></div>
