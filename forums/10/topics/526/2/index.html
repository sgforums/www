If you are stupid enough, maybe you can go on a strike and see what happen to you. As mentioned, singapore is controlled. Who are you to change this system? It's the government who decide and not you or me who are little tiny nobodies. Go check out your own status b4 toking big here and complaining on your poor fellowmen for being apathetic and slacking in training. It's a culture forced on us by the system, who should you blame? blame on your parent like what you had mentioned? It's so obvious. It's the maker of such a system who is at fault and hence don't come back and blame the pple or the poor parents.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 08 March 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Look bub, you're right, I haven't served my NS yet.  And I seriously don't care how well officers are paid or watever.  But one thing I am surprised that you have not realised.  Singapore's educations system is of a high standard and the standard is constantly, and has constantly increased.  Why do those people have 5 digit pay, like I said, is due to QUALIFICATIONs.  Many of those MPs whom you are talking about are born between the 1940s to the 1960s.<br><br>In the 1950s, PSLE was a VERY high standard of educations, some of the current ministers have made it at least up to A'level or obtained degrees overseas.  Imagine this, a degree holder in the a place where the common education level was PSLE.<br><br>1960s, the O'levels was considered THE desired standard of education.  Some of the ministers or MPs have strove for more, and obtained Degrees or honors.  Again, they stood out from the common education level.<br><br>1970s, A'levels and diplomas were considered the standard.  Those who stood out were those who obtained Honors and Masters.<br><br>1980s, Diplomas and degrees were considered as the desired level of educations.<br><br>And from the 1990s onwards, the desired level of education to command a RESPECTABLE 4 digit pay, say around $3k, is an HONORs or Masters.<br><br>Now that I have made my point, let me ask you, what are YOUR qualifications to question why MPs are recieving 5 digit pay?  Mind you, lets not create the illusion that these 5digit pay would be above $20 for non-ministerial positions.  Sure, I may be a "kid" that has not completed NS yet, but at least I know what it takes to command a 5digit pay in Singapore. Very High quality paper, and as many as possible.  And when one gains experience, the sky's the limit.<br><br>Personally, the Singapore government, and the way it works have done a damn good job at running the country.  Considering its and island with virtually nothing, and we are still thriving.  We are thriving on a knowledge based economy, and we need papers to prove our knowledge.  And let me ask, WHY should we be so grudging against foreigners?  Sure they don't serve NS, and NS puts us at a disadvantage, but at the end of the day, if you have the paper qualifications, you needn't fear about job opportunities.  Should adopt a standard to favour the local population when looking for employees?  If we should, what difference would there be seperating this policy from the Malaysian "bumiputra" policy which favors malays?  Has their policy done them any good?<br><br>For Singapore to survive AS a nation in this competitive world, we need as much talents as possible.  Be they foreign or local.  If these foreign talents decide to settle here, all the better, their son's can serve NS alongside us.  If you look on the brighter side, and think.  These foreign talents can actually spur local students to work harder to get as better qualifications in order to compete with them.  If our leaders now adopt a thinking like, "why should our local population have to compete with foreigners for work." then, Singapore will die off in a matter of 10 years.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Shotgun (edited 09 March 2002).]</div>

They each have a different pay level.  Also, the US government system is also VERY different from ours.  I suggest you should compare our's to a more similar system, like the British.  And again, it would be helpful for you to help us understand by providing a decent salary scale rather than "5 digit" which can mean anything from $10000 to $99999.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its only contradiction if u just consider the "education" side of it.  Foreigners from certain countries bring to Singapore firms different levels of creativity, and their mindset.  Some of which can change the way business is done.<br><br>To make it simple.  Say you tell a Singaporean to get a certain job done.  A typical Singaporean answer is "I'll try." Whereas some foreigners just do it, or offer suggestions to improve the job or to make it more efficient.  Sometimes, forien talents can be more competitive than Singaporeans, for example honkies.  They are considered the elite in the entertainment industry, and its no surprised that the people behind Mediacorp, and Mediaworks are honkies.<br><br>Basically, different people from different lands bring to singapore different culture.</div>

And using $$ and social stability as incentives, everyone is willing to contribute their share of talent.<br><br>Not that Singaporeans are inferior but when it comes to something new, the govt rather uses proven talent then to start it from raw ground. It is just the way it works around, especially that there must be no lag in the economic sector cause by this 'deficiency'.<br><br>The small isle that we are living uses brains, sells ideas....nothing more.

Personally, i find that the local pple really lack of creativity maybe due to the rigid educational system in singapore.<br><br>Well as for the NS matters, with the arising political problems between singapore and other neighbouring countries, i see the need for a stronger military defence of singapore. With so many positive youth around who support NS, an increase of the NS period from 2.5 years to maybe 4-5 years should be greatly supported to contribute further for a stronger defence. This will ensure the singapore will be stable and safe for foreigner to come over to stay, work or invest. So guess you local better don't complain too much when you are not up to that qualification and standard to help out in the singapore's economic. Serve your NS for the government diligently and more foreigner will come over to singapore to work and help make it prosperous.<br><br>[This message has been edited by MP (edited 15 March 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i guess there isn't alot of folks like myself to speak up on this issue and i will do the honours   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I've completed my NS, presently undergoing Reservist, not an officer, not a spec, just a LCP and even then, not a combat personnel, just some small "fly".<br><br>And well, i don't have the luxury of money since very young, parents could only make ends meet, couldn't get to a U. Results not overtly fantastic. Anyway, now and then, i may have some complaints, but never was there an inclination to think of myself as a "second class" citizen.<br><br>True, this is a land that is based on paper, but it doesn't necessarily mean you will be stamped with a life sentence if you don't have it.<br><br>I don't earn a 5 figure pay, but the pay is comfortable and you know what? My last job was a Systems Engineer at a semi-govt establishment (notice i didn't use the word "firm")<br><br>If the allegations that this land is all paper and no appreciation for those whom are good at what they do is correct, could anyone in the right frame of mind explain my case?<br><br>I don't know anyone in parliament. I don't have a degree. I don't have useful connections. All i was armed with was a low end self assembled PC / routing hardware (most of which i had worked my butt off to afford then) to fuel my interests in information technology.<br><br>Timing was a good bet, since my interests coincided with the govt's push for singapore to embrace IT. But other than that, it was nothing more than hardwork and a clear resolve.<br><br>If the govt and it's so said agenda to suppress the under priviledged is true, then i wouldn't be what i am today. The truth is, my employment history had never been far from govt linked companies!!<br><br>I have no idea about the background of those whom were complaining about the little pay they get out of NS, but maybe they may want to rethink about much more important things:<br><br>1. Your own will.<br>I have never been turned away by people just because i don't have paper. I believe i am not the only one, as i've known more whom are really "self-made" people in the same field and managed just the same with a dip.<br><br>2. Your Country.<br>Sure there are alot of folks blabbering about it is being pointless to fight and blah blah. But the truth is, patriotism in singapore isn't dead. In many cases, everybody have eyes to see that many WILL take a stand for their country when the need arises, even a slightest remark against our homeland in forums or in the public will spark off protest of some kind.<br><br>As my dad ever told me a long time ago, when you don't have your country, you will lose your home. What then is a person without a home? Nothing.<br><br>I don't want to sound like i am spreading gov propaganda or anything like that, it's just something to think about.<br><br><strong>Because low pay or no pay, it does not outweigh the fact that it is your obligation to defend your home.</strong><br><br>770 from the rose cross,<br>Peace Profound.<br><br>------------------<br>"Neilson, for a chap out of the Massechusetts Institute of Technology, you're a major disappointment." - The Citi in the East  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by fraterlvx (edited 16 March 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nah, there's nothing for me to take note of when fraterlvx is of some exceptional case. Glad that fraterlvx's interest coincide with mine being an IT professional. True, Semi-govt or govt establishment will mostly employ only singaporean instead of foreign expatz due to security reason and not because you are valued for what you are. fraterlvx, try working outside in the private sector and compete with those foreigners and then you come back to comment. Would you still be a full professional system engineer in the company when they can get in lots of foreigner expatz with degree to replace you?<br><br>For one thing i noticed, you are easily content with your current status, job and pay. Would our MP be content so easily? how comfortable is your pay?? comfortable enuff to clear all your HDB debt/Housing loan or pay for the COE of your new car?? Without a degree nowsday, i like to see how far you can proceed up the organisation hierarchy. Well, it's good to be content with what you have. But is this the spirit our government is teaching and hence not demanding any pay increase??<br><br>Regarding your impt things:<br>1. Try competing in the private sector with the rest instead of being pampered and 'stuck' without advancement up the hierarchy in a govern link establishment and see if you can managed anymore the same with just a dip.<br><br>2. Did i imply that patriotism in singapore is dead? It's just that protest is sparked off due to unfairness done. Or should we keep quiet and be dog just for patriotism?<br><br>3. When the country is recognising foreign expatz's value rather than the citizen's. Would the person feel at home? When in the future your son as fresh grad came out to be jobless because so many foriegn expatz are available and holding up those jobs, would you still be contented and keep being a dog? How many local can we squeeze into the govn link sector? So many of our local talent hence shaked heir head and go for oversea for a better future, yet nothing is done but foreign expatz keep coming in.<br><br>Low pay or no pay, it does not outweigh the fact that we are forced and conscripted to serve in NS as cheap labour. Patriotism will not be defined until singapore is at war, and you see pple sacrificing themselve then and not now. Those who diligently serve in NS now might be the one who fleed singapore the first esp those MP, who know?<br><br>As i had mentioned b4, apathetic is the culture forced on us the common folk and the $$$ language theory was demonstrated and taught by our leaders. What more you want to complain about our attitude towards being a cheap labour?</div>

Academical qualifications is important if you can afford it, because the foundation would be a good stepping stone in whatever fields you're interested in.

I don't see how the NS has disrupted my life, besides on the academic momentum side of things.<br><br>NS is treated as just another phase of my life, where everyone abled-male in my country goes thru'. I don't see whatz the fuss about the whole NS thing. Is it part of the 'kiasu' syndrome that happens to all singaporeans? Does that mean the earlier you get the job, the most secure you'll be? Can't believe that it's coming from someone that is 'surviving' well in the IT industry, supposedly the brainy industry. *sigh*<br><br>It seems that the shallow thought of the few years lost because of your NS affects your personal development and possibly a better job prospect(if any). One who is deeply concern with the foreign competition, the 'threat' of a iron rice bowl. Can you accept the good of all these arrangement at all? Expats are only here for the gd of our economic growth, and they are usually on short term contract. And i'm sure if the local proved to be as capable, they would get the job, why pay more for the foreign levy for someone who only knows as much as a local? Makes sense?<br><br>The market is seriously in need of people who proved to be capable in their fields, paper or not. I'm sure we've seen/heard people succeeding in life without a degree, haven't we?<br><br>Do not blame our NS liability on your progress in life, as they provide the foundation for our social stability and in turn attracted all the investers which provide you with jobs. Without that.... we'll be just a fishing village with some factories, perhaps....  =)  Take it in good faith!</div>
