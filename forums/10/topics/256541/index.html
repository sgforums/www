            <div class='col-md body'>Really, what has Minister Khaw Boon Wan done ? Has he done something to alleviate people's suffering or is he taking people's retirement funds in advance to pay for their medical expenses which should have been borne by way of services of the government to the people through their own contributions to the economy and all the direct and indirect taxes paid.<br><br>All we are seeing is more devious method of charging people like being done by HDB or URA, making obscene profits on lands by using taxpayers' monies to acquire lands and infrastructure at little or no costs but through setting up privatized GLCs it is charging for services at full market prices which they still claim to be not enough to pay for costs due to creative accounting.<br><br>Citizens through direct, GST, and indirect taxes (levies, fees, COE, ERP, Development Charges, Stamp Duties) are already over-paying the government.<br><br>Yet when it comes to providing medical services needed land costs, infrastructure costs are added onto the bill and a false claim of subsidy is stated in the bill as if government has bought lands and infrastructures with their own monies from foreign loans or someone else.<br><br>This kind of taxing and recovering all costs against the citizens through creative accounting has caused big problems to the whole economy driving up business costs and rentals and making the economy uncompetitive.<br><br>They then set up all kinds of privatized GLCs and hospitals and make them operate on cost-centre basis without using direct or indirect taxes to return services to the people for their contributions.<br><br>Naturally citizens have to struggle to pay double all the time one tax to government and another to their GLCs. Citizens are being made to pay all over again because government has made these GLCs take over people's assets which then have to recover costs all over again.<br><br>What Khaw has done is merely using another creative accounting no different from the old NKF in denying use of people's monies for the original intended purpose but to dump all the medical costs on the taxpayers in advance onto their own CPF retirement savings and called such schemes medishield, medisave and whatnot so that at the end the government could collect more and more taxes and yet does not have to pay for people's medical costs.<br><br>But so much fanfare was made by him that he has achieved some kinds of medical breakthrough as if government is paying all these costs.<br><br>It is still the same old story he is telling that there is no welfare, no free lunch as Mah Boh Tan has been telling the people though government continues to horde people's taxes and double-charge people on lands and infrastructure.<br><br>If Khaw is now to start a means-testing he is obviously not only witholding taxes intended to be spent to pay for people's medical needs he will be further charging people by pushing more people away from relevant class "C" to higher-paying classes in order to make more monies as in the first place by medishield and medisave he has already succeeded in dumping medical costs against people's retirement funds.<br><br>It will be rubbing salts into injury (deprivations of services to people they deserve from their own taxes paid) if he goes ahead to use means tests to make more monies for the government.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>MOH ready to reveal details on revamped ElderShield within weeks<br>By May Wong, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 26 May 2007 1819 hrs<br><br>SINGAPORE: Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan has said he will reveal details of the revamped ElderShield before the end of next month, while hinting that a total of three insurers may offer the scheme.<br><br>Currently, only two companies provide ElderShield, a severe disability insurance scheme to help Singaporeans pay for long-term care especially during old age.<br><br>The reformed scheme is set to be implemented end-September.<br><br>Mr Khaw was speaking at a dialogue session with some 300 grassroots leaders to get public feedback on the proposed ElderShield changes.<br><br>One request that often came up during Saturday's session was to shorten the 90-day deferment.<br><br>Currently, a policy holder has to wait 90 days after being certified as disabled before he could receive the ElderShield payout.<br><br>This is to minimise fraud.<br><br>Mr Khaw said: "We can take a look to see if 90 days are overly long. But, I think, in practice the insurers have been flexible case by case. They do approve cases well within 90 days, shorter than 90 days."<br><br>One proposed change to ElderShield is to increase the monthly payout for policy-holders from $300 to $400 over five years.<br><br>Other proposed changes are extending the payout period to six years and allowing people to buy add-on schemes for more coverage.<br><br>As of end last year, about 750,000 people have ElderShield policies offered by NTUC Income and Great Eastern Life.<br><br>The two existing insurers as well as Aviva have thrown in their bids to be providers.<br><br>Mr Khaw said: "There are some details to be tidied up but I think within a few weeks, I should be able to settle the exact form of what the reform will look like and also to announce the result of the tender. We have two insurers at the moment for ElderShield and I think a third insurer is likely to crop up with this reform. Three insurers are not bad."<br><br>The Minister also said that after reforming the ElderShield, he wants to work with insurance companies to make their contracts easier to understand.<br><br>Insurance contracts, he said, should be written in simple languages so that people will know what they are buying and the kind of benefits they will get.<br><br>Mr Khaw said he would work on this in the second half of this year. - CNA/ir </blockquote>Let's hope they bring it out for discussion before implementation otherwise it going to be from one useless insurance to another. For between $150 -  S190 per year, don't introduce another useless insurance that does not benefit the people other than the insurance companies.<br><br>People's opinion and requirement should be sought as the "Ministries" are already out of touch with the ground.<br>In the meantime, please further explain the following and its benefits as it is drawing the money from people's medical saving.<br><br>1. Medisave<br>2. MediSheld<br>3. MediFund<br>4. ElderShield<br>5. whatever else there is as all above are either complusory or "OPT OUT" necessary.<br><br></div>

Has he done something to alleviate people's suffering or is he taking people's retirement funds in advance to pay for their medical expenses which should have been borne by way of services of the government to the people through their own contributions to the economy and all the direct and indirect taxes paid.<br><br>All we are seeing is more devious method of charging people like being done by HDB or URA, making obscene profits on lands by using taxpayers' monies to acquire lands and infrastructure at little or no costs but through setting up privatized GLCs it is charging for services at full market prices which they still claim to be not enough to pay for costs due to creative accounting.<br><br>Citizens through direct, GST, and indirect taxes (levies, fees, COE, ERP, Development Charges, Stamp Duties) are already over-paying the government.<br><br>Yet when it comes to providing medical services needed land costs, infrastructure costs are added onto the bill and a false claim of subsidy is stated in the bill as if government has bought lands and infrastructures with their own monies from foreign loans or someone else.<br><br>This kind of taxing and recovering all costs against the citizens through creative accounting has caused big problems to the whole economy driving up business costs and rentals and making the economy uncompetitive.<br><br>They then set up all kinds of privatized GLCs and hospitals and make them operate on cost-centre basis without using direct or indirect taxes to return services to the people for their contributions.<br><br>Naturally citizens have to struggle to pay double all the time one tax to government and another to their GLCs. Citizens are being made to pay all over again because government has made these GLCs take over people's assets which then have to recover costs all over again.<br><br>What Khaw has done is merely using another creative accounting no different from the old NKF in denying use of people's monies for the original intended purpose but to dump all the medical costs on the taxpayers in advance onto their own CPF retirement savings and called such schemes medishield, medisave and whatnot so that at the end the government could collect more and more taxes and yet does not have to pay for people's medical costs.<br><br>But so much fanfare was made by him that he has achieved some kinds of medical breakthrough as if government is paying all these costs.<br><br>It is still the same old story he is telling that there is no welfare, no free lunch as Mah Boh Tan has been telling the people though government continues to horde people's taxes and double-charge people on lands and infrastructure.<br><br>If Khaw is now to start a means-testing he is obviously not only witholding taxes intended to be spent to pay for people's medical needs he will be further charging people by pushing more people away from relevant class "C" to higher-paying classes in order to make more monies as in the first place by medishield and medisave he has already succeeded in dumping medical costs against people's retirement funds.<br><br>It will be rubbing salts into injury (deprivations of services to people they deserve from their own taxes paid) if he goes ahead to use means tests to make more monies for the government.<br></div></blockquote>What he has done, and will continure to do, is just follow orders from the top.<br><br>That's all there is.<br><br>Any plans, any bright ideas from our gov., you can bet your last dollar is to charge more and more...<br><br>What's the farking use of Medisave when it can mostly scratch the furface of medical bills? And surgeries such as those to save a person's eyesight is considered COSMETICS???? They maybe should substitute the word COSMETICS with EXPENSIVE...that's why cannot claim...<br><br>Lame as hell as ever...Hub this Hub that and healthcare is full of screw-ups and shortcomings!!<br><br>NNB...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  hopeless case!<br><br></div>
