            <div class='col-md body'>i would be grateful if he didn't increase the registration fee as much as he did in 2007!:<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s healthcare system - uniquely Singapore? (Part 2)<br>Leong Sze Hian<br>F6.February 2007 - DRUGS LICENSING:<br><br>On the licensing and registration fees for medicinal and cosmetic products, before 1991, there were hardly any fees payable for the registration of medicinal products. When registration began in 1991, the per product licence fee was $66 a year.<br><br>Since a new regulatory agency was created a few years ago, the fees have increased to $80, $100, $120, $360, $750, and up to $77,500 per first year, in 1992, 1996, 1998, 2003, 2006 and 2007 respectively.<br><br>Not counting 2007, this fees increase was at a compound rate of 18 per cent a year, for the last 15 years until 2006.<br><br>This has resulted in pharmaceutical businesses reducing their product lines and is also a deterrent to expanding their product ranges in Singapore. The higher costs are also being passed on to consumers. More Singaporeans are buying from Johor Baru and neighbouring countries.<br><br>For example, the price of Norvasc 5mg tablet box of 30 for heart condition and Lipitor 10mg is $28.70 (RM65) and $55.30 (RM125) in Johor Baru, compared with $75.20 and $96, respectively, in Singapore.<br><br>To put this in perspective, according to the ChannelNewsAsia programme, War on Cancer, on Feb 11, the cost of cancer drugs has gone up 500-fold over the last decade.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>After 10 years, CGH ups A&amp;E fee<br>By Tan Hui Leng, TODAY | Posted: 10 July 2007 1241 hrs<br><br>SINGAPORE - Ten years after it last revised its Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) charges, Changi General Hospital (CGH) has become the latest public hospital to up such fees.<br><br>Following in the wake of earlier hikes by the National University Hospital and Alexandra Hospital, CGH this month increased its A&amp;E attendance fee by $10 Â— or 15 per cent Â— to $75. Even so, the hospitalÂ’s A&amp;E charges are one of the lowest across public hospitals, said a spokesperson.<br><br>CGH also raised inpatient fees for the first time in seven years. For the B2 and C-class wards, the daily treatment fee went up by $1, representing a 6-to-10-per-cent increment.<br><br>The daily ward charge for B2 wards also rose by $1, or 2 per cent. Despite the coincidence of the timing, the hikes are not tied to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) increase that kicked in this month. The reason is rising operating costs, said the hospital.<br><br>On the other side of the island, the National University Hospital (NUH), too, recently raised some of its fees, attributing the need to increased operating costs.<br><br>From May 14, NUH increased ward charges for B2 and C-class wards by $2, increases of 4 and 8 per cent. The hospitalÂ’s last revision for both ward class charges was more than 10 years ago.<br><br>Both hospitals say GST will be continued to be absorbed for subsidised patients.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>But the chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, Mdm Halimah Yacob, when contacted by TODAY, said: Â“Â‘Operational costsÂ’ is a very broad term Â— what does it really include?Â” </strong></span><br><br>Since late last year, public healthcare costs have been on the rise with various fee increases in hospital specialist outpatient clinics, polyclinics and inpatient wards.<br><br>From April, the Singapore General Hospital started charging $3 more for patients in class-B2 wards. C-class patients now pay $26 a day, up $1. Those were its first increases since 1993.<br><br>At NUH, the A&amp;E fee was raised from $70 to $80 in January, its first such hike since 1997.<br><br>Over at Alexandra Hospital, A&amp;E charges went up from $55 to $60 late last year, as did C-class ward charges Â— from $21 to $23 Â— and subsidised specialist outpatient clinic consultation rates, from $18 to $20.<br><br>KK WomenÂ’s and ChildrenÂ’s Hospital hiked ward treatment fees in February.<br><br>Hospitals can do better when it comes to being transparent about why they are charging more for various services, said Mdm Halimah.<br><br>Â“The most important thing is for hospitals to explain to the public why they are increasing fees, even if they are not passing on the 2-per-cent increase in GST to patients,Â” she said.<br><br>Â“I think one would be staff cost which over the years has been going up ... hospitals have to think of ways to control costs and enhance efficiency and productivity. And they should explain what they have done in this regard.Â”<br><br>CGHÂ’s spokesperson said the hospital was Â“prudent in maintaining costs and has also been adopting many cost-saving measuresÂ”, such as those aimed at reducing energy and water consumption, and group purchase of equipment and drugs with SingHealth. Â“This has helped us to hold off fee increases for several years,Â” said the spokesperson.<br><br>Mdm Halimah said that while inpatient increments at CGH and NUH are marginal, she has received numerous pieces of feedback that A&amp;E charges are, in general, too high Â— and were so even before the hikes.<br><br>Â“That increase will have more impact especially on Sundays and public holidays Â— when polyclinics and many general practitioners do not open Â— so that is one point one has to bear in mind,Â” she said. - TODAY/fa </blockquote>a very simple excuse that 10 years never raise price and "increased overheads " to raise charges. even "they" themselves couldn't agree with these excuses.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A family friend of mine was recently diagnosed with Colorectal Cancer, stage one type.<br><br>Generally, we all know Stage One Cancer is treatable and there's a high chance of survival. However, when I visited him he was cheerful even though prior to his discovery of Cancer, he had his spine operated on due to a compressed disc and has metal braces in side holding up his lower spinal column, and a more recent surgery on his right knee to replace a worn out knee joint.<br><br>All these surgeries has more or less depleted his CPF Medisave funds, and with the onset of Cancer of his Colon, he was still smiling and joking but he said something before I left; "Well, I'll just go through whatever's necessary... and when my CPF money runs out.. so be it..."<br><br>As I walked away, I couldn't help feeling so so bitter and furious....with the knowledge that we're living in a so called 1st World Country, a government so super rich, but its people are left to their own devices....<br><br>CPF, Medisave, Retirement Funds, all these "safety nets" -  what good is it in the end if one comes down with a major illness and healthcare along with all other general cost of living, relentlessly increasing??<br><br>Can you imagine those who not yet able to draw on their CPF because they havein't reached 65, but are already plagued by medical condition/s which made them lose their jobs and unable to find employment due to both age and medical reasons and yet unable or NOT ALLOWED to touch their CPF money to pay for their medical condition/s????<br><br>I say it is a HEARTLESSLY CRUEL SYSTEM...<br>Safety Net my foot....!<br><br></div>
