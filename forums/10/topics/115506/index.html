            <div class='col-md body'>This blog is interesting.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><a href="http://xenoboysg.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://xenoboysg.blogspot.com/</a><br><br>The Birth of Sg's First Political Blog<br><br>I Xeno Boy will go where no one has ever gone before. I hereby announce the birth of Singapore's first Political Blog. I will give my awesome rants on Singapore politics. I will give the truth as I see it. Before I begin, I am studying political science, of course, in the UK. Yes, I have fucking spoken at Hyde Park before ... For all the political watchers in Singapore lemme state my basic assumptions in all posts :<br><br>First Rule : The PAP SUCKS<br><br>Second Rule : The Opposition needs to FUCKING ARISE<br><br>Whaddya think of my awesome rants?<br><br>To begin proper, Singapore is a Corporation or what is better known as Singapore Inc, a term coined by a co-opted Singapore political scientist, Chan Heng Chee. She had brains but she became sucked into the PAP system and is now a technocrat like all others. Nullified.<br><br>The problem with Singapore politics is epitomised by the definitional conundrum of the very word democracy itself. By all accounts, the lee-thal PAP has conducted social engineering par excellence in creating a system of government that is by all accounts a "functional" democracy. On paper, it makes the grade for a democracy. BUT the word democracy has its problems of definition, Singapore through the PAP has latched onto a problematic definition of democracy and stuck to it conveniently. It does not help that the dumb Yankees themselves have no notion of democracy but yet trumpet it like a coherent ideology to enlighten the fucking world.<br><br>But in Singapore there is no democracy. Why? Because there is no people in it. People in the sense of political people. A polity. There are economic people and people tied up with Government Housing Loans in Singapore. The people are tranquilized against thought and action from a political viewpoint. In the word democracy, "demo(s)" = people is a fundamental tenet of the concept. This is lost in Singapore. The recovery must begin with this. To recover the "people", recover their political selves, recover themselves as a full people and not just economic people. The demos must awaken so that it can control the "cracy". The "cracy" is over-represented in Singapore. The PAP is "cracy" only and power cracy to boot.<br><br>As the first step, "Demos" must be recovered so that the full sense of "democracy" can gain its signification. Because Demos comes before cracy. People first. We can than rein in the government. How to do this? This will be my next post.<br><br>All politicians in Singapore, come and listen to Xeno Boy. For I come as Political Savant. Suggest and comment, but I will fuck you back. I am Xeno Boy. I bring to birth Singapore's First Political Blog.<br><br>Xeno Boy<br><br>Quote of the Day from Walter Benjamin<br><br>This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing in from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such a violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward.<br><br>--Walter Benjamin, "Theses on the Philosophy of History, IX"</div>
