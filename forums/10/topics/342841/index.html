              <p>"You'd
              have to be an idiot to trust the North Koreans," Secretary of State
              Condoleezza Rice said recently. Apparently unaware of the irony, she
              then predicted eventual success for the six-party talks on the North's
              nuclear weapons program.</p>
              <p>President-elect Barack Obama has promised major changes in U.S.
              diplomacy and repeatedly criticized the Bush administration on both
              substance and style. Mr. Obama has pledged more negotiation and
              multilateralism -- less saber-rattling and "take it or leave it"
              unilateralism. While Iraq was Mr. Obama's focal point in the campaign,
              the biggest problem ahead is countering the proliferation of weapons of
              mass destruction.</p>
              <p>But on proliferation, what is striking are the similarities between
              Mr. Obama and President George W. Bush's second term. Given Mr. Bush's
              recent record, continuity between the two presidencies is hardly
              reassuring. And where Mr. Obama differs with Mr. Bush, he is only more
              accommodating to the intractable rogues running Pyongyang and Tehran.
              This is decidedly bad news.</p>
              <p>The recent, embarrassing collapse of the six-party talks starkly
              underlines how, under Mr. Obama, everything old will be new again. The
              talks are classic multilateral diplomacy, pursued since 2003 with
              notable deference to North Korea. There's been about as much engagement
              with Pyongyang as consenting adults can lawfully have.</p>
              <p>The outcome of this Obama-style diplomacy was the same as all prior
              negotiations with the leaders of the world's largest prison camp. North
              Korea charged even for the privilege of sitting at the negotiating
              table, extracted concession after concession, endlessly renegotiated
              points that had been resolved, and ultimately delivered nothing of
              consequence in return.</p>
              <p>When pressed, North Korea would bluster and threaten to rain
              destruction on South Korea. "Experts" on North Korea would observe that
              this was just its style, nothing to worry about. Thus did the Bush
              administration enable the North's bullying behavior by proclaiming even
              greater willingness to offer further carrots.</p>
              <p>Most recently in Beijing, Pyongyang refused to put in writing what
              U.S. negotiators say it committed to verbally -- namely, verifying its
              commitment to abandon its nuclear program. But even taking U.S.
              negotiators at their word, this did not constitute real verification.
              The charade of verification was only one more ploy to squeeze out U.S.
              concessions, which Mr. Bush's negotiators seemed prepared to give.</p>
              <p>On Iran, also for over five years, Mr. Bush has endorsed vigorous
              European diplomacy. The Europeans offered every imaginable carrot to
              persuade Iran to drop its nuclear program in exchange for a different
              relationship with Europe and America. This produced no change in Iran's
              strategic objective of acquiring deliverable nuclear weapons. The only
              real consequence is that Iran is five years closer to achieving that
              objective. It now has indigenous mastery over the entire nuclear fuel
              cycle.</p>
              <p>The Obama alternative? "Present the Iranian regime with a clear
              choice" by using carrots and sticks to induce Iran to give up its
              nuclear aspirations. What does Mr. Obama think Mr. Bush and the
              Europeans have been doing? Does he really think his smooth talking will
              achieve more than Europe's smoothest talkers, who were in fact talking
              for us the whole time?</p>
              <p>While Mr. Obama has uttered only generalities on North Korea, his
              Iran policy will be worse than Mr. Bush's. He acts as though the years
              of failed efforts to dissuade Iran from going nuclear simply didn't
              happen. That is blindness, not continuity. And that's without Mr.
              Obama's pledge to meet personally with Iran's leaders, an incredible
              act of legitimization he seems willing to give away for nothing.</p>
              <p>Neither North Korea nor Iran is prepared to voluntarily give up
              nuclear or ballistic missile programs. The Bush policy was flawed not
              because its diplomacy was ineffective or disengaged, not because it was
              too intimidating to its adversaries, and not because it lacked
              persistence. Mr. Bush's flaw was believing that negotiation and mutual
              concession could accomplish the U.S. objective -- the end of
              proliferation threats from Pyongyang and Tehran -- when the objectives
              of our adversaries were precisely the opposite. They sought to buy
              valuable time to improve and expand their nuclear programs, extract as
              many carrots as possible, and play for legitimacy on the world stage.</p>
              <p>Iran and North Korea achieved their objectives through diplomacy.
              Mr. Bush failed to achieve his. How can Mr. Obama do better? For
              starters, he could increase the pressure on China, which has real
              leverage over North Korea, to press Kim Jong Il's regime in ways that
              the six-party talks never approached. Options on Iran are more limited,
              but meaningful efforts at regime change and assisting Israel should it
              decide to strike Iran's nuclear facilities would be good first steps.</p>
              <p>Sadly, the chances Mr. Obama will adopt these policies are far less
              than the steadily dwindling possibility that the Bush administration
              might yet come back to reality. Mr. Obama's handling of the rogue
              states will -- at best -- continue the Bush policies, which failed to
              stop nuclear proliferation. Get ready for a dangerous ride.</p>
