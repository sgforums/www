For instance, his "American Freedom Agenda Act" aimed to nullify Bush's unconstitutional Military Commissions Act of 2006, which abolished habeas corpus for those deemed to be "unlawful enemy combatants" (a term which the president and his attorney general could bestow on anyone they wanted).</p>

              <h1 class="headline">Obama's wiretapping stand enrages many supporters</h1>
              <p><a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/07/02/america/obama.php">http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/07/02/america/obama.php</a></p>
              <p><strong><a id="articleLocation" title="Click to view map" href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/07/02/america/obama.php">WASHINGTON</a>:</strong> Senator Barack Obama's decision to support legislation <strong>granting legal
                  immunity to telecommunications companies that cooperated with the Bush
                  administration's program of wiretapping without warrants has led to an
                  intense backlash among some of his most ardent supporters.</strong></p>
              <p>Thousands are now using the same grass-roots organizing tools
                  previously mastered by the Obama campaign to organize a protest against
                  his decision.</p>
              <p>In recent days, more than 7,000 Obama supporters have organized on a
                  social networking site on Obama's own campaign Web site. They are
                  <strong>calling on him to reverse his decision to endorse legislation supported
                  by President George W. Bush to expand the government's domestic spying
                  powers while also providing legal protection to the telecommunications
                  companies that worked with the National Security Agency's domestic
                  wiretapping program after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the
                  United States.</strong></p>
              <p>During the Democratic primary campaign, Obama vowed to fight such
                  legislation to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or
                  FISA. But he has switched positions and now supports a compromise
                  hammered out between the White House and the Democratic congressional
                  leadership. The bill is expected to come to a vote on the Senate floor
                  on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The decision, one of a number made by Obama intended to position him
                  toward the political center as the general election campaign heats up,
                  has brought him into serious conflict for the first time with liberal
                  bloggers and commentators and his young supporters.</p>
              <p>Many of them have <strong>seen the issue of granting immunity to the
                  telecommunications companies as a test of principle in their opposition
                  to Bush's surveillance program</strong>. "I don't think there has been another
                  instance where, in meaningful numbers, his supporters have opposed him
                  like this," said Glenn Greenwald, a writer for Salon.com who opposes
                  Obama's new position.</p>
              <p>Jane Hamsher, a liberal blogger who also opposes immunity for the
                  phone companies, said she had been flooded with messages from Obama
                  supporters who are frustrated with his new stance.</p>
              <p>"The opposition to Obama's position among his supporters is very
                  widespread," said Hamsher, founder of the Web site firedoglake.com.
                  "His promise to filibuster earlier in the year, and the decision to
                  switch on that, is seen as a real character problem. I know people who
                  are really very big Obama supporters are very disillusioned."</p>
              <p>One supporter, Robert Arellano, expressed his anger over the issue
                  on the Obama site. "I have watched your campaign with genuine
                  enthusiasm, and I have given you money," he said. "For the first time
                  in my life, I have sensed the presence of a presidential candidate who
                  might actually bring some meaningful change to the corrupt cesspool of
                  national politics. But your about-face on the FISA bill genuinely
                  angers and alarms me."</p>
              <p>For now, the campaign is trying to put a positive spin on the FISA fight among its supporters.</p>
              <p>"The fact that there is an open forum on BarackObama.com where
                  supporters can say whether they agree or disagree speaks to a strength
                  of our campaign," said Bill Burton, a campaign spokesman.</p>
              <p>Several activists and bloggers predicted that Obama's move toward
                  the center on some issues could sharply reduce the intensity of support
                  that he has enjoyed from liberal activists. Such enthusiasm helped
                  power Obama's effort to secure the nomination, and it has been one of
                  his campaign's most important tools for fund-raising and organizing
                  around the country.</p>
              <p>Markos Moulitsas, a liberal blogger and founder of the Daily Kos Web
                  site, said he had decided to cut back on the amount of money he would
                  contribute to the Obama campaign because of the FISA reversal. "I will
                  continue to support him," Moulitsas said in an interview. "But I was
                  going to write him a check, and I decided I would rather put that money
                  with Democrats who will uphold the Constitution."</p>
              <p>Greg Craig, a Washington lawyer who advises the Obama campaign, said
                  Tuesday in an interview that Obama had decided to support the
                  compromise FISA legislation only after concluding it was the best
                  deal possible.</p>
              <p>"This was a deliberative process, and not something that was
                  shooting from the hip," Craig said. "Obviously, there was an element of
                  what's possible here. But he concluded that with FISA expiring, that it
                  was better to get a compromise than letting the law expire."</p>

              <h3>'Hope is flickering,' ACLU declares</h3>
              <p>The American Civil
              Liberties Union, which has generally been harshly critical of President
              George W. Bush and praiseworthy of President Barack Obama, has fired a
              torpedo across the Obama bow.<br> <br> After the British High Court ruled that evidence of a British
              resident's rendition and harsh interrogation at the Pentagon's
              Guantanamo Bay prison must remain secret because of threats made by the
              Bush administration to halt intelligence sharing, the Obama
              Administration offered a terse statement seemingly expressing support
              to the BBC.<br> <br> "The United States thanks the UK government for its continued
              commitment to protect sensitive national security information and
              preserve the long-standing intelligence sharing relationship that
              enables both countries to protect their citizens," a spokesman said.<br> <br> In response, the ACLU's executive director, Anthony Romero, shot off a
              letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asking the Obama
              Administration to clarify their position. Romero also issued a
              sharply-worded three sentence statement to the press, saying Obama has
              now offered "more of the same."<br> <br> "Hope is flickering," Romero said in a statement. "The Obama
              administration's position is not change. It is more of the same. This
              represents a complete turn-around and undermining of the restoration of
              the rule of law. The new American administration shouldn't be complicit
              in hiding the abuses of its predecessors."<br> <br> The ACLU called on Clinton to "reject the Bush administration's policy
              of using false claims of national security to avoid judicial review of
              controversial programs."<br> <br> Romero's letter to Clinton follows.</p>
              <hr>
              <p><br> <br> February 4, 2009<br><br> <br><br> The Honorable Hillary Clinton<br> U.S. Department of State<br> 2201 C Street, N.W.<br> Washington, D.C. 20520<br> <br><br> Re: Clarification Requested on Position of the United States on
              Blocking Disclosure by a British Court of Its Report on Allegations of
              Torture<br> <br><br> Dear Secretary Clinton:<br><br> <br><br> The American Civil Liberties Union strongly urges you to clarify the
              position of the United States on the publication of the full judgment
              in a lawsuit brought by a Guantanamo detainee, Binyam Mohamed, in a
              British court. Earlier today, the High Court in Great Britain published
              a judgment denying publication of its report detailing allegations of
              torture. The High Court stated that the United States had threatened
              that full publication of the court's judgment would jeopardize
              intelligence cooperation between the two countries. Remarkably, the
              court reported that the British government claimed the U.S. position
              had not changed, despite the inauguration of President Barack Obama. We
              urgently request that you clarify the position of the United States in
              this matter.<br> <br> Two of the British justices severely criticized the position of the
              United States in working to block publication of the judgment in the
              torture case. Lord Justice Thomas and Justice Lloyd Jones stated today
              that: Indeed, we did not consider that a democracy [the United States]
              governed by the rule of law would expect a court in another democracy
              to suppress a summary of the evidence contained in reports by its own
              officials ... relevant to allegations of torture and cruel, inhumane,
              or degrading treatment, politically embarrassing though it might be. We
              had no reason ... to anticipate there would be made a threat of the
              gravity of the kind made by the United States Government that it would
              reconsider its intelligence-sharing relationship, when all the
              considerations in relation to open justice pointed to us providing a
              limited but important summary of the reports.<br> <br> The court's opinion specifically stated that attorneys for British
              Foreign Secretary David Miliband told the court that the United States'
              threat on the effect of publication on intelligence cooperation was
              continued by the United States, despite the inauguration of President
              Obama.<br> <br> Specifically, the justices stated that, "it was submitted to us by Mr.
              David Rose that the situation had changed significantly following the
              election of President Obama who was avowedly determined to eschew
              torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and to close
              Guantanamo Bay. We have, however, been informed by counsel for the
              Foreign Secretary that the position has not changed."<br> <br> The claims made by the British justices that the United States
              continues to oppose publication of the judgment in the Binyam Mohamed
              case--to the point of threatening the future of U.S.-British
              intelligence cooperation--seems completely at odds with both the
              anti-torture and transparency executive orders signed by the President.
              We strongly urge you to clarify the position of the United States and
              remove any threat related to the publication of the court's full
              judgment.<br> <br> Please let us know if you have any questions regarding this matter.<br> <br> Sincerely,<br> <br> Anthony D. Romero<br><br> Executive Director<br> <br> Caroline Fredrickson<br><br> Director, Washington Legislative Office<br> <br> cc: Joan Donoghue, Acting Legal Adviser</p>

              <div class="articleAuthorName">by  Tom  Eley</div>
              <div class="articleAuthorName"><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=12205">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=12205</a></div>
              <div class="articleAuthorName"><br></div>
              <div class="articleAuthorName">
              <p>On Wednesday, President Barack Obama announced
              measures that purport to restrict executive compensation to $500,000 at
              financial institutions receiving billions in government assistance. The
              figure does not include stock options, which could be redeemed after
              financial firms pay back loans from the federal government. Nor does it
              apply to the original recipients of tens of billions in TARP (Troubled
              Asset Relief Program) money.</p>
              <p>The measures are essentially a public relations
              exercise. Their aim is to provide political cover for a new and even
              larger Wall Street bailout, which Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
              will unveil next week.</p>
              <p>Yet the discussion that has emerged in the wake of
              Obama’s announcement sheds light on the domination of government by a
              tiny financial elite and the increasingly threadbare pretense of
              democracy in the US. This financial aristocracy, the episode reveals,
              is a power to be approached on bended knee.</p>
              <p>The media have responded to Obama’s proposal of a
              $500,000 limit on executive compensation, <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">which would affect only a
              handful of firms, as though this were a severe and astonishing
              punishment. Yet the figure represents approximately 12 times the annual
              salary of the typical worker. To the majority of the population, a
              salary of a half million dollars is a staggering amount of money.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Obama’s servility before the financial aristocracy
              was summed up by the reassurances he gave it in announcing his limits
              on executive pay. “This is America,” Obama said. “We don't disparage
              wealth. We don't begrudge anybody for achieving success.”</p>
              <p>Such a vision of America is at odds with both its
              present circumstances and its history, which has been characterized by
              deep democratic and egalitarian traditions that date back to before the
              Jeffersonian democracy of the early Republic. And while liberals are
              busy attempting to equate Obama to Franklin Roosevelt, the latter, in
              the midst of the Great Depression, attempted to capitalize on the
              tremendous contempt for the rich in the population at large by
              regularly issuing bromides against the “money changers.”</p>
              <p>Indeed, Obama’s obsequiousness stands in sharp
              contrast to the anger of the working masses, who find it
              incomprehensible that t<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">he same executives who are responsible for
              ruining the economy and squandering trillions in taxpayer money are now
              presented with pay “limits” of a half million dollars. Workers are
              wondering why there haven’t been criminal indictments and television
              scenes of handcuffed executives frog-marched from their offices.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">But on Wall Street, $500,000 is considered a
              pittance.</span></strong> The New York Times reports that executives felt cheated by
              taking home “only” $18 billion in collective bonuses in 2009. “I feel
              like I got a doorman’s tip, compared to what I got in previous years,”
              an investment banker with Citigroup told the Times.</p>
              <p>The Financial Times reported on Wall Street’s
              opposition to the largely token measures. “Senior bankers were quick to
              warn the plans would cause a ‘brain drain’ from the profession as top
              executives seek more rewarding jobs out of the public eye,” it wrote.
              “Unlike other careers where job satisfaction and other considerations
              play a part, finance tends to attract people whose main motivation is
              money.”</p>
              <p>“‘The cap is a lousy idea,’ complained one top Wall
              Street executive. ‘If there is no monetary upside, who would want to do
              these jobs?’”</p>
              <p>Andrew Ward, a University of Georgia professor and
              specialist on corporate boards and management, told the Financial Times
              that executives could respond to Obama’s measure by calling his
              bluff—refusing to allow their firms to accept a bailout that would in
              any way limit their personal enrichment. “One of the potentially
              unintended consequences is that executives might try and hold off
              asking for government assistance until it is too late,” Ward said.</p>
              <p>Media and academic figures who have tried to argue
              that the massive pay packages of the Wall Street executives are somehow
              legitimate, or even rational, succeed only in revealing the rot that
              characterizes intellectual life in the US. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Their central argument—that
              the same CEOs who have driven their companies and the economy as whole
              into the ground are worthy of remuneration in the tens of millions—is
              so absurd it is almost an embarrassment to answer.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The immense power of the financial elite is revealed
              by the case of Bernard Madoff, the investor who squandered more than
              $50 billion in wealth in a giant Ponzi scheme. While working class
              Americans are arrested and spend years in prison for far lesser
              offenses, Madoff remains ensconced in his Manhattan penthouse.</p>
              <p>For nearly a decade, a whistleblower named Harry
              Markopolos, who had uncovered Madoff’s scheme, attempted to draw the
              attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the federal
              regulatory agency ostensibly tasked with policing the securities and
              stock industries. Instead, the SEC ran interference for Madoff. Rather
              than being applauded for his efforts, Markopolos feared for his safety.
              “We knew that he was one of the most powerful men on Wall Street and in
              a position to easily end our careers or worse,” he said.</p>
              <p>The social psychology and physiognomy of the
              financial elite—with its wealth, special privileges and its control
              over the organs of public opinion—resembles nothing so much as a modern
              aristocracy.</p>
              <p>Any discussion of a rational attempt to find a
              solution to the economic crisis runs immediately into the ferocious
              opposition of this elite. Similarly, in the 18th century the
              aristocracy of the French ancien regime precipitated a financial crisis
              through its avarice and wars. When the aristocracy convened the Estates
              General in 1789, it was to demand that the Third Estate, the commoners,
              bail the aristocracy out of the crisis of its own making. But the
              monarchy and nobility refused to cede a bit of its power and
              privileges. This set the stage for the great French Revolution.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The odious subjective characteristics of the US
              financial aristocracy—its greed, arrogance, stupidity and decadence—are
              themselves deeply rooted in objective historical developments, the
              social expression of an underlying economic process. The rise of this
              narrow social layer with its obscene levels of accumulation is
              inextricably bound up with the decline of American capitalism in the
              world market and the gutting of its domestic industrial base. Indeed,
              what makes the whole process so filthy, what imparts to it such a
              decadent and repulsive character, is the degree to which this wealth is
              unconnected to any progressive economic process. It is in every sense
              destructive and reactionary.</span></strong></p>
              <p>In an earlier period of history the US had its
              “robber barons,” such as Cornelius Vanderbilt, Andrew Carnegie and John
              D. Rockefeller. As brutal and greedy as these men were, their wealth
              was bound up with the creation of enormous industrial empires. The
              latter-day robber barons of Wall Street, on the other hand, have made
              their billions from the destruction of the industry and productive
              capacity built up over decades.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The staggering wealth accumulated in the top one
              percent of American society over last 25 years is directly bound up
              with the deterioration of the economy, the decline of industry and the
              impoverishment of the working class.</span></strong> The enormous personal fortunes of
              the elite have been built up on hedge funds, the leveraging of debt and
              other forms of financial speculation. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">This has entailed an enormous
              transfer of resources out of manufacturing and into finance, and out of
              the working class and into the pockets of those who have played the
              critical role not only in destroying living standards, but in setting
              the stage for the present disaster. </span></strong></p>
              <p>The fortunes that grew on this basis at a certain
              point assumed a dynamic of their own. Their sheer scale assumes a
              malignant character that becomes an insurmountable obstacle to any
              rational policy coming from within the confines of bourgeois politics.</p>
              <p>It follows that there is no solution to the crisis
              without a direct and massive assault on social inequality, and thus the
              wealth and privileges of the financial and business aristocracy. This
              cannot be carried out by pressuring the Democratic Party. The Obama
              administration’s meager rules on executive pay shows that it will not
              consider any policies that even hint at the redistribution of wealth.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The American political elite, Obama included, is
              tied by a thousand strings to the financial aristocracy. The Obama
              administration is populated by individuals who have parlayed their
              political positions into lucrative positions in finance. Virtually the
              entire cabinet fits this billing—not only Tom Daschle, the former
              senator who withdrew his nomination for the Secretary of Health and
              Human Services amidst revelations that he had withheld tens of
              thousands in taxes owed on payments he received from his corporate
              sponsors.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Yesterday it came to light that Leon Panetta,
              Obama’s nominee for chief of the Central Intelligence Agency, took home
              more than $1 million last year through payments from corporations for
              consulting, speaking appearances and through his membership on
              corporate boards. He was paid handsomely for speeches by financial
              firms that have since collapsed, including $56,000 by Merrill Lynch and
              $28,000 by Wachovia. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Secretary of State
              Hillary Clinton have also used their political connections to make
              millions from the same financial elite that would ostensibly be
              targeted by Obama’s rules on executive pay.</p>
              <p>Obama knows very well that when he leaves office he
              will be able to make millions of dollars, as Bill Clinton, the last
              Democratic president, and countless other leading politicians have
              done. Nor would this be a departure for Obama, whose career was taken
              into hand early on by leading financial and political figures in
              Chicago.</p>
              <p>The subordination of the whole of society to the
              financial aristocracy is most clearly expressed in the massive bailout
              of Wall Street. Its political representatives, Democrats and Republican
              alike, hand over trillions to the biggest banks, while providing no
              provisions for the masses of people who have lost their jobs and homes.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Millions of workers who voted for Obama are now
              coming face to face with the fact that his administration will defend
              the interests of the financial elite every bit as ruthlessly, if with a
              slightly different presentation, as the Bush administration.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The solution to the economic crisis is not a
              technical question but a social, political and revolutionary settling
              of accounts, and a historical necessity. At a certain point in the late
              18th century, it became necessary for the oppressed classes of France
              to rise up and destroy the power and privileges of the nobility. In the
              America of the 1860s, the only resolution to the “irrepressible
              conflict” was the destruction of the “slave power” in the South.</p>
              At this point it is necessary to destroy the
              political and economic power of the financial aristocracy. A resolution
              to the economic crisis can only begin with an independent mass movement
              of the working class that aims to break the political stranglehold of
              the financial elite over society; the development, to be blunt, of a
              revolutionary movement.</div>

              <p>Wah . . SO long ... I can only read the blue text then ....</p>
              <p>I think there is serious doubt in the statement that the idea that the finance people have no incentives to work and look for other high paying jobs when the salaries are capped. Given their track record and limited experience in other industries , I do not think people will employ them. The change in pay scale will also be too big as well should they leave their industries.</p>
              <p>I still think that it is a good start for the pay cap and better than not doing anything. What else do you realistically want to expect?</p>
              <p>Of cos one can argue that direct salaries changes is not good enough too. There are always lots of other ways that the management can change the payout to the benefits of the top performers or people sitting in the high post.</p>
