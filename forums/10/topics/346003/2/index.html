              <p><br>as i said, there is no immediate remedy, the only chance now is the complete remove of all insitution peoples who are running the show, reposition themselve and re appoint top capable peoples to run the show. Congress must show the whip and not alway provide the carrot. Restructuring is not key (as the chinese said, change the soup, but ingredient still the same), re-engineering is the key, hard it maybe, but it is the only way...ie a complete remove of all and rebuilt again.</p>

              <p>Likewise, think first than talk. If Obama was truly a man of the people, he would abolish the Fed, which has been waging economic warfare on the American people since 1913, destroying the value of the Dollar.

              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">To:  U.S. Congress</span></p>
              <p>Ron Paul Is Right – It Is Time To Abolish the Federal Reserve 
              <br> <br> Today in August 2007, the world financial systems and investment
              markets, real estate and the availability of credit are all under
              direct assault due to past actions of the Federal Reserve in the United
              States. <br> <br> We the undersigned now call on Congress to Abolish the Federal Reserve
              System. The latest boom, mania and subsequent bust in the stock market,
              real estate, asset prices and now credit around the world are the
              direct result of easy money policies of the FED designed to enhance the
              profits of certain financial special interests. Now in 2007, ultimately
              as usual, the unsophisticated American middle and working class
              investors and borrowers who believed all the hype will pay the price in
              financial losses. <br> <br> Wall Street’s” business as usual” call for the FED to intervene and
              bail out the corporate perpetrators of the scam is like asking a child
              molester to run a day care center or a drug dealer to teach our
              children all about drugs. The private banker owned FED is the cause of
              our problems not the solution. <br> <br> Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in secret at Jekyll Island,
              Georgia in 1913, “middle and working-class Americans have been
              victimized by a boom-and-bust monetary policy. In addition, most
              Americans have suffered a steadily eroding purchasing power because of
              the Federal Reserve's inflationary policies. This represents a real, if
              hidden, tax imposed on the American people….
              <br> <br>From the Great Depression, to the stagflation of the seventies, to
              the burst of the dotcom bubble last year, every economic downturn
              suffered by the country over the last 80 years can be traced to Federal
              Reserve policy. The Fed has followed a consistent policy of flooding
              the economy with easy money, leading to a misallocation of resources
              and an artificial "boom" followed by a recession or depression when the
              Fed-created bubble bursts.” - Congressman Ron Paul, U.S. House of
              Representatives September 10, 2002
              <br> <br>GOP Presidential Candidate Ron Paul was right back in 2002 and he
              is right today about abolishing the Federal Reserve and the necessity
              for the United State to return to a Gold Standard in order to protect
              the dollar from political and Wall Street banker manipulations which
              ultimately will destroy the dollar as a store of value and the
              financial security of millions of American investors and other innocent
              hard working citizens around the world. <br> <br> For more information, read Ron Paul’s speech before Congress at:

              <p>Exactly. Since the Fed is a privately-owned bank, which loans money to the US Govt, the hand that gives is above the hand that takes. And considering that the US Congress has the authority to coin its own money according to the US Constitution, its absurd why the US Govt should borrow money from the Fed.</p>

              <p>Its not even the speech or even about Ron Paul himself. Its about the idea. That a government should print its own currency as value, not borrow it from a privately-owned central bank at interest, creating money as debt. This is the fundamental problem that so many wilfully fail to see because its not "mainstream".</p>
              <p>As long as the Fed continues to exist, the so-called elected representative of the People will continue to be subservient to people who create the money, which is the privately-owned Fed.</p>

So the yearly pay is nothing once he gets in the office . It will be even better if he is successful and start writing books about it.
