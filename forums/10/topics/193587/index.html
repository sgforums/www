            <div class='col-md body'>Is this what we have to live with as they raise public transport fares and charges???<br><br>Looks like fares have gone to heavenly heights and service standards gone to hell!<br><br>====================================================<br>FREAK TAXI ACCIDENT<br><br>Panicking husband says: I thought I was going to lose her<br>&gt;Couple gets out after paying cabby<br>&gt;But wife, 74, is slow. Cabby does not notice and drives off<br>&gt;She hits road, suffers fracture, cuts and bruises<br>By Tan May Ping<br><br>June 02, 2006<br><br>AT this time every year, Madam Tan Gim Goh would be holed up in her kitchen making close to 400 bak chang (rice dumplings) for her eight grown-up children and their families.<br><br>Mr Ng feeding his wife, who needs help just to sit up or bathe. --Pics/CHONG JUN LIANG<br>But this year, she is in no shape to do anything of the sort.<br><br>Her left arm is in a sling because of a fracture and she has bruises on her body.<br><br>She is in pain and spends most of her time in bed.<br><br>She needs help just to sit up and cannot bathe or look after herself.<br><br>Madam Tan, 74, was involved in an accident while getting out of a taxi.<br><br>It happened on 20 May when she and her husband, Mr Ng Eng Thong, 82, took the taxi from their Choa Chu Kang home to HarbourFront to attend the opening ceremony of a relative's shop.<br><br>When they arrived at the HarbourFront taxi stand just after 1pm, Mr Ng, who was sitting in front, paid the fare and alighted.<br><br>His wife, who was slower in getting out, had just put her left foot on the road and was still half in the taxi when it moved off.<br><br>MOVED OFF FAST<br><br>Madam Tan being helped into bed by her husband and one of her daughters, Madam Ng Lian Geok.<br>Mr Ng recounted in Hokkien: 'I had just taken one step away from the taxi when he started to move off very fast. He didn't look back to see if my wife had alighted.'<br><br>Madam Tan was knocked off her feet, fractured her left shoulder and bruised her left hand badly. She had cuts on her right knee and upper lip.<br><br>She was quiet and in a state of shock after she fell, said Mr Ng. And when he saw his wife like that, he panicked and started shivering.<br><br>'At that point, I thought I was going to lose her,' recalled Mr Ng, who has been married for 55 years.<br><br>The cabby didn't notice that his passenger had fallen till several people at the taxi stand shouted for him to stop.<br><br>As four passers-by and Mr Ng attended to Madam Tan, he got out of his taxi and apologised.<br><br>The Comfort cabby has been given a final warning and demerit points due to the severity of the accident. (See report on facing page.)<br><br>Mr Ng then asked him to drive them to the Singapore General Hospital. During the journey, Mr Ng said he scolded the driver for being reckless.<br><br>By the time they arrived at the hospital, Madam Tan's blood pressure had shot up and she had to be admitted. She takes regular medication to control hypertension.<br><br>They made a police report at the hospital's police post on the same day. Later she had blood in her stools, and underwent gastroscopy and colonoscopy during her eight-day stay in hospital.<br><br>She was found to have gastritis, but was cleared otherwise, and discharged on Saturday. Mr Ng said the cabby visited his wife twice after the accident.<br><br>Meanwhile, Madam Tan's children are upset to see their mother so helpless. Gone are her trips to the market or mahjong games with her friends.<br><br>HOLIDAY PLANS SCUTTLED?<br><br>Her plans to visit one of her daughters in the United States this year may have to be shelved.<br><br>Her youngest child, Madam Jessie Ng, 40, said Madam Tan had been taking care of her two children until the accident.<br><br>Madam Ng, who contacted Comfort on the day of the accident, claimed: 'I expected them to do something about it, but I ended up having to call many times.<br><br>'They said that if we have any claims, we have to speak with their insurer directly.' Since the accident, Madam Tan's children have been taking turns to watch over her.<br><br>But as most of them are working and have their own families, they are concerned about her long-term medical needs.<br><br>Madam Tan lives with her husband and youngest son, who has to go to work.<br><br>She said in Hokkien: 'I'm slightly better, although it still hurts. But I feel helpless. I can't do things on my own and I'm afraid that I won't recover.<br><br>'I'm very scared to take a taxi or car, so I don't want to go out.'<br><br>Mr Ng will not be taking chances in future too.<br><br>He said: 'Next time, I'm going to tell the driver to make sure we are out of the taxi before he drives off.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Driver's first offence, but he gets stiff penalty<br><br>COMFORTDELGRO, which owns Comfort, told The New Paper that it was dismayed to learn of the incident and had immediately conducted a thorough investigation after Madam Jessie Ng made the report.<br><br>Said Ms Tammy Tan, its group corporate communications officer: 'We had advised her to liaise directly with our insurance department with regard to medical claims.<br><br>'Unfortunately, our external insurer did not return the passenger's daughter's call. We have since communicated our displeasure with the lapse in service to our external insurer.'<br><br>The driver was remorseful over what had happened, Ms Tan said.<br><br>She added: 'The driver, who was very apologetic, took the passenger to the Singapore General Hospital for a medical checkup.'<br><br>Though it was the driver's first offence, he was given a final warning and demerit points because of the seriousness of what happened.<br></div>
