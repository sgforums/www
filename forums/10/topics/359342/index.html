              <p>What is the agenda of this TS in spreading false information - that is nothing more then an attempt at a sly effort in disinformation simply to discredit the Israelis ?</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Madsen"> What is the acronym in WMR ? Who is Wayne Madsen that created WMR ?. </a></p>
              <p>Is it not odd that in the WMR report it had observed and reported that - "Although corporate media is focusing on the war in Sri Lanka, and much has been said about Sri Lanka's military purchases from China, there is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://onlinejournal.com/artman/publish/article_4677.shtml">little mention is made of Sri Lanka’s military links with Israel. " ?</a></p>
              <p>Can Israel be buying old weapons from Cambodia and passing it along to the Tamil Tigers - when Israel has multi-million dollar contracts in selling and maintaining the Israeli designed and built Kfir Jets ?</p>
              <p>Israel had been contracted by Sri Lankan Air Force to send their technical specialists to assist in the maintenance of the Russian built MIG-29 jets.</p>
              <p>Besides the technical support given, at Sri Lanka's request - Israel had even sent their military advisers to give "technical advise" in electronic intelligence, military tactics and strategies in the field.</p>
              <p>If the report holds any truth, what would it achieve for Israel to be involved in any 'double dealings' - when <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.tamilnation.org/intframe/us/86tic.htm">Israeli and Sri Lankan military co-operation had existed since 1984 ?</a> </p>
              <p>Do you seriously expect anyone to believe this piece of wild speculation that is no better then an attempt at disinformation ?</p>
              <p>Does this disinformation serve your anti-Israeli agenda ?</p>

              <p>Double dealing happen everywhere and in every business, i studied the watergate issue, the double agents of CIA and all those history of Russian spies. Everybody and eveyone of us in our life had to do a double dealing, the govt had to deal with the workers and employers, the waiter have to deal with the customers and his captain, men hv to deal with their career and family. I hv to deal with my pub and the gals. I guess so do you, but the equation is to strike a balance, if arm broker or stock broker you hv deal with the seller and buyer, that is your jobs. And let me tell you that in business, if you are spending your own money after 10 or 5 years of initial start up, you better close shop. Broker are the most tongue twister of all, cos nothing belong to them, not the arms, not the fish, not the stocks, etc etc, they are the middle men, sell or buy, they earn from both side. But not everyone have the capability to be a broker, you need the skill ya.</p>

              <p>When times are bad, one has to be more creative to extract the maximum from what is available. If there are more drinkers but only a few glasses are bought by each customer - you should be more creative to entice them to buy more at lower prices, which will result in larger volume of returns.</p>
              <p>Many businesses continue to be dogmatic by insisting on fixed profit margins per bottle, and fail to see that profit can be increased by volume sales when prices are lowered slightly.</p>
              <p>Other methods can be created to improve the less noticed effects that can lead to higher drinking - such as a more comfortable environment provided by clean air, side-line competitive games and entertainment that inflate proud ego of the drinkers.</p>

              <p>Double dealing happen everywhere and in every business, i
              studied the watergate issue, the double agents of CIA and all those
              history of Russian spies. Everybody and eveyone of us in our life
              had to do a double dealing, the govt had to deal with the workers
              and employers, the waiter have to deal with the customers and his
              captain, men hv to deal with their career and family. I hv to deal
              with my pub and the gals. I guess so do you, but the equation is to
              strike a balance, if arm broker or stock broker you hv deal with
              the seller and buyer, that is your jobs. And let me tell you
              that in business, if you are spending your own money after 10 or 5
              years of initial start up, you better close shop. Broker are the
              most tongue twister of all, cos nothing belong to them, not the
              arms, not the fish, not the stocks, etc etc, they are the middle
              men, sell or buy, they earn from both side. But not everyone have
              the capability to be a broker, you need the skill ya.</p>

              <p>If you cannot sleep after drinking, it shows you did not drink enough with your customers, and set the tone for the evening.</p>
              <p>When times are bad, one has to be more creative to extract the maximum from what is available. If there are more drinkers but only a few glasses are bought by each customer - you should be more creative to entice them to buy more at lower prices, which will result in larger volume of returns.</p>
              <p>Many businesses continue to be dogmatic by insisting on fixed profit margins per bottle, and fail to see that profit can be increased by volume sales when prices are lowered slightly.</p>
              <p>Other methods can be created to improve the less noticed effects that can lead to higher drinking - such as a more comfortable environment provided by clean air, side-line competitive games and entertainment that inflate proud ego of the drinkers.</p>

              <p><br>ah!!! Yawn!! just wait up, wee! lunch liao, wha fish porridge, not bad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh yes, i am trying my best to be creative here, I am wearing shorter and shorter skirt and told my gals to wear lower and lower navel clothing. It does attract a few chi ko peh. I have also joint venture with the nearby seafood restaurant to provide foods if customer required, of course i marked up the price lah. We are also slashing the cleaners here, ask them to go home and fry cuttlefish, that mean FIRE THEM. Then me and my gals and the rest of them do more multi tasking lor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Alamak, just like a stock broker or a housing agents, up or down, he takes the 2 to 5% commissions depending on his negiotation, or even 1% if he wish to attract more customers, but brokers have their rules, they cannot sabo each other even tho they are competitors, but nevertheless, peoples dun mind paying more for a good good service. Whether you sell yr stock at a lost or gain, they still take the commission. But of cos, if you keep losing under him, he is gone case, no one will go for him. Just like a child, she has to deal with her parents and school teachers, let say she had a quarrel with a classmate in school, so the parents ask her at home, she will say everything is fine, and when the teacher ask her, she will say i know i am wrong, i had even informed my parents and they hv forgive me, i promise i will not quarrel in school anymore. So, you see, as a child, we already learn to deal with both side of our life. I am not saying that child is naughty but i simply said she is a smart kid.</p>
