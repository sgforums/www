              <p>My house was harassed by loan shark since Feb 26, 2009. 
                                      Police reports were made each time.</p>
              <p>G/20090226/,G/20090227/0064,G/20090302/0095,G/20090403/0187
                                      &amp; G/20090416/0138</p>
              <p>The loan shark claimed that my mum was a guarantor for her
                                      friend which my mum denied. The debt which was $1000 is increased
                                      to $3000 instantly as my mum argued with the loan shark over the
                                      phone.  He said that he no longer want to chase after the
                                      debtor's $1000 and now only aim at my house / mum to compensate him
                                      $3000 for arguing with him over the phone. On top of that, each
                                      time his runners splash paint, we have to pay him extra $500 and
                                      interests too.</p>
              <p>The whole thing starts with my mum's friend but her house not
                                      being harass by loan shark recently.  Whatever information,
                                      such as the loan shark hangout, contact details, etc., the friend
                                      gives us was duly reported to the police.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Advised by the police, we changed
                                      our home contact number to avoid contact with the loan shark, and
                                      were told that usually they will come less frequently when no money
                                      was given to the loan shark. </span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Now
                                      things seems to get worse</span>, they start splashing paint at
                                      mine &amp; my neighbours' doors and start they coming during
                                      daytime to do the job more regularly.</span></p>
              <p>I am very worried for my neighbours' children's as well as my
                                      own children's safety.  What if they meet face-to-face with
                                      the loan shark's runners when coming home from school?</p>
              <p>I am going crazy soon. Waiting at home for my son to reach home
                                      safely while taking care of my toddler. Each time the runner splash
                                      paint, my heart start beating very fast and my mind start thinking
                                      wild.  <span style="color: #ff0000;">Other then waiting for
                                      the loan shark to stop, what can I do???  My son starts
                                      feeling the pressure and neighbours giving us looks.</span></p>
              <p>What can I do???????????????????????????</p>

              IF you give them money, there will be no end to this. You don't lose much from paint splashing, but if they are caught once, they are screwed.

              <p>My house was harassed by loan shark since Feb 26, 2009. 
              Police reports were made each time.</p>
              <p>G/20090226/,G/20090227/0064,G/20090302/0095,G/20090403/0187
              &amp; G/20090416/0138</p>
              <p>The loan shark claimed that my mum was a guarantor for her
              friend which my mum denied. The debt which was $1000 is increased
              to $3000 instantly as my mum argued with the loan shark over the
              phone.  He said that he no longer want to chase after the
              debtor's $1000 and now only aim at my house / mum to compensate him
              $3000 for arguing with him over the phone. On top of that, each
              time his runners splash paint, we have to pay him extra $500 and
              interests too.</p>
              <p>The whole thing starts with my mum's friend but her house not
              being harass by loan shark recently.  Whatever information,
              such as the loan shark hangout, contact details, etc., the friend
              gives us was duly reported to the police.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Advised by the police, we changed
              our home contact number to avoid contact with the loan shark, and
              were told that usually they will come less frequently when no money
              was given to the loan shark. </span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Now
              things seems to get worse</span>, they start splashing paint at
              mine &amp; my neighbours' doors and start they coming during
              daytime to do the job more regularly.</span></p>
              <p>I am very worried for my neighbours' children's as well as my
              own children's safety.  What if they meet face-to-face with
              the loan shark's runners when coming home from school?</p>
              <p>I am going crazy soon. Waiting at home for my son to reach home
              safely while taking care of my toddler. Each time the runner splash
              paint, my heart start beating very fast and my mind start thinking
              wild.  <span style="color: #ff0000;">Other then waiting for
              the loan shark to stop, what can I do???  My son starts
              feeling the pressure and neighbours giving us looks.</span></p>
              <p>What can I do???????????????????????????</p>

              <p>Chances are.. your mom really never become any guarantor to her friend.</p>

              <p>Ah long or loan sharks are business people. They are not as unreasonable as you think.</p>
              <p>There are so many con cases which people are conned of their money.. because the con guys called up family members and make claims about debts the other family members owe, which is untrue. So out of fear.. they paid up, only to realise it was a con job all along.</p>
              <p>If the police are not acting on your case.. something is really wrong. I'm starting to wonder if the local police are getting any kick backs from these kind of extortion ? Are the top dogs sleeping ?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Home Affairs Ministry is considering making borrowing from loansharks an offence in the country. <br><br>Speaking at the annual Police Workplan seminar on Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng noted that while the overall crime figure has fallen by three per cent from January to March this year as compared to the same period in 2008, unlicensed moneylending harassment cases for this period have almost doubled. <br><br>It has gone up from 2,066 cases to 3,993 cases. <br><br><strong>To step up efforts to combat this public menace, police have recently acquired more CCTVs which will be installed at harassment-prone sites to detect loansharks and harassers in the act. <br><br>Mr Wong said such CCTV footage will also aid police investigations. <br></strong><br>Another step would be to make borrowing from loansharks an offence. <br><br>He said this would hold borrowers accountable if their reckless borrowing or gambling habits endanger the safety and security of the community. <br><br>The Home Affairs Minister revealed that from the arrests made, police conclude that many borrowers eventually joined the loanshark criminal organisation as runners to carry out harassment and vandalism - hence the need to nip the problem decisively on the bud. <br><br>Mr Wong also touched on manpower challenges being faced by the Singapore Police Force. <br><br>He said the Ministry recognised that resources were stretched and it has been working with police commanders and senior leaders to address this. <br><br>The Ministry will be creating 220 new frontline staff posts at existing Neighbourhood Police Centres. <br>- CNA/yb</span></p></div>
