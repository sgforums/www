              hey TS, fret not!
              I'm in the exact same situation as u except that the loansharks had nv come to my home to splash paint.
              
              My bro wanted to buy a condo with 1 of his fren n approached a real estate agent from biggest (if not, 1 of the biggest) real estate agency in SG. The deal felt thru n was called off. What happened next was extremely unethnical, the agent used my bro's as well as his fren's particulars as guarantor to borrow $$ from loansharks. The agent had photocopies of my bro's IC n details as well. All these was done without my bro's knowledge n consent. My home started receiving calls from loansharks out of the blue around late Jan this year threatening to come splash paint n chain our gates.
              
              As expected, my family was seriously traumatised n my parents become paranoid, jumping at everything. The loansharks have full details abt my bro's particulars n there's nothing we can do. We called the police countless times, went down to NPC to makes reports a few times n also went down to CID to make our report. After so long, nothing seems to be done, the calls r still coming but not as frequent as before. Desperate, my parents went to look for the MP in our GRC n the MP said ours is not the 1st case n told us we should leave it to the police to handle, he said wat he can do is to write a letter to CID to place our case on top priority. My parents told him that they want to seek media attention with regards to the real estate agency involved but he advised my parents not to do so n i have no idea why.
              
              I will not reveal the name of the company here but i can only say they r the biggest (if not, 1 of the biggest) real estate agency in Singapore. This is damn unethnical, imagine u wanna buy a 2nd hand HDB flat n the agent uses ur particulars to borrow $$ from loansharks. How can this be happening in Singapore n we r helpless abt it???
              
              And guess wat? The exact same thing happens to my neighbour but their case is buy insurance from insurance company n the agent used their particulars to borrow $$ from loansharks. For their case, the loanshark's runners came to splash paint 6 times with different colours each time. For my case, the loanshark's runners nv come to my home, they only called my home repeatedly.
              
              My bro went to the real estate agency but it appears that the company is trying to shrink its responsibilities by saying the agent is no longer working in that company. BUT all these happened when the agent was still working in that company!!! 
              
              For now, we r ignoring the persistent calls (we have caller id n the loansharks r using "private number" to call us). The loansharks also always tell us that we owe them different amt of money each time they call. I will always ask them when was the loan made n how much it was, n each time their answers will be different. Once it was loan $1k n return $3k, another time was loan $10k n return $20k n the dates will always be different.
              
              Oh yah 1 more thing, the loanshark who kept calling my home has a deep Malaysian chinese accent n he speaks hokkien and mandarin. TS, my advice to u - DO NOT PAY THOSE FAGGOTS ANY MONEY or it will be like u r acknowledging that ur mum is the guarantor. For my case, the last resort is to seek media attention n get everything to come to light.

              Yes, you are right, police don't do anything. They should arrange hundred's of plainclothes ambush daily at each of the block. It's very easy to execute, and don't need much manpower. you are so smart, you should be the chief of police.

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Home Affairs Ministry is
                  considering making borrowing from loansharks an offence in the
                  country.<br> <br> Speaking at the annual Police Workplan seminar on Thursday, Deputy
                  Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng noted that
                  while the overall crime figure has fallen by three per cent from
                  January to March this year as compared to the same period in 2008,
                  unlicensed moneylending harassment cases for this period have
                  almost doubled.<br> <br> It has gone up from 2,066 cases to 3,993 cases.<br> <br> <strong>To step up efforts to combat this public menace, police
                  have recently acquired more CCTVs which will be installed at
                  harassment-prone sites to detect loansharks and harassers in the
                  act.<br> <br> Mr Wong said such CCTV footage will also aid police
                  investigations.<br></strong><br> Another step would be to make borrowing from loansharks an
                  offence.<br> <br> He said this would hold borrowers accountable if their reckless
                  borrowing or gambling habits endanger the safety and security of
                  the community.<br> <br> The Home Affairs Minister revealed that from the arrests made,
                  police conclude that many borrowers eventually joined the loanshark
                  criminal organisation as runners to carry out harassment and
                  vandalism - hence the need to nip the problem decisively on the
                  bud.<br> <br> Mr Wong also touched on manpower challenges being faced by the
                  Singapore Police Force.<br> <br> He said the Ministry recognised that resources were stretched and
                  it has been working with police commanders and senior leaders to
                  address this.<br> <br> The Ministry will be creating 220 new frontline staff posts at
                  existing Neighbourhood Police Centres.<br> - CNA/yb</span></p>

              <p>Are they serious ? Oh good grief !</p>
              <p>So , how are they gonna differentiate real borrowers from innocents victims  ? Like if someone gets paint splashed on their front door.. they MUST be guilty of borrowing from loan sharks ? Or are the loan sharks gonna send the police a list of debtors ? DUH ? either way.. how are they gonna verify ?</p>
              <p>Sure.. when that gets implemented.. nobody would dare tell the police they got harrassed by loansharks or conmen. Good for the police.. less complaints less resources needed for the job. Labour issue SOLVED... wtf !</p>
              <p>C'mon man.... instead of going for the culprit.. they go after the victims.</p>

              <p>Ok.. so you put more receptionists in the NPC.. big deal .</p>
              <p>Why not field more police to get the loan sharkies ?</p>
              <p>The only difference between loan sharks and finance companies , one is illegal the other one is legal.</p>

              <p>So , how are they gonna differentiate real borrowers from

              their front door.. they MUST be guilty of borrowing from loan
              sharks ? Or are the loan sharks gonna send the police a list of
              debtors ? DUH ? either way.. how are they gonna verify ?</p>
              <p>Sure.. when that gets implemented.. nobody would dare tell the
              police they got harrassed by loansharks or conmen. Good for the
              police.. less complaints less resources needed for the job. Labour
              issue SOLVED... wtf !</p>

              well, you see, banks and money lending coorporations don't lend money to people who can't pay back. because they can't pay back.
              
              The US market collaspe is basically alot of loans the banks make become bad loans,and they cannot pay back.
              
              These people still die die want to borrow money, so they go to the only guys who is willing to take the risk, albert with higher interest.
              
              
              so that's the situation. how will you suggest to improve it?
              
              I have no idea how to solve this though...

              <p>great ... this is getting funny ... don't make me spill my

              <p>let's review your classic statement again</p>

              each of the block." (SIC)</p>
              <p>so loanshark splashes paint on this floor outside this unit on
              this block .... you, the brillant one, would have the police stake
              out the entire constituency, munching donuts around each block ?
              ....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>sure, I know it's your lame attempt at sacarsm, but you
              obviously haven't give a lot of thought to that .... and the

              <p>can't you just imagine a guy, typing away at the key board, than agreeing with you that he had made a mistake? or do you imagine me to be a little kid holding my balls for making an english mistake about the ambush thingie, throwing a fit and stuff?</p>
              <p>haha, if i can't accept making mistake, than i will be leading a very stress life. I do make mistake, apologize for it, and life goes on... </p>

              <p>And so again, have i said anything in the defence of the police? Why must i defend the police?</p>
