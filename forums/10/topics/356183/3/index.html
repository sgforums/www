              The US market collaspe is basically alot of loans the banks make
              become bad loans,and they cannot pay back. These people still die
              die want to borrow money, so they go to the only guys who is
              willing to take the risk, albert with higher interest. so that's

              <p>even small loan like 3k can be financed, i believe. not too sure, have to ask the expert.</p>
              <p>loaning out 10k, no question ask sounds reckless though. I have no solution for that, and i highly discourage anyone to actually lend money out like that, unless they are trusted friends and relatives.</p>
              <p>for the USA thingie, that sounds like borrowing from the company, or boss. well, people here do borrow from the boss sometimes, i believe, as in get pay advancement.</p>

              <p>even small loan like 3k can be financed, i believe. not too

              <p>loaning out 10k, no question ask sounds reckless though. I have
              no solution for that, and i highly discourage anyone to actually
              lend money out like that, unless they are trusted friends and
              relatives.</p>
              <p>for the USA thingie, that sounds like borrowing from the
              company, or boss. well, people here do borrow from the boss
              sometimes, i believe, as in get pay advancement.</p>

              <p>Yes, people do borrow from their own bosses.. and their collateral is their jobs.</p>
              <p>There's always some form of borrowings big or small ..and the lenders usually has some form of collateral.</p>
              <p>Even between friends and relatives.. its based on trusts. And the collateral is the relationship.</p>
              <p>Banks are not high risk takers. Loan sharks are just another form of financial institution.</p>

              <p>haha, the rest i didn't really read, but again, why should i defend the police?</p>

              <p>ah ... so now they are good, but just not good enough ? .....
              great .... so we have half a common ground ... then, no ?</p>
              <p>but then ... wat was your original statement about then ? ...
              once again, was it a brain burp ? an "error" on your part ? ... or
              really, a failed attempt at sacarsm that blew up in your face that
              had you backpedalling till now ? ....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this is your original statement ......"<strong>Yes, you are
              right, police don't do anything. They should arrange hundred's of
              plainclothes ambush daily at each of the block.</strong>"</p>
              <p>okie ... We've already established the stupidty of the second
              part of that statement .... but so now you're saying that they are
              good ... but not good enough .... is that your final answer ? ....
              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>let's assume that is for now, lock this in before any more
              backpedalling occurs ..so ... you don't like what I said should be
              done by the police about this problem ...</p>
              <p>so what do you suggest the police do then, brilliant  ? ...
              or you're the sort who'd only snipe and deride what other people
              are saying, but is really empty headed when asked what to do ?
              ....</p>
              <p>I'd assume so .... let's look at another quote ....</p>
              <p>"<strong>and what job? i didn't volunteer to do any
              job</strong>" (SIC) ... oh yeah, sure ... I know the type ... the
              type who just lurk around sniping at other people's responses ....
              but when refuse to come up with something more than these
              "<strong>and what job? i didn't volunteer to do any job. I was
              saying you are perfect for the job, since you are so
              smart"</strong> .... </p>
              <p>but of course .... in the mind of skythewood ... the police are
              trying their best ... and everything is fine .....</p>
              <p>5 police reports so far .... and counting .....</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I think is thousands of report and counting... i believe this is not the first and only case of paint splashing by loan sharks.</p>
