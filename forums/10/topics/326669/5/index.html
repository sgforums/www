              <p>Try telling that to this chap:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(words of Chia Thia Poh)<br><br>“They tried very hard to break prisoners, to extract confessions from them, to have them confess on television. They made me pay a very high price for not kowtowing to them.<br><br>In 1966 they put me in a dark cell and said some people had gone insane under such circumstances. Sometimes you could hear people kicking the doors as if they had gone insane. I went from one prison to another and was in solitary confinement several times. Sometimes I was deprived of reading material for months at a stretch. They said that there's no end to this, that it will go on year after year if I don't confess, that even if I'm made of steel, they have means to break me.<br><br>I told them that I had nothing to confess, and that if the government had the evidence it should try me in an open court, where I could see the evidence against me and defend myself.<br><br>There were day-long interrogations in a freezing cold room. They pressurised my family. But I always thought, no matter how long they keep me in this way, some day they will have to release me, because I'm innocent and I have support. It's part of the broad struggle for democracy all over the world.<br><br>When you are in solitary, there is nothing in the cell. But you can explore, and see faint scribblings from previous prisoners. I still remember one of them. It was a poem in Chinese:<br><br>”Ten years behind bars<br>Never too late<br>Thousands of ordeals<br>My spirit steeled.“<br><br>When you were alone and helpless, and you saw things like that, you were encouraged.”<br><br>“The best part of my life was taken away just like that, without even a charge let alone a trial in the court.”<br>-Chia Thye Poh 1998</p>

              <p>In politic, who dare wins, i guess during that time, it was in a critical stage of power struggle, a stage whereby our nation was still in it infant,very fragile and skeptical to chaos, therefore, whoever lead will try to down his opponents and put peace in to it, as peace is essential for a nation as it is one of the building pillar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let say if Mr Chia was the govt and head of the state, do you think he would not imprison LKY and torture him??? I guess it will be the same or more worst. What you see is only one side of the story, what really happen, nobody knows, we must therefore be more liberal in looking at an issue, and you have to agree me, that we make mistakes in our life, a part of all human nature. But given what LKY did for our country, bring us as a little red dot to a world class cosmopolitan, a shelter with comfort zone, work, play, peace and harmony, he deserve to be respected.</p>

              <p>Guys stop the personal insults please, everyone here are well educated and intelligent, thanks to the internet. Singaporeans are no longer ignorant about political issues.</p>
              <p>It is up to the individual to decide and excercise their votes.</p>
              <p>I believe in time to come, the opposition will grow stronger.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans will come to realise the importance of voting the candidate who will best serve their interests. We would want more voice in the decision making of our country. Decisions that will affect our children, our grandchildren and their children too.</p>
              <p>Time is our friend and it has proven that the decisions made by the garmen now does not serve the majority interests of Singaporeans. It is up to the individual to judge. Has the PAP performed beyond or under your expectations?</p>
              <p>I think the Bear said this before, "the best gift that your parents can give you is an independent mindset and the ability to do what you love". The political party that can achieve this by not using force on the people will be the ultimate winner. Only time can tell. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
