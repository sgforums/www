              <p><span class="title"> ‘Nothing to do with political freedom’ </span></p>
              <div id="articleBody" class="artText"><span> <span style="color: #666666;"><strong> MM’s press sec responds to WSJ editorial on Chees’ case </strong></span>
              <div> </div>
              THE libel case against Dr Chee Soon Juan and his sister had nothing to do with political freedom in Singapore.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Instead, “it was for defamation
              arising from the Chees’ false claims” that Prime Minister Lee Hsien
              Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew “are criminaland corrupt”.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              These were among the points
              raised by Madam Yeong Yoon Ying, press secretary to MM Lee, in her
              letter to the Asian edition of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). Mdm Yeong
              was responding to the newspaper’s editorial titled Democracy in
              Singapore, which was :published yesterday.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “Your editorial ... relying on
              a ‘partial transcript’, has misunderstood the issue in the libel case
              involving Dr Chee Soon Juan and his sister,” Mdm Yeong said.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              In its editorial last
              Thursday, the newspaper had offered its readers a glimpse of what it
              described as a “David-vs-Goliath exchange” between Dr Chee, the head of
              the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), and MM Lee during last month’s
              court hearing to assess damages arising from the defamation suit.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              In 2006, the Chees lost the
              suit brought by PM Lee and MM Lee over an articleDr Chee had published
              in the SDP newsletter, which drew parallels between governance in the
              old National Kidney Foundation and the Singapore Government.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Referring to a partial
              transcript of the courtroom exchange between MM Lee and Dr Chee, the
              editorial noted: “Mr Chee is no orator, and on one level the dissident
              was no match for the eloquent Mr Lee. But when the subject turned to
              the moral underpinnings of democracy — freedoms of speech, assembly and
              association — the debate went game, set and match toMr Chee.”
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              In her letter, Mdm Yeong noted
              thatthe Chees had failed “to produce credibledefence or evidence to
              back up their claims”. She added: “Having lost, Dr Chee in open court
              then called the Singapore leaders ‘murderers, robbers, child molesters’
              and ‘rapists’. The Chees also rebuked the judge, ignored her orders and
              shouted her down.”
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Mdm Yeong’s letter prompted Dr
              Chee to pen his own response. In a letter to the WSJ — which was also
              posted on his party’s website — Dr Chee challenged her statement that
              he had called the Singapore leaders by such names.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “The outrageousness of Mdm
              Yeong’s lie borders on the comedic. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, or his counsel, is
              in possession of court transcripts and audio-recordings that would show
              whether I had uttered those words. He must now produce the part of the
              transcript that quotes me saying those words or he risks destroying his
              own credibility,” Dr Chee wrote.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The WSJ editorial had also
              said that since the MM Lee–Dr Chee exchange took place in a courtroom,
              the dialogue is “therefore privileged — which means we can report it

              THE libel case against Dr Chee Soon Juan and his sister had nothing to do with political freedom in Singapore.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Instead, “it was for defamation
              arising from the Chees’ false claims” that Prime Minister Lee Hsien
              Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew “are criminaland corrupt”.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              These were among the points
              raised by Madam Yeong Yoon Ying, press secretary to MM Lee, in her
              letter to the Asian edition of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). Mdm Yeong
              was responding to the newspaper’s editorial titled Democracy in
              Singapore, which was :published yesterday.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “Your editorial ... relying on
              a ‘partial transcript’, has misunderstood the issue in the libel case
              involving Dr Chee Soon Juan and his sister,” Mdm Yeong said.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              In its editorial last
              Thursday, the newspaper had offered its readers a glimpse of what it
              described as a “David-vs-Goliath exchange” between Dr Chee, the head of
              the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), and MM Lee during last month’s
              court hearing to assess damages arising from the defamation suit.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              In 2006, the Chees lost the
              suit brought by PM Lee and MM Lee over an articleDr Chee had published
              in the SDP newsletter, which drew parallels between governance in the
              old National Kidney Foundation and the Singapore Government.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Referring to a partial
              transcript of the courtroom exchange between MM Lee and Dr Chee, the
              editorial noted: “Mr Chee is no orator, and on one level the dissident
              was no match for the eloquent Mr Lee. But when the subject turned to
              the moral underpinnings of democracy — freedoms of speech, assembly and
              association — the debate went game, set and match toMr Chee.”
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              In her letter, Mdm Yeong noted
              thatthe Chees had failed “to produce credibledefence or evidence to
              back up their claims”. She added: “Having lost, Dr Chee in open court
              then called the Singapore leaders ‘murderers, robbers, child molesters’
              and ‘rapists’. The Chees also rebuked the judge, ignored her orders and
              shouted her down.”
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Mdm Yeong’s letter prompted Dr
              Chee to pen his own response. In a letter to the WSJ — which was also
              posted on his party’s website — Dr Chee challenged her statement that
              he had called the Singapore leaders by such names.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “The outrageousness of Mdm
              Yeong’s lie borders on the comedic. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, or his counsel, is
              in possession of court transcripts and audio-recordings that would show
              whether I had uttered those words. He must now produce the part of the
              transcript that quotes me saying those words or he risks destroying his
              own credibility,” Dr Chee wrote.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The WSJ editorial had also
