              <p><br>so aside from posting in sgforums in bold and red --- here's the big question --- HOW TO SUPPORT?</p>
              <p>seemingly the right thing to do is to post in sgforums about supporting these people....</p>
              <p>rather pathetic strategic, if I may say so.</p>

              <p>Try telling that to this chap:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(words of Chia Thia Poh)<br> <br> “They tried very hard to break prisoners, to extract confessions from
              them, to have them confess on television. They made me pay a very high
              price for not kowtowing to them.<br> <br> In 1966 they put me in a dark cell and said some people had gone insane
              under such circumstances. Sometimes you could hear people kicking the
              doors as if they had gone insane. I went from one prison to another and
              was in solitary confinement several times. Sometimes I was deprived of
              reading material for months at a stretch. They said that there's no end
              to this, that it will go on year after year if I don't confess, that
              even if I'm made of steel, they have means to break me.<br> <br> I told them that I had nothing to confess, and that if the government
              had the evidence it should try me in an open court, where I could see
              the evidence against me and defend myself.<br> <br> There were day-long interrogations in a freezing cold room. They
              pressurised my family. But I always thought, no matter how long they
              keep me in this way, some day they will have to release me, because I'm
              innocent and I have support. It's part of the broad struggle for
              democracy all over the world.<br> <br> When you are in solitary, there is nothing in the cell. But you can
              explore, and see faint scribblings from previous prisoners. I still
              remember one of them. It was a poem in Chinese:<br> <br> ”Ten years behind bars <br> Never too late<br> Thousands of ordeals<br> My spirit steeled.“<br> <br> When you were alone and helpless, and you saw things like that, you were encouraged.”<br> <br> “The best part of my life was taken away just like that, without even a charge let alone a trial in the court.”<br> -Chia Thye Poh 1998</p>

              <p>Honestly I don't really know what you all think but as far as CSJ is concerned, someone who contrived to kick out arguably the most respected opposition MP, off the party he founded, in sg who I personally respect even more than our MM (Seriously, LKY may be a mother fcuker who might burn in hell after he passes on but in the founding and developing of sg, I don't think anyone can deny he played a pivotal role), doesn't deserve an ounce of respect.</p>
              <p>As for international support. Really lah, if he can't even get support from his own people what international support do you think he's got? Maybe those kind of fair-weather support like, yah I agree with your ideas but I am not willing to follow you all the way, just support you spiritually. And as for going to jail, really they should lock him up for life so that he'll stop providing Singaporeans with a poor impression of opposition parties in general.</p>
