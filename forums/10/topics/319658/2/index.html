              <p>You want people to believe that true intellectuals are those who persisted in fixing people, calling others liars without the slightest understanding of what is a lie, or in a position to handle truths themselves e.g. collecting million-dollar salaries and refusing to accept responsibility for serious problems as seen in NKF or Mas Selamat, a case of total lapse of country's security system.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oxford has better to revise the definition of "Intellectual" or "Honesty" or "Liar" in its latest edition of the English dictionary.</p>

              <p>Robert, if you can believe in Asswipe Atobe's proven craven and despicable posts, then i guess there is nothing to even discuss. Now i know why true intellectuals have no wish to engage with the opposition parties and their rabid supporters, espacially here. There is no point for the wise to argue with fools because others will not be able to know the difference.</p>
              <p>I wish you good luck and may you see the truth one day, and may that day be not a painful experience.</p>

              <p><br>The following was posted on Page 1 of this thread in my response to TS opening piece:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">“I would say the generation of the ‘50s and ‘60s took the plunge into politics without ever calculating the costs of the risk and the benefits to be gained. They were driven by ideology. Today’s generation has no culture and averse to taking political risk. Really, an interest in politics is very necessary for the future. But I cannot blame the present generations, because they see the heavy-handed response by the government to dissenting views, even though they know that these matters involve their daily lives.<br><br>So the result is that we have produced a younger generation who are meek and therefore very calculating. They are less independent-thinking and lack in initiative. It does not bode well for the emergence of future leaders in politics and business. Robots and computers can be programmed or if you like, can be trained. But the trouble, of course, is that computers lack soul and what we need in Singapore is soul. Because it is soul that makes society.”</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In your usual vulgar ways of intellectual dishonesty, should we assume that you were correct in your assessment - that this was my elaborate dishonest twist from an honest speech by Dr Toh Chin Chye to be woven into the text of my response to TS ?</p>
              <p>Have you lost your intellectual creativity to adopt any other positions in honest debate, except to lie on your back - insulting the trade of honest whores - with your dishonest work in making 'Point_blank" unsubstantiated juvenile critiques of the responses from others ?</p>
              <p>Yet you will accuse others to be ''bastard opposition supporters'' that the People in Singapore do not need - when your own efforts have continuously bastardised the image of your God Father.</p>
              <p>Do you think you are appreciated and be accepted by those whom you try so hard to protect - when your own diligent work at dishonestly protecting the God Father is no better than a half-baked bastardised version of your God Father ?</p>
