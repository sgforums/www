            <div class='col-md body'>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/2391<br><br>Mellanie Hewlitt<br>Sg_Review<br>Obscene Salaries; Cutting to the Heart of Issues,<br><br>5 May 2006<br><br>The past weeks have seen page after page of speeches by PAP ministers with extensive coverage by the local propaganda media. However, the discerning and intelligent reader only needs to look at one central issue which will, by itself, cut to the center and heart of all discussions and reveal the honesty and intergrity behind the PAP Ministers. This central issue is of cause the bloated obscene ministerial salaries.<br><br>This sensitive issue has been raised countless times before in many forums and has never been satisfactorily addressed by the PAP Government and its propaganda press.<br><br>At this belated stage of the electoral process, we do not propose to dwell again into all the issues concerning ministerial salaries. However, we do ask all discerning and intelligent voters to consider any speech that any PAP minister makes in the context of these bloated and obscene ministerial salaries. Each minister takes home a minimum sum of USD140,000/- PER MONTH excluding perks and bonuses.<br><br>In their inspirational speeches, PAP ministers portrait themselves to be selfless civil servants who work only towards the greater good of the community.  But such obscene salaries obsecure all else and at once throw into doubt the sincerity behind any proposal or speech that these same million dollar ministers will make.<br><br>Remember for instance that these are the same million dollar ministers who imposed mandatory wage and CPF cuts on you during the bad times even when they continued to rake in their million dollar salaries. See: Government should take lead in swallowing bitter pill and Cutting CPF now may cause deflationary spiral<br><br>These are the same million dollar ministers who refused to restore employer CPF contributions in good times even when they gave themseves higher salary cincrements. See: No CPF Restoration / Grotesque Ministerial Salaries and The Reality Of Singapore Wage Reform<br><br>These same million dollar ministers also denied sick and unemployed Singaporeans rights to their own hard earned CPF money. see: CPF: Let Singaporeans have their money back!!!!! and CPF - LET US HAVE OUR MONEY BACK and Lifting The Veil On Singapore Politics and Medisave, Why can't we use 100%? Because none of it is really yours.  and The Truth About The CPF System - The Great CPF Scam<br><br>And of cause these same million dollar ministers also masterminded the COE, ERP, CPF and HDB scams. See: HDB's Deceit Exposed!!! The Great HDB Scam and Govt Needs Your Support for COE Price! The Great COE Scam and More Scams From The CPF / The Great CPF Scam and CTE Toll A Money Spinner - The COE Scam<br><br>These same million dollar ministers also made the false and unfounded statement that Singaporeans were OVERPAID and the average Singapore wage exceeds those of their couterparts in the US, UK and Australia. See: Are our wage costs really that high?  and Spore's labour costs higher than US, Australia? Really?<br><br>When times were bad, with retrenchments at an all time high, one of these same million dollar ministers even defended the merits of retrenchments saying that "Lay-Offs were not all bad". See Layoffs are not all bad, says PM Goh and More examples of PAP lies and double-speak<br><br>These same million dollar ministers also used hard earned tax dollars to set-up non-trasnparent fly-by night GLCs, TLCs and other PAP owned state vehicles which acted as corporate veils for questionable and illicit transactions. See: File - The Incestous World Of Singapore's State Runned Enterprises  and File - The Truth Behind Singapore's Public Policy Administration and More Inane GLC Investments - The CPF Scam and Demand for Indepth. Audit of GLCs, CPF, LTA, HDB etc<br><br>These same million dollar ministers then also concocted rules and regulations and used  GLC and TLCs to create a virtual monopoly in the local business environment for PAP runned entities. In so doing they essentially stifled any potential for entreupreneural business. See:  URA Killing Entrepreneurship and How The S'pore Govt Stole &amp; Killed The Meals On Wheels Concept. and Fault lines Beginning to show<br><br>These million dollar ministers also imposed rules and regulations which financially handcuff Singaporeans, locking away a substantive part of their disposable assets in the hands of non-transparent state organisations. See: and More On The CPF Scam - The PAP Debt Trap and The PAP Debt-Traps &amp; Financial Handcuffs<br><br>Finally, these million dollar ministers also implemented their own Elitist twisted version of Eugenics which accounted for a fall in the country's birth-rates. See:<br><br>Stand up, Singapore / Misplaced Elitist Eugenic's Programme<br><br>Are Singaporeans truly happy under this government? See More Students Committing Suicide In Sinkapore<br><br>The figures reveal that the average Singaporean is a far from happy creature and is afflictaed by a host of social-economic ailments ranging from;<br><br>a) Escalating Costs of Living<br>b) Insufficient Savings For Retirement<br>c) Unemployment Concerns<br>d) Shrinking Real Income<br>f) Marital Blues and declining Birth Rates<br>g) Mounting Work Pressure, long work hours<br>h) Mounting academic pressure<br>i) An Unforgiving academic and work culture which places a premium on qualifications over actual performance<br>j) Competition from Foreign Talent<br>k) Bureucratic Government Policies<br><br>The list goes on. Small wonder that suicides rates are on the rise. But according to previous "figures" released by the Singapore Government last year (2003), Singapore workers were better paid then their US, UK and Australian counterparts.<br><br>Life is also supposed to be rosy here in Singapore and Singaporeans should be grateful for the safe and comfortable environment provided by the local government.<br><br>But if Life in this "Wonderland with the Death Penalty" is so good;<br><br>1) Why is disposable income (and CPF rates) falling ?<br>2) Why are more and more people leaving?<br>3) Why are the birth rates falling?<br>4) Why are suicide rates on the rise?<br>5) Why are unemployment rates on the rise?<br>6) Why are daily living costs escalating?<br>7) Why is there the emergence of the "educated poor" as a new social class?<br><br>WHY?<br><br>The silence is deafening.

            <div class='col-md body'>It looks like the salaries of GLCs' CEOs and upper echelon will be raised to justify ministers' own self-approved million-dollar salaries or pave the way for another round of increases for ministers.<br><br>The raising of president's salary to S$2,200,000.00 per annum might be cited for giving ministers further salary increments and bonuses by saying that if president who are only ceremonial and non-executive get so much how about ministers?<br><br>The last attempt to increase Comfort CEO to millions there was an instant uproar as taxi chiefs were never paid that high anywhere. Then they did it to many other GLC CEOs so that they can be benchmarked by ministers. All of a sudden we have so many CEOs who are previous civil servants before incorporation being paid in millions. Many of these highly glamourised GLCs could be outsourced to save taxpayers billions every year. The citizens will then be able to lower their rising costs of living or doing business.<br><br>If there is such a practice of increasing GLC CEO salaries so that ministers can benchmark them then this is not very open or accountable to the public taxpayers in running of government services.<br><br>GLCs are actually former government branches corporatised to make them private to charge more fees so there are much monies to be made from monopoly charges of fees and some other way.<br><br>People objected to highest peanut salaries to NKF CEO or GLC chiefs by artificial benchmarking to private sector's talents which in fact they are not. Citizens cannot pay ironricebowler type of occupation in GLCs and comfort-zone ministers or MPs unaffected by hiring and firing for inefficiencies this kind of self-scaled or self-benchmarked obscene salaries.<br><br>No wonder MediaCorp/Mediawork were forced to merge again due to heavy losses after divesting for two years because this kind of salary upscaling is uncompetitive and running down our economic competitiveness.<br><br>Public and government jobs with the exception of the proven few are ironricebowler jobs who mostly collect funds or taxes and spend them according to budget.</div>
