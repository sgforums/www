              <p>IN HIS letter last Thursday, 'Elitist danger in Singapore education',
                  Mr Muhammad Faruoq Osman is wrong that only the elite minority from
                  wealthier households is more likely to 'receive value-added education
                  at the expense of vast amounts of public funds' in our education
                  system.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Education provides adequate resources to all
                  schools and institutions of higher learning to enable every Singaporean
                  child to achieve his full potential. For each level, we spend what is
                  needed to achieve a high-quality education for all. For example, we
                  spend annually about $11,300 for each student in junior college and
                  about $10,300 for each student in the Institute of Technical Education
                  (ITE). All students can develop themselves in music, sports or the arts
                  through school-based co-curricular programmes.</p>
              <p>Students, regardless of their family background, have done
                  well in this system. The top 5 per cent of students in the 2007 Primary
                  School Leaving Examination did not come only from a few schools with
                  rich parents. In fact, they came from 98 per cent of primary schools -
                  from all socio-economic groups.</p>
              <p>Mr Osman noted that about half of Public Service Commission
                  (PSC) scholarship recipients lived in private property. But to conclude
                  from this narrow and single observation that our education system is
                  therefore less meritocratic is neither sensible nor fair. It is true
                  that in all societies, successful parents tend to produce successful
                  children and Singapore is not unique here. However, thousands of
                  students who graduate from ITE, polytechnics and our universities every
                  year do not feel less of themselves or their achievements because they
                  have not received a PSC scholarship. All of them have succeeded by
                  their own efforts and no eligible student is deprived from entering our
                  top schools, institutions or gifted programmes just because his family
                  is poor. Admission is strictly based on merit and we have a wide range
                  of bursaries and financial assistance schemes to assist students in
                  need./;=</p>
              <p>Our education system should motivate and provide
                  opportunities for all students to go as far as each can. We have
                  targeted programmes to assist those from poorer families and many are
                  moving up. One of every eight undergraduates in our public universities
                  comes from households who live in one- to three-room flats. We should
                  celebrate when any student excels, regardless of his background. When
                  that student comes from a lower-income household, we applaud his
                  efforts because he has succeeded despite difficult circumstances. But
                  we should not cavil or be envious when students from higher income
                  households do well in our education system. Both have earned rewards
                  based on personal effort and merit. And we hope both will feel a duty
                  to contribute back to society to maintain our system that provides
                  opportunities for all.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">While Singapore has better infrastrature and system than most countries, i disagree this translate to equal chances for all students. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Singapore's
                  highly comptitive education system today is heavily reliant on private
                  tuition.Today, the number of students getting As have increased. Consequently the grades to get into schools or university have also been raised. <strong>As such, any advantage in the education system is magnified in a highly competitive education system.</strong><br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">For example,If instruction in the school is
                  poor due to trainee teachers, incompetent teachers or disruptive classes, parents
                  with financial resources have the option of private coaching or even switching to a private school. In some
                  of these top schools dominated by richer families, the student from the
                  poorer family may be disadavantaged by the lack resources for private
                  tuition.</span></p>

              <p>Well i didnt need tuition, and neither did most of my peers during my time but the landscape for education has changed tremendously. I am just amazed by the truckloads of straight As students and how much harder it is to get into the same course in university. While there is no point trying to achieve complete equality, the state had a duty to address increasing inequality.</p>
              <p>Finland for example has very competent teachers with masters and their system is less reliant on private tuition. Therefore Finland system can be said to be more meritocratic than Singapore despite their egalitarian attitudes.</p>

              <p>what to do, when teachers nowadays are overworked by MOE, and school children being rather spoilt in schools.</p>
              <p>The toll on teachers is so large that it is extremely hard to imagine sensible and proper teaching from the teachers.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, teachers are given near 40 students per class. Finland? This <a href="http://johangijsen.blogspot.com/2008/05/taiwans-low-quality-and-elitist.html">blog </a>claims no more than 20 students per class. The attention and care of the teacher is being divided much more! Add that to the fact that students are mostly immature before uni studies, and have a higher tendency to misbehave in class, further adding stress to teachers.</p>
              <p>To further compound the problem, the recent grading system makes it compulsory that a certain percentage of the teachers in the schools must be graded D. Another man-eat-man situation, sort of what we have been experiencing all along as students. Result of this policy by MOE? Office politics within the teaching community stepped up, with more backstabbing and unwillingness to share materials for fear of other teachers doing better than you (with your materials).</p>
              <p>Office politics can be so jialat that a teacher can be criticised and marked badly for bad teaching because of comments from senior teachers, even though the students improved extremely well in the exams.</p>
              <p>As a teacher, you are expected to handle many admin and extra curricular things. You are to teach, to attend meetings, to do duty for O/A levels, etc. After all these extra things (which end about 4 plus pm), you can go home. But bear in mind, there's still marking to be done, lessons to be prepared, and various other admin stuff; you are working when no one can see, when everyone is supposed to resting...</p>
              <p>How are you ever going to attract quality teachers for the long term with the above?</p>
