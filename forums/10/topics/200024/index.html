            <div class='col-md body'>hey ppl,<br><br>I hv been in this forum for quite a long time already, and I see that many of us have good opinions to share, the only problem being that they are a little scattered and messy. What I wish to propose is that we post up our major suggestions here in this thread, and then a few of us consolidate this into one massive online petition, and post the url - via ST Forum, TNP Speakup, TODAY VOICES or email-to-FBU - to the govt and/or to the public. Then we can see how much support we will get i.e. how many signatures. That will be far more effective, I think, then to continue ranting on here.<br><br>Cheers,<br>the pikamaster (who is trying to maintain his political optimism)<br><br>P.S.: btw, for all JC/Poly/ITEC students, how many of you are interested in forming an informal organization - online at least - to promote student unity among all our 3 educational streams? I'm thinking of sth like an online community for all students...</div>

(JC/Poly/ITEC)?<br><br>2) I am not asking for a merger of streams. Different mentalities are a result of different environment. ANd I seriously think, all students have different mentalities; the different blocs aren't exactly homogeneous within.<br><br>I think the problem is not so much mentalities; the problem is the attitudes they have toward each other. These attitudes are of course not arising from their own fault; rather, it is our entire socio-educational system which has produced it. These are misconceptions (e.g. that HC students come to school in red-carpeted limos) that have arisen from historical isolation.<br><br>But - contrary to what you may think - I trust there is a desire for the students of different streams to integrate with each other. interestingly, this was oen of the suggestions put up at a recent feedback/ policy-proposing session involving students from all three streams. And the team of students proposing  social integration (not academic, because obviously MOE won't bend to that) were made up of students from all three streams. In addition, at the Q&amp;A session with the Minister, integration between students of different streams was one of the runnign themes through the individual questions. The audience, of course, consisted of students from all three streams.<br><br>Yahh, so be a little more optimistic man.<br><br>the pikamaster<br><br></div>

I didn't get any political slant from my convo /w the Minister, but I see what you are getting at. Tharman himself was rather regretful that such a situation existed - he (I can't say for TCH and predecessors, except maybe for Goh Keng Swee) is genuine to the idea of dividing students according to abilities in certain fields. He exprressed his desire to move toward a "talent-based" streaming system rather than a "subject-based" streaming system i.e. more course differentiation. ANd he indeed will welcome genuine cohesion among the students, as long as it's not too politically-biased from of cohesion.<br><br>Is this an adequate response?<br><br>the pikamaster</div>

The petition is sth aimed at giving SGForums some kind of coherent voice in the political arena, so that ppl here are not just dismissed as unproductive coffee-shop grumblers. And yes, I agree with the idea of a student committee.<br><br>However, a key problem with the idea of a student committee is that - for historical environmental reasons probably, or Divide-and-rule policy, if ur more cynical - the student body, as students, are divided evenly into 3 streams: at secondary level, Special, Express, Normal; at post-secondary JC,Poly,ITEC; at uni SMU,NUS + NTU and the foreign scholars. So first we need a common ground to bond them together.<br><br>I propose creating some sort of online community where members of the three groups can freely associate with one another. In fact, I already started it with Eiki; of coruse it's still in planning i.e. we haven't started promoting it to ppl yet. But generally it's there. DO you want to help in the settign up/ promoting/ managing? haha<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">. PM me if ur interested. And that goes for anyone else too. Click <a href="http://www.6sir.net" rel="nofollow">here</a> to visit the forum.<br><br>5) Like I said previously, the student body here is still to immature to fucntion as a tripartite students' council or anything. And aside from that, the student council model you're suggesting might be (mis)construed as a form of subversion by MOE, and that won't be safe, especially since infant organizations aren't usually strong enough to take on the establishment. But what we could have is that out of the forum I'm suggesting above, we find some particularly good contributors, amke them mods and stuff, and organize them into rudimentary committees which SLOWLY expand in number and scope of activities. Eventually, form one committee to gatehr feedback on a regular basis and submit it to the govt.<br><br>6) I don't know about STU, but yahh, tt's it. Nope, of course I won't want it to be subservient, and I think it won't be, because MOE seems to want to gvie schools and students more autonomy, and exert less control over them. Inf act, this allows us to utilize the countervailing power argument agaisnt school administrations who can be rather arbitrary in their policies. But I do think the MOE is loosenign up a little, probably more than MICA at any rate.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>the pikamaster</div>
