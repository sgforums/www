              <p><strong><span class="contentpagetitle"> Transcript confirms Yeong's dishonesty</span></strong></p>
              <p>Dear Madam Yeong,<br> <br> The court transcript which you produced after being pressed has confirmed your dishonesty.<br> <br> You wrote in your letter to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> (WSJ): "Having lost [the case], Dr. Chee in open court then called the
              Singapore leaders 'murderers, robbers, child molesters' and 'rapists.'"
              <br> <br> You cleverly omitted the phrase that I had said to Mr Davinder Singh:
              "...you might as well throw it in..." (see below). By doing so you hide
              the fact that I was referring to Mr Singh's wild conclusions, and that
              since <strong><em>he</em></strong> was  making all these allegations, <strong><em>he</em></strong> might as well throw in these terms.<br> <br> This is a far cry from me saying that the Lees committed murder, robbery, rape and had molested children.<br> <br> Your letter was not even a case of taking my words out of context, it
              was a wholesale twist of imputing to me something I was not saying. It
              is childish, unbecoming and a gross lack of intellectual decency.<br> <br> In the audio-recording there was laughter in the courtroom after I told
              Mr Singh that he might as well throw in murderers, robbers, child
              molesters and rapists. (See below) You again omitted this portion in
              your letter to the WSJ to make it look like I have gone off the
              deep-end to call the Lees these names.<br> <br> I also wrote in my letter to the WSJ: “Mdm Yeong also says that
              'Singapore upholds free speech.' Yes, and Mr Mugabe has just been
              awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.” By the standard of your logic, you will
              no doubt say that I have claimed that the brutal Zimbabwean dictator is
              indeed a Nobel Peace Laureate.<br> <br> Every time you make such wild claims, including your boss Mr Lee Kuan
              Yew calling me a psychopath, you degrade yourselves and the offices you
              hold.<br> <br> On another matter, Mr Lee testified in court that the International Bar
              Association (IBA) president had sent a letter to the Law Society of
              Singapore (LSS) complimenting Singapore on its judiciary. The IBA
              denies sending the letter and the LSS confirms that it has not received
              such one.<br> <br> Would you ask Mr Lee to produce the letter to refute the two
              organisations? This is important as it was part of the evidence that Mr
              Lee tendered in court under oath.<br> <br> By the way you have still not answered why, as a civil servant, you are
              writing letters for the Minister Mentor when this is his personal
              matter and not a state one?<br> <br> Chee Soon Juan<br> Secretary-General<br> Singapore Democratic Party</p>

              <p>Dear Madam Yeong,<br>
              <br>
              The court transcript which you produced after being pressed has
              confirmed your dishonesty.<br>
              <br>
              You wrote in your letter to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> (WSJ):
              "Having lost [the case], Dr. Chee in open court then called the
              Singapore leaders 'murderers, robbers, child molesters' and
              'rapists.'"<br>
              <br>
              You cleverly omitted the phrase that I had said to Mr Davinder
              Singh: "...you might as well throw it in..." (see below). By doing
              so you hide the fact that I was referring to Mr Singh's wild
              conclusions, and that since <strong><em>he</em></strong> was making
              all these allegations, <strong><em>he</em></strong> might as well
              throw in these terms.<br>
              <br>
              This is a far cry from me saying that the Lees committed murder,
              robbery, rape and had molested children.<br>
              <br>
              Your letter was not even a case of taking my words out of context,
              it was a wholesale twist of imputing to me something I was not
              saying. It is childish, unbecoming and a gross lack of intellectual
              decency.<br>
              <br>
              In the audio-recording there was laughter in the courtroom after I
              told Mr Singh that he might as well throw in murderers, robbers,
              child molesters and rapists. (See below) You again omitted this
              portion in your letter to the WSJ to make it look like I have gone

              <br>
              I also wrote in my letter to the WSJ: â€œMdm Yeong also says that
              'Singapore upholds free speech.' Yes, and Mr Mugabe has just been

              <br>

              Dr Chee alleged that I had lied, and challenged me to produce the
              relevant transcript.<br>
              <br>
              I enclose p. 115 of the verbatim court reporting transcript of the

              i have read the verbatim court reporting transcript of the hearing on28 May 2008 a few times but i'm unable to find anywhere where Dr Chee called Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew 'murderers, robbers, child molesters' and 'rapists'. Wonder if Mdm Yeong had quoted the wrong transcript.

              June 26), relying on a "partial transcript," has misunderstood the
              issue in the libel case involving Dr. Chee Soon Juan and his sister.</p>
              <p class="times">The case had nothing to do with political freedom. It
              was for defamation arising from the Chees' false claims that Prime
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Lee Kuan Yew are criminals and corrupt.
              Despite being advised by a Queen's Counsel, they failed to produce any
              credible defense or evidence to back up their claims.</p>
              <p class="times"><strong>Having lost, Dr. Chee in open court then called the
              Singapore leaders "murderers, robbers, child molesters" and "rapists."</strong> The Chees also rebuked the judge, ignored her orders and shouted her
              down. In Ms. Chee's defense, her lawyer could only claim that she was
              "almost paranoid." This is why the judge sentenced the Chees to
              imprisonment for scandalizing the court.</p>
              <p class="times">Many opposition politicians routinely criticize
              government leaders, but are not sued because they have not uttered
              slanderous falsehoods. Contrary to your editorial, Singapore upholds
              free speech and the right to disagree, subject to the law.</p>
              <p class="times">Singapore's laws must be decided by Singaporeans, not
              by foreigners like Gopalan Nair, who is a U.S. citizen, or by the
              foreign media. Foreign media are entitled to report and comment on what
              is happening in Singapore, but they circulate here subject to Singapore
              law. They have no right to defame, to give a skewed account of court
              proceedings, or to engage in Singapore politics, for example, by
              campaigning for their version of Western style "democracy" for
              Singapore.</p>
