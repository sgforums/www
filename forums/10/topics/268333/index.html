            <div class='col-md body'><strong>IT'S PARENTS' DUTY TO REGISTER BIRTHS<br>By Karen Wong<br><br>July 16, 2007</strong><br><br>HOW could a child live in Singapore for six years without an identity?<br><br>Madam Angela Goh, the Marsiling grassroots leader, said that this was the first time that she has come across such a case.<br><br>'I was very surprised when I found out that the children did not have birth certificates.'<br><br>When she told her fellow grassroots volunteers, they too were surprised.<br><br>Mayor of the South West District, Dr Amy Khor, also told The New Paper on Sunday that this is the first time she has heard of such a case.<br><br>She said: 'I checked with South West Central Development Council and they have also not come across such a case. I must say that upon first reading of the case, I was somewhat surprised.<br><br>UNDERSTANDABLE<br><br>'But on further reading, and given the family background and the mother being in jail as well as the fact that the current husband is not their biological father, one can understand how this slip came about.'<br><br>Much as the authorities can streamline their processes and send reminders, the responsibility of registering a child's birth lies ultimately with the parents and family members.<br><br>MP for Sembawang GRC (Marsiling), MrHawazi Daipi, said that this particular problem came about as the child's father's identity could not be established.<br><br>In such cases, the family should seek assistance to register the birth and have the birth certificate issued.<br><br>'They should seek their MP's assistance if they need help,' he said.<br><br>'First and foremost, the responsibility lies with the parents and the family, no matter what the circumstances of the pregnancy or birth. They should not wait till the child has reached school-going age before seeking assistance,' he added.<br><br>TIMELY REMINDER<br><br>Ms Ellen Lee, MP for Sembawang GRC (Woodlands), said: 'This is a good reminder to would-be parents of their responsibility in getting their children's births properly documented so that they do not become stateless due to omission of an important identification process after birth.'<br><br>She added that that it was the first time she and her grassroots leaders have heard of such a case.<br><br>Ms Lee, who is also a lawyer, said: 'As stateless persons, they are not entitled to any rights that citizens and permanent residents enjoy, and this is grossly unfair to them.'<br><br></div>
