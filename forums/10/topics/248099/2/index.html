            <div class='col-md body'>by going on strike doesnt necessary mean to retort to violence, it only implies the majority of the citizens are unhappy of wat the governments are doing now n hope dat the govenments can abort the ideas of wat they r doing.<br><br>riot only happens when police and unhappy pple fight. it will reflect badly on singapore to let other world know such a thing happen but on the other hands, we r telling pple we singaporeans do stand up for the things which we feel it is unjust!<br><br>just look at hong kong, the pple go on strike, n the governments decide to drop the gst thoughts. do our governments do so? by keeping quiet will make them to continue taking advantages of us.</div>
