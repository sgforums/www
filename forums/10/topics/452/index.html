            <div class='col-md body'>guys i really need your help.over the past ten weeks of bmt, i have struggled and cried a lot just to pass out of there.i am having my block leave and am having nightmares everyday about sispec.i really do not want to go there!!during bmt i have fallen sick countless of times and reported sick quite a few times as well.what i want to know is how do i know i am doomed to be in sispec.i just scraped past my ippt, failed my soc test in 18:05 minutes, got 24 out of 44 for my range, did not go for any sit test as i was sick, am excused from throwing grenades and explosives by the medical staff at cmpb, talked to my oo and platoon sergeant about my problems and even humiliated myself by crying in front of them, not on good terms at all with any platoon mate and has a lousy peer appraisal.the worst thing is that i did not get any interview from any unit.the strange thing is that the mp, armour , infantry ,artillery are the ones that gave interviews.i hope sincerely that someone can help me as i do not want to humiliate and isolate myself anymore.<br></div>

U r partially rite. It's common fact that if u have the educational qualifications,esp if u r in the 'A' level scholar companies, u r most prob going to sispec/ocs. But still, u need to pass your IPPT, and preferably your SOC. you also need a decent peer appraisal, pc assessment and sittest result lor.<br><br>Well, what I said abt the initial screening is true. If u express the wish to get out of sispec on the first day, they will try to get you out ASAP. and i can say, not many pple really try to ooc on their first day.<br><br>Most that get into ocs, really have performed well during their bmt. They usually exhibit excellent command and control, as well as outstanding leadership qualities. Abt office politiks, well.. it exists everywhere... not only in the army, u juz gotta accept it.<br><br>Hmmm.. the Suffer in silence part... i think it's juz some stupid acronym to scare new trainees. But really... it's not the getting in part. Pple hate to get into sispec. but as u go along, you find that it's ermm... the pride's juz there. granted, it's not fun to apply camo on ur face -first thing in the morning, EVERYday, and then charge left and rite the whole Afternoon... but I think that after it's accomplished, you do feel it's something. whatever.. bmt is the most FUN!<br><br>------------------<br>wHaT tIMe iS iT?<br>iT's ORD tImE!</div>

I can tell you, by then, you would be glad that you didn't do it.<br><br>If you are that desperate for money, sign on Air-force or Navy. At least they treat you better than Army (better than seeing green everyday).</div>

If you are the "sway kuang" person,  doesn't mean failed SOC mean you would not go.  Anyway, I heard that prior to enlisting, the posting is already fixed. Unless something happen.</div>
