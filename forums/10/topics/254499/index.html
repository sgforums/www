            <div class='col-md body'><br>Having read the below article from New Paper, I have the following to ask:<br><br>&gt;&gt; Ethics in question, who do we question?<br>&gt; the stall holder ?<br>&gt; or the Vietnam supplier?<br><br>&gt;&gt; New emerging economy Vietnam: are their sense of ethics<br>becoming corrupted by money? - seems to be the traits of all<br>emerging economies...<br><br>===========================================<br>He's charged for 450g crab &amp; 300g rope<br>Upset Tampines diner refuses to eat or pay<br>May 15, 2007<br><br>TAMPINES resident Chen Qing Hong (above) was puzzled when the small steamed crab he ordered cost him $21.<br><br>When weighed for a photograph, the ropes around the crab tipped the scales at about 300g. --<br>The 80-year-old was shocked to discover that he was being charged not just for the 450g Vietnam crab but also the 300g of rope that had been used to tie it.<br><br>Based on a price of $30 per kg for the crab, the rope cost $7.50, reported Shin Min Daily News.<br><br>An angry Mr Chen refused to eat the crab or pay for it.<br><br>But the owner of the zi char stall he had ordered the crab from said she had not cheated him.<br><br>She said that she was charged for the weight of the rope by her supplier and was just passing on thecost.<br><br>The incident happened last week at a coffee shop at Block 419, Tampines Street41.<br><br>Mr Chen was looking forward to tucking into the single steamed crab he had ordered. But when the dish arrived, he was shocked to be presented with a bill for$21.<br><br>Mr Chen, who said he loves eating crabs, felt that the crab on the plate could not have weighed more than500g.<br><br>Convinced he was being cheated, he went to the kitchen to clarify the cost of the meal with Ms Huang Xiu Mei, 42, the owner of the stall.<br><br>(Left) One of the Vietnamese crabs that the zi char stall in Tampines occasionally serves. It typically comes with thick ropes around it, said stall owner Huang Xiu Mei. --<br>She took him to the crab display area and showed him the tied-up crabs and a clump of rope used to tie the crab on Mr Chen's table.<br><br>Mr Chen said he put the wet rope on a nearby weighing scales and was shocked to see that it weighed 300g.<br><br>Ms Huang said: 'When the crabs were delivered to me, they were already like this. The supplier also charged me for the weight of the rope.'<br><br>So she had no choice but to pass on the cost to the customer, shesaid.<br><br>Ms Huang, who has had the stall for 21/2years, said she usually buys Sri Lankan crabs, and has served Vietnamese crabs only a few times, when there is a shortage of crabs from Sri Lanka.<br><br>She added: 'I've realised for a long time that the amount of rope being used seems to be getting more andmore.'<br><br>She said that in the beginning, about 100g of rope would be used to tie each crab.<br><br>Now, it's about 300g.<br><br>The importer told Shin Min Daily News that the crabs are tied that way in Vietnam.<br><br>(Left) One of the Vietnamese crabs that the zi char stall in Tampines occasionally serves. It typically comes with thick ropes around it, said stall owner Huang Xiu Mei. --<br>He said he has given feedback about the amount of rope used several times, but nothing has been done about it.<br><br>Ms Huang said that she will probably stop buying crabs from Vietnam and has returned the rest of the crabs to thesupplier.<br><br>She said she did not blame MrChen for not paying.<br><br>She said: 'He is an old customer. I can't blame him and chase him away because of one crab.'<br><br></div>
