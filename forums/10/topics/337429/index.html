              <p><br>In term of buses, they already engage many PRC guys as drivers, this eventually lowered their wages cost, now as fuel price falls, fares still all time high, so they are gaining from both side. Well, as someone said, this is how this world works, i would rather said, this is how Singapore alone works.</p>

              <p>It has been reported that comfortdelgro has bought an aussie bus company keffford for S$147M in the govt-controlled newspapers 21/11/08.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It has quoted mamaging director saying 'our ambitions do not end there ... we want to become a signiciant operator in the Australia bus sector'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does it mean that it will raise more money through more fare hikes in Singapore. The latest purchase will be financed internally and by bank loans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Public Tranport Council weakness in protecting the commuters has <strong>emboldened</strong> these govt bus companies yet again. It is also reported that the farehike that kicked in last month, falling oil prices and higher ridership has benefitted the Spore operations the most !</p>

              <p>Rule #1: Just because it is listed in the SGX does not make it a non-government owned corporation. Look at the shareholding. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>how to spend when tomolo is uncertainty?  I love to spend.  But can meh?  imagine lost ur job tomolo and u got pile up bill to pay..... then cant pay and declare bankrupt.  Then our ghamen will force u sell your family and u live on street depending on charity if there is any. </p>
              <p>Ghamen can say anything they want.  Of coz can spend lah... earning mil of salary every year.  If i take that kind of salary u think i not spend meh?</p>
              <p>damn load of bull.</p>
              <p>I know in theory that is how to stimulate the economy.  But then again to stimulate economy need big amount of $$$.  Ghamen shd start ball rolling first such as giving us $30,000 each singaporean as relief package then we can spend and stimulate the economy.</p>
              <p>when one barely can make ends meet how to steam the economy?</p>

              <p><br>exactly, if you cannot afford a massage, just go for a steambath will do,...if all hv the same mentality of no steam, then all will go down together,..so spent at what you can afford, chicken rice, kopi packet, pasar malam etc etc...</p>
