              Bridge – The volume of sand exported to Singapore from Vietnam’s Mekong
              Delta in the first half of 2009 was equivalent to the total exports of
              the last ten years. Ironically, most of it is shipped under falsely
              backdated contracts.</span></span></span> <br> <br> The many channels of the Mekong river are filled with sand dredging
              barges. Though the area has long supplied building sand to the Ho Chi
              Minh City region, its sand export business has not been considerable
              until now. <br> <br> The Customs Office of Can Tho City reported that the volume of sand
              exported in the January-June period of 2009 rose dramatically to nearly
              7 million tones, as much as was exported during the previous ten years.
              <br> <br> The surge in exports was stimulated by Cambodia’s decision to ban
              further exports of its own river sand in order to reserve it for
              domestic use and limit further erosion of river banks. <br> <br> Prior to May, while Cambodia still allowed sand exports, sand from
              Vietnam’s Mekong Delta was not favoured because it is of lower quality
              than Cambodian river sand. <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">Now, with
              the demand for sand by Singapore and some other countries in the region
              still on the rise, Vietnamese companies have lept at the opportunity to
              export this natural resource to Singapore, </span></span>reports Tuoi Tre newspaper.
              <br> <br> Nguyen The Hung, manager of a sand exploitation enterprise in Can Tho
              city, said that before Cambodia closed down sand exports, the prices
              for sand in the Mekong Delta were quite stable, from 15,000 to 17,000
              per a cubic meter. Now, the prices are 25,000 to 30,000 per a cubic
              meter.
              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">Cambodia
              exported its high grade sand to Singapore at the price of 90,000 dong
              per cubic meter. Currently, Vietnamese firms ship sand to Singapore for
              40,000 dong per cubic meter. However, the profit from sand is still big
              because exporters can purchase sand at only 15,000-17,000 dong per
              cubic meter.</span></span> <br> <br> Vu Duc Hung of the River Police Bureau in Can Tho City said that since
              Cambodia banned sand exports, hundreds of sand barges travel on local
              rivers while sand ships of 10,000 tons or more anchor at Tra Noc and
              Cai Cui every day to take aboard sand from the barges. Each day around
              ten ships leave Vietnam, each carrying hundreds of thousands of cubic
              meters of sand.
              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;">Ironically, the booming sand export business is in patent violation of the intent of Vietnamese law. </span></span></span>Prime
              Ministerial Instruction No. 29, issued in October 2008, established a
              temporary ban on Vietnam’s own exports of sand and gravel exploited
              from rivers and seas. <br> <br> There was a huge loophole, however, exports could continue indefinitely
              under contracts signed before November 30, 2008. Based on this clause,
              sand is still exported to Singapore.
              <br> <br>The deputy head of the Can Tho Customs Office, Nguyen Minh Thong,
              said that the the total volume of sand for export committed in
              contracts signed before November 30 2008 reaches tens of millions of
              cubic meters. <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;">“Lured
              by virtually unlimited profits,” Thong said, “sand exporters change the
              date of signing contracts to before November 30 2008 to continue
              exporting sand.” </span></span></span>The customs official added that his office is not responsible for controlling these contracts.”
              <br> <br> Thong said that because sand is a limited natural resource, the
              government should study the matter and establish a sand exploitation
              plan. He said the Can Tho authorities have proposed the Prime Minister
              to reconsider the instruction on sand export. <br> <br> VietNamNet/Tuoi Tre
