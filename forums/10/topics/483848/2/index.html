              <p>We all now know that NMCs are basically irresponsible by nature.
              For example they will relese any wastes to the rivers if no one
              controls them. For example Apple will move their factory anyway
              they like irregardless of whether it is best for USA citizens. As
              far as NMCs are concerned, since globalization started, there is no
              patriotism to talk about.</p>
              <p>So since 20 years ago, governments all over the world have been
              keeping a watchful eyes over NMCs. Governments all over the world
              has implemented policies to protect its citizens. Singapore govt is
              slow in realizing this fact or may be simply choose to ignore it.
              As for Singaporeans because we are an authoritarian state thus a
              lot of information has been suppressed by SPH and Media Corp. and
               so we are not well informed at all.</p>
              <p>I hope Singaporeans can quickly realize the predicament we are
              in and pressurize the govt to do the right things for Singaporeans.
              There are a lot of ways the govt can twist the arms of NMCs and
              make them take care of locals.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 12px;">Do you think this is still the right thing to do ? --&gt; No that is exactly my point. Many companies choose to be here only for cost reasons,nothing more. Now that is taken by China and others and they are moving. Unlike China who managed to acquire th technology for self,Singapore failed.</span></p>
              <p>Sir, MNCs are irresponsible,I have been in many meetings where the discussions were how to find loopholes in govt rules,thats how it is done. That is known but no one can control them anymore since by the time an impact is suggested and a rule inacted(by those not lobbied),it"s too late. Since you mentioned apple, have you seen what is written on it? Something like designed in California, Assembled in China. </p>
              <p><img src="http://twimgs.com/informationweek/byte/commentary/2012-April/iphone4-cost-model-china-big.png" alt="" width="752" height="546"></p>
              <p>Let me make the picture easier to understand, it an iPhone cost 100$, the Chinese get about 5$,Japanese about 15$(Display) and Americans about 80$. Why do these guys who do no physical labour get so much profit?There you have it,IP protection laws.Labour is cheap,IP not. Thats where the West survives. And why they failed in China, Chinese guys were even wiser, they learned the game,copied the stuff and then inacted 'their own IP rules'.That's how these games are played.  Today Chinese have made Xiaomi which rivals Apple in many ways and is growing fast,not to mention others.Singapore unfortunately lost in this game not only in this but in all sectors.</p>
              <p>Even the American govt today cannot twist the arm of any MNC,otherwise they would have brought all the manufacturing jobs to US. Have you sir, heard of lobbying?Simply put it is where the interests of MNCs are passed into rules via senators who draft them.</p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong,Singapore did what they could very well till about 5 years ago. Then they weren't able to capitalize on it to grow national competence.</p>

              <p>Yes,  it is all facts that there are foreigners working in almost every country.  </p>
              <p>It is all in the media that in the recent years UK are aware of the increasing number of foreigners working in their country.   More to this they are concern and acknowkedge the reality that the influx of foreigners working there are affecting the livelihood of their very own citizens.  Besides, UK people are voicing out this concern.   Being a responsible govt they are going to or already started to do something about it to protect their citizens.</p>
              <p>Going globalized is inevitable.  Intentionally bringing in influx of foreigners to work in jobs that locals can do does not protect own citizens' livelihood is irresponsible and ruthless.   It is not something to be proud of  for intentionally "killing" the livelihood of its own citizens.  </p>
              <p>Those who are in support of leechgime working against the livelihood of its citizens are evil.    Evil leechgime will have its retribution when the time is up.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 1.231;">You seems to imply we Singaporeans have the responsibility to inform our govt of bad practices. This is so wrong ! Our govt command all the resources and power. They can easily hire people to check on MNCs. They can't escape the blame of condoning bad MNCs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 1.231;">Anyway I know that MOM is not a trust worthy organization. Most of the rules they established to block foreigners is for show to Singaporeans only. They have betray us ! The rules are not being enforced at all.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large; line-height: 1.231;">We Singaporeans can have prosperity and high growth if PAP govt stop its Anti-China policy. At the moment we stick to a very slow boat called USA. If PAP can wake up their minds and let us tag to China high growth engine we will definitely and automatically enjoy high growth. Countries like Germany, South Korean, France, UK are doing just that. We should simply do the same.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 1.231;">On the other hand there is no point sticking ourselves with India. India is not going to grow no matter how you look at it ! They can't even resove their caste system. Is India even a country after they were put together by the British ?! Their corruption is like the worst in the world. How about stop tourists being raped ?!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 1.231;">I say we will be better off staying far away from the Indian before their 1.2b-1.3b and fast growing population swallow us up. Have India started family planning program for their people ? I guess not. They are but a hopeless country !</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large; line-height: 1.231;">With the high growth we get from China our govt will be able to pick and choose MNCs.

              <p><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 12px;">Do you think
                  this is still the right thing to do ? --&gt; No that is exactly my
                  point. Many companies choose to be here only for cost
                  reasons,nothing more. Now that is taken by China and others and
                  they are moving. Unlike China who managed to acquire th technology
                  for self,Singapore failed.</span></p>
              <p>Sir, MNCs are irresponsible,I have been in many meetings where
                  the discussions were how to find loopholes in govt rules,thats how
                  it is done. That is known but no one can control them anymore since
                  by the time an impact is suggested and a rule inacted(by those not
                  lobbied),it"s too late. Since you mentioned apple, have you seen
                  what is written on it? Something like designed in California,
                  Assembled in China. </p>
              <p><img src="http://twimgs.com/informationweek/byte/commentary/2012-April/iphone4-cost-model-china-big.png" alt="" width="752" height="546"></p>
              <p>Let me make the picture easier to understand, it an iPhone cost
                  100$, the Chinese get about 5$,Japanese about 15$(Display) and
                  Americans about 80$. Why do these guys who do no physical labour
                  get so much profit?There you have it,IP protection laws.Labour is
                  cheap,IP not. Thats where the West survives. And why they failed in
                  China, Chinese guys were even wiser, they learned the game,copied
                  the stuff and then inacted 'their own IP rules'.That's how these
                  games are played.  Today Chinese have made Xiaomi which rivals
                  Apple in many ways and is growing fast,not to mention
                  others.Singapore unfortunately lost in this game not only in this
                  but in all sectors.</p>
              <p>Even the American govt today cannot twist the arm of any
                  MNC,otherwise they would have brought all the manufacturing jobs to
                  US. Have you sir, heard of lobbying?Simply put it is where the
                  interests of MNCs are passed into rules via senators who draft
                  them.</p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong,Singapore did what they could very well till
                  about 5 years ago. Then they weren't able to capitalize on it to
                  grow national competence.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>We can't twist MNCs arms ? Not true! Apple is moving part of the assembly operation back to America after pressure from Obama. Google and Microsoft open back door for NSA to steal information. You know Snowden ?! He is still alive in Russia. Even Singapore govt was able to force OUB to close down eventhough they were doing very well.</p>
              <p>PAP govt can stop those financial institutions from continuing to laundary rich Indonesians money in Singapore if necessary. But I guess they won't do this for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>As I explained in the other post Singapore has not been doing well for the last 10 to 15 years simply because of PAP anti-china policy. If you stick to USA and India then you will die with them of course. These two countries are not growing how can you grow ?!</p>
              <p>We have to pick the right partner. We have to work with winner not loser ! PAP's wrong choice has make us suffer today.</p>
              <p>Look at Austrialia ! Before China's open door policy no one heard about Australia much. Today they are booming and reccession is unheard of for more than 10 years because they export materials to China.</p>

              <p>Sir,</p>
              <p>I understand your optimism and passion. Unfortunately though it seems it not inline with world realities.Everything you mentioned would have been perfect in an ideal world,which ours is not. Signing PMET with India wasn't a good move for Singapore,for PAP,MNCs,yes. If all the German industries pulled out of SG many Singaporeans will be jobless. Perhaps it would be interesting for you to know how many Singaporean companies are working,atleast known in EU. I have seen tiger balm,nothing else.</p>
              <p>MNC"s fund political campaigns usually as shawdows,when the candidate wins they get favours back. It's how politics wok in most countries. Most companies have internal departments doing analysis,tasked with influencing govt policies,accounts in caymann to transfer money as bribes etc.</p>
              <p>Australian economy is in a bad shape especially due to their currency appreciation and carbon tax. They too have a skilled migrant program which took many from SEA. No one heard of Iraq as well before the American wars,publicity doesn't mean a thing.</p>
              <p>Singapore can side with any one they choose. There are many things happening in different levels which are not so obvious to many. If SG sided with Chinese it would be seen as going against the Americans(due to Chinese-American not-so subtle hostilities) which can't be risked for the country.India is non-aligned and w<span style="line-height: 1.231;">ith India they do a lot of military exchanges(overt and covert) which is not possible with Chinese. Indian employees are usually docile and well behaving.Moving out of Asia,strong attachment with USA brings no real benefits, they won't provide employment or military help.And as like Japan most likely would establish a base in SG as well.Is it what you want?</span></p>
              <p>So every action,policy and agreement has a reason behind it which is well thought of. We can give the credit to policy makers for having thought of that well.When I was younger I had not-so amicable feelings to other countries. When you are older and wiser it seems, everyone is equally good and equally bad,just serving their own interest in personal,social and national levels.Good day!</p>
