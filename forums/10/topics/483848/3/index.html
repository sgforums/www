              <p>Sir,</p>
              <p>I understand your optimism and passion. Unfortunately though it
              seems it not inline with world realities.Everything you mentioned
              would have been perfect in an ideal world,which ours is not.
              Signing PMET with India wasn't a good move for Singapore,for
              PAP,MNCs,yes. If all the German industries pulled out of SG many
              Singaporeans will be jobless. Perhaps it would be interesting for
              you to know how many Singaporean companies are working,atleast
              known in EU. I have seen tiger balm,nothing else.</p>
              <p>MNC"s fund political campaigns usually as shawdows,when the
              candidate wins they get favours back. It's how politics wok in most
              countries. Most companies have internal departments doing
              analysis,tasked with influencing govt policies,accounts in caymann
              to transfer money as bribes etc.</p>
              <p>Australian economy is in a bad shape especially due to their
              currency appreciation and carbon tax. They too have a skilled
              migrant program which took many from SEA. No one heard of Iraq as
              well before the American wars,publicity doesn't mean a thing.</p>
              <p>Singapore can side with any one they choose. There are many
              things happening in different levels which are not so obvious to
              many. If SG sided with Chinese it would be seen as going against
              the Americans(due to Chinese-American not-so subtle hostilities)
              which can't be risked for the country.India is non-aligned and
              w<span style="line-height: 1.231;">ith India they do a lot of
              military exchanges(overt and covert) which is not possible with
              Chinese. Indian employees are usually docile and well
              behaving.Moving out of Asia,strong attachment with USA brings no
              real benefits, they won't provide employment or military help.And
              as like Japan most likely would establish a base in SG as well.Is
              it what you want?</span></p>
              <p>So every action,policy and agreement has a reason behind it
              which is well thought of. We can give the credit to policy makers
              for having thought of that well.When I was younger I had not-so
              amicable feelings to other countries. When you are older and wiser
              it seems, everyone is equally good and equally bad,just serving
              their own interest in personal,social and national levels.Good
              day!</p>

              <p>I figure out politics in less than a year. It is really all about interest, interest and interest. If you are serving my interest, I will support you. If you are opposing my interest...you'll know what comes around. </p>

              <p>Good for pappy govt n companies involved.   They can continue to make sure they employ foreigners only.  Pappy can continue wayang they are open to employ locals and as usual in their own way they employ only foreigners.</p>
              <p>If pappies claim lack of talent, we sure are desperately lack of talent to run the country singapore.  We should look out for foreigners to be leaders to run the country .  This is also in line with pappies' foreigners policy.</p>

              <p><strong>Singaporean First Party</strong> feels like a really weak party. They have no facebook page, gets trolled on FB twice, and lacks the "idealism" spark I am trying to look for.  Their logo is...well...suckish. I feel that Singapore really lacks a capable and charmistic opposition. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>
