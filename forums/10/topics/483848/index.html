              <p>My personal encounter tells me that the banking sector is particularly glaring with foreigners issue. Most of the tenant I encountered either work in the banking industry as senior banking officers or software engineers. From the fact that they can afford $5k rental per month at the age of about 35 with a wife as housewife and usually 2 children studying at international schools I estimate their pay to be 15k and above. They are usually Indian Nationals by the way.</p>
              <p>The above is what PAP has for foreigners. </p>
              <p>You may think these indian nationals are exceptionally good but that is simply not true. Almost everyone of them I come across earn that kind of salary and I come across about 50 of them per year for the last ten to fifteen years. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">It is getting worst year by year even after the last election.</span></p>
              <p>So what PAP has for locals ?</p>
              <p>My friend is a A Star scholar. He is a first class honours with an engineering degree from NUS. At 45 years old now he earns about $8k per month in his previous job. After he got retrenched again few weeks back he found another job ( as his resume is rather impressive and has good connection) but in a different field. He is now earning about $7k per month.</p>
              <p>Many of my friends are earning around this figure. They usally have master degree or MBA from NUS or NTU and almost all of them has engineering degrees. They are between 45-55 years old.</p>
              <p>So what is happening ?!</p>
              <p>Why our own best students with more years of experience earning less than foreigners with less experience. Please note that these foreigners are NOT from well known universities at all. They are mostly graduated from univeristies from their own country which is basically unheard of.</p>
              <p>The conclusion I draw from the above fact is we have a very incompetent PAP govt. They have failed us. They failed to train our best students for the best jobs in Singapore. Instead they now have to recruit foerigners to fill those well paid posts whereas Singaporeans best students ended up doing lower pay jobs.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I begin to come across many Indian National doctors last 3-4 years. Mostly junior doctor who has to rent single room when they start working here. I am sure they will move to better accommodation in no time. How about PAP govt gives our own best students a chance to become doctors ?</p>
              <p>Two of the children of Malay neighbour became doctors about 10 years ago after studying at KL's university. They now work for Malaysian Hospital in KL and will probably never come back to Singapore.</p>
              <p>PAP govt is getting complacent and has failed us in many ways but this is the worst part because we ended up become second class citizens comparing to these foreigners.</p>

              <p>I don't think you understand or accept reality in singapore...   you are the one who gao bu qing chu zhuang kuang.    I have been in banking there are both hopeless and capable ones.   As for foreigners be they good or not they are more welcome to join them as employees compare to locals.</p>
              <p>You are just like pappies fast, unreasonable and heartless to point fingers at locals.  you hate sgporeans so much to view their problems created by pappues as incitement.</p>
              <p>It is a very well known fact in sg iT industry is dominated by indians from india.   Many of my IT friends were retrenched from companies who prefer indian nationality over locals.   </p>
              <p>Are you a foreigner?   Are you sgporean living in spore who refuses to acknowledge the greed and policies of PAP are affecting locals?   You sound very arrogant, qian pian.</p>

              <p>Some people said banks hire capable people. He is implying that Singaporeans are not capable enough to be hired.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I think firstly our govt must provide the right traing to its people. We also should not forget we can't just go to a more advanced country to work as if we are part of them. Their govt (Europeans, Americans etc) will protect their citizens and reserve the jobs for their own citizens. They will only approve and allow Singaporeans to work there if the NMC concerned really can't find their own people to work for them.</span></p>
              <p>There may be some NMCs disregarding their own govt policy to achieve their selfish aims but that is the minority.</p>
              <p>Our PAP govt should do the same as what Taiwanese, HK, European, American govt etc do. People do that for a reason ! We also have to protect and reserve the best jobs for our own people if you want them to be royal to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Indian National are India citizens ! They are by no mean Singaporeans eventhough they looks like some of us. We have to be clearheaded about this point and cannot get confused and fall into the trap set by PAP govt. We have to protect Singaporeans from the 1.2b - 1.3b Indians as they are trying to grab jobs from us and dominated our banking and software industry.</p>
              <p>Don't sell our best jobs to foreigners. Don't sell our country to foreigners. Don't betray Singaporeans !!</p>

              <p>Here I would like to explain the main reasons why PAP is betraying Singaporeans. Mind you I am not trying to expain how they do it but rather why they do it.</p>
              <p>1. PAP is scare of China.</p>
              <p>- To cut a long storey short. He fell out with China's leaders over Suzhaou project and decided to re-aligned itself with the Ameriacan to give China a hard time. This is none of my business. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Unfortunately, China is the country which is booming. They are growing at 7.5-10% every year whereas America is in a reccession. America hardly grow 2-3% a year. So when we stick with America then we get 2-3% growth rate per year too and so the 2 casinos came into Singapore.</span></p>
              <p>- To beef up his support PAP govt worked very hard for it. Finally with the encouragement of the US govt he managed to bring in more partners for Asean to counter China. He brought in Japan, Australia, NZ, India etc</p>
              <p>- Then come the worst part for Singaporeans. To entice India to come to Asean he betrayed Singaporeans and sold our best jobs to India thr the signing of PMET with them.</p>
              <p>- We should also note that one of the reason why he is so scare of China is because he  wanted revenge. He wanted revenge for his failure at Suzhou and he knows the Chinese know it and despise him for being so revengful and short sighted. So the hatred is now both way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. PAP wants High GDP for Singapore.</p>
              <p>Please note. He didn't want high family income for Singaporeans. His main aim is to achieve high GDP for Singapore. First of all Singapore's GDP has to be higher than Malaysia. In order to achieve this aim he brought in whatever foreign workers needed and mess up Singapore social fabrc but he couldn't careless. Singaporeans welfare is not part of his concern at all.</p>
              <p>In addition to beating Malaysia in GDP which is of paramount impt to him he also needed the high GDP ao that he can collect high tax money. But he didn't want high tax so that Singaporeans can live a better life. He has done close to nothing for Singaporeans. What we get today is just the by product of his hunger for power. We have never been an impt consideration in his mind.</p>
              <p>So why then he needs so much tax money ? Because he wanted to punch above his weight. He wants to become the leader of Asean which consist of a few hundred millions people. With high GDP and high tax collection he created GIC and Tamasek Holdings and he can throw his weight around. He started to ignore Wahid or Habibi or Mahatir etc. Money speaks louder than word ! He didn't give a damn about them and that satisfied his ego alot.</p>
              <p>So what I am just a small red dot ?! Once I am able to command the few hundred millions people in Asean I will teach China a lesson....</p>

              <p>Sorry Sir if my posts came across as anti-local much like your post which appears to pain Indian IT as incompetent.Everywhere in the world I have been from Airbus to Nokia,IT is outsourced to some Indian company.</p>
              <p>I am a striver for equality.World is not black and white as many makes it out to be.<span style="line-height: 1.231;">In UK there has been many problems since thw Polish migration.NO law forbids EU Nationals from working in UK and many locals were displaced.Now it's better as jobs in Poland attracts them back. I haven't seen a job in SG which has invited anyone other than Singaporean/PR to apply.Even Malaysians are left out more and more. This is same in Australia,EU eventhough it's not made explicit.It's not a secret how many SGians are in Australia,UK or US. Rules there like in SG provides for equality. I have seen more Nigerians in China than Indians in SG.</span></p>
              <p>SG like every country is ultimately run by MNC's today. Government can't do much unless it's middle east and things are done gradually.Most of employment opportunity comes from MNC(US+EU) who outsource to SG for cheaper price. PAP has advertised SG as a cheaper hub and has succeeded to bring in developments so far. However there are countries like China,Vietnam,Philippines etc who offer similar if not better value. Recently we took the decision to close all our operations in Australia and move to China because of Carbon tax and increased currency value. Thats now companies work, go to cheaper places for more profits.</p>
              <p>GOVT has their own limitations in this globalised macro-economic context as well. If they bring a rule saying only 'red passports' can be employed,many companies will close. There aren't many local companies who can absorb them.<span style="line-height: 1.231;">However they can be more leniant with CPF,NS etc AFAIK.</span></p>
              <p>My 2cents for those who can comprehend this.</p>

              <p>I was in London 2 weeks ago, the cab drivers I met were a Polish and an African who lived 7 years in Netherland and then moved to UK 2 years ago (couldn't quite understand his english). The hotel I stayed in egam was run by an Indian family, the staff serving breakfast were from Romania. The sourvenir shops were run by a guy from Oman and another from Vietnam, and of course, those running the Chinese restaurants spoke only Cantonese. I didn't meet any pure anglo saxon!!</p>
              <p>I went to Copenhagan for 2 nights and the river cruise conductor was from Czh republic and she spoke english, german, and obviously Danish and her Czh language. The cafeteria I went to was run by Turkish, I was served in a restaurant by a guy from Greece. Fortunately, the hotel counter staff were local Danish, but when I went into the lift, the guy who delivered laundary had his name tagged as Abdullah!!</p>
              <p>wellcome to the new world order.</p>

              <p>Please understand what is EU before you write the above. You are confused ! Please don't bring your confusion to others.</p>
              <p>Firstly, Singapore is not in a union. We can't go and work in the EU like those countries in the it. Also no Singaporeans want to go work in India. So why PMET with India ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, we Singaporeans are not complaining about low pay jobs like waiter, nurse etc taken up by foreigners. Did you read our posts at all before you reply ?!</p>

              <p>Sorry Sir if my posts came across as anti-local much like your
              post which appears to pain Indian IT as incompetent.Everywhere in
              the world I have been from Airbus to Nokia,IT is outsourced to some
              Indian company.</p>
              <p>I am a striver for equality.World is not black and white as many
              makes it out to be.<span style="line-height: 1.231;">In UK there
              has been many problems since thw Polish migration.NO law forbids EU
              Nationals from working in UK and many locals were displaced.Now
              it's better as jobs in Poland attracts them back. I haven't seen a
              job in SG which has invited anyone other than Singaporean/PR to
              apply.Even Malaysians are left out more and more. This is same in
              Australia,EU eventhough it's not made explicit.It's not a secret
              how many SGians are in Australia,UK or US. Rules there like in SG
              provides for equality. I have seen more Nigerians in China than
              Indians in SG.</span></p>
              <p>SG like every country is ultimately run by MNC's today.
              Government can't do much unless it's middle east and things are
              done gradually.Most of employment opportunity comes from MNC(US+EU)
              who outsource to SG for cheaper price. PAP has advertised SG as a
              cheaper hub and has succeeded to bring in developments so far.
              However there are countries like China,Vietnam,Philippines etc who
              offer similar if not better value. Recently we took the decision to
              close all our operations in Australia and move to China because of
              Carbon tax and increased currency value. Thats now companies work,
              go to cheaper places for more profits.</p>
              <p>GOVT has their own limitations in this globalised macro-economic
              context as well. If they bring a rule saying only 'red passports'
              can be employed,many companies will close. There aren't many local
              companies who can absorb them.<span style="line-height: 1.231;">However they can be more leniant with CPF,NS
              etc AFAIK.</span></p>
              <p>My 2cents for those who can comprehend this.</p>

              <p>Do you think Singapore is developing country or developed country ?! You said our govt is adverising Singapore as a cheap hub...are you out of your mind ? Do you think this is still the right thing to do ?</p>
              <p>You are not well informed about how things work in this world at all. The world is not just run by companies. The time that comanies can decide everything is over since than 15-20 years ago. No govt in the world today, including USA, allows companies a free hand anymore. No one trust NMCs anymore basically.</p>
              <p>We all now know that NMCs are basically irresponsible by nature. For example they will relese any wastes to the rivers if no one controls them. For example Apple will move their factory anyway they like irregardless of whether it is best for USA citizens. As far as NMCs are concerned, since globalization started, there is no patriotism to talk about.</p>
              <p>So since 20 years ago, governments all over the world have been keeping a watchful eyes over NMCs. Governments all over the world has implemented policies to protect its citizens. Singapore govt is slow in realizing this fact or may be simply choose to ignore it. As for Singaporeans because we are an authoritarian state thus a lot of information has been suppressed by SPH and Media Corp. and  so we are not well informed at all.</p>
              <p>I hope Singaporeans can quickly realize the predicament we are in and pressurize the govt to do the right things for Singaporeans. There are a lot of ways the govt can twist the arms of NMCs and make them take care of locals.</p>
