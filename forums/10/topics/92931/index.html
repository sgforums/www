            <div class='col-md body'>How do we fight a group of people who believe their religion transcends all government authority on Earth?Is there a way to deal with such mindless creatures?Seemingly, we cannot bomb them into submission, and now much of the world is afflicted by this stain, cursing us to live in a time where unparalled prosperity and development is also full of violence and unprecedented hatred for secularity.What makes a perso so rabidly fanatic about the justness of his cause that he embraces it outside any social norm?Is it because he is already placing himself outside our society and culture that he deems it a holy cause to eradicate the culture and the lives we are engaged in?If that's the case, then we should not negotiate, because we can never hope to acheive a policy where we can actually turn-off his brainwashing and re-integrate him into the peace loving nations of the world.<br><br>It's a very big dilemma which all societies might one day be forced to solve, and how we solve this will impact on the direction our world will take in the coming decades.The sooner we eradicate this blot on human progress, the sooner we can focus our energy and time on cleaning up the planet and investing in space exploration, off-world resource surveys on the moon and further research into alternative energy.Imagine if we did not have to divert so much of our funds into anti-terrorism measures?Would we have been halfway on the road to solving the social and financial problems in Africa and South America?Absolutely.These raging meatheads are only delaying our progress.Let's wipe them and their influence out asap.Destroy their motivation to fight by urgently address the causes that propel them to take up arms and kill.<br><br>Militant Islam is deluded if it thinks it can convert this world into an Islamic Caliphate.Misquotation and selective contextual quotation of the Koran takes place so often that preachers mislead impressionable young , uneducated, oppressed men to die for nothing.Leading Moslem academics should undertake a serious and tough review of the madrasahs in their own country for we cannot reform a religion, only the believers can do so.If Europe had not gone through the Reformation, we would see Christian militants running around a long time ago, IMHO.Reforms are the only way forward.TIme cannot be wasted anymore, before we go down the road of no return and irrevocably change the fabric of our societies into something that is vigliante in nature.Pray for peace.The world needs it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many are brainwashed in religious school from young. They are then perhaps reinforce by what they see and hear.<br><br>To reduce their numbers, you need to<br>(1) Remove the hard-cores from the population (I leave the method to your imagination)<br>(2) Monitor religious schools. Unfortunately, this is up to individual countries.<br>(3) Do less evil, do not give them any reason to hate you. This is up to individuals as well as countries to act in a fair manner that gives these people no excuses to fuel their hatred.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Any reason is a good enough reason to hate if you want to hate. some have said that poverty and social injustice are reasons that drive terrorism but there are many poor countries that do not produce terrorist. you don hear laotian or rwandans running around the world blowing up innocent people that have nothing against them.<br><br>terrorism, if taken from a historical view always have an overarching purpose to it...u don die for poverty but for political aims (tamil tigers/IRA). neither do you die for the well-being of people but for a god or some other divine stuff (slamic).<br><br>so i really do not know what is the best solution to religious-linked terrorism. can it really be eradicated? there is always someone somewhere who wants to hate somebody, and that i think is the real problem. religion and politics are just good excuses.<br><br>war is an ever-present curse of man's existence. where there is man, there'll be hate, there'll be war. i guess we are fighting a different type of war now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Those who commit the terror acts are just some minority Muslims. It doesn't reflect the overall perception of Muslim community.<br>Most likely, those ppl come from Wahhabis ideology, a hard-lined idealism, that is widely found in Saudi Arabia. Those ppl seek to form a Caliphate, whereby Islam will rule the world under one ruler.<br>There are other internal conflicts as well such as clash of ideas between the Shiites and Sunnis in Iraq &amp; Iran, to name a few.<br>Moreover, those ppl are able to carry out terrors due to their large number of followers.<br>Poverty, unemployment, disillusionment of rapid globalisation &amp; repressive governments (widely seen in Middle East) are the catalyst for the terrorist to recruit huge number of folowers. The restless youths are "brainwashed" so that they view the idea of democracy &amp; globalisation as detrimental to the teaching of Quran.<br>The moderate Muslims are reluctant to voice out their criticisms as they would be seen as supporting USA' causes, which has a double standard policy on the sensitive Israel-Palestinian issue.<br><br>Hence, it is baseless to argue that "terrorism has become an Islamic enterprise", as 'stansingh' commented in his locked thread.</div>
