Somehow or rather they just have to say something or do something that get everyone's attention. Must be the effect of being overshadowed by Big Brother all the time!<br><br>Are Singaporeans dumb? Please Mr Li, yes we are not perfect, we do make mistakes, hell, we are fast running out of ideas on how we should steer this ship. Yes, we are at times gullible and yes maybe not very intelligent. BUT DUN U DARE MR LI UNDERESTIMATE THE RESOLVE OF US ALL!! As I do not underestaimate your country's resolve to establish it's own soverignity or for that matter, unification with the mainland.<br><br>That comment of yours just reflects sheer arrongance and contempt on your part towards us Singaporeans and it just undermines your own credibility.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The original remarks about the overseas chinese in china was that Taiwanese are bad, Hongkongers are cunning and Singaporean are stupid. Take it whichever way we like.<br><br>I really wish we have a Li Ao character in Singapore. One who is a headache for the ruling party. During the rule of KMT he was a Taiwan Independence Element but under DDP he is anti independence and pro one china two systems. He speaks up against the government, and he toyed with the taboo .He was jailed for many years under sedition law in Taiwan.  He wrote over 100 books many of which exposed social ills and most of which were censored, but people listen to him. He does not belong to any political party but nobody can ignore him in politics.<br><br>There are many lessons from his activities in Taiwan alone, for the singaporean politicians, especially those in the opposition. He is critical, witty, knowledgeable, has a strong grasp of current affairs, courageous, confident, and he gained the support of the people.<br><br>Li Ao's opponents are the DDP, the KMT and the CCP, don't think he has time for singapore, so why bother about what he says. If Chen Wen Qian and Long Yin Tai speak, then we should pay a little attention.</div>
