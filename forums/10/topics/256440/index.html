            <div class='col-md body'>Causes:<br><br>The cause of this disorder is unknown, but biological or genetic factors may play a role.<br><br>A family history of the disorder Â— such as having an antisocial parent Â— increases the chances of developing the condition. A number of environmental factors within the childhood home, school and community, such as an overly punitive home or school environment may also contribute.[6]<br><br>Robins (1966) found an increased incidence of sociopathic characteristics and alcoholism in the fathers of individuals with antisocial personality disorder. He found that, within such a family, males had an increased incidence of ASPD, whereas females tended to show an increased incidence of somatization disorder instead.[7]<br><br>Bowlby (1944) saw a connection between antisocial personality disorder and maternal deprivation in the first five years of life. Glueck and Glueck (196<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> saw indications that the mothers of children who developed this personality disorder tended to display a lack of consistent discipline and affection, and an abnormal tendency to alcoholism and impulsiveness. These factors all contributing to failure to create a stable and functional home with consistent structure and behavioral boundaries.[7]<br><br>Adoption studies support the role of both genetic and environmental contributions to the development of the disorder. Twin studies also indicate an element of hereditability of antisocial behaviour in adults and have shown that genetic factors are more important in adults than in antisocial children or adolescents where shared environmental factors are more important.
