When you set up a trust - say for your family or children, you put in your money or property, then you leave it to the trustees. My point is very simple: if you get the meaning or concept of trust - then the question on whether it is your money or whether you have a say would not arise. But if you don't get the concept, then I supposed you will be back to square and there will be no end. </span><br><br>2. Your analogy is not quite correct. We are not children. We are adult citizens, and I don't believe we adults like to be treated like children, as the government sometimes treats us.<br><span style="color: red;">You are wrong. We are always someone's children. Growing up into adult doesn't not mean we know better and therefore need not be treated like children. I've seen 70-year old fools.</span><br><br>Moreover, you seek to characterise paternalistic government and "care-less" government as two polar opposites, with the former as the obvious choice.

A caring government does not tell people how to live their lives and force them to comply with that rigid paradigm of what life is.<br><span style="color: red;">A paternalistic parent is very likely to be caring than one who is not. That is the meaning of paternalistic. An apathetic parent need not be less caring but certainly not more caring.  Therefore, it is not possible to separate caring from paternalistic, otherwise the term has no meaning!<br>A caring parent will certainly tell you how to lead your life. I can't see any other way. When you have lived long enough, you will get the meaning better.
