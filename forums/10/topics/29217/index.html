Read other thread in this forum. We have already gone through this topic.<br><br>These Spike mounted M113 shouldn't come as a surprised or as some top secret thingy. They are just going to improve the anti-tank capability for each amoured battle group (I think probably at company or battalion level) given our neighours are acquiring MBT capabilities. We need, in immediate term, stronger anti-tank capabilities (in ther form of Apaches, Tow-armed Fennecs and Spikes armed vehicles) until SAF receives its 105mm armed light tank and possibly the replacement for the Centurions.<br><br>SAF should also, IMHO, look into fielding short range Spike to complement or replace the Armbrust, and the non-line of sight anti-armour weapons, such as EFOGM, BONUS top attack artillery rounds, 81mm Merlin Mortar rounds, and  guided 120mm mortar rounds like the SAAB/Bofors Strix.<br></div>
