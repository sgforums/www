But now, school girl are aggressive enough to pose offensive videos of their despicable acts online. Its the men who are punished and not the girls. If equal punisment is given, the judgement is fair. Sabotage is common as girls are easily to be proven innocent if they report to authorities. What do you guys say?</div>

However, they are still nothing when compared to what women had been through in the past. Women had always been treated a lot worse. Some are still badly treated today. Men wouldn't speak up when it's women who's on the receiving end but once men themselves are on the receiving end, they start behaving resentfully. That is what makes me laugh.<br><br>Not that I agree with those women do, though. I think the system to protect women is good, but it is simply not funny when something meant to protect our interests have been abused in such manners.<br><br>I do think that the government should pass a law about women who abuse the system.<br><br>I'm not updated about the furore over the videos though, so I won't comment further on it.<br><br>EDIT: My post is mostly commenting about the Women's Charter.</div>
