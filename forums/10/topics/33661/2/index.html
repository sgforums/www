            <div class='col-md body'>the claim that spore lost $$$ in its investments is nothing new...... dare to claim what economic intelligence..... the investment community knew of it a few years back........ obviously if that is the intelligence you get..... obviously you are not very intelligent.....  GIC is very active in the market......as with any investments, you will make $$$ and suffer loss. the issue is not so much of losing $$$..... most investment have a long term investment horizon.....meaning you do not look at short term profit....probably looking at 10 years of more......even if we are to lose $$$ now it is not even an issue...... obviously, dr m lacks knowledge in the field of investment.....he can consider getting the dean of the finance dept of UM to brief him....<br><br>by the way, in 1996, the bank negara used its own forex reserves to dabble in the forex market...they lost a few billions in USD...... the point is that central bank exist is to regulate their own monetary policy and not speculate in the forex market for the sake of getting a profit...........someone must remind them of their fail 'investments' too.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, that is true, but one has to be mindful of the fact that some of it is taxpayers' money...<br><br>its obvious that he's trying to work up the emotions of singaporeans against their gov't to deflect the anger over the nonsense that m'sia has been shovelling at us for so long.<br><br>hee hee... talk about "economic intelligence"... most people would've heard about their time.com fiasco... the usual... throw money at a bumiputra to make him a poster boy only to find that he's pissed it all away... talk about a lousy investment...<br><br>seriously, military intelligence isn't the only thing that's important in intelligence gathering... i'm sure there're economists, statisticians, sociologists, psychologists and political scientists holed up somewhere chewing through the data to find out exactly what makes them tick... and how to make it <strong>stop</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>know thy foe...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div>
