              <p>With inflation hovering around 6%, my expectation is that it will continue within the range of 4% to 6% in the next 10 years. Interest rates currently pay you less than 1% a year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Looking at the current retiring generation of folks in their 55s to 60s. These 55s to 60s have a total of $14,768,999,000 distributed amongst themselves (262,641).</p>
              <p>This works out to about $56,233 per each soon to be sexagenarian.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How much do you think $56,233 will last these old folks if they leave it in CPF to earn 2.5%, withdrawing $1,000 per month?</p>
              <p>5 years!!! Provided that no chronic illness befalls them, else it will be even shorter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With inflation hovering around 4% - 6% in the future (my guesstimate). Does the interest rates that CPF pay these old folks even make up for the increase in cost of living? We are all making negative interest rates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any chance of retirement for the average Joe Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>Yes!!! But only in your wildest dreams!!!</p>

              <p><br>Quite ironic don't you think?</p>
              <p><br>The CPF was conceived out of helping average Singaporeans plan their retirement savings, since it is no longer a credible source of retirement savings to rely on, shouldn't the government do something to prop up this source of retirement funds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those elderly (60 y.o. born in 1948) who contributed their salary since they started working in 1968 are retiring soon. But the sum they have in their CPF, is not even sufficient for them to live for 5 years without medical illness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the PAP government chooses not to prop up the retirement savings of the average Singaporeans, shouldn't they scrap the CPF scheme altogether. Afterall, why give the average Singaporeans a false sense of security by making them think that CPF would see them through their old age.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or, they should consider raising the interest rates to a ceiling to match the inflation rate and a floor equivalent to their current calculation of 2.5% now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All those multi-million dollar salaries and they can't even keep their word of CPF as a source of funds for retirement. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>With inflation hovering around 6%, my expectation is that it
              will continue within the range of 4% to 6% in the next 10 years.
              Interest rates currently pay you less than 1% a year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Looking at the current retiring generation of folks in their 55s
              to 60s. These 55s to 60s have a total of $14,768,999,000
              distributed amongst themselves (262,641).</p>
              <p>This works out to about $56,233 per each soon to be
              sexagenarian.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How much do you think $56,233 will last these old folks if they
              leave it in CPF to earn 2.5%, withdrawing $1,000 per month?</p>
              <p>5 years!!! Provided that no chronic illness befalls them, else
              it will be even shorter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With inflation hovering around 4% - 6% in the future (my
              guesstimate). Does the interest rates that CPF pay these old folks
              even make up for the increase in cost of living? We are all making
              negative interest rates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any chance of retirement for the average Joe Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>Yes!!! But only in your wildest dreams!!!</p>

              <p><br>Quite ironic don't you think?</p>
              <p><br>The CPF was conceived out of helping average Singaporeans plan their retirement savings, since it is no longer a credible source of retirement savings to rely on, shouldn't the government do something to prop up this source of retirement funds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those elderly (60 y.o. born in 1948) who contributed their salary since they started working in 1968 are retiring soon. But the sum they have in their CPF, is not even sufficient for them to live for 5 years without medical illness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the PAP government chooses not to prop up the retirement savings of the average Singaporeans, shouldn't they scrap the CPF scheme altogether. Afterall, why give the average Singaporeans a false sense of security by making them think that CPF would see them through their old age.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or, they should consider raising the interest rates to a ceiling to match the inflation rate and a floor equivalent to their current calculation of 2.5% now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All those multi-million dollar salaries and they can't even keep their word of CPF as a source of funds for retirement. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>After 51 Years of LKY at the helm, and finding out the "double speak" in most of his words documented - {read "a nation cheated"} - can we believe that the CPF was all about helping Singaporeans to save for retirement ?</p>
              <p>When LKY stepped into the seat of a Self-Governing Singapore, the British Colonial Government had already set up the Provident Fund, while LKY, Toh Chin Chye and Goh Keng Swee were toying with the idea of some form of Social Welfare.</p>
              <p>But with an empty State Treasury after Lim Yew Hock short rule at the helm, the easiest route to create money for the PAP to rule effectively was to expand aggressively on the Colonial Government's Provident Fund scheme.</p>
              <p>Over time, with the easy accessiblity to a cheap source of fund for public projects that can be accumulated in such geometrical proportions by legislations, the scheme was popularly promoted as a scheme towards "Home Ownership".</p>
              <p>The CPF became a permanent feature in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Sadly, the "Home Ownership" scheme was no better then borrowing our money at below market interest rates, and selling the homes to us with a huge profit, all of which resulted in the "Singapore Government laughing all the way to their Bank".</p>
              <p>Over time, realising that the accumulated funds from a large population of Post-War Babies cannot be returned in full even at such low interest rates paid to the CPF accounts, and with the CPF not being supported by new accounts from an expanding population to match the numbers of retiring "Post-War Babies" - this Government began a series of measure that restrict the amounts to be returned to the CPF Account Holders by holding back initial sums paid out by instalments, then an ingenious plan to transfer fractions from the Main CPF Account into some new scheme separately named as the Medi-Save and Medi-Shield.</p>
              <p>The sophistication in designing withdrawal restrictions on Singaporean CPF Accounts have now reached the ultimate stage - with the imposition of the minimum sum to be held until the median age of death determined separately for Singaporean Males and Females.</p>
              <p>Even the Colonial Government will not take as much from Singaporeans to be locked into its Provident Fund scheme, as they had realised at the early stage that too much taken will remove the ability for Singaporeans to make alternative arrangements for themselves - that included being enterprising.</p>
              <p>With the large amounts removed from the control of individual Singaporeans, and still expecting Singaporeans to look after ourselves during crisis, has this Government placed unnecessary burden on Singaporeans ?</p>
