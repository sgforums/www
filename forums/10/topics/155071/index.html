The reason is very simple. Please reflect upon WHY you are fearful in the first place!

Indoor talks and forums are LEGAL and do not need a license. There is no issue of "illegal assembly" here.<br><br>BTW, the Constitution of Singapore grant us the RIGHT to assemble peacefully but we have been robbed of this right by administrative rules.

We've given the ruling party a lot of chances, &amp; they still screw things up for the people.

            <div class='col-md body'>It is not that Singaporeans are afraid of being arrested by the police, it is just that the opposition still have not realised 1 thing, that the reasons why they constantly lose GEs is simple: Singaporeans know that the Opposition is weak, and that they cannot put up a credible fight against the PAP. The by-election strategy is proof of that.  They are already conceding defeat even the war begins, how can?</div>
