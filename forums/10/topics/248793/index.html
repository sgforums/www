Even immigration check were passed to landlords who could be jailed for so-called renting of premises to foreigners which MHA has failed to carry out.<br><br>Facts speak for themselves. With such reduction in their duties and works, Ministers have lesser problems and worries but citizens are being told they are the great talents who should be paid more salaries and bonuses.<br><br>There is no more fair play in our present system with the ministers doing lesser but able to engage in power game of promoting themselves and protecting their own interests. All the rewards are going to the ministers and the civil servants.<br><br>Morever whenever anything goes wrong they would take the easy way out by denying problems with the newspapers keeping quiet about real problems for years or ministers coming up with excuses as being uttered by V Balakrishnan or Yacoob to justify the civil servants' pay increases despite the people's dropping wages and indebtedness and all the high costs of living caused by unnecessary taxes in the face of all the hidden surpluses and profiteering.<br><br>The only talent our ministers have seem to be their ability to enslave the population, hypocrisy and blaming problems on the people or giving of quick excuses of one kind of another with problems remaining unsolved for years.</div>

Are you a civil servant? Do you know what kind of crap we handle daily? The five day work week is a farce and most civil servants slave away on extra programs on weekends without pay and OT!

We elected them we face the music. The civil service is not instrumental in lowering cost of living etc. They have to suffer the same taxations and suffering as the rest and the take the brunt from people ignorant of their roles.

Majority of them get lesser than those working in the commercial and banking sectors.<br><blockquote><strong><br>However I did point out that the lower-ranking civil servants like the clerical staff are over-paid.<br></strong></blockquote>Can you justify your claim? Can you produce the data to verify your statements?

I don't see many millionaire cleaners and clerical staff.<br><blockquote><strong><br>The overpaid and under-worked are the ministers and the grades A-G civil servants who are mostly pushing pens and carrying out instructions but fearing to make changes.</strong></blockquote>Are you a civil servant Robert? Do you know their job scope before making such fantastic claims? Please substantiate your claims with facts rather than push unverified thoughts from your fingertips to the screen.<br></div>

If you are in the civil service and you work the grounds there, you will understand the sentiments of most civil servants. We aren't getting anymore than you. In fact most of us are getting less and being squeezed dry by the top ethos.</div>
