            <div class='col-md body'>Something I would like to clarify based on inside stories. The 'increment' is not of 'proper' proportions. i.e. The one on top is getting increments like 30 over%, followed by 20 over%... e.t.c. By the time the 'increment' is distributed down the line, the bottom ones are only getting things like 2-4% or so... Which is really not much difference from a normal annual increment...<br><br>In fact, the scheme just so well diversified the 'firepower' from public so that the ones on top are collecting their 'big bucks' at a much reduced damage... It also created an avenue for the public to rant and display their dismay with... i.e. the general civil servants... Not to mention that it's more likely and much EASIER (yes, people often just choose the EASIER ROUTE) to just FLAME and 'ATTACK' the ones at the bottom and more common folks like you and me... Not any easier when they try to target people 'on top', nor any more effective while doing so...<br><br>Selfish people who create CHAOs among public for their own selfish reasons...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by greengoblin:</div><div class="quote_body">Robert, name me the number of teachers who are paid $8000 a month. You really do not know your facts well.<br><br>And if a teacher is paid $8000 a month, I will say it is justified considering the amount of work and heartache he or she has to go through. Teachers are among the most unappreciated civil servants of all.<br><br>If you wish to say that teachers only teach then I seriously encourage you to join the teaching profession and learn first hand what they are going through.<br><br>To get even half of what you are quoting there as a teacher's pay is not even justified for the work the teacher does.</div></blockquote>If we refer to the upcoming (or already current) wage scheme, teachers go into the service with a starting pay of 2.7K (assuming graduate-qualification).<br><br>This figure will rise with experience and potential. However, there is difference between qualification and potential.<br><br>Below is an excerpt from a blogpage:<br><br><blockquote>To understand how the system works, you first have to understand that performance and potential mean two completely different things in the civil service. They lead to very different, very distinct consequences in the official appraisal system.<br><br>For example, a civil servant may be judged to have very high potential, even though his performance is very poor. Alternatively, his performance may be judged to be utterly outstanding, and yet his potential may be judged to be extremely low.<br><br>Performance is linked to your annual bonuses and increments. Whereas potential is linked to your promotions. So Ms Ong Toon Hui is correct to say that those who perform well in their jobs will get bigger bonuses.<br><br>What Ms Ong isn't telling you is that those who perform well in their jobs may never get promoted. That's because promotions depend on your potential, and potential has nothing to do with performance.</blockquote>Source: <a href="http://mrwangsaysso.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Mr Wang says so</a><br><br>His above statement was in response to an article by Ong Toon Hui (Ms),<br>from the Prime Minister's Office, which did not disclose the full picture.<br><br>In any case, CEP-grading goes into a teacher's promotion or career path.<br><br>Back to the topic, if a teacher chooses to continue teaching instead of moving up, the highest one can attain will be 'senior teacher', and these old birds will usually rake in around 6K+. But that's as good as it gets.<br><br>Those who choose to ascend the ranks must first qualify by virtue of workmanship, results or by simply being a 'scholar'. Then how quickly one gets fast-tracked will depend on how well your performances goes. A certain amount of diplomacy plays a part too, as stepping on too many toes will not get you very far, even if one is supremely gifted.<br><br>Principals and Inspector-of-schools are classified as 'super-scale' salaried base and will earn on average 10K monthly. Those higher up...well it's really anyone's guess.<br></div>

I do understand how the rest in the civil service would feel including teachers if ministers and top civil servants are able to give themselves 30% pay rise by comparing themselves with the lucky few in the private sector who happen to be earning their earn million-dollar salaries because of a string of factors and circumstances like touching of big sweep lotteries. Who does not want a similar pay rise?<br><br>But the teachers who are lucky getting S$8,000.00 pm (senior teachers who reached $6,000.00 pm scale who also get holiday pays and 3 month bonuses)  should not just compare with top civil servants for they are many lower-ranking civil servants who are getting lesser. The adjunct teachers from the private sector are currently being paid at around $2,000.00 pm and not doing too bad in their performance.<br><br>Many people with equal or more talents are simply unable to get those opportunities not because of lack of talents or ability but because of not being connected to the leaders.<br><br>Yung Pung How for example, would not have become our chief justice due to his lack of practical legal experience at the time of appointment but because of sheer connection, he had been given the opportunity.<br><br>Now the truths have come out, due to postings by forumers. Ministers and top civil servants are not some supermen but are simply people given the opportunity to serve the citizens.<br><br>30% pay rise and 6-8 months of bonuses are simply too much and the truths have come out.<br><br>It is hoped that our ministers will stop promoting themselves again and again without basis.<br><br>They should let the ordinary people benefit from their performance first like enjoying lower costs of living and better services before giving themselves pay rise again.<br><br>It is not true that the ministers have more ability and higher talents than others. It is just that they are people given the rare opportunity to govern our country and serving the people.<br><br>They should irrespective of salaries and name without selfishness carry on serving the people with distinction instead of being engaged in so much money politics and promoting themselves.<br><br></div>
