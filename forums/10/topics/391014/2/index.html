              <p><br>All these are british and american are just jealous of us, they should mind their own business, westerners likes to about others, with so much human rights in their culture, what rights do they have to talk about our society, aren't their economy falling, ask them to take care of their own economy, gay marriage and unemployement rates before bumping us again. No wonder Malaysia also asked Aussie to shut up over Anwar case, each individual country must respect each other domestic issue, each should not go in meddle with it, just like, if my house got a problem, i dun need a neighbour a come and critise me, what right does he/she has??</p>

              <p>Do we need a Taiwanese 'hum' to stand up and defend Singapore's interests - when it is defending the PAP's interests and denying the truth of the events in Singapore from Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, the Malaysian Government will want the Aussies to shut-up on the Anwar's case when it is clear and open to the World that the sodomy charges are no more then another wild and desparate Malaysian Government attempts to sodomised Anwar's reputation.</p>
              <p>Only a typically blind government supporter like a Taiwanese 'hum' will bury itself into the mud and deny the truth of the real events occurring.</p>
              <p>If the British and American should mind their own business - what is the Taiwanese 'hum' doing getting involve with Singapore's business ?</p>
              <p>Get back home to your Taiwan, and face the challenge from China.</p>
