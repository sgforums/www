              <h1>The Economist accuses Singapore of being a “stingy nanny state”</h1>
              <div class="date">

              <p><span class="time">February 14, 2010</span></p>
              <p>Influential international journal The Economist has hit out at the Singapore government of being a “stingy nanny state” in reference to its antipathy and resistance towards public welfare.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Though it acknowledges that the government “does run a handful of schemes directed at some of the needy, from low-income students to the unassisted elderly, these benefits are rigorously means-tested and granted only sparingly.”</p>
              <p><em>“The most destitute citizens’ families may apply for public assistance; only 3,000 currently qualify. Laid-off workers receive no automatic benefits. Instead they are sorted into “workfare” and training schemes,”</em> it added.</p>
              <p>Known as the Public Assistance (PA) scheme, it gives applicants a monthly allowance of $330 which is hardly sufficient to survive in Singapore. One has to be completely destitute without any living relatives or certified permanently unfit to work by a medical specialist before one can qualify for it.</p>
              <p>The process of seeking help is also made tiresome and in some ways humiliating on purpose to deter “free-riders” from “abusing” the system.</p>
              <p>Singapore workers have no job security to speak of as a result of the government’s open-door policies towards foreign migrant workers who now make up more than 35 per cent of the workforce.</p>
              <p><em>“Official reassurances that migrants create growth do not convince those competing for scarce jobs. Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s founding father and still its “minister mentor” has maintained that ambitious migrants help to keep citizens on their toes. In an interview given to National Geographic last July he said that if native Singaporeans lag behind “hungry” foreigners because “the spurs are not stuck on [their] hinds”, that is not the state’s problem to solve,”</em> noted the Economist.</p>
              <p>According to a recent Wall Street Journal editorial, the relentless influx of foreign workers has depressed the wages of ordinary Singaporeans, increased the cost of living, especially that of public housing, decreased labor productivity and led to an overall decline in the standards of living.</p>
              <p>To compound matters, there are no independent trade unions to represent and fight for the interests of Singapore workers. The only legal trade union in Singapore – NTUC is a pseudo-PAP organization which is always headed by a PAP Minister (without portfolio).</p>
              <p>Right after he became Prime Minister in 2003, Lee Hsien Loong emphasized that “welfare is a dirty word in Singapore”, a sign that his administration will not do much to help those who have fallen behind.</p>
              <p>In a speech made in Parliament in November 2006, he said:</p>
              <p><em>“We need a sustainable approach.  You saw the numbers.  You see how quickly the number of old people and the proportion of old people is growing in Singapore.  Some MPs and some other commentators outside writing in the newspapers have suggested old age pensions, which they argue every Singaporean should have as of right, because I am born here, I carry a pink IC, I should have an old age pension.  But if every old person, whether rich or poor, is entitled to an old age pension, it is going to impose a very heavy financial burden on the State, which means a very heavy financial burden on young Singaporeans, because they are the ones who are going to be working and paying the taxes, which is where the State will get the money.”</em></p>
              <p>Yet the state is flushed with cash as evident by the billions of dollars it lost recently in failed overseas investments via its two sovereign wealth funds – GIC and Temasek Holdings.</p>
              <p>The Economist Society of Singapore (ESS) recently proposed to a government committee that it should build a more robust safety net, starting with unemployment insurance which would promote social stability and help muster public support for Singapore’s open-door migration policies.</p>
              <p><em>“While self-reliance is a good principle in general, it may be neither efficient nor just if taken to extremes,”</em> it claimed.</p>

              <p>The $330 for monthly provision for financial assistance is bullshit.  I know of people who are receiving this and the maximum they give is just $200.</p>
              <p>Though it acknowledges that the government “does run a handful of schemes directed at some of the needy, from low-income students to the unassisted elderly, these benefits are rigorously means-tested and <span style="color: #ff0000;">granted only sparingly</span>.” ==<span style="color: #0000ff;"> this is very true.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">That is the down side of having a govt who is not interesed to place public service as the top priority.    Seems money making is their main motive of staying in power.</span></p>

              <p>It does not make sense to have more than 1 minister in the ministries and PM's Office.   The ministers are paid world class salary and if I did not hear wrongly LKY did mention a few times that his ministers are first class.    First class, world class paid ministers incapable of handling the ministries themselves and need more than one minister doing the job is a joke.   The highest paid PM in the world need a few ministers to help him in his office is waste of manpower.  </p>
              <p>LHL recently talks about productivity of the people. Think he should start himself first before expecting productivity from the people.   It is not productive to have more than one minister in the PM's office.</p>

              world class salary and if I did not hear wrongly LKY did mention a
              few times that his ministers are first class.   
              First class, world class paid ministers incapable of handling the
              ministries themselves and need more than one minister doing the job
              is a joke.   The highest paid PM in the world need a few
              ministers to help him in his office is waste of
              manpower.  </p>
              <p>LHL recently talks about productivity of the people. Think
              he should start himself first before expecting productivity from
              the people.   It is not productive to have more than one
              minister in the PM's office.</p>

              <p><br>The millions saved annually from paying for the useless ministerial appointments in 1MM, 2SMs, 1DPM, 2MwoP in the PM's Office, and several 2nd Ministers - could have paid for the annual insurance premium of a National Insurance Policy that would have provided cover for:- primary and secondary medical attention for those who need such medical services, and also to attend to the needs of the older generation in the population.</p>
              <p>The additional funds accumulated by the PAP Government that are placed in high risks investments, would have been better used to build for a separate Trust Fund that could be better used to benefit Singaporeans who are retrenched and have families to feed during the economic downturns.</p>
              <p>Those annual handouts from "economic surplus" could have been better used to build a sinking fund to assist young Singaporeans to fund their studies overseas - either as study loans, or scholarships.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, greed and political insecurity has influenced the PAP to use these public funds to attract supposed talents to enter politics and join the PAP, and placate the general population with small handouts costing a billion a year that are uselessly spent and returned to the Government.</p>

              <h1>The Economist accuses Singapore of being a “stingy nanny state”</h1>
              <div>
              <div>
              <p><span>February 14, 2010</span></p>
              <p>Influential international journal The Economist has hit out at the Singapore government of being a “stingy nanny state” in reference to its antipathy and resistance towards public welfare.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Though it acknowledges that the government “does run a handful of schemes directed at some of the needy, from low-income students to the unassisted elderly, these benefits are rigorously means-tested and granted only sparingly.”</p>
              <p><em>“The most destitute citizens’ families may apply for public assistance; only 3,000 currently qualify. Laid-off workers receive no automatic benefits. Instead they are sorted into “workfare” and training schemes,”</em> it added.</p>
              <p>Known as the Public Assistance (PA) scheme, it gives applicants a monthly allowance of $330 which is hardly sufficient to survive in Singapore. One has to be completely destitute without any living relatives or certified permanently unfit to work by a medical specialist before one can qualify for it.</p>
              <p>The process of seeking help is also made tiresome and in some ways humiliating on purpose to deter “free-riders” from “abusing” the system.</p>
              <p>Singapore workers have no job security to speak of as a result of the government’s open-door policies towards foreign migrant workers who now make up more than 35 per cent of the workforce.</p>
              <p><em>“Official reassurances that migrants create growth do not convince those competing for scarce jobs. Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s founding father and still its “minister mentor” has maintained that ambitious migrants help to keep citizens on their toes. In an interview given to National Geographic last July he said that if native Singaporeans lag behind “hungry” foreigners because “the spurs are not stuck on [their] hinds”, that is not the state’s problem to solve,”</em> noted the Economist.</p>
              <p>According to a recent Wall Street Journal editorial, the relentless influx of foreign workers has depressed the wages of ordinary Singaporeans, increased the cost of living, especially that of public housing, decreased labor productivity and led to an overall decline in the standards of living.</p>
              <p>To compound matters, there are no independent trade unions to represent and fight for the interests of Singapore workers. The only legal trade union in Singapore – NTUC is a pseudo-PAP organization which is always headed by a PAP Minister (without portfolio).</p>
              <p>Right after he became Prime Minister in 2003, Lee Hsien Loong emphasized that “welfare is a dirty word in Singapore”, a sign that his administration will not do much to help those who have fallen behind.</p>
              <p>In a speech made in Parliament in November 2006, he said:</p>
              <p><em>“We need a sustainable approach.  You saw the numbers.  You see how quickly the number of old people and the proportion of old people is growing in Singapore.  Some MPs and some other commentators outside writing in the newspapers have suggested old age pensions, which they argue every Singaporean should have as of right, because I am born here, I carry a pink IC, I should have an old age pension.  But if every old person, whether rich or poor, is entitled to an old age pension, it is going to impose a very heavy financial burden on the State, which means a very heavy financial burden on young Singaporeans, because they are the ones who are going to be working and paying the taxes, which is where the State will get the money.”</em></p>
              <p>Yet the state is flushed with cash as evident by the billions of dollars it lost recently in failed overseas investments via its two sovereign wealth funds – GIC and Temasek Holdings.</p>
              <p>The Economist Society of Singapore (ESS) recently proposed to a government committee that it should build a more robust safety net, starting with unemployment insurance which would promote social stability and help muster public support for Singapore’s open-door migration policies.</p>
              <p><em>“While self-reliance is a good principle in general, it may be neither efficient nor just if taken to extremes,”</em> it claimed.</p>

              <p>Conned by the western banks is none  of your business.  It is your beloved PAP who invest and lose the money, western banks did not force your beloved PAP to invest in them.   If your beloved evil PAP loves to lose so much money it is none of the business of singaporeans.  Singaporeans have no control over how the govt wants to invest the $.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the article was not from AH TRUTH.    Get all your facts right before attacking!   YOU sound real stupid!   Think you only good at getting prosititutes to work for you and nothing else.</p>

              <p>Jealous?   Hahahah, what is there that the govt in sg are doing that make the westerners jealous????   You are minding their business now that you speak this way, I tell you  mind your own business, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>angel7030 aka longinchjohn</strong></span>.   Just because the western countries are not singing the same tune as your beloved evil PAP you are against them.    I believe one day if they take over sg you will sing a different tune, that time you will put PAP down and bootlick them.</p>
              <p>Conned by the western banks is none  of your business.  It is your beloved PAP who invest and lose the money, western banks did not force your beloved PAP to invest in them.   If your beloved evil PAP loves to lose so much money it is none of the business of singaporeans.  Singaporeans have no control over how the govt wants to invest the $.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the article was not from AH TRUTH.    Get all your facts right before attacking!   YOU sound real stupid!   Think you only good at getting prosititutes to work for you and nothing else.</p>
