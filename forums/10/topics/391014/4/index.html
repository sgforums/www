              <h3 class="entry-title">Singapore has the lowest wages and domestic purchasing power among the Asian Tigers</h3>
              <p><span style="color: blue;">August 25, 2009<br>By Eugene Yeo, Consultant Editor</span></p>
              <h4 class="vcard author"></h4>
              <p>The
              worldwide study conducted and released by UBS lately, titled “Price and
              Earnings 2009" has some unflattering results for Singapore. (download
              the study here)</p>
              <p>While our economy has the highest GDP (PPP) per capita in Asia at
              $49,288 according to a World Bank report (source: Wikipedia), our
              people do not enjoy a quality of life which commensurate with it.</p>
              <p>Though we are technically a developed first world country, some
              economic indictators as shown by the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>UBS study suggested that
              Singaporeans are not that better off than those in Third World
              countries.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Low wages</p>
              <p>Singapore has a GDP (PPP) per capita higher than Switzerland, but our wages are way below the Swiss.</p>
              <p>The UBS study found that employees in Copenhagen, Zurich, Geneva and
              New York have the highest gross earnings. With its extremely high gross
              wages and comparatively low tax rates, Switzerland is a very
              employee-friendly country.</p>
              <p>The net wages used have been deducted for taxes and social security.</p>
              <p>Zurich and Geneva have wage indices (gross) of 119.8 and 107.5
              respectively. In contrast, Singapore has a wage index of only 31.3,
              comparable with Moscow (30.9), Tallinn (28.7) and Johannesburg (26.7).</p>
              <p>In the Asia-Pacific region, it is exceeded by Tokyo (83.0), Sydney
              (74.1), Auckland (44.1), Hong Kong (42.3), Taipei (35.5) and Seoul
              (32.3)</p>
              <p>Low domestic purchasing power</p>
              <p>Where does an average income buy the most products and services?
              Wages alone do not determine the standard of living in a particular
              city or country.</p>
              <p>A better way to measure prosperity is to divide the average annual
              salary by the total price of a selected basket of goods and services
              (as used in the UBS study). This tells us how much purchasing power
              local wages.</p>
              <p>Again, Zurich (106.9), Sydney (95.9) and Luxembourg (95.4) topped
              the list - its citizens have the highest domestic purchasing power.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singaporeans have a low purchasing power</span></strong> of only 39.9, comparable to Kuala Lumpur (39.5), Warsaw (34.0) and Bogota (33.7).</p>
              <p>Other countries in the Asia-Pacific region which are ahead of us are
              Tokyo (82.2), Auckland (68.9), Taipei (58.9), Hong Kong (58.1) and
              Seoul (57.4).</p>
              <p>In other words, though the cost of living is higher in Tokyo, the
              average Japanese has a domestic purchasing power more than twice that
              of an average Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Though Malaysia is still a developing country and has a GDP (PPP)
              per capita of only $14,215, less than 3 times of ours, the ordinary
              Malaysian citizen has about the same domestic purchasing power as the
              Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Low relative purchasing power of wages</p>
              <p>This is calculated in the UBS study by using a specific, highly
              uniform product that is available everywhere in the same quality, and
              then calculate how long an employee has to work to afford it in each
              city.</p>
              <p>For the purpose of this article, the iPod nano (with 8 GB of storage) is used.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">An average wage earner is Zurich and New York can buy a nano from an
              Apple store after nine hours of work. A Singapore worker will have to
              work three times longer after 27.5 hours.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The figures for selected Asia-Pacific cities are as follows: Sydney
              (9.5hrs), Tokyo (12hrs), Auckland (16hrs), Hong Kong (19hrs), Seoul
              (22hrs) and Taipei (23.5hrs). Again we came in last among the 4 Asian
              Tigers.</p>
              <p>Long working hours</p>
              <p>People work an average of 1,902 hours per year in the surveyed
              cities, but they work much longer in Asian and Middle Eastern cities,
              averaging 2,119 and 2,063 per year respectively.</p>
              <p>European cities had the lowest working hours per year. A global
              comparison showed the people in Lyon and Paris spend the least amount
              of time at work: 1,582 and 1,594 hours respectively.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans spent on average 2,088 hours at work per year with 11 days of vacation.</p>
              <p>This is less than Hong Kong (2,295) and Seoul (2,312), but more than
              Tokyo (1,997), Taipei (2,074), Sydney (1,747) and Auckland (1,884).</p>
              <p>Singaporeans also took the least number of holidays after Hong Kongers (10 days/year).</p>
              <p>High cost of living</p>
              <p>Singapore was ranked the second most expensive place to live in after Tokyo, surpassing Hong Kong for the first time.</p>
              <p>Let us compare the food prices in Singapore and other developed countries since food is a basic necessity.</p>
              <p>In the UBS study, a basket of 39 food items is put together and
              weighted mainly according to Western European consumption habits. The
              average worldwide cost of the basket is USD385.</p>
              <p>In Asia, Tokyo topped the list with an index of 124.7, followed by
              Hong Kong (96.5), Singapore (89.4), Seoul (89.0), Taipei (67.9) and
              Sydney (66.3)</p>
              <p>Conclusion</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The high cost of living coupled with low wages and domestic
              purchasing power condemns the average Singapore worker to an
              ignonimous, monotonus and stressful working life.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Singapore workers have to work harder to earn the same amount of
              money and save for a longer period to purchase the same product.</p>
              <p>In 1991, then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong promised Singaporeans
              that we will be able to achieve the “Swiss standard of living” within a
              decade. Ten years later, we have a living standard which is closer to
              Russia than Switzerland.</p>
              <p>Like Singapore, the Russians has a low wage and domestic purchasing
              power and Russia, especially the city of Moscow, has one of the highest
              cost of living in the world.</p>
              <p>In the next part of this article, we shall examine the uncanny
              similiarities between life in Singapore and Russia after the
              disintegration of the Soviet Union.</p>

                  than Tokyo (1,997), Taipei (2,074), Sydney (1,747) and Auckland
                  (1,884).</p>
              <p>Singaporeans also took the least number of holidays after Hong
                  Kongers (10 days/year).</p>
              <p>High cost of living</p>
              <p>Singapore was ranked the second most expensive place to live in
                  after Tokyo, surpassing Hong Kong for the first time.</p>
              <p>Let us compare the food prices in Singapore and other developed
                  countries since food is a basic necessity.</p>
              <p>In the UBS study, a basket of 39 food items is put together and
                  weighted mainly according to Western European consumption habits.
                  The average worldwide cost of the basket is USD385.</p>
              <p>In Asia, Tokyo topped the list with an index of 124.7, followed
                  by Hong Kong (96.5), Singapore (89.4), Seoul (89.0), Taipei (67.9)
                  and Sydney (66.3)</p>
              <p>Conclusion</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The high cost of living
                  coupled with low wages and domestic purchasing power condemns the
                  average Singapore worker to an ignonimous, monotonus and stressful
                  working life.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Singapore workers have to work harder to earn the same amount of
                  money and save for a longer period to purchase the same
                  product.</p>
              <p>In 1991, then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong promised Singaporeans
                  that we will be able to achieve the “Swiss standard of living”
                  within a decade. Ten years later, we have a living standard which
                  is closer to Russia than Switzerland.</p>
              <p>Like Singapore, the Russians has a low wage and domestic
                  purchasing power and Russia, especially the city of Moscow, has one
                  of the highest cost of living in the world.</p>
              <p>In the next part of this article, we shall examine the uncanny
                  similiarities between life in Singapore and Russia after the
                  disintegration of the Soviet Union.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the article. It basically emphasizes what I have highlighted many times in this forum.</p>
              <p>Our wages are artificially suppressed such that we do not have a good standard of living. This is caused by the liberal influx of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">foreign labour</span></strong> (NOT foreign talent).</p>
              <p>90+% of the foreigners are just foreign labour to me. They cannot even compete with Singapore's local talents.</p>

              <p>My observations are as follows. The "Foreign Talent" Policy has 3 objectives:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>To depress wages in Singapore so as to ensure that Singapore remains competitive. As was mentioned by many, Singapore has no other resources but manpower. And to keep itself competitive, it has to ensure its workforce remain cheap to the world. The question is, how long can this strategy last, before it puts too much pressure on the society and result in catastrophic consequences?</li>
              <li>To bring in more foreigners in the hopes of converting them to citizens/PRs, which is to balance Singapore's greying population</li>
              <li>To bring in more foreigners in the hopes of converting them into citizens, so as to have new people who will vote for the PAP (hence diluting the votes of the disgruntled local)</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Hence, do not hope that the "Foreign Talent" policy will change too drastically.Everything is to the PAP's benefit (continually rewarding themselves because Singapore's economy is expanding, though the people are suffering). In fact, I guess elections are around the corner, that they have decided to slow down the pace of the influx. I expect the influx to come back with a vengeance after elections.</p>
              <p>To all, you have been warned. Vote them in, and they will continue suppressing your wages.</p>

              <p>The term "Foreign Talent" is an euphemism that is cleverly used by the PAP to merge foreign workers for the lower wage strata with the Foreign Professionals in the super wage strata of Niche Skills and Expertise.</p>
              <p>Such methods have also been cleverly applied by PM LHL in 2008 - when he introduced a higher wage package for Civil Servants claiming the necessity to keep talent in the Government.</p>
              <p>He failed to mention that Civil Servants are not the Government - as they are not elected officials, but are merely Public Servants.</p>
              <p>PM LHL used the euphemism of wage increases for Civil Servants - and lumped in the wage increases for the PAP Ministers, who had "voluntarily" cut their high pay during the economic downturn in 2003 through 2005.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the parlance of the American tribesman - the PAP speaks with a fork tongue.</p>
