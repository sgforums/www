              <p>Is my job less shitty? I think when someone takes up a job, he/she has to be willing to account for it. Getting paid 6-star rate of service equals that he/she is willing to accept responsibility and step off from the cushy job (YES<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> it is cushy</span></strong> with the kind of pay WKS is getting).</p>

              <p><br>What possibly could have motivated the resident pseudo-Bavarian Hog to pass a generalised "zwei-siao" unthinking statement that - "<em>Singaporeans do take the Home Affairs Team for granted and think that they have a cushy job</em>" ?</p>
              <p>WKS - as a nephew-in-law - is only the Head of the Home Team, has he ever worked as part of the Home Team ?</p>
              <p>If he had been part of the Home Team, he would have at least taken full responsibility for the various embarrassing events that happened in 2008 through 2009 - instead of passing the buck to the dumb subordinates whom he was responsible for appointing.</p>
              <p>Surely, WKS's job cannot be all that shitty when his annual pay is $2 Million PLUS - while the next guy below him is a Permanent Secretary who drew no more then an annual salary of 6-figures as are the other Heads of Divisions in the Home Team.</p>
              <p>The dumb ass who got sacked - for doing a shitty job looking after Mas Selamat - was only paid no more then a 5 figure annual salary and was head of the Whitley Detention Centre.</p>
              <p>Are all the Home Affairs job so shitty ?</p>
              <p>With your fixated infatuation over CSJ, one would have thought that you would be characteristically "zwei-siao" to nominate him to takeover that shit job - which he is qualified to be, as afterall he is part of the Home Team as an NSF Inspector or an ASP in the Police Force.</p>
