            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Daddy!!:</div><div class="quote_body">according to CPF website www.cpf.gov.sg,  we can draw out lump sum money from our ordinary account at 55.  Only our retirement account is "locked" away. </div></blockquote>I am amazed at the numerous replies. Thanks.<br><br>I have 2 questions:<br><br>1. cpf age was recently set at 62. And more recently it became 65. And all of a sudden recent, 67. And according to forum reply, this retirement age is based on assumption that singaporeans will generally live to 67 + 20.<br>Now, I wonder how many die due to whatever reasons before 67? Some simply die of lung cancers (many), kidney / diabetes problems (quite  many), heart attacks (many), healthy-guy-running-sudden-death (not rare), cancer (many), etc. This means sadly they could not even enjoy their cpf before they die?  Could they use it to prolong their life longer with the money? allowed to withdraw for this reasons?<br><br>2.  Lets assume a current age of 40.  Looking at the frequency and how fast this retirement age is changed, I worry what figure it will eventually end up to?  age 40 to 67 is 27 long years away. How confident are we that in this period, the retirement age will not extend to even older age?<br><br>3.  a reply was that at 55, we can withdraw a lump sum of Ordinary CPF account.<br>-  around how many percent is this account? I mean I like to know roughly is it sizable amount. Of course needless to say it depends on your income level. But I hope to get a picture roughly how much is this?<br><br>-  is this amount taxable at withdrawal?<br><br>-  can the retirement cpf account be transferred to ordinary account for withdrawal and topup later? eg. need money urgently.<br><br>-  what happens if cost of living is more than 700 per month to survive? work harder right? any inflation in 2  decades time? Does the interest cover the inflation?<br><br>Last but not least,<br>I like to say that Singapore systems are so amazing.<br>The policies implementation are the most efficient in the world.<br>Thanks to the citizens.<br>Without whom, there can be no singapore of today, the wonderful situation that is and will happen.<br>i would take this opportunity to applaud singapore for the ability to implement all policies without any obstacle. Simply Uniquely singapore.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One way is the make your cpf low at the age of 60 to 70, as low as S$5K by buying a property for rental.  You need to borrow from a bank and pay the mortgage using cpf to make this work.  by doing this, you depletes the cpf and at the same time use the cpf to repay the bank loan, and you pocket the rental.  time the bank loan tenure to end at 65.   after which, collect property rental from the time you purchase till death.<br><br>the rental income will adjust to inflation and deflation.<br><br>many people are doing it.</div>
