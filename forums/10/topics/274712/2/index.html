As I said, many people have done it and are doing it.<br><br>Because it is a second property for rental, it has to be private property.  And since it is private property, it can be willed to your off-springs.  A will at a lawyer costs around S$200.<br><br>Very simple, just a phone call to any lawyer.  Not sure, call a few lawyers to check out.<br><br>if you save up the rental income into a rolling fixed deposit, it is not spending like you said, it is investments.<br><br>In case one is unemployed in lets say 10 years, the balance in the CPF can be used to pay the mortgage.  If this is insufficient, the rental and then the fixed deposit can then be used to pay the mortgage payments till a job is found.<br><br>There is one thing to note though.  When you sell the property before 55, you need to return to CPF what you draw out from CPF after repaying the bank loan.  In other words, try not to sell it.<br><br></div>
