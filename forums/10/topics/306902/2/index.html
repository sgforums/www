              <p>Not sure about you.... But I don't take Cab very often. And will try my best not to do so.... And if I really need a cab (like returning from the airport with 28kg of baggage), then for my comfort, I'm willing to pay. But most ppl, including you and me, won't be taking cabs daily right.... <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> </p>

              <p>I agree that in the end, they would still somehow make you pay..... <strong>but at least in a smaller way</strong>. The bus companies can't be charging you $1 extra if you are going to the CBD at peak hour......</p>

              <p>I have no qualms if LTA wants to increase the revenue collections from car owners. What I want to see is that the revenue collected is used to benefit the users of public transportation. That should mean reduced fares or freeze in fares, more bus lanes and less traffic jams on the roads for public commuters, more cleaner buses with less roaches,  higher frequency of bus trips and buses packed with mobile TVs and wireless connections.</p>
              <p>I am pretty frustrated with the traffic jams on the roads, screwing up the bus schedules and more time wasted to get to the office and home. Despite the frequent increases in ERP, the jams remains unabated. Cutting the number of COEs is a good move but does not solve the packed roads.</p>

              <p><br>The perfect solution to this vicious cycle is to ride a motorbike. LTA is trying to suck more money from car and public transport. Motorbike is the solution,cheap and can get u to place as fast as car.... No matter how much they raise on roads and charges, motorbike will be the least affected. Cos its small and will not contribute to cogestion/ It consume very little fuel... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
