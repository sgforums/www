            <div class='col-md body'>Is Singapore hitting the skids as electronics hub?<br><br>By Jonanthan Hopfner<br>EE Times<br>(09/16/2005 10:53 AM EST)<br><br>SINGAPORE Â— Despite this city-state's loss of some manufacturing operations to cheaper destinations such as China and Malaysia, officials and analysts insist Singapore can still count on its skilled workforce, first-rate infrastructure and pro-business policies to maintain its status as an Asian electronics hub.<br><br>Lim Swee Nian, director for electronics at Singapore's Economic Development Board (EDB), acknowledged that the emergence of lower-cost locations "will always pose a challenge to Singapore" but said the country saw itself "competing on the grounds of overall costs instead of just labor costs alone."<br><br>This year has proved to be mixed for Singapore's electronics industry, with companies such as hard-drive maker Maxtor and consumer electronics firms Creative and Aiwa all cutting jobs or shifting manufacturing elsewhere. In July, National Semiconductor announced the closure of its local facility to consolidate production at its other assembly and test plants in Melaka, Malaysia and Suzhou, China. In August, Agilent Technologies announced the sale of its Singapore-based semiconductor operations and the transfer of some1,800 local staff to two private equity buyers.<br><br>Gartner semiconductor analyst Philip Koh said the reallocations were the culmination of a trend that began in the 1990s with China's emergence as an economic power. "We saw China start to suck more electronic equipment manufacturing, not only from Singapore but also from Malaysia and Indonesia," he said. "In recent years more and more manufacturing has been shifted to the mainland. Companies are looking for lower-cost destinations, especially in manufacturing, to make their products more cost competitive."<br><br>Koh said Singapore's ability to attract investment in more leading-edge technologies would prove the deciding factor in the continued success of its manufacturing sector, which currently accounts for about a quarter of the economy.<br><br>"Singapore needs to continue to move up the value chain in order to stay competitive in the semiconductor industry," he said. Singapore is moving "towards value-added/high-end manufacturing and also into the R&amp;D marketplace, where we continue to attract IC design, product and investments."<br><br>Koh added that Singapore should concentrate on developing its front-end wafer fabrication capabilities, expanding on the 14 fabs based here already.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is sad but true that our manufacturing sector is not powered or facilitated by an economic master plan identifying strategies you mentioned in the foregoing. Smaller and smaller mobile harddisk are taking over the reign in computers. It is increasingly popular and will propell new growths in manufacturing of computers and telecommunications.<br><br>I have suggested to Feedback Unit to adopt an economic master plan to better coordinate and strategize our industries so that we will always catch the right opportunities at the right time but my suggestions were probably too difficult for them to consider.<br><br>Instead, EDB is taking the general pro-investments approach of incentivising foreign MNCs and selected industries on case by case. EDB is sending scholars to do courses in US and western advanced countries and hope that these scholars do not break bonds.<br><br>I suggest that an economic master plan, EDB and senior ministers and whole cabinet are involved in overseeing practical planning and strategizing of diverse opportunities that suit our locational and other advantages. By leveraging on the new advantages afforded by IR, we will have more value-adding in many more sectors among other cost-affected industries.<br><br>EDB by using the economic master plan incorporating mobile harddisk manufacturing and hand-phones, solar powers, and fuel cell cars etc, bio-tech etc can follow up with creating new technology start-ups and macro-tune our current general investment approaches to success.<br><br>The whole cabinet must be geared up for tapping on newer advanced manufacturing opportunities. General investment-centred incentives will only bring in certain level of industries whereas proactive opportunity seeking among our entrepreneurs will enliven the whole investment climate, especially we have the IR and good location and call-centre management excellence to use as stimulants.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The main issue right now is the COST. It is true that Sg has one of the best infrastructures and political stability in the Asia Pac region. In the past, we have managed to attracted many big guys to setup offices and distribution centres or even regional centres in Sg.

It makes Sg an expensive place to invest.<br><br>It is a very real threat that if the trend for MNC relocation continued, Sg will face a BIG BIG problem to maintain her status as a hub. Take Matrox and Seagate for example, they used to have the most advanced facilities outside US, to be located here. Thus, Sg will be attractive for them to become their Distribution Centre (logistic), Regional HQ. But when the manufacturing facilities moving out, going closer to their targeted market, it is quite clear that the Regional HQ or even Distribition Centre may go along. What might be left is some R&amp;D lab for some tax rebate.

They refused to admit that costing is a critical factor for any business decision. Why? very simple, these EDB guys with their golden rice bowl are not really graded by their performance (how much investment that they bring in), they still sit on their comfortable zone even the FDI in Sg goes south. But this is entirely different in business world. The CEO will need to justify the cost to setup a business, cost is the ultimate factor that decide if the CEO will stay or get kicked in the butt!<br><br>The past 2 years, I have been able to get in touch with the EDB / IMRE / SIMtech guys. Their qualification are very high, most of them PhDs. But with little or no industrial experiences neither do they really understand how a business actually operate in real life.

It is not until cost is recognized as the major factor that we will have the necessary right kind of policy in place such as working full steam ahead to cut down unnecessary loading of costs onto the private sector by all government departments and agencies.<br><br>There is no need to push up costs of doing business to skyhigh level as we are now doing using all kinds of excuses to do so. Import duties on cars can now be scrapped as it is ably substituted by COEs. High land costs need not be that high as lands are already paid for by the tax payers out of public funds.<br><br>Incentives of all kinds given to foreign investments should be channelled back to domestic economy to promote SMEs as well to help reduce the present high costs.<br><br>Government leaders for years have been stubbornly sticking to non-welfare and full market fee policies to make government rich and efficient. Private sector to that extent is being whittled down to lose all its fizz. Unless something urgent is done, there will be more MNCs transferring their operations out of Singapore. Don't believe this - wait to see more Maxtors and others leaving next year.</div>

Their people mindset is very different from our worldclass efficient EDB official lah. In far east countries, people only want to see true results and real action plan. they are after real $$ in profits.<br><br>But the Sg, on the other hand, always love to use data chart and comparing ratio and percentage to mask our poor real-life performance.

            <div class='col-md body'>Our local top officials kept harping on selling spore as a springboard to China and India for foreign MNCs, such myopic ideas, who needs to set up HQ in Spore when they can capitalise on cheaper land cost and lower wages in these giant economic machineries. Our advantage in bilingualism has limited impact, the scarcity of jobs in China has driven the hungry Chinese to trained themselves to be bilingual.<br><br>In fact, when i was in Shenzhen recently, the young ang mos with laptops cross-slinged were roaming the city and hanging out in Starbucks accompanied by local chinese, (whom i may add, spoke perfect english with american accent) discussing business and cutting small deals . The point is, who needs a middleman(spore) ? The go getters: young generation of business oriented ang mos are BOLD....the Chinese are HUNGRY, and both are redefining the traditional methodology of doing business. They are fearless with no language barriers. Its really exciting to observe such phenomenon unfolding.<br><br>Our dear leaders should wake up to these realities and reposition our so-called advantage, and think of more radical ideas to 'market' spore.</div>
