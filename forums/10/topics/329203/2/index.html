              <p>Did you watch blogTV on CNA?</p>
              <p>There is this angmore called FD and TOC chief editor, a student and 3 others.</p>
              <p>It was like 4 person share similar views vs 1 man's view, TOC student's.</p>
              <p>The new citizen, an indian girl said if to become new citizen, they need to serve NS, most might not want to. Then she said, NS is something to be proud of to serve your country.  I was confused by this MBA from india, now new citizen.</p>
              <p>i like to ask her, does she feel more patriotic to which country now? I actually impressed by her ability to love 2 countrys. So, my question meant which she love more ?  I am sure she feels more patriotic to spore now but only she will know.</p>
              <p>So, what you guys think of TOC's role ? Educational or Inspirational? Engage the young ones or convince the young ones?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In USA.. people get to vote yes or no on "measures and propositions", during elections and every few years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>USA so big.. so many people.. why they can do it, yet we only 4 million cannot ah? Lazy right ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On top of it .. still can recall elected officials who are not doing their job well to serve the people.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In USA.. people get to vote yes or no on "measures and
              propositions", during elections and every few years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>USA so big.. so many people.. why they can do it, yet we only 4
              million cannot ah? Lazy right ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On top of it .. still can recall elected officials who are not
              doing their job well to serve the people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An example of what US voters get to decide.</p>

              <p>Also.. people power.. removed Gray Davis from office replaced by
              Arnie.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>yup... more important is choosing what the voice is. if there is only PAP in government, the voice will be the same. if got variety of parties, than they will more accurately represent the views of everyday people.</p>
