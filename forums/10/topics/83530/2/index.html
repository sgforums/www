            <div class='col-md body'>Prior to her founding, Singapore was perceived as part of the Malay peninsular.<br><br>Then the British came and Singapore (along with Penang and Malacca) grew a somewhat separate identity as part of the Straits Settlements.<br><br>Because the Straits Settlements was the hub of business activities, many Chinese were spontaneously drawn to settle down in the area.<br><br>When the British left, their plan was to merge Malaya and Singapore (and Sabah and Sarawak) so as to increase the viability of these newly independent entities.<br><br>Racial politics caused the inevitable rift between the two main (but unequal) partners of the marriage.<br><br>Today, globalisation may render the need to re-marry unnecessary. Good relations need to continue to be built, and not just between Singapore and Malaysia, but with the rest of ASEAN, Asia, and the rest of the world. We need to cultivate our sense of inter-dependence. The recent announcement on the impending links between the Singapore and Malaysian stock markets is a step in the right direction.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To reunite with Malaysia is utter stupidity.Even as a sovereign state, they have derided us and tried to bully us innumerable times.What matters is the future we forge for ourselves, not the past we once had.In anycase, I support Taiwan for not bowing to the belligerent words of Communist China.Yes.Communist China, others may suck up to them and call them capitalist but I feel that ,for one minute that they still practice a totalitarian form of government, they cannot shake off that yoke.We need more people in this world to stand together against reunification that doesn't suit both parties fair and square.Malaysia didn't want us then, and they sure as hell don't need us now.I'd rather we form alliances with like-minded nations.Physical geography is an outdated notion.A geography of ideas and culture is more relevant.<br><br>Heh.Btw, LKY still regrets that we have been kicked out of Malaysia.Why?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As for now,  I don't see the need for reunification with Malaysia. Both countries have different agendas.<br><br>And to LazerLordz, I really disagree with what u said about China. I have lived in China for a few years and I have to say that there is more personal freedom in China than in S'pore. The locals I met dare to criticise their government so openly that it will make  Singapore look like North Korea. I have also on many occasions seen on TV fierce debates between citizens and their local officials. The most ironic thing about Taiwan is that although the current Taiwanese government(DPP) is pushing towards independence and always badmouthing China, there is a growing trend of Taiwanese emigrating to mainland China!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i can agree with your point.My post about China is more from a philosophical standpoint.On the ground, that may well be the reality but do you really think China's government will really devolve ower to the people.You give them some to satiate their needs and distract them as they aint hungry anymore.Stage two may come when affluence is widespread and economic "bribes" just don't work anymore.Just my two cents worth. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
