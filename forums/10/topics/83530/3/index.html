            <div class='col-md body'>so would it not make more sense if we became a chinese colony rather than a malay state?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>please lor... part of the reason why we became independent was because the promise of a common market with the peninsula DID NOT work out...<br><br>they jealously guarded their industries and commerce while WE ended up with the short end of the stick...<br><br>and we did better on our own than we EVER could have in the federation...<br><br>so much for trying to DEPEND on a bigger brother... as long as u package yourself as a dependence, u're not gonna like how they threat u... it is ONLY as an independent country that we can decide on the role that WE can play in the new world economy.<br><br>so why are pple so blind to want to advocate a return to something that ALREADY didn't work before?<br><br>sure, life is hard now... but what makes u think that it'll get better if we surrender our pride, dignity and sovereignty to become a dependent territory???</div>

As it is already happening in M'sia, which is Mat taking over the chinese in the cooperate world just becoz of government policies, eg, MBF bank is now no longer under chinese, Kwong Yik bank, Hock Hua bank also no more, Malayan Bank took over rich chinese bank. Bank Bumiputera ( weak bank) merge with Commerce Bank. Now, only left back 1 chinese bank which is Public Bank , and the government is eying on it. This is just one eg of wat happen in banking industry. Ok wat will happen if we merge wif msia. All the directors will sooner or later be replace by Mat. Where do these Mat graduate from?? University Islam, University Putra, and other dunno what university that is " world " class standard that those graduate cant even write proper english. And we will be under them, working for them and seeing them drivng merce. If u can accept the fact..then merge loh. The ministers, any Phd??? pls....some are not even a degree holder. If yes also again from their own reknown university?? Anyone knows wat is Pak Lah highest education lvl and from where? go find out.

And if I do get involved in a fight... trust me I want the other guy down with the first blow.<br><br>We have no rights to put down another country or do name calling?? Hello, where were you when  THEY were putting us down during the Pedra Branca, reclamation and water issues?? Have you read the kind of editorials they had in their papers about Singapore and its leaders??<br><br>Look, I was from that damn country in my younger years, and I could not put with their Bumiputeran bull crap, coz I am a Chinese... so I left and came to Singapore.<br><br>Singapore gave me a chance to be what I am today, not because of my colour, race or religion. Because I worked hard and got to where I am today, success based on my own merits. I could have struggled like hell back there and I know I would get nowhere simply beacause I was not one of them "Princes of the Land" a name which I will spit upon every bloody chance I get.<br><br>Do you know who the real Princes of the Land are?? The Sakais and Negritos, the jungle tribes. They were the original dwellers of the land!!!

So what if I am too bloody patriotic in my ways??<br><br>This is a Singaporean forum isn't it?? I just find freaklingly amazing my post can be censored simply because I only followed their name calling ways in the defense of my homeland.<br><br>And you can censor this again for all I care.

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking though there is a lot of sucks policy in S'pore, it is still better than in Malaysia. At least ppl here re not discriminate, unlike our 'brudder' giv land to Mats juz becos they re MATs..<br>Opportunities re limited for others race in our 'brudder' land as mentioned. Tat the reason S'pore hav alot of 'foreign' talent from our 'brudder' land.<br><br>S'pore will always be 1 step ahead of her 'brudder' partly becoz of this reason &amp; tat is the reason s'pore do not need to merge back but maybe take over? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>We can at least walk safety in the street at nite compare to the headline stories tat happen frequently in our 'brudder' land.<br><br>1 more point to take note is their polis (rite?) paid too low always ask for 'allowance' when got chance. Kena b4....<br><br>Life is imperfect, will still go there enjoy our strong currency...juz need to be wary....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
