Hello, where were you when  THEY were putting us down during the Pedra Branca, reclamation and water issues?? Have you read the kind of editorials they had in their papers about Singapore and its leaders??</blockquote>just because they're rude and lie a lot doesn't mean we have to be like them, i know the crap they have all the time in their papers, but babiputera or whatever you called them is too much<br><br><blockquote>Look, I was from that damn country in my younger years, and I could not put with their Bumiputeran bull crap, coz I am a Chinese... so I left and came to Singapore.<br><br>Singapore gave me a chance to be what I am today, not because of my colour, race or religion. Because I worked hard and got to where I am today, success based on my own merits. I could have struggled like hell back there and I know I would get nowhere simply beacause I was not one of them "Princes of the Land" a name which I will spit upon every bloody chance I get. </blockquote>this is where you're wrong, very wrong, do you really think you can get far here if you're not a chinese?but another malay or indian? personally speaking i find my current company a little racist, of dozens of employees, i've only see 2 malays , one still there because he's a good friend of the director and the other because he looks like a chinese<br><br><blockquote>I now owe my life to this little red dot... it is my home. So what if I am too bloody patriotic in my ways??</blockquote>sorry if i'm going to offend you with this but i feel that what you're showing now is not patriotic feelings but the anger you've bottled up while you were still back "there"<br><br><blockquote>This is a Singaporean forum isn't it?? I just find freaklingly amazing my post can be censored simply because I only followed their name calling ways in the defense of my homeland.</blockquote>its not very amazing considering that the rules said that no flaming is allowed, thats why the other thread was locked</div>
