            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, I will admit Im not a very political knowledgable person on deep politics, but better than average.<br><br>But the 1mil increase of minister salaries from 1.2mil to 2.2 is madness. Come on, the justification for the ministers salary increase is benchmarked by parliment, which is ironically made up of ministers? this makes no sense.<br><br>Are we paying them more to continuously benchmark their salaries 1 mil higher after every election???<br><br>Plus dont forget there are 88 ministers. So that is +$88 mil for the ministers alone.<br><br>The other sad thing is that money should be one of the last things on a minister mind. Serving the country should be his number one priority. If the pay is not good enough for the minister, he is free to leave, (and why should he in the first place when the pay in sg of our ministers is one of the highest in the world.)<br><br>if he does leave, it shows he has no loyalty to the country in the first place.<br><br>And I thought the justification of the gst hike of taxing the poor to help the poor was bad enough.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Using the excuse of staving off corruption to justify ministerial pay rise is in essence tantamount to an admission that the ministers are so lacking in integrity that they would not be able to resist the temptation of bribe-taking if the amount is sufficiently comparable to their offical pay packet. Plainly any person with common sense will not buy this pathetic excuse. If the PAP wishes to justify its civil service pay policy, it is going to have to find a better excuse, or run a serious risk of losing its mandate 5 years later.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, I think that the ministers deserve a 66.6% increment in their pay. But for the PM, I think he deserved a 66.1% increase in his pay. The health minister should get a 72.5% increase in his pay. The foreign minister should get a 58.2% increase in his pay. If the increment excercise is conducted this way I think it is very fair. But I seriously have no idea how to increase ministers' pay who are "elected" by walkovers.<br><br>Don't you all agree? I know for sure that 66.6% of Singaporeans will agree? Right, the 66.6% out there?</div>
