If the increment excercise is conducted this way I think it is very fair. But I seriously have no idea how to increase ministers' pay who are "elected" by walkovers.<br><br>Don't you all agree? I know for sure that 66.6% of Singaporeans will agree? Right, the 66.6% out there?</div></blockquote>Hey! For someone who is NOT pro establishment, I am supporting the pay increase.
