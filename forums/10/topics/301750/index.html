            <div class='col-md body'>According to Iraq's report to the UN, the know-how and material for developing chemical weapons were obtained from the United States, West Germany, the United Kingdom, France and the People's Republic of China.<br><br>In December 2002, Iraq's 1,200 page Weapons Declaration revealed a list of Eastern and Western corporations and countries, as well as individuals, that exported a total of 17,602 tons of chemical precursors to Iraq in the past two decades. By far, the largest suppliers of precursors for chemical weapons production were in Singapore (4,515 tons), the Netherlands (4,261 tons), Egypt (2,400 tons), India (2,343 tons), and Federal Republic of Germany (1,027 tons). One Indian company, Exomet Plastics (now part of EPC Industrie) sent 2,292 tons of precursor chemicals to Iraq. The Kim Al-Khaleej firm, located in Singapore and affiliated to United Arab Emirates, supplied more than 4,500 tons of VX, sarin, and mustard gas precursors and production equipment to Iraq.<br><br>According to Iraq's declarations, it had procured 340 pieces of equipment used for the production of chemical weapons. More than half came from a US firm via a German company, the remainder mostly from France, Spain, and Austria.<br><br>In addition, Iraq declared that it imported more than 200,000 munitions made for delivering chemicals, 75,000 came from Italy, 57,500 from Spain, 45,000 from China, and 28,500 from Egypt<br><br>It was business. Iraq wanted to buy , suppliers provided. It was the Iraqis that manufactured the chemical weapons and used it.<br><br>The treaty to ban chemical weapons was signed later, 1997, I think.<br><br>The ban does not include the chemical precursors which can be used for something else.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nice try to Â‘reuniteÂ’ the sects.<br><br>Since the 1980's, the Baath Government reportedly attempted to eliminate the senior Shi'a religious leadership (the Mirjaiyat) through killings, disappearances, and summary executions.<br><br>Jordan's King Abdullah II accused Iran of planning a sinister scheme to employ tactics of intimidation, bribery and militia training of sectarian elements throughout the Middle East, in order to create instability among rival Moslem factions. The king warned that Iran's quest toward empowering a "Shiite Crescent" stretching from Iran to Lebanon, would initiate the strategic dominance of Shiite power throughout the Middle East.<br><br>But these days, the escalating sectarian violence among Moslem brethren are clearly bearing out the Monarch's predictions in a unprecedented internecine bloodbath reaching from Iraq to Gaza, via Beirut- all fueled by Iranian fingerprints.<br><br>The hurried rise of hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has certainly served to strengthen that resolve. In recent years, the "republic" has brazenly broadened its influence in Iraq, Lebanon, and in Gaza. Needless to say, the recent expansion of Shia forces in the region has caused the Saudi royal family much deserved anxiety.<br><br>The Kurds - Kurdistan encompass as much as a third of Turkey, large parts of Iran and Iraq and a sliver of Syria.<br><br>The Kurds suffered two decades of persecution by the Saddam Hussein Regime.<br><br>Kurdistan is not a separate nation is due, in part, to its abundant natural resources: two of Iraq's major oil fields, rich agricultural land, minerals and the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.<br><br>In modern times, Syria, Turkey and Iraq have all tried to dilute Kurdish claims to a homeland through massive relocation programs.<br><br>The Kurds might forgive the Iraq's use of chemical weapons on them since Saddam Hussein is dead.<br><br>The Kurds dream of having their homeland but how are they going to make that happen?<br><br></div>
