            <div class='col-md body'>This is the official process of how your votes are counted and then destroy.<br><br><blockquote>Why are your name and IC number read aloud?<br><br>1) A voter queues for his or her turn to vote.  The returning officer will then call out the name and NRIC number of the voter and verify his/her identity. He will then present the voter with a ballot paper. The voter will then proceed to the balloting booth to cast his vote.<br><br>Calling out the voterÂ’s name and NRIC in public will enable the polling agents of the WorkerÂ’s Party and PAP at the polling centre to note and to prevent the same voter from attempting to vote more than once.  The serial numbers behind the ballots are there to ensure that every ballot paper is accounted for, so as to prevent the possibility of any fraud.<br><br>2) After the polling has closed, all the ballot boxes are then be sealed with specially made security seals in the presence of the polling agents from all the contesting parties.  The boxes are then transported under police surveillance to the designated counting centres, witnessed by the representatives of the contesting parties.<br><br>How do you know your vote is counted?<br><br>3) Upon reaching the designated counting centre, the counting agents from the WorkersÂ’ Party and PAP will gather at the main counting area, with the counters (civil servants from different government departments) sitting at open counting tables.  The counting agents will then inspect the ballot boxes and when they are satisfied that the boxes have not been tempered with, these boxes would be opened and the ballots poured out onto the counting tables, under the close supervision of the counting agents. (Counting agents are not allowed to touch the ballot papers.)<br><br>4) The counting of the votes then begins.  The counters will stack the voting slips on the counting table.  Each candidate will have his/her own stacks, in bundles of 100 votes each.  Spoilt votes and disputable votes will be placed aside.<br><br>5) Upon completion of the counting process, a tabulation of the votes is done at the counting tables.  If any of the counting agents is dissatisfied with the initial count, he or she can request for a recount.  Otherwise the returning officer will do the final tabulation of the results and declare the winner of the electoral contest.<br><br>What will happen to the Ballot papers after the Election?<br><br>6) After this, all the ballot papers, including the unused ballot papers, will be tallied against the total number issued per constituency. Then together with the voting and counting documents, they are then gathered and placed into the boxes, in the presence of the counting agents from all the contesting parties.  The boxes are then sealed with the specially made security seals, which are temper proof.  In addition, counting agents may sign their names over the seals to further reinforce the secrecy of the ballots.<br><br>7) Once the sealing and signing are done, the boxes are then transported under police escort to the Supreme Court Vault for a storage period of 6 months and the key to the vault is handed to a judge.  During this period, the documents can only be retrieved by court order.<br><br>Six months later, representatives from contesting parties will be invited to witness the destruction of the ballots. The WorkersÂ’ Party representative has always been present to inspect and ensure that the seals are intact.  He will also follow the ballot boxes all the way to the incinerator to witness the whole destruction process.<br><br>Your Vote is secret.<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't be paranoid lah wah liao... Aljunid 46% voted for opposition what you think the government gonna do?  That is like more than 10k ppl leh friend. Is he going to sue every single one? Further more it is quite fairly distributed among the estate and age lor. Even if I profess that I voted for who I doubt anyone would really care. You are just ONE vote of the many. You have no significant threat. Isn't it more useful to deal with the one who is of more threat like the opposition party than YOU!?<br><br>STop the conspiracy theory lah.</div>
