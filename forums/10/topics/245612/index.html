But cracks and fissures are showing, regardless the meticulous facade...<br><br>=====================================<br><span class="large"><strong>Consumer complains that SingTel sells used phones</strong></span><strong>By Pearl Forss, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 30 March 2007 2040 hrs </strong><br><br>SINGAPORE: One unhappy consumer complained that she was sold a used phone at a SingTel retail shop.<br><br>SingTel said their phones come from manufacturers and consumers need to check the product when making a purchase.<br><br>Just because it comes in a new box does not mean it is a new phone - which was what private banker Ivy Ling found out when she left the SingTel Hello! shop without checking her phone.<br><br>She said: "While I was loading my contacts list, I went to the message section and in the message section, I noticed a lot of SMS messages to a lady called Sharon.<br><br>"The lady actually told me that she lost her phone in a cab. That brings me further to query whether I've been sold a used and stolen phone."<br><br>Channel NewsAsia was unable to contact Sharon to confirm if she really had lost her phone.<br><br>But the news team verified that the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number on the phone matched that on the box.<br><br>Ms Ling said: "I went personally to the Hello! shop to inform them of this thing and they told me that they'll consider this as a faulty phone, and will replace it with a brand new phone."<br><br>Responding to our queries, SingTel said: "Hello! shops only sell brand new phones. All handsets that we sell come directly from the manufacturer and IMEI numbers are checked before they are put on sale."<br><br>SingTel is currently investigating the matter.<br><br>SingTel added that consumers need to check their phones thoroughly before leaving the shop to ensure that problems are resolved at the time of sale.<br><br>Last year, there were over 4,500 cases of mobile phone theft.<br><br>- CNA/so<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The PM has talked about promoting service culture. He has forgotten that when ministries make a mistake and not willing to admit such mistake, it is a poor service.<br><br>For example, HDB has been selling its low cost public housing a full market price and said that it is subsidising public housing.<br><br>When exposed as not giving any subsidy at all but only a discount the HDB has been tongue-tied and unable to substantiate that discount is the same as subsidy, HDB simply kept mum and continue to insist that it is subsidising its public housing.<br><br>Is HDB prepared to accept it is not providing a service to the taxpayers by acquiring lands using people's monies for public housing and then selling the public housing at full market price less discount providing a good service to the people.<br><br>Is this a good service on the part of the government?<br><br>But there is no change to the service culture at all two years after calling for improvement of service culture. It would appear it would continue to use its power to increase their own ministers' salaries and give them all the life-long pensions while the majority of people are suffering from problems in meeting their daily rising expenditures.<br><br>It would appear that it would continue to use its power to legalistically get what it want for itself to accumulate taxes as surpluses rather than excelling its service to the people.<br><br>So far after two years of calling for improvement to our service culture we only see more such behavior with ministers dismissing or explaining away problems instead of solving them as better service to the people.<br><br>If our leaders continue with such behaviour will we ever improve our service and claim that it is the world's best as MM Lee is now telling the Canberra University in being conferred the honorary degree last week.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Basically, it's like what the ministers said are right, and even wrong also right...<br><br>Remember when the government started off the COE scheme, their reason was to regulate the car ownership rate and use the money to fund other transportation schemes under the Roadworks plan... After so long when there's little effect in bringing down the car ownership, and on top of that, they had come out with the ERP scheme... So by the millions of dollars accured from the COE scheme, how much has the money been used for any of the transportation plannings?<br><br>Me's a Young PAP member but me's always been the Devil's Advocate in the committee...</div>
