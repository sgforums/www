              <p>In my opinion casinos shouldnt be built, Toto shouldnt be made, and prostitution shouldnt be legal.</p>
              <p>Even underground illegal activity wont be as bad compared to open legalization.</p>
              <p>But no choice, society is moving, more secular, more money-minded. What to do?</p>
              <p>Casinos fail in Singapore? As in going bankrupt? I think very unlikely. They have enough tourists/ travellers, and some domestic market.</p>
              <p>But maybe I am wrong also to emphasize so much on casinos, maybe it is just a small part of it, and more activities will be on restaurants, hotels, theme park, etc.</p>

              <p>the cynical part in me also tells me that there is no room for 2 casinos in singapore. the positioning of it will be important. one needs to cater to high rollers and the other, to more mass market. genting should cater to the latter. if both wants to attract the hi-end market, i think one will need to give.</p>

              <p>So if "No Casino" isn't the perfect policy, was this regime's plan to reverse a long-standing policy of banning casinos any more perfect? More specifically, which side of the fence would you like to sit on and which is a "more perfect" policy in your view - with or without casinos?</p>
              <p>Or is this another faux pas of yours that typically characterizes this regime's ineptitude in eternally reversing dubiously senseless policies (be they dealing with the population or casinos) ?</p>

              <p>Unless you're hopelessly dyslexic (which you might very well claim to be in a veiled attempt to emerge with any credibility), are you for a moment suggesting the above (in red) actually implies "targeted success" should entail the inclusion of locals in the consumer base of any casino-operating region? Or are you saying the gaming ventures in Singapore should only be successful if they manage to target high rollers and foreign visitors?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps, (while awaiting your response to the abovementioned) to illustrate your dire lack of logic and how you're effectively driving around aimlessly on your drunken stupor with incoherent sense, you may wish to consider how fallacious your point of putting Genting in the league of Macau/Las Vegas actually is.</p>
              <p>If you actually know what you're even talking about, it shouldn't escape your eyes that<br>Las Vegas and Macau raked in between US$6.5billion and US$6.95billion respectively in 2006 (source : <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aTWqxxBfz_B8&amp;refer=home">http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aTWqxxBfz_B8&amp;refer=home</a>). Genting, on the other hand, only churned out US$1.89 billion for the same period (source : <a href="http://www.hotelsmag.com/articleXml/LN790010216.html">http://www.hotelsmag.com/articleXml/LN790010216.html</a>). Surely, your rudimentary mathematics can't be suggesting that Genting actually qualifies as being in the same breadth as Las Vegas and Macau with under 1/3 of the revenue generated by the 2 behemoths, can you?</p>
              <p>Or am I led to believe your logic dictates the impact of any city/area operating a casino would have an equally significant influence on its industry as your overzealous anecdote "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>The answer is Life Style. (U forgot to mention Genting.)</em> </span>" would suggest?</p>

              <p>1 thing all of us have to admit, Our Singapore Government is not smart for no reason. The Casino will not be a failure. Like what Arapahoe has posted the STATS after casinos are built. It really contributed alot in terms of taxes and revenue, new jobs and of coursemaking Singapore even more well known for the RICH AND Famous.</p>
              <p>Singapore will be one of the top destination for the rich in Asia and its growing just looking at the number of foreign banks stationed here. They are here for a reason...</p>
              <p>Singapore is already home to some 15% of the very rich weathy Indonesian Chinese from INdonesia...and its growing steadily...more and more weathy people are moving into Singapore..</p>
              <p>Casino will play a large part and international events</p>
              <p>Expect the Casino to be a hit. And yes SIngapore is getting more and more interesting especially rising prices everywhere.</p>
