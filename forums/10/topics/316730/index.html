Nah…, it is
              better to face reality. No, not that it would be impossible for the
              Singapore casinos to fail but it is better to face REALITY and that is,
              to face reality rather than to assign failure and success to God, the
              Devil and the Pink Unicorn. The possibility that the Singapore casinos
              might fail, and at least can fail, became a reality with the failure
              today of one of the oldest and sexiest casinos operating out of Las
              Vegas, The Tropicana.<br> <br> It seems to me that the biggest success of the PAP government was the
              success in pushing and yes, shoving, of the citizenry, to become good
              coolies. It was done through a series of social engineering using
              incentives and disincentives (using one of the most powerful, making
              everything more and more expensive) to encourage the people to work.
              Furthermore, it was not a very difficult thing to do, since the
              majority was and is Chinese, (look at China now), and migrants seeking
              wealth and fortune in Nanyang, to boot.<br> <br> Its biggest failure must be the inability of the PAP, as Dr Chee Soon
              Juan would call it, regime, to develop homegrown private enterprises
              that are world champions. <br> <br> You might say, why blame the government and not the private sector?   <a href="http://newsintercom.org/index.php?itemid=592"> </a><a href="http://newsintercom.org/index.php?itemid=592">[Read More!]</a></div>

              <p>what is your targeted success?  failure to attract high roller? and foreign visitor? I don't think they were intended to target local Sg. After all most singaporean are mediocre income.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also don't think there is a lack of global gambler. Particularly in the chinese community given that the idea of  "Luck" n "Energy" is so ingrain within our pysche.  </p>

              <p>those old casino along Vegas strip had a hard time competiting because the newly built casino are mega size with plenty of purge and entertainment.</p>

              <p><strong>Guess who misses the boat?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="postbody">(SINGAPORE) Singapore is expected to pull ahead of Hong Kong as home to the highest concentration of millionaires over the next decade, sealing its reputation as a wealth centre not just in Asia but worldwide. <br><br>And while the US and Japan should remain the top two largest global economies, emerging markets such as China, India, Russia and Brazil will make their presence felt more strongly. <br><br>Now ranked seventh in terms of total net worth, China will grab third place by 2017, bypassing several G7 countries to become the third-richest country, while India is expected to make its debut in the top 10 list at No 8. Russia and Brazil will also display significant growth, moving up from 19th to 11th place and 15th to 12th place respectively. <br><br>With the Economist Intelligence Unit, Barclays Wealth released a report yesterday that forecasts the evolution of the level and distribution of household wealth in 50 countries between 2007 and 2017. Household wealth was measured using three components - financial holdings such as cash and other liquid assets, non-financial holdings such as property, and an aggregate measure that combined the two. <br><br>Last year, Singapore trailed Hong Kong in highest wealth density, with 23.3 per cent of residents having wealth of more than US$1 million. But by 2017, Singapore is expected to see this figure grow to 40.7 per cent - some 436,000 households - in comparison to Hong Kong's predicted 39.4 per cent. <br><br>According to the report, countries with the highest percentage of dollar millionaires tend to be small, densely populated financial centres such as Singapore and Switzerland. <br><br>In addition, the study revealed that the disproportionate distribution of wealth is expected to narrow as the concentration of wealthy households in Singapore, with US$3 million and US$5 million, is on an upward trend. Households with wealth of US$3 million will more than double from the current 5.1 per cent to 12.5 per cent, while those with US$5 million will almost triple from 2.1 per cent to 6 per cent. <br><br>Barclays Wealth chief executive for Asia-Pacific, Didier von Daeniken, pointed to Singapore's recent efforts to shift its focus from manufacturing towards technology and financial services. In addition, the opening up of previously protected sectors, like financial services, and bilateral trade agreements serve as an impetus to garner foreign direct investment. <br><br>For China, wealth creation has stemmed largely from the stock market and real estate. Citing figures from Ernst &amp; Young, the report said 464 IPOs were launched in China over the past three years, raising US$134 billion. As the country's economy continues to expand, the average net worth per household is expected to quadruple, from US$18,000 in 2007 to US$74,000 10 years later. <br><br>'Asia now represents 25 per cent of HNWI individual wealth globally but only about 10 per cent of the income of the major private banks,' said Mr Daeniken. 'Growth for private banks can come from two areas - more penetration of existing wealth and more wealth being created.' <br><br>In Asia, Barclays clients are typically entrepreneurs, a trend that is expected to remain in the future.</span></p>

              <p>Since its inception - have these companies been able to dominate even their own home market ?</p>
              <p>Hyflux remains stuck with their synthetic material used in the Reverse Osmosis Water ''filteration'' process that have its own innate weaknesses, and they remain stuck with this problem.</p>

              <p><span>(SINGAPORE) Singapore is expected to pull ahead of Hong Kong as home to the highest concentration of millionaires over the next decade, sealing its reputation as a wealth centre not just in Asia but worldwide.<br><br>And while the US and Japan should remain the top two largest global economies, emerging markets such as China, India, Russia and Brazil will make their presence felt more strongly.<br><br>Now ranked seventh in terms of total net worth, China will grab third place by 2017, bypassing several G7 countries to become the third-richest country, while India is expected to make its debut in the top 10 list at No 8. Russia and Brazil will also display significant growth, moving up from 19th to 11th place and 15th to 12th place respectively.<br><br>With the Economist Intelligence Unit, Barclays Wealth released a report yesterday that forecasts the evolution of the level and distribution of household wealth in 50 countries between 2007 and 2017. Household wealth was measured using three components - financial holdings such as cash and other liquid assets, non-financial holdings such as property, and an aggregate measure that combined the two.<br><br>Last year, Singapore trailed Hong Kong in highest wealth density, with 23.3 per cent of residents having wealth of more than US$1 million. But by 2017, Singapore is expected to see this figure grow to 40.7 per cent - some 436,000 households - in comparison to Hong Kong's predicted 39.4 per cent.<br><br>According to the report, countries with the highest percentage of dollar millionaires tend to be small, densely populated financial centres such as Singapore and Switzerland.<br><br>In addition, the study revealed that the disproportionate distribution of wealth is expected to narrow as the concentration of wealthy households in Singapore, with US$3 million and US$5 million, is on an upward trend. Households with wealth of US$3 million will more than double from the current 5.1 per cent to 12.5 per cent, while those with US$5 million will almost triple from 2.1 per cent to 6 per cent.<br><br>Barclays Wealth chief executive for Asia-Pacific, Didier von Daeniken, pointed to Singapore's recent efforts to shift its focus from manufacturing towards technology and financial services. In addition, the opening up of previously protected sectors, like financial services, and bilateral trade agreements serve as an impetus to garner foreign direct investment.<br><br>For China, wealth creation has stemmed largely from the stock market and real estate. Citing figures from Ernst &amp; Young, the report said 464 IPOs were launched in China over the past three years, raising US$134 billion. As the country's economy continues to expand, the average net worth per household is expected to quadruple, from US$18,000 in 2007 to US$74,000 10 years later.<br><br>'Asia now represents 25 per cent of HNWI individual wealth globally but only about 10 per cent of the income of the major private banks,' said Mr Daeniken. 'Growth for private banks can come from two areas - more penetration of existing wealth and more wealth being created.'<br><br>In Asia, Barclays clients are typically entrepreneurs, a trend that is expected to remain in the future.</span></p>

              <p>Is there any use to gloat over - ''Singapore is expected to pull ahead of Hong Kong as home to the highest concentration of millionaires over the next decade'' ?</p>
              <p>It would have been much better if it had read that Singapore is expected to pull ahead of Hong Kong with its own significant concentration of HOME GROWN MILLIONAIRES.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Middle Income Group has been struggling and sinking since the last economic downturn, and has not recovered but have been battered even harder since the 2006 Elections.</p>
              <p>With inflation rising and wage increases being tightly controlled or even frozen in some sectors, can there be any consolation to the average Singaporeans if Singapore manage to become ''HOME to more millionaires than Hong Kong'' ?</p>
              <p>If at all, it will simply exacerbate the Class Divide between the disgustingly obscene Rich and the hapless Poor.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans will be brain washed to accept that without the Millionaires being present there will be less jobs to go around.</p>
              <p>Will the Millionaire Ministers be prepared to sacrifice their wages to help the growth of more millionaires amongst Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>If the Millionaire Ministers are unwilling to sacrifice their million dollar wages to achieve this task, can we expect the same from the foreigner millionaires - as if they owe Singaporeans a living ?</p>

              <p>This money grabbing Singapore Government  will surely not pass up the opportunity to lay their hands on the daily collections - and based on the present taking of 40 percent of  jack pot machines collections from private Clubs - even if the Government is to take anything less, it will surely not fall below 30 percent tax.</p>
              <p>Each of the IR development will cost the owner-operator at least US$3Billion or more, and the lease on their property will be for a period of at least 60 years.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the IR investors would have taken all these into consideration before making their decision to commit their money, and it is not an impossible task for them to recover at least US$50 MILLION a year - in order to recover the US$3 BILLION investment in sixty years.</p>
              <p>The Singapore IR projects are unlike the casinos in Macau, which are dedicated gambling places with a large backdoor market from Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.</p>
              <p>The challenge for the Singapore IR is similar to those in Las Vegas, which is to generate traffic into their properties from the global market based on the attractions of their investments.</p>
              <p> The Singapore IR cannot depend on the high rollers from South-east Asian alone, and will need to attract the other business and family oriented activities to visit Singapore and spend time at these facilities.</p>
              <p>The ultimate question is what is there left to trickle down the pipeline that will benefit the average Singaporean ?</p>
              <p>What is the size of the cake that is left for Singaporeans after the lion share has been cut up by the Government, the Banks, and the IR Owner-Operator ?</p>
              <p>The success and failure of this IR facilities will be measured by the social impact and the standards of living of Singaporeans after a few years have passed. </p>

              <p>HK decided on disneyland instead of casino.  (shanghai comes in later with its own disneyland 2 to 3 times the size of that in HK)</p>
              <p>Singapore picked up the discarded casino idea from HK.  in time  to come, shanghai will come in with an IR 3 to 5 times larger than anywhere in Asia.  the irony of all is that rich S.E. Asians all fly into shanghai to have a few games at their casino over the weekend. </p>
