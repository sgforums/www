              <p>When a candidate for the Opposition Party himself votes for the
              ruling party candidate, it goes to show how little confidence
              people can have in the Opposition Party. If WP comes into power, we
              will have senior party officials like Ling How Doong running our
              ministries, when even his own comrades do not believe in his
              competence.</p>

              <p>I am not surprised. A guy who campaigned against the incums voted in that same elect for the incums. At least he could have voted for someone else. No, he did not.</p>
              <p>Is he a politikxian?  Imagine the wp supporters who put in effort to support him. Is he a talent to be reckoned with ? Why did he not know that what he says on the net is being monitored?  If he is just a kopi shop customer kpkb'ing, that is fine. But he represents wp. Is this a shot in its own foot?  What is going on? so many strange things happened:</p>
              <p>What surprised me more is that there are Opposite parties that exist in the Pore.</p>
              <p>A police leader joined the opposite - i could not believe it. but it happened.</p>
              <p>A oppositie guy could have forgotten to submit a form to qualify to stand for election - i could not believe it. but it happened.</p>
              <p>A oppositie guy keep getting sued till bankrupt many times over , and still doing it - i could not believe it but it happened. how can anyone be so rich?</p>
              <p>A oppositie guy said to look like incumbent style of candidate and given best of the losers award. I could not believe it but it happened.</p>
              <p>A oppositie when given the chance to say does he want him to resign did not utter a reply. i could not believe it. but it happened.</p>
              <p>So many turned up to support the opposites and it turned out that they nebber even won a new seat.  i could not believe it. but it happened.</p>
              <p>The sky dropped a big goolan by way of toilet. did they capitalised?</p>
              <p>Transparency thingie, what have they done in this respect?</p>
              <p>Dengue and HFMD.</p>
              <p>ERP.</p>
              <p>COE.</p>
              <p>FT.  what has WP done to address in the influxification?</p>
              <p>The most unbelievable thingie is the small small tiny parties of oppisites did not choose to unite and now a new oppisite being created to split the small pie even further. I could not believe the rationale and strategy. But it happened.</p>
              <p>did any of you guys get wtf  i mean?</p>
              <p>REALity. more than meets the eyes.</p>
              <p>Really, what can opposites do?</p>
              <p>I rely on 1 thing only. Its the surest and most guaranteed thingie - TIME. Time will help the balance. Time is not into self-preservation. Its not into croning. Its not into wayang. Its not into Corruption / Greed. Its not into Duress. Its not into Coverups. Time is pure and honest and clean and most reliable. There is really no other thing left to rely on.</p>

              <p>what the WP joker did is of little value and hold no political consequences to WP, imo.</p>
              <p>in not so many words, it pales in comparison with what LKY did in his early days in his political manouvering; communist one day, anti-com the next. if you must start picking on this, you should start looking from within, starting with your own Master.</p>
              <p>if anything else, good has come out of this. the WP will know who in its fold is trustworthy.</p>

              <p>Having heard the WP reply on why he said he votted for them, technically he is not wrong. It just shows he is not an experienced politico.</p>
              <p>To remedy, I urge the WP to give him less important role and function.</p>
              <p>Maybe, he should focus on how to write in forums for a start.</p>
              <p>Agree that this incident will not hum the WP much.</p>
              <p>It shows another thingie. that the WP is seriously in need of new blood.</p>
              <p>personally, I think the best skilled speaker is JBJ. He is one of the best speakers in asia. Being lawyer trained is really different.</p>
              <p>Thus, I urge WP have someone with law experience give tutor lessons to the WP guy so that he learns more and becomes more mature as a politico.</p>

              He can vote for PAP for all we care but why must he publicize it.  What was his motives for doing so? To raise the credibility of PAP? To erode the credibility of the opposition? To sow discord in his party, WP and the opposition camp? To get invitation to PAP's tea session? i suspect it is all of the above. He probably thought that that was a masterstroke but i think he has nailed shut the coffin of his political career!

              <p>People will whine about the ruling party but time and again at the polls they will seriously consider the things that truly matter. Can the Opposition Party ensure their company will continue to prosper and that they will have a job? Will the WP be able to field competent ministers? Will the SDP be able to maintain law and order when its leaders are perpetually breaking the law and have no respect for the courts? Will their HDB flat gain in value or will their estate turn into the dump called Potong Pasir?</p>
              <p>When it comes to the crunch, even WP leaders know how to vote the ruling party. For all we know, half the WP CEC might have been secretly voting for PAP all this time. Pity the fools that vote for WP not realizing that the Opposition Party leaders themselves secretly support the ruling party :) </p>

              OM
              
              If you care to read the records within PAP itself you will no doubt find many PAP MPs including some who have crossed over to the oppositions for reasons best known to PAP itself.
              
              Read the posts in youngpap and you will find ex-members expressing great frustrations over how they were treated within the party.
              
              Why? If PAP has experienced such similar defections in the open then when it comes to secret voting one should not be surprised there are many PAP members who have voted for oppositions too in the general election.
              
              So do not insist the government is always in the right and encourage more callous or rogue behavior like challenging Gomes to sue unprovoked or fixing of the oppositions. 
              
              Leave well alone for greater maturity and wisdom and statesmanship as claimed in international media. Let people be the voices of conscience and work on such voices to prevent wrongdoings like the NKF or Shin Corp and uphold the true effectiveness of the young democratic processes being experienced by this young nation to mature without too much fixing and tweaking. 
              
              If you continue to claim success by singing hollow praises for past glories it will not help the cause of your master any way for people are not that stupid to listen to your ivory tower stuff any more being sufficiently educated to know truths from hypocrisy.
              
              It may only make it worse and bring downright contempt and discredit to PAP if all the counter-insurgents continue to counter carelessly without a thought for true feeling of citizens who not only are struggling to pay and pay but are experiencing many injustices as found in the daily running like the ex-NKF.

              <p><br>Obviously you show a lack of intelligence in interpreting the issues this way.</p>
              <p>The case was a WP candidate making a choice between a SDP candidate and a PAP candidate.</p>
              <p>Obviously the WP candidate has the interest of Singaporeans at heart, that's why he voted PAP instead of SDP. Isn't the leader of SDP Dr. Chee Soon Juan?</p>
              <p>Your illustration is illogical as usual, I am entertaining the fact that you could be mentally challenged.</p>
              <p>You can't even make a case between Acer, Dell and Fujitsu, because if WP was Fujitsu, it wasn't contesting the market with their product. It's probably like the CEO of Fujitsu was in China and they only carry 2 brands (Acer and Dell) of notebook PC there, since he believe that Dell was a better PC, he bought Dell. Fujitsu is not in the picture.</p>
