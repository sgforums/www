              <p>oxford moron,</p>
              <p>As per above. How can we trust our lives to your flawed logic and understanding by making another mistake of voting in P4P again?</p>
              <p>From the numerous exchanges I had with you in the past, I would your IQ to be in the range of sub 100. Most of the time, after you lose an argument with me, you will go in to hiding for an extended period of time. When you notice that I am no longer active in Speaker's Corner, you will resurface, only to get your pride demean before going back into seclusion again.</p>
              <p>My logic is clear and I have the interest of the Singapore people at heart. Even though you and me are at different ends, but I still have you and the welfare of Singaporeans at heart. I would ascribe your affliction of low level intelligence to a freak of nature and not bear any grudges against you. Obviously if you are an imbecile in the habit of making erroneous decisions, you should not be at fault, because you do not have the ability to reason logically. Seriously speaking, you should follow in my footsteps and vote in the opposition, it's the wisest choice.</p>

              <p>Which maniac came up with those ideas? You, me or some politician? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I was merely pointing out to oxford moron how wrong he was in his analysis. You did read his analysis and my reply didn't you? If his analysis was gravely wrong and he supports P4P, then obviously he was banking on the wrong set of analysis and facts to base his support for P4P. If he was wrong and I was right in my analysis, then isn't it wiser to follow the right choice. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> I hope this is not too complex for your mind.</p>
              <p> FYI, oxford moron has been consistently wrong in all his past arguments and analysis.</p>

              The Bearable Bear,
              
              For 40 plus years, the M/W have been using all kinds of hypocrisy and assumptions to over-tax people and hoard taxes to serve its own narrow and selfish interest taking for granted people's sacrifices as their success.
              
              If the bear chooses to keep quiet and is prepared to bear with such a system of hypocrisy given the abundance of wrong doings as found in NKF, Shin Corp etc, that would be his privilege.
              
              Hypocrisy and wrong doings will not just disappear just because in Bear's opinion others are grousers and trouble makers or democracy as a open and accountable institution will be wrong. Do not prejudge the goodness of democracy. Do not get brainwashed into believing that what M/W did over the past 40 plus years were all right and beyond criticisms.
              
              If M/W are great leaders as they claim they should not be so negative towards public criticisms and should welcome them as opportunities for further improvements.
              
              It is wrong to get carried away and start believing critics or oppositions are trouble-making.

              <p>if i decide that the MIW is a bum and i cannot trust him, and that the opposition is sincere and will work for the people, i may choose to vote for the opposition - <strong>it is my right</strong></p>
              <p>for you people who condemn those who exercise their rights, you are no better than tinpot fascist wannabes.. and think about it.. if the country was to be placed in hands like yours, we would probably see death squads to rub out people who disagree with you...</p>
              <p>now.. think about that.. think about what democracy and freedom of choice truly means..</p>
              <p>and then RESPECT THE DECISION OF THE MAN who dared to choose with his conscience, his logic and his heart.. instead of some nonsensical brainless "anti-MIW" kneejerk actions which a lot in SC seem to be unable to get out of...</p>

              <p>your counter is logical, but it is really the election preamble that is called into question. credible opposition clamped even before they can campaign, iron-clad media control that only pushes the government agenda and election manifesto and arguably `illegal' sweeteners put forth to sway the apolitical/elderly electorates are areas that are questionable.</p>
              <p>had the government be more `open' to allow credible opposition to challenge the MIW in a more `level' playing field, the end state is that the country as a whole `move forward'. surely the MIW do not have ALL the answers. if the MIW touts itself as having the best candidates possible, why worry? as you rightly put it, the electorate is smart enough to make the right choice.</p>
              <p>by its iron-fisted control of every conceivable lever to maintain total power, the MIW has instead done singapore a disfavor. </p>

              <p>if you deny and could not even see the obvious, it then makes no sense for me to point those out to you. your eyes are bottle-capped already. </p>
              <p>nobody is asking the ruling government to hand the power to the opposition on a platter. for you to suggest that is incredibly naive.  </p>
              <p>for a nation of 40 over years and still cannot trust the people to make the right judgement in choosing their leaders, singapore is heading towards a `political maturity vacuum' that will come to haunt it in time to come, some suggest sooner than later.</p>
              <p>and the MIW work immensely hard for what? wealth hoarding within the inner circle or a fair share for every citizen?</p>
              <p>your desription of the political process in singapore is akin to saying that because i am the defending champion of the 100m race, i am entitled to the best spikes and you, a challenger, can only wear rubber shoes.</p>
              <p>if the PAP fears the opposition more than its own belief and capability of winning a (fair) fight, doesn't that tell you something about the quality of the PAP men?</p>

              <p><br>please just list 2 or 3 instances where `the arena is more merciless on the world stage'? what is it that Mah Bow Tan can do at the world stage that a similar man of reasonable intelligence of his calibre cannot? isn't it just the authority and power entrusted to him that enable him to perform those duties? and with experience and wisdom, that's where he gets better (&amp; i am not referring to MBT)</p>
