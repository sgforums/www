              <p>A Workers' Party CEC member, Yaw Shin Leong, bragged in his blog that he voted for PAP's Teo Ho Pin in the last election. Now we know why the PAP cannot lose because even opposition members in WP is voting for them <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Last Sunday, during WP's walkabout at Nee Soon East SMC &amp; Ang Mo
              Kio GRC. A party member shared with me about rumblings in a local
              Internet forum (Sammy Boy) that some forum participants were unable to
              reconcile with the fact that I voted for Teo Ho Pin in GE2006. <br><br>This party member subsequently sent me the forum link <a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=sammyboymod&amp;msg=176554.1&amp;maxT=4">here</a>.<br><br>I
              am of the view that it is a trait for humans to operate within the
              paradigms of subjectivity and objectivity. Personally, I do not believe
              in opposition for opposition's sake. In this regard, there is nothing
              inherently wrong for me to vote for an MP, regardless of his/ her
              partisan background, whom in my opinion is the better man who can
              better serve the interests of Singapore and my community (Bukit Panjang
              SMC). <br><br>Consciously in so doing, I have raised my understanding
              on a required 'standard for parliamentary entry'. In another words,
              being a forefront partisan activist, myself am of the view that a
              particular candidate from the ruling regime deserves my vote rather
              than another from the opposition, this invariably reminded me that, the
              WP has to 'strive so much harder', 'offer so much more' and 'convince
              so much more' in order 'to get there'. <br><br>Actually during GE06
              itself, there were also some in WP who raised their eye brows when I
              shared with them that I will be voting for Teo Ho Pin. On polling day,
              one urged me that since the incumbent will win anyway I should perhaps
              'spoil my vote' instead. However as a citizen of our constitutional
              state, I take my voting duty very seriously and will never waste my
              precious vote, unless the political circumstances really warrant it. <br><br>The
              interesting question perhaps would be, if a WP candidate is to offer
              himself/ herself for election in the constituency I reside, will I vote
              for this WP candidate? Partisan considerations will certainly weigh
              heavily in my considerations. Having said that, ultimately this WP
              candidate has to convince me that he/ she has what it take to better
              serve the interests of our country and the constituents to win my vote.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>When Mr Yaw said he did not believe in 'opposition for opposition's sake', it would have been helpful if he explained his reasons for joining the opposition in the first place. Was it because he believed in the WP's manifesto or for other reasons? I sure as heck don't get it! If he believed PAP MPs to be 'better', why did he contest in the last election? Opposition for opposition's sake? And why did he join the Workers Party in the first place if he believed the PAP to be 'better'?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Yaw also said: 'ultimately this WP candidate has to convince me that he/she has what it take to better serve the interests of our country and the constituents to win my vote.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This statement reveals alot. His fellow WP candidates have to work at 'convincing' him before he can decide if he wants to vote for them! In other words, Mr Yaw is unsure of WP's policies and candidates! Why on earth is he still in the Workers Party then? Go join the PAP lah!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now back to his 'opposition for opposition's sake' remark… When Mr Low spoke up against the obscene increase in ministerial pay, was he just 'opposing for opposition's sake'? Mr Yaw, can you explain to us what that term means to you? Are there certain PAP's policies opposition politicians shouldn't oppose? Are there certain PAP's policies (or all of them) opposition politicians should endorse? I guess what I am trying to say is: To be a 'responsible' and 'moderate' opposition politician, and avoid accusations of 'opposition for opposition's sake', does he have to oppose none of the PAP's policies and endorse all of them?</p>

              <p>Ridiculous. If I am going to use that stupid logic of yours, the superbly fucked up Republikan party filled to the brim with bigots and racists would be in power for decades and send America to ruin. The whole point of democracy is to get rid of an incompetent government, and many forumers regard the ruling party as a bunch of bumbling incompetents who are better off nursing babies (if they even know how to nurse babies), than running a country.</p>
