You would find very few negative news about Singapoor.

So how does Singapoor justify in having properties sustained at the same level as Australia? Because HDB said it is so and subsidy (discount) was given? Housing in Australia is private whereas HDB is "public" and subsidized.<br><br>These days in Singapoor, it's difficult to differentiate what is public and what is private anymore, because public has morph into quasi-private with profit motive.</div>
