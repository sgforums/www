            <div class='col-md body'>a bit of an overkill lah really. Its like saying that you'll get fined every time u litter and would have to live in fear if you migrate to Singapore. Nobody seriously expects any country to run out of teachers really unless of course that country is at war or something. In a mining town where mining jobs pay much more than teachers and where everything is expensive maybe but i'm sure they will mitigate the problem. Else nobody would expect Australia to run out of teachers.</div>

Higher wages but higher tax and expenditure. There is of course some offset for everything. Thing is in every city everybody has their own set of problems thus as eagle has said no point comparing. Its not like suddenly you go somewhere you become rich or will be comparatively better off. No Utopia. It really depends on individual circumstances whether or not one becomes better off financially. That said, of course there are some things one cannot get in Singapore and can get overseas and vice-versa. Just a general statement from me, not directing this at anybody.</div>
