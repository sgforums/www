            <div class='col-md body'>I have lived in Australia for many years.<br><br>For disabled, ( real or otherwise), bludgers, unemployed -- there is no argument. Australia has welfare. Enough for the very basic needs. (around $200 per week)<br><br>For low or unskilled workers, I would say you are probably better off in Australia. The pay is a bit higher, but the cost of living also higher. But there is some government assistance in terms of healthcare, education, so I would say for these people, probably better in Australia.<br><br>For some workers, eg plumbers, builders, bricklayers, carpenters, etc... These "skilled" blue collar workers are very well paid here compared to Singapore.. Easily over $1000 per week. Maybe closer to $2000 for some.<br>I believe this category of workers are not too well paid in Singapore.<br><br>For highly skilled/ high pay work, that is where Singapore is ahead. The pay may or may not be higher in the first place, but the lower taxes, and lower cost of living really comes into play. Taxes start to get pretty scary at this point. Up to almost 50%.<br></div>
