What do you want to prove? That somebody will be shortchanged by the tax system? You can't please all the income classes, somebody will be shortchanged, I'd rather the rich and the higher middle income be shortchanged rather than the lower income. The higher income with their large paychecks do not have to struggle with necessities.<br><br>I hope this answer your question.<br><br>What we are concern with is low income earner's ability to afford necessities, not with the middle or high income earner's ability to afford luxuries.<br><br></div></blockquote>I strongly agree that the rich and the higher middle income should be shortchanged rather than the lower income. However, your basis of comparisons with those affected by the minimum wage law in Aussie only shows that a minimum wage enables low income earners to better afford necessities. True, it illustrates your point, but it encompasses that most important difference of minimum wage.<br><br>I would think it more convincing, at least for me, if the profession chosen is one that is a little above the minimum wage (so as not to be affected by it) compared to the same profession in Singapore. That, I'm sure, would still be considered low-income, and will serve as a better comparison.<br><br>Bear in mind, I've already started discussing low-income since you have stated your stand, if you haven't already noticed.</div>

However, your basis of comparisons with those affected by the minimum wage law in Aussie only shows that a minimum wage enables low income earners to better afford necessities.
