The commoners are left with having to pay the price with high levels of inflation, taxes, fees, charges and fines.<br><br>Ever wonder why our wages are so depressed, while citizens from other equivalent GDP per capita economies (e.g. Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, etc) can better afford holidays overseas. Their average wages are at least 3-5 times of Singaporeans <a href="http://www.jobaroo.com/working-livingandworking.html" rel="nofollow">(e.g. waiters and retail assistant makes AUD 15 to AUD 25 per hour)</a>. Singaporeans can only contend with 3rd world standard of living in the future, given the government's policy on letting in more 3rd world workers to push down wages.<br><br>The explanation for low wages given by P4P was global competition, seems like competition only applies to Singapore ONLY. But not to countries such as Australia or New Zealand.<br><br>P4P lackeys here complain that some of these countries like Australia, New Zealand, etc have high tax structure. But given their wages, they still make more than the average Singaporeans and could afford more despite their high tax structure. Notwithstanding that they do not need to pay for healthcare and basic education.<br><br>***This comparison is based only on the after tax spending power of low wage earners of both countries.

            <div class='col-md body'>But those prices were taken from an online site yesterday night. I don't live in Perth, so I am not in an authoritative position to state the price. You can click on the link to check on the price of housing in Perth. Also depends on your definition of "decent", I am comparing HDB standards with a condominium in Perth. Since you say your children are there, I guess your definition of decent should be high, because your children can afford to study or emigrate there.<br><br>I agree that the poor in Australia are more abled to make ends meet than in Singapore. But sad thing is, the poor in Singapore will never have a chance to emigrate to Australia to make 3-5 times more for their labour. Instead our beloved P4P imports more foreign labour to compete against citizens for wages and resources (housing, transportation, etc). Thus, the lower wage earners are stuck in a perpetual poverty spiral.<br><br>Let's face it, with the current influx of foreign talents to compete for low level jobs, the wages for these sectors are not going to increase. Whereas, price levels will inflate to higher levels (e.g. higher housing cost, transport cost, food, etc), decreasing the standard of living for our low level wage earners.</div>

If u work outside city, few take a trains. unless u work in downtowns. the cost of cars or petrol no matter how your compare/exchange rate is still lower than singapore.<br>Car average price: 150% cheaper.<br>petrol average price:25-30% cheaper.<br><br>thus the comparison of train ride comparison  is not so suitable as most aussies drive and mostly tourist or foreigners/ students take a train. thus that why u feel the pinch when u visit aust.<br><br>But truth about the rapid salary increase in australia is due to many reason. one such reason is commodity booms, resulting in shortage of labours for the services sector, construction, engineerin sector + govt strict control of foreign influx of labours.<br>i feel the thread starter are discussing these topic because he feel more can be done for the betterment for the lower and middle lower earners in singapore.
