It's because of the old man's grand plan of having approximately less than 15% of citizens as highly educated, while keeping the remaining 80% in low level jobs. This has created a shortage in high end jobs and an over supply of low end jobs. Shortage equates to high prices; over supply equates to lower prices.<br><br>Sakae Sushi makes less than $3,000 a month? Is that your approximation or do you have their audited profit and loss statement. Even if it's true, does it mean that all the restaurants here make less than $3,000 a month.</div></blockquote>Sakae Sushi info is from my uncle, who has worked with them before. If you read carefully, I did not say that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sakae Sushi makes less than $3,000 a month</span>. It is the amount they earned <span style="text-decoration: underline;">per branch</span>, which means with 10 branches, the whole group will earn near $30k a month.<br><br>And if it is as bad as you said that the poor in Sg have low buying power, and if Sg is to emulate first world countries, then ya, a minimum wage law should be implemented. Yet the govt "do not want Singaporeans to develop a crutch mentality", although they want Singaporeans to store CPF with them.<br><br>Of course a low wage worker wouldn't eat in a restaurant in Singapore or Australia, but if a low wage worker works long working hours just to have the funds and means to survive, how much time does he/she have to make his/her own meals? In sg, low wage workers has the choice of getting food with sufficient nutrition from hawker centres. Not really so in other countries. Do you think bread with a long sausage is better and cheaper than a plate of rice with meat and vege?<br><br>I have no idea why you would equate lowly educated with low wages. Living with such a mindset will only make one forever stuck in the particular wage group with little improvement. Education is only a step in life, and a paper cert only helps in being an employee, and employees will usually not earn too much.<br><br>Even a fresh engine grad with first class honours earns less than the average wage in Singapore (ard $3.2k now), with uni sch fees debt amounting to $24k. A first class accountant fresh grad also earns around $2.4k a month, and with the debt of needing to pay the uni fees amounting to $18k. Whereas a waiter perhaps earning $1.2k a month has probably no such debt, and has perhaps entered the working world earlier than the uni grad.<br><br>There are also just so many living examples of how the supposedly "lowly educated" earning more than (and employing) the supposedly "highly educated" people in Singapore. I've personally seen hawkers driving Mercedes and living in landed houses. And as an additional info, there's this HK restaurant in Munich, whose owner owns a PhD, an example of so called "highly educated" doing a job that does not require a cert. It is quite likely that he earns more from running the restaurant than doing research work on his PhD.<br><br>However, I believe the main problems are not with the above, but rather, with families who could not even land a job as a waiter, whose income is not fixed, who, no matter in which part of the world they are at, can hardly find a job, be  it in Sg or in Aussie.</div>
