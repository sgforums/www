I see it so many times when there is a chance of national identity creeping up it got discourage. Personnally i think S'pore is an over grown Child. It needs to be treated as an adult.  It has to stop seeking approval from the US, PRC, Aus or UK or human rights...., It needs to find its own footing.<br><br>i think we are legitimately stood as a nation and financially mature enough to have an identity, but not able to refine our identity from the historical attachment.<br><br>I don't think brother LHL would be able to bring us anywhere till the next generation of minister.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, realistically speaking, the world is a mixed bag today, with foreigners in every country.<br><br>People may have misgivings against foreigners because they take their jobs and run off when times are bad.<br><br>Firstly, I think there are jobs that pay $600 to $700 per month that Singaporeans do not want to take. If employers have to hire Singaporeans for these jobs at, say, $1,200, it could push the market for other jobs down.<br><br>However, I believe if a Singaporean and a foreigner has exactly the same criteria and requirements, a Singaporean employer should take care of the Singaporean first. Unfortunately, such total coincidences are rare among contending candidates for a job vacancy.<br><br>There are certain policies that are pro-Singaporean, although I think there is much further room for improvement.<br><br>Secondly, I feel it is not a bad thing to have foreigners leaving Singapore when times are down. It saves Singaporeans from the axe and is a better alternative to having all Singaporeans and they all end up stuck here in bad times.<br><br>Personally, I am against foreign talent, specifically the direct-hire situations we have seen in SGX, DBS and NOL. The pattern appears to have faded away, with Singaporeans hired in places of the expatriates in the above organisations who had their contracts prematurely ceased. The PAP government appears to have learnt their lesson. The issue is whether Singaporeans remember these lessons.<br><br>Regards</div>
