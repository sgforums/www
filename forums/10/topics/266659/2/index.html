About half of our population now is made up of foreigners.<br><br>REAL SINGAPOREANS</div></blockquote>no, foreigners don't make up half of our population, only 25%.<br><br>anyway, you better get use to the idea since the ft policy is going to stay for quite a while. here is some reality:<br><br>Indians<br>History revisited<br>A new wave of Indian immigrants is uplifting Singapore's skills content; some locals see them as a threat for jobs. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Jul 7, 2007<br><br>A RETIRED banker on a visit to the city centre after several years was taken aback by the new mass of cosmopolitan humanity during lunch-hour, Â“especially the number of IndiansÂ”.<br><br>He wasnÂ’t referring to local Indians, who had lived here for over a century, but the new arrivals.<br><br>Â“I was surprised to see the changes. The crowds were a colourful lot with people speaking in various languages. There was hardly a place to sit,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“Above all the buzz are Indian professionals, who seem to be everywhere, from Raffles MRT to Suntec City.Â”<br><br>The foreign elements were not so prevalent in the years that he had worked there before he retired. Â“At the time most of the Indians could be seen only in Little India or were scattered around the housing estates.Â”<br><br>My friend would have been more impressed had he visited some industrial estates, where many IT engineers work in electronics.<br><br>Needing to change a computer disk drive, I went to Ang Mo Kio Industrial Estate recently, lost my way in the vast concrete jungle and had to seek direction from two workers.<br><br>Both turned out to be recent arrivals from India.<br><br>As Singapore moves deeper into the 21st Century, its future lies increasingly in the hands of immigrants Â– of the right kind, of course. With its birth rates falling, it needs millions of them to stay ahead.<br><br>And India is one of the top suppliers of talent, next in numbers only to Malaysia and China (though Malaysians have never really been regarded as foreigners).<br><br>Over the past decade, Singapore's Indian community has been transformed by the invasion of high-tech professionals, similar to the impact they made in the United States.<br><br>The new arrivals are not only IT professionals but include a growing number of financial, research and support workers. Some bring their own businesses here.<br><br>Several condos in the East Coast are popular choices for Indian families; their kids play in the parks on Sunday.<br><br>The influx is reshaping the demography. Traditionally, some 8% of Singaporean residents are ethnic Indians, 76% Chinese and 14% Malays.<br><br>But Indian arrivals make up a large 12% of the estimated 900,000-strong foreign community here.<br><br>This has pushed up the total number of ethnic Indians living here to more than 420,000 or 9.4% of the total population of 4.5 million.<br><br>Unlike those in the past, this new wave has higher skills and is wealthier; their children are better educated, which augurs well for the future.<br><br>Â“Being a creative and entrepreneurial group, Indians are a great asset to our economy,Â” Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong commented.<br><br>A blogger recently wrote: Â“The new breed of professional Indian expatriates are radically transforming the Indian Diaspora in Singapore.Â”<br><br>In 1990, for example, only 22% of Indians were professionals or managers; today it is more than 50%. Cleaners and labourers fell from 15% to less than 8%.<br><br>The Indians have become a major ingredient in the mixed racial salad bowl of this city state Â– South East-Asia's most high-tech and wealthiest country.<br><br>The flavours of the Indian curries, of Roti Prata, Thosai and Briyani, the festivities of Deepavali and Thaipusam, and the song and dance of Indian movies, are all an integral part of the socio-cultural landscape of Singapore.<br><br>Little India is the enclave for Indians, as Geylang Serai is for the Malays and Chinatown for the Chinese.<br><br>For the new migrants, settling down to SingaporeÂ’s lifestyle is less a social or cultural challenge compared with the West or Hong Kong. But even with the affinity, life is often less than rosy.<br><br>Singaporeans do not feel hostile towards foreigners Â– whether from China or India Â– but neither do they welcome them with open arms. They are sometimes resented for taking away local jobs or places in university.<br><br>Even among their local kin, the foreigners from India often stand out. Mindsets and values between them differ.<br><br>Many new arrivals seem to consider themselves superior to local Indians, PeopleÂ’s Action Party backbenchers say.<br><br>An ethnic Indian backbencher said the way they were seen to behave had raised concern among the local Indians.<br><br>A similar barrier exists between the local-born and mainland Chinese that sometimes bursts into online verbal spats.<br><br>Tapping into emerging IndiaÂ’s strength is a major strategy for Singapore not only economically but also politically.<br><br>Â“It is a universal truth that the new world belongs to the United States, China and India,Â” said a political commentator. In short, India makes a good strategic partner to offset ChinaÂ’s power.<br><br>Traditionally, Singapore has thrived on trade and investment in South-East Asia, but in recent years the environment has deteriorated for its investors in Thailand and Indonesia.<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s high-powered investments in several counties in the region are encountering local sensitivities.<br><br>In many ways, India itself has changed.<br><br>In the 70s when it first banned Coca Cola and other foreign products, an ambassador told me in New Delhi: Â“IÂ’ve been here for three years and I still havenÂ’t figured out whether this is a capitalist or a communist economy.Â”<br><br>India is gradually overcoming partisan politics that prevent another China from taking shape there.<br><br>Â“Realistically speaking, India is not China and the opportunities, when they come, will be slow to take root,Â” said an exporter to China.<br><br>Â“Between them there is still a big gap, but it could narrow in future and Singapore should be there.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think TS said it the right way, but I can understand why he is feeling frustrated. If you are working you will know that feeling also. Like the guy above said, its not how hard you work, its how low you are willing to get paid. And when you want to fight who can go lower with a foreigner from India, Indonesia, Phillipines, China, Thailand, Malaysia etc. You see who will lose. They are willing to squeeze with 6 people renting a 3-room flat. Are you willing to take a salary that can only afford a 3-room flat if you also have to house your parents, your wife and children?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To start with, I strongly agree to a large extent as to what the TS is stating, however, I suppose that certain words you had chosen to use is rather extreme to the point that it's offensive. I know how f***ed up you must be feeling now, but we should at least give them some decent respect as fellow human beings lest not we be considered as barbaric.<br><br>For those who can't really identify what's the problem with these "alien" talents, please read my humble opinion on this issue. As for "alien" talents who aren't really happy with my opinion, please forgive me and not read on. This post is meant to allow me to practise my freedom of speech, no offences.<br><br>Firstly, we have to bear a thing in mind, which is the defination of a true blue Singaporean. Being one would mean that we had spent most of our time progressing with and being molded under our nation. Most importantly, jingoism towards our nation.<br><br>Progressing with our nation would mean that those people who had stick with Singapore through thick and thin, had literally, grew up in Singapore through our education system or gone through the National Service as for males. Most importantly, we must not forget about the descendents of the forefathers who sacrificed a their lives and effort to shape Singapore to what it is today.<br><br>On the other hand, those aliens who had been allowed to step on our soil and hailed as "talents" may not have such love for our nation due to the fact that they are NOT Singaporeans in the first place. So, they(majority) are unable to pledge allegiance like we Singaporean does.<br><br>Just for reference, I would like to relate a true account of my teacher's experience with these "alien talents" in a social gathering.<br><br>My teacher was socializing with these aliens when they started the discussion about the living standards of Singaporeans. One of them commented that how shocking was it that among so many developed Asian countries, Singapore was the worst he had ever been to! He was relating that how pathetic we are to live in HDB (Housing Development Board) flats and even made comparisons of it with the cottages that poor people use to live in back in his country.<br><br>Another alien narrated his encounter with a Singaporean taxi driver and ridiculed his poor command of English. On top of that, this particular alien even sterotyped that every Singaporean, speaks English like him.<br><br>Out of patrotism and the role of being an authentic Singaporean, my teacher spent that whole night defending the truth and stature of Singapore and became the "rogue of the night", extremely loathed by those aliens.<br><br>From the above incident, I sincerely hope that you, the true owner of Singapore, to stand up and address to the danger that we are exposing ourselves to.<br><br>Just look at these aliens! They have no contact with our heritage and culture(which I doubt they are even interested in) and they know nothing about being a Singaporean. For example, they are unaware that HDB flats are a symbol of the welfare of our society which Singapore successfully helped<br>in housing our population. They even assumed that everyone of us speaks like a taxi driver uncle(come on, some taxi uncle speaks excellent English!) and even if we do, that's part of the unique culture that we induldged in!<br><br>In case you are still unable to spot the jeopardy by now, please read on.<br><br>I cannot deny the solidity that there ARE indeed "alien talents" among these outsiders and they are capable of driving of economic progression. Perhaps, there may be a day that the goverment find these aliens so beneficial that they start importing them into our motherland until we are out numbered by them. Again, perhaps when it is our children's time, they would be living under the expense of these aliens and be treated as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">second class</span> citizen in their own country!<br><br>To all Singaporeans I urge you people to please address to this issue that we are facing now and the issue that we may be facing in the future.<br><br>My final message to aliens; if you really think that Singapore's living standard is that unbearble, then f*** off. Please kindly crawl back to your own land and stop your scurrilous slammings of my motherland.<br><br>Thank you.</div>
