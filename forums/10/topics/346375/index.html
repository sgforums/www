              <p>During last downturn, our government hope that all of us to support the rich or the big bosses by having CPF cut, and think that if the rich getting richer, they will make the economy moved as they will spend more money.

              <p>they did have pay cut. Pay attention.</p>
              <p>Instead of firing all the employee, the rich fired some of them. Again, pay attention.</p>
