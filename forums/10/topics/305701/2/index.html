              <p>I'm all for these pupils to be flogged publicly. All this fear
              about the boys being scarred psychologically is over-protecting
              them. Whack the shee-it outta them I say!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p>If we don't hammer these kids to shape now, they'll never learn
              their lesson. And when they repeat their errant ways when they are
              grown up, society will punish them even more severely.....

              <p>i don't think its overprotecting them leh. i think its good to evaluate why do we punish someone.</p>
              <p>is it to enact justice so that the victim will feel at peace?</p>
              <p>is it to condition the perp of his wrongdoing so that he knows that it was wrong?</p>
              <p>is it to use them as examples to "kill the chicken to scare the monkey"?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think the only good reasons to punish someone is to let him know that his actions are not acceptable and to allow the victim to have some sense of peace and justice. until the perp realises that what he does is wrong, he's going to do it again, and again and again.</p>
              <p>how many times can you publically flog someone? it only works once, because it is inefficient once he is numbed to the attention, or he grows to like the attention.</p>
              <p>kids will be kids, they're going to be idiots, and teenagers will be teenagers, always wanting to prove their worth and bravado. the worrying part is whether they will mature and be responsible adults. and i'm not sure public humiliation is a step towards that path.</p>
              <p>i agree that they should be flogged, but not publically.</p>

              <p>like what? rape?</p>
              <p>there's always risks involved when you show grace and give benefits of the doubt.</p>
              <p>in this case, i give them the benefit of the doubt that they're not young demented perverts role-playing rape fantasies in their head, but they're just trying to show off how brave they are and just being naughty.</p>
              <p>i mean, what's the use of public humiliation. for example in USA, child molesters are profiled publically, not to shame them, but to allow people around them to safeguard their kids, in case things do go wrong.</p>
              <p>so you really have to ask yourself, what is the purpose of punishing them publically?</p>
              <p>if you're saying to educate them from their wrongdoings, i think caning is good enough.</p>

              <p>The kids would most likely go with the second choice especially if their actions were not done out of perversion but for fun and on impulse. They will feel that they have been wronged and do not deserve the severe punishment and humiliation of not just being caned in public but being labelled as perverts by everyone around them for the rest of their secondary school life.</p>
              <p>I'm not agreeing with TS regarding his view that they need not be punished because their actions have not been carried out, but caning them in public simply serve no purpose but to snuff out their self-esteem and amplify their rebelliousness. From what I can remember when I was a kid, after the punishment, they will probably be afraid if they don't do anything to get back at the teachers, their peers would assume that they accept the punishment because they are indeed perverts and are guilty of what they have done, hence rebellious actions would usually follow thereafter to avoid that.</p>
              <p>The staff in charge of student discipline in that school should definitely investigate the matter further to find out the cause and intention behind their actions before deciding on a solution instead of just lazily throwing up a one-rod-ends-all.</p>

              <p>I see your point. An alternative to physical punishment may be the use of coventry.</p>
              <p>It's a practice of ignoring someone as a punishment. However while it can be very effective it requires the participation of all and is difficult to organize.</p>
              <p>They used to brand thieves to warning to others not to trust them. Or cut off hands etc.</p>
              <p>The less extreme version would be putting them in jails, in effect being ignored by society, except jails have developed their own social systems that can exacerbate the problem.</p>
              <p>A public humiliation has somewhat of the same effect as people distance themselves from the wrong doer.</p>
