Nothing that can be proudly raised as a positive, because the current situation, posed as a positive, is more apt as a lousy joke.<br><br>For eg, the frantic presentation of the recent election victory of the ruling party as a "strong mandate" and "landslide victory" is a very good sign of just how desperate things are for the ruling party and their blind supporters. And that does not even take into account the breaking up of previously strong opposition constituencies and annexing them with MUCH LARGER constituencies where the margin of support for the ruling party is enough to overcome the total number of opposition supporters. I mean, hey, if they need to play dirty like that to get their "strong mandate" then well, thats just very telling how things really are isn't it?</div>
