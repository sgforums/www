            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SHE was a new face representing the PeopleÂ’s Action Party, but when Ms Denise Phuasurfed the Internet during the recent General Election, the tone of the postings stunned her.They were overwhelmingly slanted against the ruling party.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: indigo;">Â“I know that something has gone wrong when more than 85 per cent (of the traffic) writes negatively about the PAP,Â” she said at a post-mortem of the GE organised last night by the National University of Singapore Society. Â“This is something that the PAP would do well to take into account ... and to manage this channel of communication,Â” she added. Ms Phua stressed that she was not dismissing the views posted on the Internet nor even disagreeing with them. Her concern was more that the coverage was not balanced.</span></span><br><br>Nowhere, for example, was it mentioned that this particular GE was not a snap poll or that the Opposition had the freedom to hold rallies of its own. But given the fact that cyber-traffic goes out to the world, Ms Phua felt that a foreigner reading about elections in Singapore would only have a<br>chance to hear one side of the story Â— that too, a somewhat skewed one.<br><br>Again, she mentioned that her party would do well to think about this medium.<br>One member of the audience pointed out that if the Internet was skewed in one direction then, surely, the local media had gone in the other direction, giving far morecoverage to the ruling party.<br><br>Perhaps, rebutted Ms Phua, this was on account of the fact that the PAP had fielded far more candidates in the GE than the Opposition Â— and the coverage was a reflection of that.<br><br>Dr Chee Soon Juan, secretary-general of the Singapore Democratic Party, objected not merely to the extent of coverage that his party had received in the media, but also to the tone of it. He said that even the photographs of his partyÂ’s candidates used in local newspapers were Â“not flatteringÂ”. Someone from the audience mentioned that Dr Chee sounded more Â“reasonableÂ” than the image he had formed of him.<br><br>Â“That is because what you read about me is a relentless campaign<br>of character assassination,Â” said Dr Chee. A member of the audience observed<br>that the local media, during the recent GE, had been more balanced than in the past. Another issue that cropped up related to voting secrecy.<br><br>Mr Perry Tong from the WorkersÂ’ Party acknowledged that he had no doubt whatsoever that the vote was secret and it was Â“as good as impossibleÂ” for someone to find out how an individual had voted. Political scientist Dr Ho Khai Leong then said he was surprised that the Opposition had not used this fact to their advantage to persuade more people to vote for them.<br><br>But Dr Chee said the fears did exist. Â“And even if peopleÂ’s fears are irrational, you still have to address them,Â” he added. </strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â— DERRICK A PAULO<br>TODAY Newspaper<br>24 May 2006</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another example of double standards by the Ruling Party, claiming that the internet coverage is not balanced?<br><br>Wasn't it in direct contrast to the media coverage during the elections, especially the photo coverage of opposition rallies which was only reluctantly published late towards the end of the elections when it's effect was diminished?<br><br>Isn't that the 'balance' to the imbalance equation created by the govt-controlled media?<br><br>Since ST forum articles are heavily censored or self-censored to avoid the fearful defamation suits, the internet is the only means to air one's views objectively without the summary nip and tuck. Could it be that many of the comments, including those in SC here are discussing issues the govt considers taboo and non-discussion?<br><br>Denise Phua, despite her newpaper interview prior to elections regarding open views and religion, has certainly shown her credentials as another stooge if she plans to 'fix' those views on the internet, instead of properly analysing and dissecting the issues discussed:<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is something that the PAP would do well to take into account ... and to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">manage</span> this channel of communication</span></span></strong><br><br>What could she possibly mean by the use of the word 'manage', which was delicately posed to make a dual inference?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>(Posted by "Anonymous" at Feedback Unit: on 24.5.2006)<br><br>Many of your so-called articles are not concrete, lacking in substance or insight or almost illusory and that is why the press is reluctant to publish. The press has to produce quality work for its readers and these articles must clear the test or worthiness of journalism. It may not be of journalist appeal or interest even if it is well-crafted because it could be just a pulp work.  You may think your work is good but if the press thinks otherwise, then the press is right because they are at liberty to publish or not publish. The press is by itself a neutral and independent authority on its own. Please don't throw your frustrations on others. Wish you improved writing.</blockquote>(Reply to above-quoted "Anonymous" post)<br><br>Good writing with correct syntax is only one aspect but the press has obviously fought shy of publicishing letters with views which may be overly strong in criticism or at loggerhead with established mainstream policies of government. Take the letter "Proposal to Review the Constitution of Singapore" as posted in this forum as an example. What is wrong with the substance of this letter as compared with those which were selectively published by the Straits Times which were normally full of praises of existing government views and policies. I might just re-post the said letter here again with one letters which were published.<br><br>For your information, my other letters which were published by the Straits Times were often those which praised the government e.g. one "Congratulation to PM Goh Chok Tong on his national rally speech" and other "Practical Efficiency and Productivity".<br><br>These facts have proven my point that our press is fully under the control of the government and it is this fact that have partly caused the negative internet forum postings mentioned by Denise. Good corporate governance will be an essential ingredient of government if a government is to win over the people.<br><br>(My rejected letter to forum page of Straits Times/Today referred to in my previous post was sent to their editors on 11.5.2006; Now compare with other letters published in the forum pages of these two newspapers on 12.5.2006 and during the week, wouldn't it seem too obvious that critical letter of this nature will not be entertained by ST or Today)<br><br>My rejected letter is now reproduced below again for general information:-<br><br>QUOTE:"The Constitution of a country usually sets out the basic rights of citizens and defines the role of government and its component branches.<br><br>In the new era of fast changing technologies, is there a need to review its relevance to keep up with changes?<br><br>Is the role of government still valid as defined in the existing constitution or should it be updated to reflect the needs and aspirations of the people. Should the government be more dynamic or should it be static and reactionary merely be concerned with legalistic control of the population to maintain law and order?<br><br>Should there be processes of government, to ensure accountability and transparency in administration, justice, election processes and empower the citizens to contribute to overall social, cultural and economic competitiveness.<br><br>Specifically should the constitution help to ensure greater accountability and transparency of governance, efficient and effective functioning of the three branches of government, namely the executive, legislature, judiciary supported by a non-aligned civil service in the interest of all citizens.<br><br>Finally, should the executive provide leadership which is open and accountable in arriving at policies, decisions and administration so as to win over the participation by the citizens as human resources?<br><br>A review of the constitution can be made to help bring about the necessary changes to the way the branches of government are conducting the administration of the country beyond accomplishing their own immediate tasks.<br><br>There is a need to recognise that the top priority is more than mere election and making laws or decisions affecting the citizens. Therr is obviously a much arger scope of government one that is empowering the collective talents, coordination, knowledge applications and innovation in every field in collective nation building, the key to the people's vibrancy and competitiveness.<br><br>It is critical to look at the larger picture of motivating all citizens in making collective efforts with coordination of different branches of the government, to go about their respective tasks among the legislature, executive, and judiciary. There should above all be accountability and transparency and yet attaining of unity of purpose.<br><br>It is therefore proposed to review the constitution in the context of attaining the larger perspective of nation building. Only when the constitution is open and able to involve citizens in contributing to accountability, transparency, coordination and unity of purpose that there could be collective leadership which will empower growths in social, cultural and economic vibrancy as a way of life essential to eliciting their contribution in diverse aspects of nation buidling.<br><br>With this above-stated objective in mind, it is proposed to upgrade the constitution as follows:-<br><br>(1) To unify the citizens by setting up the constitution as a compact between the state and the citizens.<br><br>(2) To set up and safeguard the basic right of citizen including freedom to speak up or air their views or suggestions on any aspect of governing of the country.<br><br>(3) To safeguard the welfare and wellbeing of citizens and protect them against any threats or exploitation from any external or internal sources.<br><br>(4) To guarantee the right of citizens to elect the best representatives based on the One-Man-One-Vote election process without any hindrance.<br><br>(5) To provide for equitable multi-racial representation by permitting for election of minority-race candidates receiving the highest percentage of votes to be elected into parliament to represent their minority race's interest in government of the country.<br><br>(6) To ensure that any changes made to the constitution boundaries or election processes or procedure will be prejudice the constitutional right of citizens elect their choice of candidates based on one-man-one-vote election system.<br><br>(7) To establish clearly defined hierarchy of government comprising the collective body of elected representatives sitting as legislature or parliament, as the supreme arbiter of government with authority and power of censor and penalty over three branches of government namely the executive, legislature, judiary collectively supported by an overall civil service.<br><br>The government of the country should be higher than the ruling party or the executive, legislature or judiciary and should have the largest role of government to form committees and other bodies to oversee any particular issue or problem. Citizens should be encouraged to come forward to play their complementary role to check on any errors or oversights or mistakes in the government and play a pivotal role in diverse areas.<br><br>It is of primary importance to review the roles of the executive to encourage overall growth involving participation by all component branches and citizens.<br><br>Such review will then bring about changes in initiation and formulation of more effective pro-people and pro-growth policies and decision but to embrace the economic, social and cultural aspects to involve the citizens in sustaining vibrancy and competitiveness.<br><br>So to that extent, law making and enforcements should be the lowest domination of government. The higher perspective should be to encourage and empower the people in active participation in every aspect of nation building and not to be restricted to laws and enforcements by the executive.<br><br>Therefore, it is essential to define the role of government and various component parties of government as follows:-<br><br>(a) Parliament (Legislature) - to debate and deliberate and give approval to recommendations of the executive on policies, decisions, proposals relating to administration of the government.<br><br>(b) Executive - to initiate and formulate policies and laws for approval of parliament and to implement policies and decisions passed by parliament.<br><br>(c ) Judiciary - to administer justice over enforcement of laws and adjudication of disputes and problems affecting the citizens.<br><br>It shall be the function of the civil service to carry out the policies and decisions and implement the laws and their enforcements passed by parliament.<br><br>( Establish Rule of law, justice, fairness and equity in conduct of laws.<br><br>(9) Establish low-cost independent panels with neutrality of status and relevant expertise to administer all situations of conflicts or potential conflict of interests, in election processes, administration of government, approval of salaries and rewards of government ministers, MPs and executives and adjudication of justice and establishment of accountability and transparency in administration of government.<br><br>The primary objective of the review should be clear - to build an inclusive cosmopolitan society and increase the overall participaton in all aspects of nation building. Secondarily the review will help to correct or clarify any grey areas that might lead to erosion of rights of citizens thereby undermining the eventual evolvement of greater social, cultural and economic vibrancy of the citizens.<br><br>By guaranteeing the citizens of basic rights of citizens, and delineate the roles of the three branches of government, we will be able to lay a strong foundation for the country one which will lead to better collective leadership and shared responsibility and one which will motivate citizens to contribute to larger aspects of nation building.<br><br>Such a constitution will then help to lessen conflicts within society, the surest and most certain way to prevent concentration of power in any individuals or groups of individuals which might lead to long-term instability.<br><br>It is envisaged that a pro-people and pro-growth constitution, will fuel the growth of people creativity, entrepreneurship in all aspects of nation building in the interest of all citizens irrespective of belief, cult, race, religion or political views or inclinations.

            <div class='col-md body'>Posted : 24/05/2006 05:21:41PM<br><br><blockquote>Mr. Robert Tay, quite interesting to note. If you have a negative tone for the government of our time, then how is it you also said good about the government in its "Practical Efficiency &amp; Productivity"? You praised what PM Goh said in his National Day Rally. So where is the sincerity of what you preach or profess? Is not there existence of flaws? Try to slowly think and reflect at your own pace and time, without any emotions of anger, frustrations etc. No one is out to get you. Feel free to speak but maintain your stance.<br><br>The press is reponsible to the welfare of a nation and also correct writing, not the prejudicial form. This could be reason why the press does not wish to publish. You cannot press the press to answer you because they are committed to good journalism and integrity. It seems the censors wound hurt you and you lick or nurse it.<br><br>Though much you like to balance yourself and mind, it is not easy. I say you should stop the balancing act. You just give your honest views. The flow of feedback into the big bin will by itself balance the whole input. Which way the balance tilt is not so much of your concern because you are part of the feedback of the many ones in Singapore. The total system knows how to sort, sieve and balance itself. If you attempt to burden yourself with the balancing act onself, then it could be too obvious to others that you are insincere or flawed in judgement or insight.</blockquote>Reply to the above "Anonymous" post:<br><br>I have mentioned in my previous post that Ms. Denise has been reported by the local press as saying that she observed that 85% of postings in the internet were very one-sided or slanted and the government had no chance to reply to those internet posts. I noticed that her criticism against the forumers in the internet was unfair and one-sided hence my posting to FBU. !!!<br><br>In your coming to her defence and defence against my comment about ST's selectively publishing only mild letters and not those with critical of mainstream policies or views of government, you said that ST would only publish certain letters to maintain its journalism standard and quality.<br><br>I think my reply to your defence of Ms. Denise and the ST for being afraid to publish certain critical letters was self-explanatory with evidence showing that ST might not be that objective as you tried to make it out to be.<br><br>As a citizen, I think I have pointed out something concrete in feedback to government and have urged the government rightly in my opinion not to be too restrictive with freedom of expression of views.<br><br>If you want to make fresh criticism saying that I am not being balanced so let it be as you are entitled to your opinion about my points too. I am not saying that my points are totally right but just want to give the government alternative views and opinions about policies. Nothing personal I hope.<br><br></div>

A member of the audience observed<br>that the local media, during the recent GE, had been more balanced than in the past. Another issue that cropped up related to voting secrecy.<br><br>Mr Perry Tong from the WorkersÂ’ Party acknowledged that he had no doubt whatsoever that the vote was secret and it was Â“as good as impossibleÂ” for someone to find out how an individual had voted. Political scientist Dr Ho Khai Leong then said he was surprised that the Opposition had not used this fact to their advantage to persuade more people to vote for them.<br><br>But Dr Chee said the fears did exist. Â“And even if peopleÂ’s fears are irrational, you still have to address them,Â” he added.<br><br>________________________________________________________<br><br>if the opposition were to argue that votes were not secret, that would be taking a stone &amp; throwing at their own feet...<br><br>if more pple know abt it, then they may be afraid to vote for the opposition liao... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

In the press they can only publish what the editors want to be published. On the Internet, though, everyone's welcome to say anything they want, be it pro- or anti- PAP.<br><br>Sure, sgforums has plenty of anti-PAP forummites, but the pro-PAP forummites aren't blocked from posting, either. They can have their say, and indeed pro-PAP threads have been set up. We don't shut down those threads; but rather, we engage them in debate about the points they raise. Moderators only intervene when tempers rise and so on.<br><br>The so-called anti-PAP 'slant' on the Internet is not caused by unscrupulous website moderators or administrators who are bent to whack the PAP at every turn. Rather, it represents the true voice of netizens who aren't afraid to voice out what they would otherwise be too scared to say in the real world.<br><br>She shouldn't be asking whether the Internet should be moderated so that it would be supposedly more 'balanced' to the ruling party (good luck to anyone who tries doing that - you can never fully control the Internet). She should instead sit back and reflect on why do so many netizens seem to be against the PAP and try to address the issues raised by them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some mistakes made, and the PAP better reflect before PAP is toppled in the next coming few elections.<br><br><strong>Internet is Balanced</strong><br>(1) The internet is not biased. Becos it is not controlled effectively by any group. Therefore whatever that's being portrayed in the internet is based on the unedited individual's feeling. So it cannot be 'slanted against the PAP'.<br>The local media however is exactly the opposite.<br><br><strong>Address the problems instead of 'managing' the internet</strong><br>(2) Instead of managing the internet, the problems that netizens bring up should be addressed. Becos if the PAP tries to control the internet, it will create extreme adverse effects. Cause more people to become more pissed with the PAP and creates even severe resentment.<br><br><strong>A major mistake</strong><br>(3) The country cannot be run with a single party. Our PM made a very big mistake by insulting the opposition parties as needing to 'fix' them. In other words, he's giving the impression that Mr Chiam See Tong, Mr Lau Thia Kiang &amp; Steve Chia are trouble makers. He forgot that they are Singaporeans too?<br><br><strong>Meritocracy</strong><br>(4) We are based on meritocrcy. Whoever performs to the benefit of the country should be given more responsibilities. As the quality of opposition candidates improves, the PAP must also recognises that. In fact with what's being portrayed by Ms Phua over the internet, I really have jitters if she were to have some power. And this is the new face of the PAP who's going to be one of our leaders for the next decade? The PAP must not view the oppositions as opponents but as fellow colleagues who also serve the country.<br><br><strong>Media &amp; internet</strong><br>(5) The media must not be wielded by any group. It should be a mirror of truth that runs only the truth without any personal feelings. At the same time, the media also should consider the elements that may distrupt our country's well being but not the the extend of distorting facts to benefit anyone. But currently the internet is performing much better compared to our TV and newspaper in this aspect. The TV and newspapers seems to behave more like a PAP blog.</div>
