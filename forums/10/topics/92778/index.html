            <div class='col-md body'><br>This problem of  children playing at void decks, has NO solution. And the supposedly ideal solution of building more playgrounds and ball courts, is not a solution. Because when the ball court is being used by another group of children, or when it rains, it will still be the void deck that children will play in.<br><br>The root of this issue, is really with the parents. And generally PEOPLE of Singapore. Not facilities.<br><br>I see all too often, playgrounds being systematically destroyed by children, or misused ( I need not detail the meaning of misused - one can just simply imagine ).<br><br>Again I repeat; it is PEOPLE. Not facilities. One such good example will be our roadways: advance network of roads, but typical SIngaporean motorists and their Bad Driving Habits, only slows down traffic and increase travelling time. As well as reduce safety on our roads.<br><br>Period. There's really no complaining or blaming the town council for implementing NAILS on the WALLS. It's the perfect last resort when PEOPLE just don't CARE, or LISTEN.<br><br>There is ALWAYS A CAUSE for something so drastic to be implemented.<br><br>I applaud the Town Council of Tampines and Hougang!<br><br></div>

What do you think the consequences will be?<br><br>Children needs a place to play, yes. But this requirement should encroach on the safety of others.

Not enough facilities and some people just call the cops on you or start measures like these?<br><br>Blame the parents? Blame the kids? They are KIDS, let them run around! Find something else to do? They'll be the fat kids we have nowadays sitting in front of their TVs playing PS2 or studying their brains out and come out to a working world which will eat them up alive.<br><br>Like i said, its EASY for you to say go somewhere else, blame the parents, there's a court nearby.
