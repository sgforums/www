Singaporean are very at home in taking punitive actions to solve problem, fine, ban, jail, cane. Can't do this to the kids so resort to embed nails on walls, to prevent, to discourage... The idea is: "as long as you don't come and dirty my place, as long as you don't damage my school field, where you play balls is not my problem."..... other places you just see signs saying 'no swimming, no cycling, no ball games......'<br><br>Everybody is talking about why you can't do this, why you can't do that, who are the people thinking about where our kids can have adequate places to run and play?

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Singapore as a society needs to wake up to a new reality - one in which we take responsibility for our own actions, and do not need childish mindings from the government.<br><br>The moment we see people falling into railway tracks, we deem it to be the government's concern, and plead for its involvement. Don't you think that had everyone the sense to keep away from the edge, they would be able to stop accidental deaths?<br><br>Now that we are afraid that people playing soccer in the void decks would hurt passer-bys, and urge the town councils to install nails to stop people from playing. Can't everyone just be satisfied with being told to do the sensible? It is like a fly which is determined to fly towards the fly paper even though it knows that the fly paper means certain death!<br><br>For every time we continue to depend on the government to protect us from ourselves, we make one major leap backwards in our development as a sensible society capable of making our own independent choices. That has been one of the reasons the PAP has managed to retain power: the promise to plan your life for you seems too irresistable to most.<br><br>Grow up, people!</div>
