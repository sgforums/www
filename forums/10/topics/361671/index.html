              <div id="p_title"><strong>The culture of shame should be revived</strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span>While a sense of shame is desirable in
                      public officials, shame should never lead anyone to end their own life,
                      as Roh so tragically did.<br><br>In his last posting on his website, on
                      April 22, Roh wrote, “You should now discard me.” He added: “I no
                      longer symbolize the values you pursue. I am no longer qualified to
                      speak for such things as democracy, progressiveness and justice.”
                      Before presenting himself for questioning by prosecutors, Roh told
                      reporters “I can't look you in the face because of shame. I apologize
                      for disappointing the people.”<br><br>These words have been repeatedly
                      quoted by Chinese netizens. In their eyes, Roh's strong sense of shame
                      is a contrast to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>overwhelming lack of shame </strong></span>among Chinese corrupted
                      officials and even in China's <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>society under the impact of the market
                      economy.</strong></span></span></div>
              <div><span><br>Recently, Fang Weigang, a local official in Guangzhou who
                      has been sentenced to years in prison for bribery and corruption, said
                      in a media interview that “the money given by the people shows their
                      respect for me.” Another corrupted official, Huang Peng, even said in
                      court it was his “personal hobby to hide big sums of money at home.”<br><br>At
                      the same time, many industries and professions in China are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>devoid of
                      self-blame and professional morality. Chinese people have a deep
                      resentment of this. </strong></span>Every industry and every person should have a
                      bottom line for what behavior is and is not acceptable.</span></div>

              <p>Minister Mentor Lee described as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“absurd” for Singaporeans to
              quarrel over the amount the ministers should be paid.</strong></span> “You know, the
              cure for all this talk is really a good dose of incompetent
              government,” he said.</p>
              <p>The total cost to pay ministers and other office holders is now at
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>S$46 million a year</strong></span>, which Lee said, amounted to about 0.13 per cent of
              the government’s total expenditure.</p>
              <p>“We are quarrelling about whether we should pay them S$46 million or
              S$36 million, or better still S$26 million. So you save S$20 million
              and jeopardise an economy of S$210 billion? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What are we talking about?”
              said Lee.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The proposed salary increase has attracted debate among Singaporeans who are against the move.</p>
              <p>But Lee told them: “I say you have no sense of proportion; you don’t
              know what life is about. And just think, what would your apartment be
              worth with a poor government and the economy down?”</p>
              <p>Asked on his salary,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Lee, said he earned S$2.7 million a year</strong></span> as Minister Mentor.</p>
              <p>“A top lawyer, which I could easily have become,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> today earns S$4
              million. </strong></span>And he doesn’t have to carry this responsibility. All he’s got
              to do is advise his client. Win or lose, that’s the client’s loss or
              gain.”</p>
              <p>On views that the ministers should be willing to make sacrifices and
              not to be there for the money, Lee said: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“Those are admirable
              sentiments, but we live in a real world.”</strong></span></p>
