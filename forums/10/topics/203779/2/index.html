            <div class='col-md body'>U feel the over population is due to the lack of land area in SG. and in HK u see the massive over crowded areas and small accomodations they are having is due to the reason that their land has too many mountainous areas. too many mountains for them to develop in.<br><br>thats y we feel that SG is over populated yet reports shows we are the 4th most dense country as compared to the rest of the world. less space results to less space to roam about.<br><br>the mrt squeeze is inevitable. so many ppl going work at the same time and the mrt can only be built to this size. its not hard to imagine the cramp.<br><br>shopping centers are displaying a sign of over population? if u are talking about tampines mall and century square or other heartland shopping centers. ask urself how big is the place actually? thats the reason for the cramp. town area u say? well think of the tourists we have here and seriously taka isnt really that big.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that Singapore is indeed having a problem of land scarcity, however the government has reclamated quite a lot of land, and who knows perhaps the government can keep reclamating and connect the main island with the surrounding small islands, thus making the living area much bigger. But even after this step, inevitably SG at some point will touch the neighbouring countries boundaries, and no more reclamation space to go, so at that time SG will see a big problem. Even now at this time, reclamation works is already meeting obstacles from Malaysia's objection and the international court decisions, not to mention the population also for some time already have to shrink themselves, as expressed in the declining birth rate.</div>
