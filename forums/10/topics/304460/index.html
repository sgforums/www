            <div class='col-md body'>weird weird..<br><br>can u guys open up ur mind a bit?<br><br>there's no critic of any religion here. since many of us are not from the same religion, most of us seek understanding.<br><br>again, this is a healthy forum and there is no critic that Muslim or Islam is bad religion or anything. Is that a problem for non-muslim to ask something that they dun understand ., the same goes to Muslim to ask why Chinese pray to what they called our God in temple a "doll or statue" ?<br><br>Honestly, from my experience in Malaysia, its always Malays to ask something bout our religion or God. Normal questions would be why are we praying to statue? Logically thinking we indeed praying to statue but religionly there is God inside it.<br><br>Yea, i had some muslims who asked me that question, i can either ask them back why are they praying to wall or i explain that the GOd is inside the statue.. its always depend on how u want to start flaming or anything.<br><br>Guys, chill out, no one is telling this religion is this or that..

It depends on your decision.<br><br>But hell yea, if u get married to a Malay, its a 100 % must to convert to muslim. If you dont, then better dont be with Malay gf.<br><br>Its normal.<br><br>Married a Muslim, u need to convert to Muslim and not otherwise.. Well, its their choice to convert again. Its not forced. The rules are simple here. U got a Muslim gf, then prepared to become Muslim if u planning to marry her. And there's just no way u can marry a  Muslim without u converting to Muslim 1st<br></div>

How many cases have we seen that non-Muslims have being discriminated against when the cases involved both Muslims and non-Muslims? Especially if the civil court decides to take its hand off and let the Islamic court judge.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> One simple case. A Chinese woman has being living the life of Christain all her life and want to change her religion status to Christain instead of Muslim. She is given the status Muslim since birth for whatever reason. However, civil court refused to entertain and push to the Islamic court. And you know Islamic court will almost never allow such convertion out of Islam (although the woman is never a Muslim to begin with).</div>
