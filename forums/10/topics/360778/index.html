              <p>Sunday, 17 May 2009</p>
              <p>Singapore Democrats</p>
              <p>The police have declared that no
                  licenses will be given for outdoor political events. This is no secret.
                  However, they have repeatedly avoided stating this stand in court.
                  Until now, that is.<br><br>Licensing officer Mr Yeo Kok Leong said in
                  court last week that the police would not issue a permit if they
                  received an application from a political party.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>He was testifying in the continuing
                  trial of five SDP members and activists (Mr Gandhi Ambalam, Ms Chee
                  Siok Chin, Mr Chong Kai Xiong, Mr John Tan, and Mr Charles Tan who is
                  away) who are charged with taking part in an illegal procession on 16
                  Sep 07 to mark the anniversary of the protest at the Speakers’ Corner
                  during the WB-IMF annual meetings in Singapore in 2006.<br><br>Under
                  cross-examination by Mr John Tan, Station Inspector Yeo said that even
                  if the defendants had applied for a permit for the procession, it would
                  not have been granted.<br><br>Mr Tan had cited a letter written by the
                  assistant director of media relations, DSP Paul Tay, that said that the
                  "police do not issue permit for outdoor political events in public
                  places, due to the potential for disorder and unruly behavior. This
                  applies to events organized by all political parties."</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Tan</strong>:
                  You are saying now, that if this outdoor event [16 Sep 07 anniversary
                  walk] is political, then sorry, no permit. Is that right?<br><br><strong>Yeo</strong>: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DSP Paul Tay issued a press statement that outdoor political party events will not be issued with a police permit. </strong></span>That's all.<br><br><strong>Tan</strong>: So you knew about this outlawing of political outdoor events, and in your routine practice, you are applying that?<br><br><strong>Yeo</strong>: Yes.<br><br><strong>Tan</strong>: Would it be correct to say that you know that the SDP is a political party?<br><br><strong>Yeo</strong>: Yes.<br><br><strong>Tan</strong>:
                  And so, if I as the assistant secretary-general of the SDP or any of
                  our members were to apply for an outdoor event, you would have said no?<br><br><strong>Yeo</strong>: Yes.<br><br><strong>Tan</strong>: Therefore in the trial today would it have made any difference if we had applied for a permit?<br><br><strong>Yeo</strong>:
                  There was no application received. If the application was received to
                  commemorate the first anniversary of the WB/IMF event, the police may
                  reject the application.<br><br><strong>Tan</strong>: Mr Yeo, can I suggest what you're saying that the police <em>would have</em> rejected, not just <em>may</em>, but <em>would have</em> rejected the application?<br><br><strong>Yeo</strong>: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We will reject the application.</strong></span><br></blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>This
                  is a significant admission by the licensing officer who had hitherto
                  refused to categorically state that he would not approve applications
                  for outdoor political events. <br><br>Mr Yeo, who processes all
                  applications for licences ranging from massage parlours to public
                  protests, has repeatedly evaded answering questions in the past about
                  whether he rejects applications just because they are outdoor political
                  events. In other cases, the judges disallowed the defence to ask the
                  licensing officer questions along this line. (Mr Yeo is also the
                  witness in the cases involving the distribution of flyers by SDP
                  leaders on 10 Sep 09 and the <em>Tak Boleh Tahan</em> protest on 15 Mar 08.)<br><br> In the present case, Mr Yeo only made his position clear because
                  District Judge John Ng had directed the officer to answer Mr John Tan's
                  questions.<br><br>It is spurious to charge citizens for not having a
                  permit to conduct a protest when no such permit will be granted. This
                  is basic common sense.<br><br>More than common sense, however, the law is very clear on such a matter. A policy to ban all outdoor political events is <em>ultra vires</em> (in excess of) the Constitution and should be void. <br><br>The
                  House of Lords, from which much of Singapore law is developed, has
                  stated unambiguously that "a man commits no crime if he infringes an
                  invalid byelaw" and that "it is open to a defendant to raise in a
                  criminal prosecution the contention of a byelaw or an administrative
                  act undertaken pursuant to it is <em>ultra vires</em> and unlawful and that if he establishes that he has committed no crime."<br><br>The hearing could not be completed with its alotted period (30 May - 15 Jun 09) and was adjourned to another set of dates.</p>

              <p>This is a prime example of the grand efforts of LKY's administration in the 1960s at bastardizing the Singapore Constitution with bye-laws that raped the original sanctity of the intent and spirit of the printed words.</p>
              <p>Under the guise of law and order to have an environment of peace to allow economic progress, draconian bye-laws were consistently passed by a One-Party dominated Parliament that swept common-sense for any checks and balance in Singapore.</p>
              <p>All the bye-laws passed in Parliament had been done without any objections - even as the PAP assured Singaporeans that their back-benchers will be more capable than any checks from any other political parties serving in Parliament.</p>
              <p>Nothing was ever mentioned that the PAP Parliamentary Whip will never allow their own PAP Backbenchers to vote according to their conscience, and every Member of Parliament from the PAP must follow the dictates of the PAP Central Committee.</p>
              <p>For 52 years, the Singapore experience has seen new laws being made without honest debate or the gathering of authoritative opinions from any relevant bodies - as LKY and his PAP see this as the sole prerogative of the PAP Government.</p>
              <p>Even the obligation of the Singapore Law Society towards its social responsibility role had been shut out of the legislative process, with their participation seen by LKY as a clear interference in politics and a political challenge to the Government.</p>

              <p>This is a prime example of the grand efforts of LKY's administration in the 1960s at bastardizing the Singapore Constitution with bye-laws that raped the original sanctity of the intent and spirit of the printed words.</p>
              <p>Under the guise of law and order to have an environment of peace to allow economic progress, draconian bye-laws were consistently passed by a One-Party dominated Parliament that swept common-sense for any checks and balance in Singapore.</p>
              <p>All the bye-laws passed in Parliament had been done without any objections - even as the PAP assured Singaporeans that their back-benchers will be more capable than any checks from any other political parties serving in Parliament.</p>
              <p>Nothing was ever mentioned that the PAP Parliamentary Whip will never allow their own PAP Backbenchers to vote according to their conscience, and every Member of Parliament from the PAP must follow the dictates of the PAP Central Committee.</p>
              <p>For 52 years, the Singapore experience has seen new laws being made without honest debate or the gathering of authoritative opinions from any relevant bodies - as LKY and his PAP see this as the sole prerogative of the PAP Government.</p>
              <p>Even the obligation of the Singapore Law Society towards its social responsibility role had been shut out of the legislative process, with their participation seen by LKY as a clear interference in politics and a political challenge to the Government.</p>

              yes, and like what lky said many years ago - after many many years of deprivation(repression) we would cease to realise the evil in it.

              <p>This piece of legislation has quite a few contradicting and conflicting interpretation that seems to be designed purposefully to sow confusion that will allow the law to be interpreted in any ways that suit the circumstances.</p>
              <p>This piece of law will only lead to a purposeful act to entrap Singaporeans as this confusing piece of legislation is purposefully drafted to be vague and allows for any interpretations that provides an all encompassing effect as needed by the Attorney-General working at the behest of the Government.</p>
