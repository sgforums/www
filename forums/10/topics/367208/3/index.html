              <p>That's what happens when you train people in english.</p>
              <p>All go off to the rich english speaking countries.</p>
              <p>It is his own doing the baba bastard.</p>
              <p>Harry Lee Kuan Yew, you are not one of the baba who adopted Hokkien as language, you are one of the baba who adopted ang moh english as language.</p>
              <p>It must be very shameful of you to be the odd one out in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Very insecure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Peranakans in Singapore have developed a language
                              called Baba Malay, essentially a Malay vernacular. Male Peranakans are
                              known as Baba and the females Nonya. The latter has been affectionately
                              used in describing Peranakan cuisines and fashion. 
                              However, as more Chinese immigrants flooded in at
                              the turn of the century, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Baba Malay rapidly lost out to the Chinese
                              dialects instead. The Hokkien dialect quickly became the adopted
                              language of the new generations.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>Lim Yew Hock was one of the baba who adopted hokkien as language.</p>
              <p>So the first chief minister of Singapore was a jew, David Marshall.</p>
              <p>The second chief minister was Lim Yew Hock, a baba.</p>
              <p>The first prime minister is another baba, Harry Lee.</p>
              <p>The hokkien leader Lim Chin Siong, they wiped out.</p>
              <p>So in Singapore, the majority hokkien dialect group never had a leader in power!</p>
              <p>Amazing.</p>
              <p>Amazing.</p>
              <p>No wonder that bastard wants to push for multicultural nation.</p>
              <p>He himself is from minority group.</p>
              <p>Harry Lee Kuan Yew, I am hokkien.</p>
              <p>I am still waiting for my hokkien prime minister.</p>
              <p>Goh Chok Tong and Ong Teng Cheong don't count.</p>
              <p>If Tony Tan came to power in 1990, that would be three babas in a row you know Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>Lim Yew Hock, Harry Lee, Tony Tan. All babas.</p>
              <p>You are not that politically stupid right Lee Kuan Yew?</p>
              <p>I see through you already lah Lee Kuan Yew.</p>

              <p>Nothing but a pile of dirty shit.</p>
