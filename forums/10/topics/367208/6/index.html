              <p>Hi! Homeless,</p>
              <p>HDB is not ridiculous No....... Never........ But Extremely Ridiiculous/ Hopeless &amp; Robotic only mah............</p>
              <p>That's the minimum and most courteous that I could think of to describe them!!!!</p>
              <p>FYI - I have my fair share of grouses with HDB &amp; I trust alot of other citizens could be in a similiar situation.</p>
              <p>I was retrenched in 2003, October. I know of the looming problems that I could face as I have stood guarantor for my ex Company's Bonds with PSA/ Insurance etc.</p>
              <p>I approached HDB, explained my situation to the counter staff and request to re-do my mortagge loan to a lower amount.</p>
              <p>This is to allow me more time to sort out my problems, get a new job and yet at the same time able to service my loan.</p>
              <p>However to my surprise, HDB refused to redo the loan as I still have more than 10K in my CPF.</p>
              <p>I explained that I can't wait for my CPF to go down to "0" as it would be too late and doing anything then is pointless!!!!</p>
              <p>They refused to listen and insist that I wait till my CPF go "0"!!!</p>
              <p>Fast forward to 2009; I just managed to get a full time job as I'm already in my late 40's. Yeah lah, that equates to a good 5 years on Temp jobs, loh!!</p>
              <p>HDB kept calling and hounding me over my outstanding loans. At one of my visits to HDB, one of the officers at the counter gave me wrong info that if I need another HDB loan for a smaller flat (I intend to downgrade). Then I need to write in to HDB resale and I was given the e-mail address to write to.</p>
              <p>"The kind officer" even warns me before hand that "it would take quite a long time for resale to answer.............."</p>
              <p>Hence I'm not surprised when after 5 e-mails and 6 weeks down the line; I still have no reply.</p>
              <p>My bigger surprise is when the officer whom have been calling me regards my outstanding loan; told me that I should approached him instead of resale!!!!</p>
              <p>Why the difference in advice????</p>
              <p>The next "boiling point" is when this officer told me to "meet up" &amp; discussed with him and to bring my employment letter so he can "work out" how much I can loan.</p>
              <p>I have all this while told him that his other colleague had claimed that I have purchased a resale flat previously &amp; thus can't have any further HDB loans.</p>
              <p>Imagine my anger when I met up with him; he just flatly refuse to bulge &amp; said I'm not eligible for any HDB loans!!!!</p>
              <p>I explained my situation to him that my proceeds plus my CPF returned are insufficient even for a 3 room.</p>
              <p>He insisted it's sufficient which I have again found out that it's not as a 3 room can easily cost S$220,000 minimum. My CPF return plus proceeds is only S$166,000 at most!!!!</p>
              <p>If the matter is not resolved, guess I will most probably end up on the streets with my son!!!!!</p>
              <p>As sleeping in parks, can cost us a S$200.00 fine!!!!</p>
              <p>If you asked me, HDB like any other civil service needs to replace robotic staff &amp; rules with a humane touch!!!!</p>

              <p>So don't misundestand that we asking free home. We only asking the governmnet to step in to help the average people, singles and the divorcee with children and without children. Not everyone who sold house make profit, try to understand us. Just there are some people who sold house to make money dosent mean that everyone doing that. only those are rich doing that. There are people who desparately looking a roof over their head. for the divorcee they have so many rules, cant buy flat direct form HDb if we no children under our custody, cant rent a flat within 30 months and also with no chidlren and must pay levy of 40k for those who used the grant to buy the previous house. Just iimgaine pay 40k plus the price of the house. it really costing a bomb, in the end up thru our life we will in debt with the government. All we earn will only go to payment for the house. I really don't ubdersatnd wher this going to end. those have house later sold make money go to another country is not singaporean la. the foriegners la.</p>

              <p>homeless said : I don't know whether HDB will treat my case as miscommunication case, because the branch head use the same reason to reply the MPs representing letters.</p>
              <p>======================</p>
              <p>Do you expect HDB to tell another story to MP? Or may be they have a different story but MP cannot reveal to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>homeless said : Let us wait and see whether I will get a reasonable reason from HDB</p>
              <p>Or get a reply that "The reason is Confidential" !!!</p>
              <p>Or I will get a more ridiculous reason!</p>
              <p>=======================</p>
              <p>May be the reply will be "your request is ridiculous" !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>_________________________________________________________________</p>
              <p>Why the tenant wanted to terminated the tenancy when there is a long Q waiting to rent?</p>
              <p>If the tenant is happy to move house then why the occupier can't take over? May be the occupier can observe whether the tenant is trying to delay to move house.</p>
              <p>If the tenant is trying to delay and delay again to move house then the tenant was definately forced by the HDB to terminated the tenancy!</p>
              <p>If the tenant was forced to terminated the tenancy then must be the tenant done some illegal things inside that unit or related to that unit and caught by HDB. But like that the HDB still can consider the occupier request if the occupier did not involved.</p>
              <p>If the occupier did not involved then I guess the another possible is HDB staff involved into the case, may be they made some mistakes so that HDB must take back this unit to cover up the mistake that made by the staff!</p>
              <p>If the HDB staff involved into the case and HDB need to cover it then it will be something like Wooden Block said "Or may be they have a different story but MP cannot reveal to you.". Am I right?</p>
              <p>If this is true then the occupier is innocent, I hope the occupier will post more what he/she knows because i am very curious that why a state board gave so ridiculous reason!</p>

              <p><strong>HDB always make people disappointed. Their reply is really not acceptable. They always want to close the case ONLY. Not helping people to solve problem. Service excellence all are fake.<br></strong></p>

              <p><strong>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Of course fake lor!! HDB officials where got heart to serve mere citizens. 1 officer advise different from the next. Like their "Big Bosses" - Make mistakes also don't apologised yet turn the barrel of the gun back at us mere citizens.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Same altitude, lah............</strong></p>
              <p><strong>For me, let me repeat, hor...........2003, October already retrenched (please refer to me earlier posts) as I don't want to bore those have read.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Up till now - how many solutions I offer to HDB - all reject!!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The latesr reply from HDB when I asked for another loan; they kept insisting that according to their Median prices - after I returned about 160K into my CPF account and the 16K profit I get is enough to buy 3 room!!!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>They refused to bulge even after I expalined till my thoat dry that all 3 rooms now selling is 220K &amp; above minimum.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I have a child with me who is still schooling; I just need an assurance that if I downgrade I will at least have a flat over our heads.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I'm not a beggar or asking for smypathy; I have my dignity. I don't want myself &amp; my son to end up like wanderers like what I read in the papers.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>On top of that I even asked HDB that if they have any balance small room flats; I don't mind to buy direct also as no matter how still cheaper than open market.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Their reply??? I must pay a resale levy of 50K even if my "profits" are only 16K and a bit more............they don't care!! No negiotiation at all................</strong></p>
              <p><strong>What they published in papers about how they helped the poor or those who faced financial problems all bullshit!!!!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I'm not asking for the sky but just to keep what little profit I have like 16K for a rainy day for my son's education but HDB is very firm if I buy a 3 room back to back with my sale of 5 room. They will take the profits + CPF to offset the purchase.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I'm already in my late 40's that's why it's so difficult to get a job; not that I'm lazy............</strong></p>
              <p><strong>What kind of Government do we have??? Talk to MP is no use......that's another "sad story" as far as I'm concerned.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I really give up hope............... to resolved anything with HDB...........I just drag............</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Moreever now I managed to get a job and already starting to pay them a few hundred a month thru my CPF.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>It's just that they claim I have outstanding and they can't revised my loan to lower amount due to the outstanding which I must clear 1st. So now become my problem not thier fault at first or problem............See the picture???</strong></p>
              <p><strong>May I asked HDB how did this come about????</strong></p>
              <p><strong>In 2003, even before my CPF runs out I already approached them, explain my situation and request for a "refinance" to a lower amount.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>They reject as I still have 10K in my CPF at that time now they have every right to twist their story to say I delay asking for help/ I did not speak to them to work out a lower amount..............</strong></p>
              <p><strong>In a nutshell like their "Big Bosses" up above - make mistakes - no apology yet turn the barrel of the gun back at mere citizens.................</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sounds familiar???? </strong></p>
