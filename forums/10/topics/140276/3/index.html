            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that, in order to solve the growing problem of kidney, liver or any another problem involving body organs malfunctioning, that we cannot just throw money in donation schemes and expect it 'to work it out by themselves'.<br><br>As I said, in order to reduce the growing numbers of kidney patients, then we must get to the bottom of it- which is the diet. This isn't rocket science. There have been examples of kidney patients who got it simply because they ate and drank too much rubbish since young.<br><br>A diet that is high in saturated fat, oil, sugar and salt and low in fiber, minerals, protein, monounsaturated fats and vitamins will cause problems in anybody in the long term. The problem is that more Singaporeans are slowly slipping down that route of unhealthy diets as we become more and more financially independent.<br><br>We do not want to go down the route of obese Americans. Neither should we escalate the problems of the kidney malfunctioning in Singapore- so if we want to reduce the number of kidney cases and also reduce the re-curring of kidney problems in those who have had it before, then we really have to address the main issue here- diet.<br><br>To do that we need not just govt. policies to encourage a pro-healthy lifestyle at work and at home, we also need the people to see our point of view. Besides who would want to spend the majority of their time sick when they can be enjoying time in work and with their families?</div>

I can't remember clearly, but the cards stated that we had to collect 'a minimum amount' - $10, I think... I can't remember. When we asked our teachers what would happen if we failed to get this 'minimum amount', they said that the school would get into trouble with NKF.<br><br>Then we, the students, would in turn get into trouble with the school.<br><br>What the ****.... We get into trouble for not 'giving enough' to charity? For goodness' sake - if every student in SG gets the same donation card, who the heck are they gonna solicit donations from?!?!?! Our parents!?!?! Not every kid in town is loaded, alright!?!? I myself had to skip meals sometimes just to buy lecture notes!!!<br><br>We were all so pissed off that we just gave this 'minimum amount' and washed our hands off the matter.<br><br>It sucks that I'm thinking badly of a charitable organization which has indeed done some good  - but the way I see it, NKF has a lot to answer for.</div></blockquote>They remove such conditions from the card liao.
