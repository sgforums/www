However, these programmes are expensive and unless people wish to go volunteer and put up their time to visit the schools and teach kids about animals and etc. Its not going to happen very fast.

Problem being, $2 - 3k for household income is like barely enough these days! Say you have 2 kids, elderly parents, a housing loan, a car loan, how much disposable income will you have left after subtracting all that? And prices keep going up in Singapore! So most families actually don't get any help from organisations and that is how they keep chalking up those obscene surpluses year after year!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the problem about kidney failure is also related to liver failure and the basis of it is actually your diet.<br><br>Basically if u have a healthy diet(eat lean red meats, fish(salmon, tuna etc), certain seafoods and lots of veggies and fruits, your chances of liver and kidney failure is reduced because your body produces less free radicals.<br><br>Free radicals are dangerous to the function of the organs in the body because it attacks the organs itself. It's produced in the midst of producing energy from food and in order to make sure that the amount is reduced, organs like the kidney and the liver will process it to reduce the amounts.<br><br>But even these organs are no robots and can fail if they are used excessively.<br><br>That's why people who have had drank loads of alcohol and ate a lot of unhealthy foods tend to have kidney and/or liver failure. So if we want to reduce the kidney failure rate of Singaporeans, then its time we start addressing the problem of diets in each and every Singaporean.<br><br>Once a majority of Singaporeans, young and old, start eating more healthly(and moderate their amount of unhealthy food) then maybe we don't need to continously throw money at huge money guzzling organizations like NKF.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by timothytsgsg:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually the problem about kidney failure is also related to liver failure and the basis of it is actually your diet.<br><br>Basically if u have a healthy diet(eat lean red meats, fish(salmon, tuna etc), certain seafoods and lots of veggies and fruits, your chances of liver and kidney failure is reduced because your body produces less anti-oxidants.<br><br>Antioxidants are dangerous to the function of the organs in the body because anti-oxidants attack the organs itself. It's produced in the midst of producing energy from food and in order to make sure that the amount is reduced, organs like the kidney and the liver will process it to reduce the amounts.<br><br>But even these organs are no robots and can fail if they are used excessively.<br><br>That's why people who have had drank loads of alcohol and ate a lot of unhealthy foods tend to have kidney and/or liver failure. So if we want to reduce the kidney failure rate of Singaporeans, then its time we start addressing the problem of diets in each and every Singaporean.<br><br>Once a majority of Singaporeans, young and old, start eating more healthly(and moderate their amount of unhealthy food) then maybe we don't need to continously throw money at huge money guzzling organizations like NKF. </div></blockquote>Anti-oxidants? You mean free radicals, don't you? Anti-oxidants mop up the harmful free radicals that cause mini chain reactions in the body, like what happens at nuclear power plants.</div>

I meant oxidants. Oxidants, aka free radicals are the ones which attack the body organs. Kidneys and the liver(to a certain extent) will reduce the amount of free radicals in the body but it isn't enough.<br><br>That's why doctors always ask pple to eat loads of veggies. Not just for vitamins and minerals but also to combat the production of free radicals in the body.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Better save the money for yourself cos Medisave already increased.<br>Very hard to qualify for NKF fund if u have cancer cos household income must not be more than $3K (1 think). They will tell u to tap your children's Medisave if u have exhausted your own.<br><br>Also why do they spend money on advertisements telling pple to go for cancer screening? The money saved can be used to  give free/subsidized pap smear &amp; mammogram for pple over 50.<br><br>By the way, who pays for foreign artistes to fly over to perform?<br>A lot of money spend on their accommodation, air tickets + performance fees.<br><br>NKF should give chance to smaller, little known charities who don't have budget to advertise on tv.

            <div class='col-md body'>I can still remember how NKF donation cards were forced onto us when I was a student. I can't remember clearly, but the cards stated that we had to collect 'a minimum amount' - $10, I think... I can't remember. When we asked our teachers what would happen if we failed to get this 'minimum amount', they said that the school would get into trouble with NKF.<br><br>Then we, the students, would in turn get into trouble with the school.<br><br>What the ****.... We get into trouble for not 'giving enough' to charity? For goodness' sake - if every student in SG gets the same donation card, who the heck are they gonna solicit donations from?!?!?! Our parents!?!?! Not every kid in town is loaded, alright!?!? I myself had to skip meals sometimes just to buy lecture notes!!!<br><br>We were all so pissed off that we just gave this 'minimum amount' and washed our hands off the matter.<br><br>It sucks that I'm thinking badly of a charitable organization which has indeed done some good  - but the way I see it, NKF has a lot to answer for.</div>
