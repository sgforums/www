Also look at the number of direct mails they send out every month and the charity shows.  Sure can get a good amount of contributions one.<br><br>Also, in their charity shows, they are very good at getting the sick children to cry in front of the cameras.  Like that, sure a lot of ppl get soft hearted and donate one.<br><br>But then hor... one point I would like to bring out, regardless of what NKF says....<br>Filming can be very tiring even to experienced actors and actresses.  Is it going to be too taxing for the cancer patients to talk and cry in front of the cameras?  After all, these ppl who are struck by fatal illnesses like cancer need a lot of rest.<br><br>And if you notice... they always like to bring their patients to the live shows.  Are these patients well enough to sit there for two hours watching the song and dance performances (sometimes dangerous stunts)??<br><br>In my opinion, I think it's even more cruel to tax on these patients just to beg for more donations, than us not donating at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Its just emotional blackmail... make people feel pity and part with $.  Some orgs rely on volunteer staff. Its more effective use of resource than to have the permanent staff.  Fact is SPCA didn't have good marketing department and didn't review their fund raising and public education. But instead of getting permanent staff in for marketing/public relations, they source current member's suggestions. I am happy to tell them straight on what worked and what didn't. And they changed based on that. And my suggestions are free.<br><br>I just felt uncomfortable with the manner NKF is handling things and the way certain reports came about. To me, I feel there's some dishonest elements plus the number of people they actually help is not that great. So I am never interested in enriching a corporation even in the name of helping people. I believe I can do more if my money goes elsewhere.  Besides, I don't believe in what they are doing, creating more funds to help more sick people (which is cyclic for them to have another excuse to ask for more funding and cash from the public). I believe in stemming the current unhealthy lifestyle choices which gives people the quality of life.<br><br></div>

I think when its handled by the hospital, its more effective.<br>Research is really needed to find better meds for ills.<br>I feel we had a good discussion. Actually people, you know you want to donate, if you walk to an AXS stattion, you can use that "communittee" tab to donate to the charity of choice.  I've not explored all the items in there...

Should be much higher than that.<br><br>I know they are quite generous in paying.  At least that's what they offered to me, every year.  I just anyhow humtum a figure that I want cuz I am not keen in their job, they will just say yes/ok (they are very desperate, like that).  Dunno why and how they got my number.  Every year, they seem to be recruiting and I keep receiving their phone calls at least once a year.<br><br>Now they know that ppl are very put off by their contract based jobs.  They now offer jobs with no contract for the first six months, after which they will sign a 3 year bond with you (last time was only 2 years).  But in any case, any party terminate the contract, the employee has to pay.  In other words, they sack you, you still have to pay.  Pay either the salary or the money they spend on courses for you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, I think this money is not enough for the needys.
