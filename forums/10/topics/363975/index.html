              <p>The Malaysian Insider, 13 Jun 2009<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>LKY remark sparks blame game in Penang </strong></span><br> <br> GEORGETOWN, June 13 — <span style="color: red;"><strong>Lee Kuan Yew’s visit
              to Penang has sparked a blame game between Gerakan and DAP over the
              island’s infrastructure, after Singapore’s minister mentor commented
              that Ipoh and Seremban were moving ahead of the island.</strong></span><br> <br> Chief minister Lim Guan Eng tried to lay the blame on his predecessor,
              Tan Sri Koh Tsu Koon, for “18 years of graceful decline” and called on
              federal support for remedial measures after his meeting with
              Singapore’s former prime minister.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>But just hours later, Koh finished his own
              discussion with Lee and expressed surprise that the minister mentor had
              focused on the condition of the roads in comparison to Ipoh.</strong></span><br> <br> The Gerakan president refuted claims that it was the fault of Barisan
              Nasional (BN) during his tenure as chief minister, as Pakatan Rakyat
              (PR) has been in government for over a year while BN had only recently
              taken over Perak after engineering the defections of assemblymen back
              in February.<br> <br> “Most of the roads here are administered by the state government or
              municipal council. PR has been in government in Perak and Penang since
              March 2008 but BN has been in charge in Ipoh for just a few months,”
              Koh said, referring to Lee’s assessment that Ipoh was doing better than
              Penang.<br> <br> He also called on Lim to deliver on his promises to make wireless
              internet connection in Penang widely available while claiming that the
              move to supply broadband internet connection was started by his
              administration.<br> <br> However, Koh agreed with the appeal by Lim, DAP’s secretary-general,
              for federal support as it was something recognised even by Tun Dr Lim
              Chong Eu who was chief minister before Koh.<br> <br> ----------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>More at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a></strong>:<br> <br> 1.

              <p><strong>Lee Kuan Yew Apologizes for Remarks That Angered Malaysia</strong></p>
              <h6 class="byline">By Michael Richardson</h6>
              <p>Published: Friday, March 14, 1997</p>
              <p>Seeking to prevent a serious rift in relations with Malaysia, Lee Kuan
              Yew, Singapore's senior minister,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> apologized "unreservedly" Thursday
              for remarks that brought a storm of protest from Malaysians.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The public apology was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a rare act for Mr. Lee</strong></span>, a tough and often
              outspoken former prime minister from 1959 to 1990 who remains a
              powerful figure in Singapore.</p>
              <p>"The senior minister had no
              intention to cause offense and apologizes unreservedly for the offense
              he has caused to the government and people of Malaysia by his statement
              on Johor," a statement from Mr. Lee's press secretary said.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mr.
              Lee said in a recent affidavit for a libel case that the Malaysian
              state of Johor, which is linked to Singapore by a causeway, was<span style="color: #ff0000;"> "notorious for shootings, muggings and carjackings."</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>Analysts said that the strength of the protests in Malaysia threatened to damage relations unless an apology was forthcoming.</p>
              <p>Most
              of Singapore's water and much of its food comes from Malaysia. Although
              the two countries have close ties and cooperate in some areas, there is
              increasing economic rivalry between them.</p>
              <p>Analysts said that Mr. Lee's derogatory reference to Johor touched a sensitive nerve in Malaysia...</p>
