              <p>Back when Singapore was still a developing nation, life on a general basis was affordable and national identity was strongly fostered among the people. In the population of 2.5 million before 1990, and everyone can afford a decent and pleasant standard of living, trust was deeply rooted into the PAP government because they indeed knew what was best back then.</p>
              <p>Today in 2010, can we still say PAP still knows best?</p>
              <p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-27522" title="CPF Interest Rate" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/CPF-Interest-Rate-300x147.jpg" alt="CPF Interest Rate" width="300" height="147">Let’s take CPF for example. Gone were the days of high CPF interest rates during Lee Kuan Yew’s times where interest rate peaked at 6.5% even when Singapore was still a developing country. But today in a fully developed nation context, our CPF’s interest rates has been stuck at a pitiful 2.5% ever since the beginning of Lee Hsien Loong’s leedership. The resulting effect of a low CPF interest rate translates into low HDB housing loan rate(presently at 2.6%) which in turn contributed to overpriced HDB Public Housings where our young couples have been put into hefty 40 years mortgage debts with.</p>
              <p>The PAP has flopped big time when it comes to tackling low birth rate and their constant denial of recognizing overpriced housings have deterred and delayed marriages certainly does not reflect wisdom and responsibility in the decision-making process of public policies. In simple terms, the PAP is the last party anyone who have family plans in their mind.</p>
              <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-27523" title="earnings vs foreign population" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/earnings-vs-foreign-population-300x184.jpg" alt="earnings vs foreign population" width="300" height="184">Another area where the PAP government has crashed miserably is the influx of Foreigners. Aside from pricing out Singaporeans in housing, the Foreigners here have also contributed to a depression of wages. Real earnings among Singaporeans have taken a hit ever since the PAP government relaxed Singapore’s Immigration and Manpower Policies since 2000. Singapore used to only have a 3million population in the 1990s, but today, it has exploded to 5million in less than 20 years in today, 2010. PAP Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong even targeted Singapore’s Population to a ridiculous 6.5million by 2030. Public Transport are overcrowded, public infrastructures are overstressed and education institutes like government subsidized universities, NUS and NTU, are already keeping Singaporean students out to fulfill their minimum 20% Foreign Students quota.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are increasingly sidelined by the PAP and condemned as 2nd class citizens especially for NS men who have to go through National Slavery. For example, the recent winning of Table Tennis Championship seems only to be celebrated by PAP and the foreigners. No true blue Singaporeans will ever do the traitorous move to call these players Singaporeans, because we all know they are no Singaporeans; they are mercenaries at best just like the Gurkhas.</p>
              <p>Our National Identity has been diluted no thanks to the present PAP administrations. $10 million Integration Fund has been set aside for the foreigners while our elderly and poor take to streets, peddling tissue papers or collecting aluminium cans from rubbish bin to rubbish bin.</p>
              <p>Despite such pressing issues and urgency, Singapore’s Opposition Parties are still currently incapable of forming the next Government. They can’t promise us GST cuts, reduction of Foreigners, reduction of Public Transport fares, increase in welfare, increase in affordability or whatsoever. But rest assured, so long we Singaporeans vote the Opposition Candidates in, we have One More Voice for the People, instead of yet another sleeping yes-man.<br>Vote for Change, vote the PAP out</p>
