            <div class='col-md body'>Dr. Vivian Balakrisnan has asked Singaporeans who complainted about high costs this question- can you help us to provide a solution.<br><br>Very simple solutions to the high cost problem are many such as the following:-<br><br>(A) SET UP A PROPER AND OBJECTIVE BASIS OF CHARGES OF ALL GOVERNMENT FEES AND HDB SALE FLATS ETC.:-<br><br>(1) Taxes - apportion the personal and corporate taxes, GST, COEs, and vehicle and petrol taxes etc into portion used to fund essential government services and portion for long-term investments<br><br>(2) Rewrite all basis of accounting to avoid hidden costs of accumulation of investment gains so that such gains are returned to offset costs  e.g. lands acquired by HDB or JTC or government for public housing etc should not have been handed over to SLA and sold back to HDB and JTC and allow them to charge for lands again already owned by people at market prices.<br><br>(3) Utility fees should be computed based on consumption items e.g. oil, wages, overheads, materials, parts and not including land or building rentals or infrastructure depreciation (fixed assets like land were acquired by government and paid from tax payers surpluses)<br><br>Disclose the full sets of accounts without creative accounting so that all the hidden gains and costs should be presented for scrutiny by anyone interested and by an independent panel.<br><br>(A) Try the following Three alternatives before proposing any fee increases:-<br><br>(1)  Cut costs and use cost saving to pay for expected increases.<br><br>(2)  Remove land rentals, fixed asset costs and infrastructure costs already paid by taxpayers upon acquisition and construction and all surpluses from asset appreciations shown in accounts prior to corporations of government into GLCs etc to return them to consumers.<br><br>(3) Increase only as a final resorts to cover consumption items or wages after removing non-consumption items amply provided by budget and off-budget statutory surpluses and national reserve. (with provision that in event of surpluses they should be passed back to all citizens to lower fees and not give rebates to only the lower income groups which so far only lead to more problems to the middle and lower-middle income groups who are already citizens and not doing that well now because of joblessness.<br><br>Do not govern by creative accounting as happened in Enron, Worldcom, CAO etc and NKF by quietly accumulating assets and surpluses.<br><br>Pass 50% of these accumulated gains to pay for fixed assets and infrastructure and other capital costs.<br><br></div>

(with provision that in event of surpluses they should be passed back to all citizens to lower fees and not give rebates to only the lower income groups which so far only lead to more problems to the middle and lower-middle income groups who are already citizens and not doing that well now because of joblessness.<br><br>Do not govern by creative accounting as happened in Enron, Worldcom, CAO etc and NKF by quietly accumulating assets and surpluses.<br><br>Pass 50% of these accumulated gains to pay for fixed assets and infrastructure and other capital costs.<br><br></div></blockquote>It seems they only ask for asking sake, cause when people do provide they will shoot down every proposal, suggestion, and or solution. Because they can't be seen as incompetent such that they need public ideas!<br><br>Since when in Singapore's history, have they EVER taken any public suggestions? Seriously I mean...<br><br></div>
