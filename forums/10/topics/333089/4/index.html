              <p>With the Foreign Reserves managed by the GIC and Temasek, and invested in the many questionable high risks ventures as publicly seen since 2006, can there be any left to help Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Even prior to all these investments made since 2006, the Government had been reluctant to open the Reserves to help Singaporeans during the recession of 2002, 1997 currency crisis, and 1987 economic downturn.</p>
              <p>This current recession has been brought about by this Government since 2007, as much as its appearance had been accelerated by the events unfolding in New York's Wall Street.</p>
              <p>With GST of 7 per cent implemented on 1 July 2007, the economy had turned more sluggish when it was already trending downwards since 2006.</p>
              <p>With the cost of living worsening as shown in the published consumer price index, it was already causing a tightening of domestic consumption, as well as causing business costs to go up - even when wage increases were kept under control by a Government controlled Wage Council.</p>
              <p>To make matters worst, despite a healthy Balance Sheet and Profit Performance for the preceding year - with healthy reserves - the Government Linked Companies had to feed their greed by demanding increases in all the various rates charged for the consumption of essential services and utilities that are all controlled by these GLCs.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should ask ourselves whether we can believe our Ministers are the Top Talent that the PAP has claimed to be deserving of the Million Dollar paid for their supposed talent - when they are mis-managing our political system, as much as they are mis-managing our economy.</p>
              <p>It is easy to operate and manage a political system that mirror the image of the Stalinist-Communist Political System with the aid of Internal Security Agents; while claiming to be operating in an Open Market Economy.</p>
              <p>The Singapore "Open Market Economy" is heavily dependent on the heavy hand of the government - with legislations to prevent local private investors from competing with the Government Linked Companies, or to legislate laws allowing these pseudo-Private Companies to charged the rates necessary to make the returns to the capital provided by the Government.</p>
              <p>Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that Singapore take the pole position in experiencing recession before even Japan make any declaration to such a state.</p>

              <p><br>u definitely should worry more than ever before. But caution. Worrying weakens you as it saps away your energy and life. You grow older faster. Your libido lowers. your taste buds dont function as well as before due to stress. You eat less and sleep less if not lower quality.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, influx continues at a pace never seen before, like 10 years before.</p>
              <p>Why not? Remind you, ah gong said "No one owes you a living" , you break your rice bowl, that are you's parsah.</p>
              <p>Employers look at bottomline and that means they always choose the cheaper labour.</p>
              <p>But dont worry too many much. I keep myself optimistic by dreaming of more good years.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The Casino will not be delay, it will open as per planned, if really got no foreigner coming in, we still have the domestic market to rely on, we shall then have 4 color cards for Ah ma and ah gong, matchstick game for local workers, Big and Small cau lag dices for the public and Foreign workers and finally, most important, Singapore Mahjong for the elites and public.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the circle line, even if it fail to complete in time, dun worry, we still hv circus tracks and circus show to entertain the crowd.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the downturn, actually it is an opportunity for Singaporeans, the injection of foreign workers need more dormitories, our Singaporeans can work as electricians, maintenance technician, toilet installation, toilet cleaners, room service chambermaid and man, we also need dormitories managers, accountants and food suppliers.</p>

              <p><br>Nah, i disagree, some people are real hardworking, it is not a matter of laziness, it is the matter of smartness. By average, in this world 2,000 poors men bring up 1 rich man, and with the cash in hand, he manipulated the poors into division of labour for him, from MD down to workers and general toilet cleaners. He will do his upmost to depress the poors further so that he get richer, for without more poor, how can he get richer??</p>
