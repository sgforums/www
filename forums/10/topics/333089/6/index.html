              <p>The only way Singapore is going to come out of this recession is if the global economy recovers quickly.</p>

              <p>That said, I am still of the view that the casinoes won't do much good if foreign tourists are not coming to spend.  And if that happens, you employ so many people at the IR for what? Swat flies? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Now is the time to decide what are liabilities and and what are assets and do what we have to do. Not to skimp on spending but to spend more on our assests to grow it further.</p>

              <p><br>We do wanted to spend, but the increment of prices of goods prohibit us to spend more. If I earn 10k per month, formerly i spend 8K per month on Goods and services, now i hv to spend 11k for the same Goods and services due to increment of goods and services here and there, what should i do, of course I have to be conservatives and save. Therefore it is not that we do not want to spend but the enviroment and the govt money policies forced me to save for the rainy days.</p>

              <p><br>Actually, their spending would help. Think of the hotel industry - chambermaids, waiters, etc. Without such, the end begins.</p>
              <p><br>Similarly, if your company is confident of weathering the financial storm, it should continue to send its assets - you - for retreats and seminars to further groom your productivity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Every dollar or even cents count in these times to keep the economy going.</p>
              <p><br>Of course, i would agree that friviolous spending should be out. As said, it is vital for individuals and companies to determine now what are their liabilities and assets. For example, cathode ray tube tvs are out. Companies dealing in such better off release their workers and close down the company or retool with another product to stay relevant.</p>
