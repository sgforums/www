              <p class="head">Singapore becomes the first Asian victim of recession</p>
              <p><br> <span>AFP, SINGAPORE </span><br> Saturday, Oct 11, 2008,  Page 1 
              Singapore has become the first Asian economy to fall into recession,
              analysts said yesterday, after the government revised downward its
              full-year growth estimate and eased monetary policy for the first time
              in years.<br><br> The Ministry of Trade and Industry lowered the city-state’s full-year
              growth forecast to around 3 percent, citing a slowdown in the global
              economy and key domestic sectors.<br><br> The move came as the ministry released preliminary data showing that
              real GDP declined by 6.3 percent in the third quarter after contracting
              5.7 percent in the previous quarter, the ministry said.<br><br> While it did not describe the economy as being in recession, a
              technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of
              contraction in economic output.<br><br> “Singapore will be the first Asia economy to fall into a technical
              recession,” DBS Group Research said in an assessment of the data.<br><br> In a move to confront the downturn, the Monetary Authority of Singapore
              (MAS) — its de facto central bank — said it was easing monetary policy
              for the first time in more than four years.<br><br> “The Singapore economy has weakened over the course of 2008, alongside
              an escalation in the turmoil in financial markets and a more severe
              deceleration in global economic activity,” MAS said.<br><br> These developments meant new uncertainties for the Singapore economy,
              while slower Asian growth would restrain activity in a range of service
              industries such as transportation and tourism, it said.<br><br> “The risks to external demand conditions continue to be on the downside
              and a more severe global downturn cannot be discounted,” the bank said.<br><br> Singapore is Southeast Asia’s wealthiest economy in terms of GDP per
              capita, but is heavily dependent on trade. This makes it sensitive to
              hiccups in developed economies, particularly key export markets the US
              and Europe.<br><br> Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 0.3 percent
              quarter-on-quarter rise in GDP, the value of goods and services
              produced in the economy.<br><br> Compared with the third quarter of last year, the ministry said
              Singapore’s economy contracted by 0.5 percent in real terms, against
              the 0.8 percent expansion foreseen in the Dow Jones poll.</p>

              eased monetary policy on Friday for the first time since 2003 after the

              Reuters poll.<br><br>Singapore last slid into a recession -- usually defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contractions -- in 2002.<br><br>The
              government also revised down its 2008 growth forecast to around 3
              percent on Friday from an earlier estimate of 4 to 5 percent.<br><br>Economists
              said the looser monetary policy will cushion the headwinds Singapore's
              economy faces from the worsening crisis, but the economy could be stuck
              in recession in the fourth quarter, and in the first half of next year.<br><br>"Looking
              at how fast construction is slowing, given services is slowing, and the
              fact that the global economy is going in a downwards spiral, it is
              quite likely Q4 will remain in negative territory," said Selena Ling,
              head of treasury research at OCBC. "Quite possibly, first half of next
              year will remain in recession," she said.<br><br>Singapore's central
              bank sets policy by managing the Singapore dollar in a secret
              trade-weighted band against a basket of currencies, instead of setting
              interest rates.<br><br>A looser policy will allow the currency to rise
              at a slower pace, and the currency should trade at the lower-end of the
              band as growth slackens, analysts said.<br><br>"Against the backdrop of
              a weakening external economic environment and continuing stresses in
              global financial markets, the growth of the Singapore economy is
              expected to remain below potential in the period ahead," the central
              bank said on Friday.<br><br>"MAS is therefore shifting its policy
              stance to a zero percent appreciation of the S$NEER policy band," it
              said in its twice-yearly policy review statement.<br><br>The Singapore
              dollar rose to 1.4724 per U.S. dollar after the central bank's
              announcement compared to 1.4780 before as traders adjusted positions
              after the widely anticipated policy easing. It soon pared gains.<br><br>Singapore
              is the first Asian country to fall into a recession since the crisis
              started. Japan is teetering on one, and New Zealand slid into a
              recession in the second quarter for the first time in more than a
              decade.<br><br>The unfolding global financial crisis, the worst since
              the 1930s, has prompted central banks across the world from the United
              States to China to loosen policy to avoid a global recession.<br><br>Singapore
              is the first country in Asia to report quarterly gross domestic output
              data for the third quarter, and its heavy dependence on trade makes the
              $165-billion economy a good gauge of the impact of the crisis on the
              rest of Asia. Singapore, like most other Asian countries, depends on
              the world -- especially the United States and Europe -- to buy its
              exports and keep its economy growing.<br><br>But the worsening crisis
              has dented global demand for Asian exports. Singapore's non-oil
              domestic exports, worth about 70 percent of the economy last year, fell
              on an annual basis in June, July and August.</p>

              <p>i dun see why singapore will not be badly hit by this global credit crisis.. singapore is an export economy mainly to US, UK, Japan as well as China. If you look deeper into the export figures, US and UK take up easily 40% of the goods exported from sg.</p>
              <p>Now these countries not longer demand so many imports and protectism will set in to protect their own local industries and employment.. sg will definitely be hit hard... Majority of the workforce in the manufacturing sectors will be lay-off as orders falls and coys have to reduce operating cost..</p>
              <p>ppl in the financial industry will also experience lay-off as foreign banks r trimming off excess fat to cut cost or outsource to cheaper countries like india etc...</p>
              <p>with more citizens being laid off or fearing of being laid off.. consumer spending falls.. hence hurt the retail sectors... and the spiralling effect goes on... affecting housing, etc...</p>
              <p>having annual gdp growth of 3% is a  v optimistic estimate.. if this credit crunch continues.. 4Q08 export and gdp data will be extremely ugly and its not surprise if we see a flat or -ve gdp for 2008..</p>
              <p>brace yourself to survive thru this recession.. if things get worsen.. i foresee a more gloomy pic ahead... drawing reference to the 1897 and 1930 great depression.. we are having the same problem brewing... and this time round more lethal as everything is leveraged.. the danger of leveraging is that once the deleveraging process kick in.. its going to be rapid and destructive cos' everything is magnified and noone can control the magnitude of such unwinding...</p>

              <div id="widgetInsert" class="p"><strong>LONDON - Pessimism about prospects for the global economy rose sharply in October, according to Merrill Lynch's monthly fund-manager survey. </strong></div>
              </div>
              <div class="StoryBottom">
              <div class="p">The number of managers stating that they believe the global economy is already in recession jumped to 69% in October, the survey showed, up from 44% in September.</div>
              <div class="p">As well, a net 60% of managers believe that the global economy will weaken over the next 12 months, up from 37% in September.</div>
              <div class="sidebarChart" style="padding: 7px;"><a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/intchart.asp?symb=SPX"></a></div>
              <div class="p">Corporate profits are expected to weaken over the same time frame, 74% of managers said, up from a reading of 68% a month ago. A net 87% of managers say corporate operating margins will shrink, up from 79% taking this view last month.</div>
              <div class="p">The survey for October is one of the most pessimistic ever, in a month when fund managers lost faith in global growth, commodities, China's economy and emerging markets.</div>
              <div class="p">Nervousness grew against a backdrop of dramatic political and financial events.</div>
              <div class="p">In the past few weeks, governments around the world acted to shore up the financial system, while central banks instigated a coordinated interest rate cut last week.</div>
              <div class="p">A net 59% of managers said that they believe monetary policy is still too restrictive. This compares with 29% holding this view in September.</div>
              <div class="p">Meanwhile, 72% of managers say that short-term interest rates will be lower in 12 months time, compared with a reading of 51% a month ago.</div>
              <div class="h3">Cash positions up</div>
              <div class="p">Markets have been on a wild ride over the past few weeks as hope that the plans to bail out banks vied with fear over how the global economy will hold up.</div>
              <div class="p">More managers moved into cash in October, the survey showed, with average cash balances rising to 5.3% from 4.8% a month ago.</div>
              <div class="p">The number of managers that are overweight cash increased to 49%, from 36% in September.</div>
              <div class="p">Still, with stock prices falling dramatically - European shares dropped 20% last week - more managers believe that share prices are undervalued.</div>
              <div class="p">A net 43% took the stance that global equity markets are undervalued, up from 15% a month ago. The latest figure is a 10-year high.</div>
              <div class="p">"Fund managers are waiting for the triggers that will give them the confidence to buy," said Gary Baker, head of EMEA equity strategy at Merrill Lynch.</div>
              <div class="p">"What they are looking for is a loosening of monetary conditions and for third-quarter earnings to clarify where problems and opportunities lie across equity markets," he said.</div>
              <div class="p">Over the month, mangers lifted their overweight on cash to 56%, from 40%, and raised their overweight on bonds to 17%, from 4%. They were more negative on equities, going from a 37% net underweight to a 45% net underweight.</div>
              <div class="h3">Regional detail</div>
              <div class="p">Managers' overweight on U.S. equities fell to a net 18% in September, from a net 26% a month ago.</div>
              <div class="p">Underweight positions on eurozone equities increased to a net 41%, from a net 36% in September, while underweight positions on Japanese equities decreased to a net 9%, from a net 23% a month ago.</div>
              <div class="p">The outlook for corporate profits is most favorable in the U.S., a net 29% of managers believe, compared with 34% taking this view a month ago.</div>
              <div class="p">Managers became more positive on the prospects for Japanese corporate profits, with a net 7% stating that the country has the most favorable outlook for profit growth, up from 2% a month ago.</div>
              <div class="p">The euro zone is still the region with the least favorable outlook for corporate profits, a net 30% of managers believe. This is unchanged from last month.</div>
              <div class="p">"Europe has now assumed the U.K.'s mantel as the world's least popular destination for equity investment," said Karen Olney, lead European equities strategist at Merrill Lynch.</div>
              <div class="p">"Against this backdrop of fear over profits and recession, investors are selling expensive, highly cyclical industrials and opting instead for stable dividends and capital preservation," said Olney.</div>
              <div class="p">A total of 172 asset allocators managing a total of $531 billion in funds participated in the survey. <img src="http://i.mktw.net/mw3/News/greendot.gif" alt="End of Story" width="10" height="10"></div>

              <p>Actually the growth rate posted by lionnoisy, a large portion of it is inflationary growth, shifts in the LM curve of the IS-LM to the left. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The GDP growth posted by Singstat is not GDP per capita growth. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i.e. If initially you had 100 workers, you produced $100,000 GDP, therefore GDP per capita of $1,000. Then you import 200 workers, you produced $180,000 GDP, therefore a GDP per capita of $900. The GDP per Capita decrease while the GDP increased. In part some of the growth is due to shifts in the LM curve to the left, because an increased in foreigner population competing for resources like housing, this short term increase in demand caused a steep increase in the cost of housing and concomitantly other resources.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a difference between GDP and GDP per Capita, but of course our blind P4P follower lionnoisy knows not the difference or tries to hoodwink anybody stupid enough. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>After reading that Singapore was the first to fall into a technical recession, do you still believe what the people at the top are telling the ordinary citizens?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those living in the ivory towers have no clue as to the hardships borne by the common folk during the so called "boom" in the economy, let alone during a recession where things will be much much worse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really dread to see how the economy will hold up against the backdrop of a global slowdown.</p>
