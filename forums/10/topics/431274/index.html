              <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
              <p>Member of Parliament <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=lim+wee+kiak&amp;#38;fr=fp-today&amp;#38;cs=bz"><span style="color: #005790;">Lim Wee Kiak</span></a> of the Nee Soon group representation constituency has apologised for his remarks linking ministerial pay with the "dignity" of politicians.</p>
              <p>In a note on his Facebook page on Friday, MP Lim said he would like to clarify the comments he made to <em>Lianhe Zaobao</em> and reproduced in <em>LianheWanBao</em>. The comments had been quickly slammed by netizens.</p>
              <p>He had been quoted by the Chinese paper last week as saying, "If the annual salary of the Minister of Information, Communication and Arts is only $500,000, it may pose some problems when he discuss policies with media CEOs who earn millions of dollars because they need not listen to the minister's ideas and proposals. Hence, a reasonable payout will help to maintain a bit of dignity."</p>
              <p>In his Facebook note, the MP said, "I withdraw those remarks and apologise for making them. Dignity cannot be and must not be measured purely in monetary terms."</p>
              <p>He said he agreed that the example he gave and his comment that there may be loss of face if the minister's salary is low "is inappropriate and incorrect".</p>
              <p>Noting that ministerial pay is a sensitive issue and one that many are concerned about, he said he would like to clarify his comments by making three fundamental points. We have re-posted them below in full:</p>
              <p>1. We need a balanced approach to the question of Ministerial pay.</p>
              <p>2. Personally, I think we should not use pay and perks to attract capable people to come forward to serve. I agree with PM that there is a service to country element and an element of sacrifice expected for the Ministers by the public.</p>
              <p>3. On the other hand, we need to take into consideration their responsibilities and job scope when we remunerate Ministers.</p>
              <p>The multi-million dollar pay of ministers was a hot-button issue in Singapore's recent General Election, which saw the ruling People's Action Party win 81 out of 87 seats but at a significantly lower share of the total votes.</p>
              <p>Following the results, Prime Minister <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=lee+hsien+loong&amp;#38;fr=fp-today&amp;#38;cs=bz"><span style="color: #005790;">Lee Hsien Loong</span></a> announced the formation of a committee to review the "basis and level of political salaries". Any pay changes would take effect from 21 May this year.</p>
              <p>In reaction to MP Lim's earlier remarks on ministerial pay, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/weekiak/posts/122048304544317"><span style="color: #005790;">Francis Oen</span></a> posted on Facebook: "Hi Wee Kiat.. Suggest you clarify your statement. Does it mean that only $ talks?! ... And if someone earns less, does it mean he cannot have dignity?"</p>
              <p><a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/wynlim"><span style="color: #005790;">Winnie Lim</span></a> tweeted: "So according to Dr Lim Wee Kiak's theory, our ministers will ignore Obama because he earns less than all of them."</p>
              <p>On his <a href="http://en-gb.facebook.com/weekiak"><span style="color: #005790;">Facebook</span></a> page, Dr Lim earlier said that his quote was taken out of context.</p>
              <p>"Minister's pay issue is a sensitive one. There must be a balance. After all, capable individuals who are willing to come forward to serve should not so because of pay and perks," he replied to a user's question about his quote.</p>
              <p>He added, "On the other hand, they do have families and dependents and need to consider for retirement, etc."</p>

              <p>No lar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just that 10, 20 years back, when they made such mistakes, the public didn't really make such a big hoo ha out of them because life in general was still ok.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now with the massive housing, wage, income gap, public transport, social and economic problems that have hit the majority of the population, many people just can't take it anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Furthermore, they decided to reward themselves with huge pay increases even though they made so many mistakes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People just became very buay song because there was just no justification.  Would you pay so much tax to fund their salaries when they made your life so much worse?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
