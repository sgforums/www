              <p>Well actually he didnt say anything wrong what......</p>
              <p>What he said is true......</p>
              <p>Someone's pay or someone's socioeconomic status would determine someone's social status and pecking order.</p>
              <p>I believe it is true that someone who is less paid would be taken less seriously / has less status and respect, compared to someone who is paid higher.</p>
              <p>What is wrong with that. He just pointed it out.</p>
              <p>What he said is true and is concise.</p>
              <p>Of course his mistake is openly saying it out, and he immediately get lynched by the mob. And then he apologized, which is also a good deed.</p>

              <p>Wait a minute, wait a minute......I want to seriously challenge these whole ministers pay hoohaa business........</p>
              <p>I feel that the people who are objecting to it, are really barking up the wrong tree.</p>
              <p>And I stand with what I said, that the MP didnt say anything wrong.</p>
              <p>What he said is correct 100%.</p>
              <p>What did he say wrong ?</p>
              <p>Ok, lets say ministers pay is severely reduced......and then when he goes to meetings......sit across company bigwigs.....and talk to them......would those big bosses take him seriously ? Or would they just think he is a troublesome little bureaucrat and dont respect him.</p>
              <p>I feel that the whole ministers pay objection thing is a serious and fundamental mistake.</p>
              <p>A high ministers pay is NOT a disadvantage but an advantage. It is not a negative but a positive.</p>
              <p>Why would you want to remove a positive asset that you have in the system and then replace it with an inferior one.</p>
              <p>That doesnt make sense ??</p>
              <p>Ok look at it this way.</p>
              <p>How about the salary of teachers and policemen ?</p>
              <p>People always point to ministers salary. But they are just commensurate to the generally high pay of the Singapore civil service. As you move up the scale of course it would go higher and higher. But they are comparatively not so high or higher than the counterparts in the private sectors such as those CEOs, as is the case in the lower scale with the policemen and teachers compared to the private counterparts.</p>
              <p>Ok lets say,</p>
              <p>Tomorrow the public say teachers and policemen also must have "sense of public service"</p>
              <p>Which is true, nobody can object to it philosophically. Teachers and policemen indeed should have "sense of public service", indeed what.</p>
              <p>So if the salaries are cut, what would happen ?</p>
              <p>If you wanna see what would happen, just take a look at Malaysia Indonesia and other countries. Bribery everywhere. Incompetence everywhere. If you get caught with traffic violation, you can pay "coffee money" to the policemen. Such things dont happen in Singapore because the pay of policemen is relatively decent and they have their dignity.</p>
              <p>How about the teachers. You would see a drastic drop in the quality of teachers. All incompetent and lazy teachers who are unmotivated and they are 3rd or 4th tier people who are rejected or cannot compete in other fields of work. This is the reality. You see those teachers in other countries who are lowly paid, unmotiviated, disrespected, has low status in society.</p>
              <p>I wonder why you want to sabotage what is good and what is working and kill yourself with these inferior systems.</p>
              <p>Why ???</p>
              <p>I believe people are really missing the point. The issue is not the high renumeration but other things such as fairness, transparency, accountability, KPI achievement, and so on..........</p>
              <p>The office holders should be capable, has integrity, can perform, and when he makes mistakes he must take responsbility such as resigning.</p>
              <p>I believe these are the more important issues.</p>
              <p>Not they pay!!!!</p>
              <p>Really barking up the wrong tree.</p>

He has an article in TODAY which discusses ministerial salaries. Excerpts below:<br><blockquote><strong>Reviewing ministerial salaries: Seven lessons from the private sector</strong><br>04:46 AM May 26, 2011<br>by Mak Yuen Teen <br><br>Last week, I taught executive and director pay to an executive MBA class and, during lunch, the subject of conversation at my table was ministerial pay in Singapore - a regular topic among the executives attending the programme over the years.<br><br>While most of the rest of the world is concerned with high executive pay, this must be the only country where ministerial salaries are of more interest.<br><br>Quite coincidentally, on Saturday morning, I had begun writing a commentary with the tentative title of "Ministerial pay: Lessons from corporate scandals and the financial crisis". That night, I saw on the news the Prime Minister's announcement that he was setting up a committee to review ministerial pay. <br><br>When you pay poorly, you might still get good people but, undoubtedly, the pool you select from will be smaller. You may also attract some who are willing to take low pay because they want to use their position for other benefit, such as taking bribes or getting directorships in companies. <br><br>When you pay very well, the pool will be larger, but you also risk attracting the wrong people who are motivated purely by money. People who are attracted to politics because of the money (or power) might still want to use their positions for their own benefit because for some, it is never enough.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I personally do not believe that high pay is effective for fighting corruption; I think it is an affront to the many who make an honest living on low pay to suggest that paying little encourages corruption.</span></strong></blockquote>I agree with Mak. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Not only that, I think that it is also an affront to the many who make an honest living on <em>high</em> pay to suggest that paying them less would encourage corruption.

              <br>This man earns a lot of money (about 3 or 4 million dollars per year, excluding bonuses). He is also a well-respected man, who has held public office for many years. And in all those many years, there has never been any reason to believe that he has ever done anything corrupt.<br><br>But you know what his father says, and has said for many years, right? According to Daddy, if his son's salary was cut (for example, to only 1 or 2 million dollars per year), then he would feel tempted to become dishonest, and to cheat, and take bribes.<br><br>Now, if I were the son, I would feel very insulted by such remarks. For if I were a genuinely honest man, I would never think of taking bribes and Daddy's remarks are therefore indeed an insult to me. And the only temptation I would feel is the temptation to slap my father's face. <br><br>But that wouldn't be very nice. At least, I wouldn't do it in public - it would be politically incorrect. Daddy, after all, is a pretty powerful man. In practical terms, perhaps my only feasible course of action would be to  wait, wait and wait ... until Daddy grows very old, and retires. Then I could go about taking steps to change his long-standing policy on ministers' salaries.<br><br><blockquote>However, it is very difficult to determine what is the "right" pay for CEOs, people with very specialised skills - and government ministers. For CEOs, certain "benchmarks" have been suggested, such as some percentage of profits, some ratio to average employee pay, the pay of sports stars and celebrities or fellow CEOs. None of these are wholly satisfactory. <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Benchmarking ministerial pay to other professions has its limitations because they are totally different jobs, and different jobs come with different lifestyles and employment risks.</span></span></strong> When I look at my peers who have gone to the private sector, many are earning a lot more than I do now, but they do not have my more flexible lifestyle as an academic, and they are not able to achieve tenure which gives better job security. <br><br>In any case, I believe that the best people in any field are those who are driven first by their passion and calling. <br><br>IT'S HOW THEY EARN IT<br><br>As a corporate governance advocate, it has never been my concern if someone is well paid and earns it in the right way. I would be outraged if someone makes a lot of money but does so in an illegal or unethical manner, where it is not related to appropriate measures of performance, or the pay determined is through a contaminated process.<br><br>The corporate sector suggests the following "best practices" which should be followed in setting senior executives pay:<br><br>- An "arms length" process for determining remuneration policy and packages<br>- Benchmarks used should be comparable (similar job responsibilities, similar size and industry, etc)<br>- There should be a reasonable mix of short- and long-term pay <br>- Pay should be based mainly on factors within the executive's control <br>- Performance measures used for evaluation should have strong links with the corporation's long-term performance<br>- There should be minimal benefits and termination payments that are generally unrelated to performance<br>- There is good disclosure and transparency<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">A private sector approach which treats running a country as equivalent to running a corporation is, of course, flawed to start out with. After all, a government can always print money, raise taxes, determine whether it wants to make a profit (budget surplus) or a loss (budget deficit) and so on. </span></span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tying ministerial bonuses to annual GDP growth can create the same perverse incentives as tying CEO pay to annual revenue growth.</span></span></strong> For example, it can lead to incentives to invest in projects with high economic payoffs, but with attendant high social costs and under-investing for long-term growth.</blockquote>"<em>Projects with high economic payoffs, but with attendant high social costs</em>" ...? Hmmm, that sounds like two things to me. <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Firstly, our massive import of foreigners - which leads to economic growth, but strains our public infrastructure such as housing and transport. </span></span></strong><br><br>Secondly, our two new casinos - which lead to economic growth, but also cause a variety of social ills such as crime, gambling addiction and the destruction of families.<br><br>What's also quite tragic is that many Singaporeans still don't realise that high economic growth doesn't necessarily translate into a better standard of living for citizens in general. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">High economic growth simply means that:<br><br>(1) Companies are producing and selling more goods and services; and<br>(2) The government gets to collect more corporate taxes.</span></span></strong><br><br>Normally, (1) means that citizens get to earn more money, because successful companies can pay better salaries and bonuses and hire more employees. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">However, if labour &amp; immigration policies are extremely lax, the companies don't actually pay citizens better, and won't invest in training them. Instead the companies will just hire plenty of cheap foreigners who earn a very large part of the extra money that might otherwise have gone to the citizens.</span></span></strong><br><br>Normally, (2) means that the government has plenty of extra money which it can reinvest in society and redistribute to the people, for example, in areas such as education, healthcare and housing. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">However, if the government has the obsessive mindset that every extra cent must be channelled into the reserves and the reserves must never be touched until the end of the world has arrived, well, basically the people won't gain any benefit from (2).</span></span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Other problems are that high economic growth typically leads to increased inflation, which means that the cost of living escalates</span></span></strong> (hmmm, coincidentally that was the top election issue in Singapore) and furthermore the wealth created by a high GDP doesn't necessarily get distributed evenly across society (i.e, the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">and guess <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #d52a33;" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2010/03/singapore-highest-income-gap-2nd-highest-prison-population-in-the-world/">which country holds the world record</a> for having the largest income gap?</span></span></strong>)<br><br>But I digress. Back to Mak's article: <br><blockquote>But if we are determined to follow a private sector approach to setting ministerial pay, then we should go the whole nine yards and adopt similar sound pay practices, which could involve the following ....<br><br> DEFER PAY, BE TRANSPARENT<br><br>One, have an independent ministerial pay committee to oversee ministerial pay policy and levels (members must be independent and perceived to be so).<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Two, adopt a small number of macro performance measures which capture overall performance in a holistic way (such as average GDP growth, average wage growth, Gini coefficient and unemployment rate) and micro performance measures which directly reflect a particular minister's performance (such as traffic accident rates, average expressway speeds, admission rates of Singaporeans into local universities, percentage of low-income families owning HDB flats).</span></span></strong><br><br>Three, tie a minister's pay primarily to his individual responsibilities and performance, based on his portfolio (a small component can be tied to more macro measures but these may be more relevant to assessing the performance of the "chief executive", that is, the Prime Minister).<br><br>Four, benchmark targets such as GDP growth to trends in comparable economies, to better ensure that improvements are not largely due to external factors (for example, a significant increase in GDP growth - just like a significant increase in a company's stock price - may be driven more by general trends in the inter-connected global economy).<br><br>Five, defer a part of a minister's pay for a number of years and put in place conditions under which the deferred pay may be reduced. <br><br>Six, eliminate or significantly reduce pensions and other benefits not linked to a minister's performance. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">And seven, publish a report each year on the actual amount of each minister's pay and its breakdown.</span></span></strong><br><br>This may sound like an awfully tedious process for setting ministerial pay. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Unfortunately, corporate scandals and the recent financial crisis have taught us that poorly designed pay schemes set through a flawed process and which lack transparency can create perverse incentives and undermine governance. The current approach to setting ministerial pay emulates the pay levels in the private sector but not the sound pay principles that well-governed companies follow.</span></span></strong></blockquote>
              <p>Some good ideas there, and all worth considering. <br><br>There is also a simpler idea which Mak did not mention. Yes, I know that it needs some tweaks and adjustments, but basically the idea goes like this. Firstly, ensure that the civil service has a rational system for determining salaries. Secondly, extend this system to the ministers. <br><br>Why? Well, in any normal organisation (and the civil service is not different), your salary depends on where you stand, in the hierarchy. Junior employees earn less than middle management, and middle management earns less than senior management. And the most senior guy in senior management earns more than the other guys in senior management.<br><br>A minister occupies the highest position in his ministry. The Permanent Secretary of that ministry occupies the 2nd highest position. So the minister should earn a salary anywhere from 5% to 20% higher than the Permanent Secretary. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Similarly, we would expect the Perm Sec to earn 5% to 20% more than the civil servants who occupy the rank immediately below him.</span></span></strong><br><br>Now, if the pay structure of the civil service is correctly rationalised across the board (and that should be the ongoing aim of the civil service anyway), what we would get is a natural pegging of ministers' salaries to private sector salaries anyway. <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Why? Because the civil service and the private sector are in natural economic competition for employees all the time. For example, government hospitals and private hospitals are continuously competing to hire  doctors and nurses all the time.</span></span></strong> Government schools, private schools and tuition centres are continuously  competing to hire teachers. Any ministry which wants to hire fresh grads has got to compete with private-sector companies who also want to hire fresh grads.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">If civil service salaries are generally fair and competitive at every level, then pegging our ministers' salaries to the permanent secretaries (and paying the ministers incrementally more) makes good sense. </span></span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Of course, this logic will probably reveal that currently, our ministers are grossly overpaid and have been grossly overpaid for many years.</span></span></strong><br><br>But then we already knew that. Didn't we?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I am glad that you brought up Obama.</p>
              <p>As a matter of fact, Obama is not an effective and efficient office holder, because he need to listen to lobbyists and special interest groups and other groups who give money donation to him.</p>
              <p>He cannot do many things, as a matter of fact, he need to give some sweets and candies to those groups from time to time.</p>
              <p>So this is the reality.</p>
              <p>So again, I come back to the basic point.</p>
              <p>The high renumeration is beneficial, advantagous, and is overall a plus.</p>
              <p>It is not negative, disadvantagous, or harmful, in any way.</p>
              <p>It is good because it can attract and retain talent, and can maintain the dignity and integrity of the office holders.</p>
              <p>Again, I propose , that the problem is not really in the renumeration package. But actually in other areas, such as,</p>
              <p>selection process (is this the best candidate), transparancy, accountability, KPI achievement, and so on.</p>
              <p>These are the areas which frankly I think can be improved (some ministers give the aura that they are arrogant or that they taichi responsibility when something is wrong)</p>
              <p>So this is the area which should be attacked by the public.</p>
              <p>Not the pay package.</p>
              <p>The pay package is already correct.</p>

              <p>What is the point really in reducing ministers pay ?</p>
              <p>Other than impacting the ability to attract and retain talent, and impacting the ministers integrity.</p>
              <p>What is the benefit of doing so ?</p>
              <p>I believe even philosophically and psychologically the anger is misplaced.</p>
              <p>If the economy is doing better and if there is less gap between rich-poor, I bet there is going to be much less anger.</p>
              <p>So isnt it better to improve the economy, and lessen the rich-poor gap, and give more help to the poor and the sandwiched middle class, than to attack the ministers pay ?</p>

Mr. JB Jeyaratnam has dented PAP's strong hold of power back then. In 1984 General Elections, PAP lost two seats in total: Mr. JBJ retained his Anson seat while Mr. Chiam See Tong won Potong Pasir beating Mah Bow Tan hands down with a respectable 60% of valid votes. <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ever since then, PAP was worried about losing more seats in the years to come. They squeezed every drops of brain juice they have, from suggesting some people may have two votes instead of one to tweaking the electoral system. Eventually, they came up with this BRILLIANT idea of GRC. Basically, the GRC system literally up the stakes for every electoral contest. </span></strong><br><br>They have succeeded in preventing losing more seats in 1988 GE with a close shave of winning Eunos GRC with Workers Party's Team losing by merely 1%. Predictably, they are so dependent and addicted to the GRC system that they subsequently increased the size from 3 to 4 and eventually created the giant 6 man GRCs. It basically up the stake further just like a gambler who thinks he will sure win all. <br><br>Of course, PAP has very thick skin to ignore all logical criticism of its "kiasuism" (mentality of being afraid to lose). At one point of time, the Prime Minister even proudly joke openly about Singaporeans being "Kiasu" (afraid to lose), "Kiasi" (afraid to die) "Kiabo" (afraid of wife). However, ironically PAP has become like a gambling addict who keep increasing its stake in electoral contests.<br><br>It is indeed a paradox. While PAP is afraid to lose, it thought that it could prevent losing by increasing the stake for all. The most ironic argument I heard during this GE 2011 is that PAP has actually accuse Workers Party of making things difficult for Aljunied voters by "forcing them to make difficult choice". It could even be interpreted that WP is "holding voters at ransom" by fielding Mr. Low Thia Khiang and Sylvia Lim together in Aljunied GRC. <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is PAP who is trying to hold Singaporeans at ransom by setting up the GRC system. Not only did it try to use HDB upgrading as the carrot ransom, it also uses subtle threats of depriving voters funding for various services. The ultimate ransom is the argument that the Nation will lose two ministers plus one Speaker of Parliament along with one potential ministerial candidate. </span></strong><br><br>But wait, isn't this PAP's own doing? It tries to gamble big by putting TWO ministers in Aljunied GRC. In fact, it is gambling away its "ministerial talents" by putting ministers in each and every GRCs! It just thinks that Singaporeans will not "sacrifice" its ministers and thus those who contest along with these ministers will have a safe passage way to parliament. <br><br>PAP's high stake gambling habits has cost it dearly. If you think the cost of this gambling is merely two or three ministers, think again. The implications of this lost in Aljunied GRC is much wider and deeper. <br><br>First of all, which PAP minister would be willing to risk their million dollar pay to contest in Aljunied GRC next round in the bid to win it back? Even George Yeo and Lim Hwee Hwa have bowed out of the game! Would it mean that once a GRC is lost, PAP will never be able to win it back again? <br><br>Secondly, after this defeat, how could PAP convince "high flyers" to quit their jobs like BG or superscale civil service positions to join them and promise them a safe passage way to become ministers? There is no longer SAFE Passage to parliament. BG Tan should understand this very well! <br><br>Thirdly, even the recruitment of backbenchers for PAP will face problem! No more hiding behind heavy weights so to walk into parliament safely!<br><br>Last but not least, there are several GRCs in "danger zones" which opposition parties have achieved more than 40%. These include East Coast GRC, Bishan Toa Payoh GRC, Marine Parade GRC, Tampines GRC, Moulmein Kallang GRC and Nee Soon GRC. There are two GRCs which are near 40%: Holland Bukit Timah GRC and Choa Chu Kang GRC. <br><br>It basically means that PAP will be fire fighting in all these places next round and I do not think it has enough ministers to have two ministers fielded in each of these GRCs. If PAP is not careful enough, it may face the possibility of losing more ministers. <br><br>It will be double whammy for PAP. On one hand, it will not be able to attract and convince talents to join its rank while on the other hand, it will keep losing ministerial talents. <br><br>PAP will do the same thing they did in the mid-1980s: think of some genius way to prevent the tide of losing more. They may try to raise the stake again (well, maybe turn Singapore into only 5 GRCs, North South East West and Central GRCs) or implement the one man two votes system for people who reach certain age. Else the only option is to go for some kind proportional representation. <br><br>Implementing proportional representation system may see PAP's percentage of seats dropping in parliament but it will help to prevent any further loss of ministers. <br><br>It seems that the implementation of proportional representation system would benefit Singapore. It will make sure that our parliament will maintain diversity of views for better debates on policy issues and at the same time, secure enough ministerial candidates to serve the nation. <br><br>The PAP has lost big time for GE 2011 and I hope that it will wake up in time to carry out the necessary electoral reforms to embrace diversity and cater to Singaporeans' urge of having more opposition voices in parliament.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng</div>

              <p>In the General Election of 1988, by which time the GRC System was already set in place, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr Wong was part of a three-man GRC team which was returned uncontested. </span></span></strong> In the General Election of 1991, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">he was part of a four-man GRC team, which went uncontested.</span></span></strong> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">In each of GE 1997, 2001 and 2006, he was part of a five-man GRC team, all of which were uncontested.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> He has enjoyed walkover “victories” in each successive election.</span></span></strong></p>
