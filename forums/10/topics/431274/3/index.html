              <p>I am glad that you brought up Obama.</p>
              <p>As a matter of fact, Obama is not an effective and efficient office holder, because he need to listen to lobbyists and special interest groups and other groups who give money donation to him.</p>
              <p>He cannot do many things, as a matter of fact, he need to give some sweets and candies to those groups from time to time.</p>
              <p>So this is the reality.</p>
              <p>So again, I come back to the basic point.</p>
              <p>The high renumeration is beneficial, advantagous, and is overall a plus.</p>
              <p>It is not negative, disadvantagous, or harmful, in any way.</p>
              <p>It is good because it can attract and retain talent, and can maintain the dignity and integrity of the office holders.</p>
              <p>Again, I propose , that the problem is not really in the renumeration package. But actually in other areas, such as,</p>
              <p>selection process (is this the best candidate), transparancy, accountability, KPI achievement, and so on.</p>
              <p>These are the areas which frankly I think can be improved (some ministers give the aura that they are arrogant or that they taichi responsibility when something is wrong)</p>
              <p>So this is the area which should be attacked by the public.</p>
              <p>Not the pay package.</p>
              <p>The pay package is already correct.</p>

              <p>I agree with you 100%.</p>
              <p>So it is not the issue of pay, but what they do (their performance).</p>
              <p>So in fact when people focus on the pay.....errrr.....isnt it will take away the focus from the more important aspects ?</p>
              <p>What if tomorrow the pay is drastically reduced and then people will forgive the ministers more, because they subconsiously expect them to work more sloppily and commit more mistakes.</p>
              <p>So really the whole pay thing issue is strange.</p>

              <p><br>MPs, PAP's MPs in parliament?  They are more interested in their own personal interest than anyone's else.    Unless they remove every minister in PAP and replace them with people who come on board to serve the nation with sincerity, the name PAP will still remain a bad one.    Leopard will never change its spots.    PM Lee is doing all these about salary and removing some of the ministers to protect his "kingdom", that is all, nothing to be happy about that he has made some changes.</p>

However, we are not taking into account the income they receive from speeches and talks they give, books they write, and any workshops they hold. The presidents actually earn more through this indirect income than their official pay.</p>
              <p>We must also note the size of the United States and how its larger population will affect the number of people buying products endorsed up by them, books they write and the sheer number of people sending in money and gifts to support them. It's not a fair comparison if we just take their pay at face value.</p>
              <p>Things are not as they seem.</p>

              <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
              <p>Member of Parliament <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=lim+wee+kiak&amp;amp;#38;fr=fp-today&amp;amp;#38;cs=bz"><span style="color: #005790;">Lim Wee Kiak</span></a> of the Nee Soon group representation constituency has apologised for his remarks linking ministerial pay with the "dignity" of politicians.</p>
              <p>In a note on his Facebook page on Friday, MP Lim said he would like to clarify the comments he made to <em>Lianhe Zaobao</em> and reproduced in <em>LianheWanBao</em>. The comments had been quickly slammed by netizens.</p>
              <p>He had been quoted by the Chinese paper last week as saying, "If the annual salary of the Minister of Information, Communication and Arts is only $500,000, it may pose some problems when he discuss policies with media CEOs who earn millions of dollars because they need not listen to the minister's ideas and proposals. Hence, a reasonable payout will help to maintain a bit of dignity."</p>
              <p>In his Facebook note, the MP said, "I withdraw those remarks and apologise for making them. Dignity cannot be and must not be measured purely in monetary terms."</p>
              <p>He said he agreed that the example he gave and his comment that there may be loss of face if the minister's salary is low "is inappropriate and incorrect".</p>
              <p>Noting that ministerial pay is a sensitive issue and one that many are concerned about, he said he would like to clarify his comments by making three fundamental points. We have re-posted them below in full:</p>
              <p>1. We need a balanced approach to the question of Ministerial pay.</p>
              <p>2. Personally, I think we should not use pay and perks to attract capable people to come forward to serve. I agree with PM that there is a service to country element and an element of sacrifice expected for the Ministers by the public.</p>
              <p>3. On the other hand, we need to take into consideration their responsibilities and job scope when we remunerate Ministers.</p>
              <p>The multi-million dollar pay of ministers was a hot-button issue in Singapore's recent General Election, which saw the ruling People's Action Party win 81 out of 87 seats but at a significantly lower share of the total votes.</p>
              <p>Following the results, Prime Minister <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=lee+hsien+loong&amp;amp;#38;fr=fp-today&amp;amp;#38;cs=bz"><span style="color: #005790;">Lee Hsien Loong</span></a> announced the formation of a committee to review the "basis and level of political salaries". Any pay changes would take effect from 21 May this year.</p>
              <p>In reaction to MP Lim's earlier remarks on ministerial pay, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.facebook.com/weekiak/posts/122048304544317"><span style="color: #005790;">Francis Oen</span></a> posted on Facebook: "Hi Wee Kiat.. Suggest you clarify your statement. Does it mean that only $ talks?! ... And if someone earns less, does it mean he cannot have dignity?"</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/wynlim"><span style="color: #005790;">Winnie Lim</span></a> tweeted: "So according to Dr Lim Wee Kiak's theory, our ministers will ignore Obama because he earns less than all of them."</p>
              <p>On his <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en-gb.facebook.com/weekiak"><span style="color: #005790;">Facebook</span></a> page, Dr Lim earlier said that his quote was taken out of context.</p>
              <p>"Minister's pay issue is a sensitive one. There must be a balance. After all, capable individuals who are willing to come forward to serve should not so because of pay and perks," he replied to a user's question about his quote.</p>
              <p>He added, "On the other hand, they do have families and dependents and need to consider for retirement, etc."</p>

              <p>Yup, well i thought the forums would be a good place to express what i felt, but now it seems pretty obvious that anyone going against the norm of the discussion is going to be mercilessly put down. So sad right, even my disclaimer that i didnt want to change people's opinion was ignored.</p>

              <p>Quote:
               The two books [The Audacity of Hope, Dreams from My Father] together 
              have now sold more than three million copies in the US 
                and are set to be translated into dozens of languages</p>
              <p>Pricing - 
              Audacity of hope: list price USD19.95 
              (http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0307237702?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=beyotherhet-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=0307237702)</p>
              <p>Pricing
               - Dreams from My Father: list price CND32.00 [USD27.25445] 
              (http://www.amazon.ca/Dreams-My-Father-Story-Inheritance/dp/0307383415/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1306921525&amp;sr=1-2)</p>
              <p>Profit: 3,000,000 x USD[(19.95 +27.25)/2] = USD70,800,000</p>
              <p>I
               can't be bothered to continue this with the other 3 books, but 
              obviously its a profit. Furthermore this is only 2008, not accounting 3 
              years worth of sales. Let's say maybe manufacturing costs cut this 
              number in half</p>
              <p>USD70,800,000/2 = USD35,400,000</p>
              <p>PM Lee's "Hard Truths" sales - estimated 100,000(http://forums.sgclub.com/singapore/sold_out_hard_333263.html)</p>
              <p>Pricing - S$40.00</p>
              <p>Total profits: 100,000 x S$40.00 = S$4,000,000 = USD3,124,536</p>
              <p>Now, not accounting for the workshops and talks he gives as well, let's compare Obama to PM Lee:</p>
              <p>Obama's profits per year: [USD35,400,000/4(number of years on sale)] + USD400,000(official pay) = USD9,250,000</p>
              <p>PM Lee's profits per year: S$3,000,000(USD2,343,402) + USD3,124,536 = USD5,467,938</p>
              <p>Therefore Obama's profits &gt; PM Lee's profits</p>
              <p>Keep
               in mind that Obama's profits is a very big underestimate noting that 
              other books and other sources of income are not included into the 
              equation. All conversion rates are used are accurate to the time frame 
              in context, used with the converter

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">CONCLUSION</span></span></p>
              <p>I
               don't care if you tl;dr the whole thing, the point is that saying that 
              the ministers are paid more than Obama is an invalid argument from the 
              start. Is this enough proof? :)</p>
