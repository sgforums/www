It allows free entry for 10 days in a year. The fee for motorcycles is S$4.<br><br>'I will find out what is happening...and whether it is us or the Transport Ministry that is supposed to be giving the green light, although I think it is them,' said Datuk Seri Radzi.<br><br>'But for now, we have not started collecting money and there is no decision if the collection will be done using the gantry system or manually.'<br><br>NEW STRAITS TIMES''<br><br>taken from: <a href="http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=2242" rel="nofollow">http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=2242</a><br><br></div>
