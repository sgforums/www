            <div class='col-md body'>I have often felt he is some sort of renegade, a mad fellow,  but now having seen this video, I  feel I have been badly misled.  He is not standing for coming election, so I think its fair for me to discuss about him.<br><br>That incident with PM Goh in the market, what Chee said was when he asked "Mr Goh where is the money?".  Mr Goh actually was pointing to his own pocket. Now that was'nt reported in the papers or TV. Is Chee telling the truth?  Well, he has not been sued or challenged for that statement...was the media or press biased and not telling everything as it happened ?.<br><br>While I don't agree with Chee's style of fighting the Government, I now have a better understanding of him,   admire his stand on freedom of speech, freedom to gather where you like to discuss politics.<br><br>I guess its hard for any opposition to win any election here with Singaporeans being so conditioned to obey without questioning.<br><br>Last nite I heard we cannot blog or post election matters in any websites.<br>Strange thing for a powerful and popular political party to do.<br><br>Why all these last minute restrictions?<br><br></div>

And I know it is working for them.<br><br>Dont your agree, looking at the big picture that we are livng under an oppressive system.  This is troubling my conscience.<br><br>Why am I so spineless and apathetic about the political decay that has gone on for so long?<br><br>How are Singaporeans going to grow up with a freedom to choose and change.    We can make alot of noises but most will never be heard.<br><br>Are we not mere 'slaves' of the Emperor,  Singapore style?<br><br>Who reaps the fruits of our labour most?  Think for a moment on this point.  Yes, we all look well off, HDB houses, cars, overseas holidays, beautiful buildings and upgradings.

Reason very simple, is becos the media and newspaper kept showing the bad and mad side of him on tv (the one which he is on a lorry with his group shouting at one of the market place whereby GCT was oso there).
