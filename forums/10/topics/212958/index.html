And I applaud your attempts to point this out to all who would hear.</blockquote>Coming to think of it, does the government ever care whether citizens have any views or problems. It would appear that the leaders regard themselves as infallible and do not care about citizens' hardship or suffering. In the name of pragmatism the government would do almost anything irrespective of people's problems or hardship. They have gone ahead to cut people's CPF, and sacrificed their rights to equitable rewards and privileges as citizens by coming up with all kinds of hardline policies and iron rule just to make them jobs easier.<br><br>They even go big scale into business to compete against their own people for a living.<br><br>So there is no issue whether citizens should appreciate government's view about the country being a small vulnerable red dot in any way as the government would as always impose all its hardline policies on the people whether they people like it or not.<br><br>So if the leaders wanted people to support their policies they will first have to demonstrate they have been a caring and listening government in the first place.<br><br>So the reality is that the government did not listen and it looks like they will continue to give the same old excuses whenever they is any hardships and recessions to give the old arguments that surpluses are for the bad times without giving people any hope that there is indeed any use for building up those surpluses.<br><br>But without getting any of the people's consent they had no hesitation to spend on those surpluses painfully taxed from the people on their own highest rewards and bonuses and even making billion-dollar losses on overseas projects without benefit to the people.<br><br>The leaders are now even so bold as to be prepared to forego their own citizens and import foreigners to be its citizens.<br><br>This is the extent of suffering of the people which the leaders do not seem to care to acknowledge or change. They seem to be interested only in creating benefits for the elites adn their careers using the people's monies without any compunctions.<br><br>Now it is for them to understand that perhaps enough is enough with their excuses and if they want people to support them they are the ones who should change.<br><br>The should stop using all kinds of tactics and excuses to brow beat the people with fee increases and taxing and recovering to no end just to secure their own benefits.<br><br>They have created all the past problems which are hampering the growths and potential of this place since 1970s.<br><br>They need to change the old iron rule and open up and help their own citizens to succeed.<br><br>The old policies like the meritocracy and leadership abilities of their scholars simply have not worked to the benefit of the people as to be seen in the last two recessions.<br><br>It is for the leaders to make some major changes if they want to win over the people once again.</div>

Are all the mps the top 5% of the country in terms of heart and abilities? What were many of the mps doing before election? - HODs/VPs/Ps/teachers in schools, journalists, GM, Financial planners/advisors/analysts, HR Directors, lawyers, doctors etc. Ordinary graduates are also performing these jobs - where got top talents? Only BG Lee and George Yeo and Lim Hng Kiang and Chan Soo Sen are former scholars - the rest are much lesser than scholars - partly of course because we do not want all scholars because they cannot understand all components of society. So do not say such pay is not high. It is very high because they can work as CEOs/GMs in addition to holding directorships in other cos. In fact mps' pay often are much higher than the ministers' - on the contrary to many of your views! There are only a few mins who are earning more before public office like MOM, Dr Richard Hu, Dr Tonly Tan.<br><br>It is the more materialistic sporeans that causes such yen for money that we need always to pay so high for such elite. Other nations like US and Japn are not so materialistic when they are rich or at middle-income level - they are willing to take up govt posts and suffer drop in pay and pay high tax upon transition to govt because they have to dispose their assets to prevent conflict of interests. While it is true we have to be more reasonable in paying govt/public or any pte incumbents to reduce corruption, other countries' salaries are not as high and yet they are judged to be just as incorrupt or even less corrupt than sg!</blockquote>The whole issue of having to pay high salaries to retain talents and avoid corrupting the corruptible of the civil servants and ministers and MPs has been a hype created to give self-rewards without substantiation or justification.<br><br>It was raised at a time when the economy was on the rise in the 1960s.<br><br>But when the economy was dropping due to recessions the private sector wages actually self-corrected although the government continued to push for their own rewards benchmarked to something unsubstantiated on facts and only on assumptions.<br><br>When MM Lee first started the campaign back in 1970s to push for wage restructuring of civil servants and ministers to match those of the private sector the situation derserved some corrections and adjustments but he went overboard with his assumption and the seed was sowed to breed elitism and high costs of living.<br><br>Throughout the whole period 1970s - 1990s, the private sector's wages actually corrected and came down below that of the public sector but that of the public sector continued to go up accentuated by many promotional schemes.<br><br>As a result of many years of such-like wage push by the public sector, an average senior civil servant's pay of some 10-20 years service went up more than three times of the 1970s despite the drop of senior managers' pay in the private sector. That was why HDB, PSA and SIA were found to have overpaid most of their staff resulting in pruning being necessary to prevent collapse of such companies.<br><br>However, other services which were not exposed ot outside competition like the Town council, government departments providing bill collector services were over-inflated with highest pays unjustified by any competitive or commercial standard measurements.<br><br>Such services like car park, M&amp;E and routine services which were not competitive should have been outsourced a long time ago but they were still being over-bloated with high pays at the expense of the taxpayers.<br><br>MPs and ministers only collect monies and enforce regulations with little caccountability for performance or creation of jobs for the citixens. They were being overpaid by at least three times if not more.<br><br>Senior civil servants do not have responsibility for performance and only spend public taxes and balance their bookd but all of them were regarded as talents and creator of wealth but in real fact were just bill collectors.<br><br>So how does the public sector go on to jusftify high wages at the expense of raising costs of living?<br><br>MPs and ministers of the calibre of Dr. Goh Keng Swee deserves the million-dollars salary but these are only a few and special votes can be taken to pass this kind of salaries for deserving cases not all the rest of ministers who have not proven themselves.<br><br>So it is time for the new PM to understand the past problems and take action to correct wrong assumptions about talents and abilities.<br><br>Not all ministers and not all civil servants are that talented as assumed. If their pays are like NKF Durai being pushed up due to self-recommendations by insider parties who are influenced by assumptions, it is time to get real.<br><br>It Singapore wants to be competitive it is necessary to avoid overpaying all the civil servants and ministers and CEOs of companies in GLCs.<br><br>Ordinary workers and middle managerment salaries are not the problems. Often it is the senior wages which cause the loss of our economic competitivenss. Waint to conduct a survey to see why so many listed public companies are losing monies due to overpayment of senior wages.<br><br>Or do we want to see more companies losing monies and moving out of Singapore because of this government-led senior wage push. It is scary human greed can get out of control in modern Singapore.<br><br>PM Lee should see the whole picture for himself if he wants to create competitiveness or employments opportunities. In fact they deny the NKF highly unjustified peanut pays, there will be more problems coming.<br><br>It is time as Ngiam Tong Dow has pointed out to stop using NWC or PTC to push up pays for GLCs and put the blame of unemployments back to the people.<br></div>

It would appear that the leaders regard themselves as infallible and do not care about citizens' hardship or suffering. In the name of pragmatism the government would do almost anything irrespective of people's problems or hardship. They have gone ahead to cut people's CPF, and sacrificed their rights to equitable rewards and privileges as citizens by coming up with all kinds of hardline policies and iron rule just to make them jobs easier.<br><br>They even go big scale into business to compete against their own people for a living.<br><br>So there is no issue whether citizens should appreciate government's view about the country being a small vulnerable red dot in any way as the government would as always impose all its hardline policies on the people whether they people like it or not.<br><br>So if the leaders wanted people to support their policies they will first have to demonstrate they have been a caring and listening government in the first place.<br><br>So the reality is that the government did not listen and it looks like they will continue to give the same old excuses whenever they is any hardships and recessions to give the old arguments that surpluses are for the bad times without giving people any hope that there is indeed any use for building up those surpluses.<br><br>But without getting any of the people's consent they had no hesitation to spend on those surpluses painfully taxed from the people on their own highest rewards and bonuses and even making billion-dollar losses on overseas projects without benefit to the people.<br><br>The leaders are now even so bold as to be prepared to forego their own citizens and import foreigners to be its citizens.<br><br>This is the extent of suffering of the people which the leaders do not seem to care to acknowledge or change. They seem to be interested only in creating benefits for the elites adn their careers using the people's monies without any compunctions.<br><br>Now it is for them to understand that perhaps enough is enough with their excuses and if they want people to support them they are the ones who should change.<br><br>The should stop using all kinds of tactics and excuses to brow beat the people with fee increases and taxing and recovering to no end just to secure their own benefits.<br><br>They have created all the past problems which are hampering the growths and potential of this place since 1970s.<br><br>They need to change the old iron rule and open up and help their own citizens to succeed.<br><br>The old policies like the meritocracy and leadership abilities of their scholars simply have not worked to the benefit of the people as to be seen in the last two recessions.<br><br>It is for the leaders to make some major changes if they want to win over the people once again.</div></blockquote>This is very true!!!!!!</div>
