              <p>I know that you know that such things happened everywhere. Oz has the advantage of space, but not in Singapore, it is so small so people have to learn to accept each other because you cannot avoid getting in each others' face.</p>
              <p>Its good for you to accept those who don't assimilate with the "diversity" perspective. In Singapore, there are idiots who would only accept the born in Singapore as true blue Singaporean. Some idiots think that all Singaporeans must speak English to be true Singaporean, why should Li Jiawei speaks english? they forgot that Singapore is a multi racial society and there are 4 official languages, and we can choose anyone! I really think NUS failed very badly in their contribution to the society, when they produced this kind of graduates. </p>
              <p>So, many singaporeans choose to migrate, among many other reasons, there are those who migrate because they can't stand the influx of foreign immigrants into Singapore. These are hypocrites! they can't stand people who speak only mandarin, or tamil, so they choose to go to a place where only english is spoken, do you think they will also adopt the "diversity" perspective when they come face to face with other immigrants in Australia?</p>
              <p>I am very glad that such people leave Singapore, for good I hope, don't leave their CPF around just in case. It is idiotic trying to compare the life in a City with that of a continent. To those of us who live in Singapore, this is always our home, and it is always good to be home. We adjust and adopt to accommodate new comers, and we hope they do the same. There are too many high rise here so we don't fly kite here, we fly radio controller model plane. Those who insist on their own way have to leave, for a bigger space, so they can fly a kite.</p>

              <p>lastly, let's not second guess why someone is leaving this island paradise called singapore just as many who choose to come. there is no right or wrong, good or bad. you choose to stay; maybe becos you love your adopted singapore too much or becos you ain't got the ability to get out. so be it. i don't question your decision. but don't sound like a sour grape just because your (lack of) mobility had you firmly grounded that you pooh pooh others who choose to leave. i can leave tomorrow, and come back the next day here if i want. it is a global village we live in after all.  </p>

              <p>lastly, let's not second guess why someone is leaving this island paradise called singapore just as many who choose to come. there is no right or wrong, good or bad. you choose to stay; maybe becos you love your adopted singapore too much or becos you ain't got the ability to get out. so be it. i don't question your decision. but don't sound like a sour grape just because your (lack of) mobility had you firmly grounded that you pooh pooh others who choose to leave. i can leave tomorrow, and come back the next day here if i want. it is a global village we live in after all.  </p>

              <p>re-read your earlier post about the fly kite analogy i posted. what you wrote is illogical. that's what i am saying. i wrote in "sgdiehard" in that analogy becos i know you will be slighted and be completely distracted. you proved me right and walked right into it. you are not as measured as you claim you are.

              <p>on lky and first language, dun try to `tai chi' and talk about the cultural stuff. so, if your indian neighbour choose to talk to you in tamil, you think it will promote neighbourliness? for once, stop slice and dice as you have been doing. if you say integrate and fit in, your very argument already backfired in your face.</p>
