              <p>aussie are bred in a higher quality of life, same as local s'poreans but this foreigners come from  parts of the world which has civil wars, poverty and crime.</p>
              <p>How can they integrate into a first world society? And now many flock to Aus for the social security system. but in s'pore there is no social security and that may discourage them from staying in s'pore.</p>

              <p>The only way Singapore condition can be worse than aust is that it is overcrowding, because Singapore is a small island and there is no way to expand the livable area.</p>
              <p>Look at it the other way, foreigners are squeezed in Singapore and have to communicate with Singaporeans as well as other foreigners, they will assimilate soon than we think.</p>
              <p>In Australia, the place is so big, you can live all your life there without speaking english. Many HK immigrants speak only cantonese. and besides the asian immigrants, there are other immigrants from eastern europe who do not come to Singapore. These people dont assimilate either. In that sense, australia is already much worse than in Singapore.</p>
              <p>In Canada, same problem, but it is worse when you have cities like vancouver with area for HK, for the Indians, primarily Singh, and for those from Singapore and Malaysia. Such area is much bigger than the Geylang here. Immigrants starts their own society there, they don't integrate.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, we have 4 official languages including Mandarin and Tamil, and Chinese dialects are still used. there is no problem for immigrants from China and India to communicate with locals here. In Australia and Canada, the only official language is English but you find all the immigrants speaking so many other native languages. Vancouver even have Cantonese and the Singh TV....may be in the not so distant in future, Cantonese will become an official language in Canada.</p>
              <p>Not too long ago, the english and the descendents of east asian immigrants took to the streets to settle racial problem in England. that is because the descendents of the east asian immigrants, never took England as their home. Now the muslim in the UK is asking for a change to the local laws to accept many muslim practices in their schools and elsewhere.....</p>
              <p>In the end, immigrants are everywhere looking for better life. Ultimately, it is important if they would treat their new place of settlement their home, whether they would assimilate into the local society. The indians immigrants in UK never did, the HK immigrants in Canada did not, the eastern Europeans in Australia are not...</p>
              <p>You think Singapore is worse, you really don't know what is happening outside. </p>

              <p>alrite, alrite, singapore is da best...bar none.</p>
              <p>on a serious note, if one choose not to assimilate into the society, he/she is done for, migrant or not. it doesn't matter where one choose to resettle.</p>
              <p>the herd mentality holds true in all situations; school, new work place, new country. most will try to hang around a familiar environment and people first. later on, the streetsmart will move away from their initial area of comfort.</p>
              <p>on a flip side, i have friends/relatives living in australia, canada, thailand.....and most integrate into the society and living a full life.</p>
              <p>australia and canada remain more live-able than singapore.</p>
              <p>migrants from elsewhere have no problems communicating with locals here in singapore? try li jiawei.</p>
