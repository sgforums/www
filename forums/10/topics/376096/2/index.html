              <p>Only a "hum" will continue to loudly boast her ignorance that Bill Gates and Warren Buffett will need to run around in circles to keep their wealth intact.</p>
              <p>Do they need to buy Euro and Reminbi, and buy back the supposedly worthless US Treasury Bonds in Reminbi again ?</p>
              <p>Can the worthless "hum" work out the mechanics to the profits and loss for such round about ways of conducting deals in the magnitude involved ?</p>
              <p>It is obvious that the "hum" is unaware that most of those listed in the Fortune 400 are already in their 60s, and are enjoying their accumulated fortunes - with Bill Gates setting up Trust Funds in aid of charity work, and Warren Buffett already giving away almost all of his fortune to the charity trust fund created by Bill Gates and his wife.</p>
              <p>The "hum" should learn to give more time to her specialty and spend less time living in her "fantasy lai lai lai" World, thinking that everyone should work like her by going through the back doors for all the dishonest shady work.</p>

              <p> If you have consoled your soul, will you end up as a useless "hum" spreading your insufferable ignorance persistently ?</p>
              <p>If you are as rich as you claimed, it is obvious that the wealth is uselessly spent to hae produced an ignorant "hum" that have to migrate from Taiwan to Singapore - jumping from a pan and into the fire.</p>
              <p>Obviously, you are ignorant to know that Bill Gates developed Microsoft at a time when the USA was having social upheavals with the war in Vietnam splitting the country and the budget draining the economy.</p>
              <p>Have you contributed enough to your adopted country, as it seems that the people are still struggling while the useless "hum" from Taiwan must come here to compete for space and import more foreigners to suck the juice from Singaporeans ?</p>

              <p> Is it not in the typical ignorance that a "hum" will paint a boastful picture of helping cancer patients, but will at the same time cause new patients by taking "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the money from the rich drinker</span></em>" and causing them to have liver cancer - only for the "hum" to look good again by being charitable ?</p>
              <p>You certainly know how to balance the evil that your "hum" can dream up to make yourself look good at the expense of others.</p>

              <p>While comparing US agriculture export vs China agriculture Import reflect the inheritance risk involved in China. You can be rich but go hungry as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>China mainly imported agricultural produce from the US, ASEAN, Brazil, Argentina and the EU, up 57.9 percent, 30.2 percent, 89.8 percent, 62.2 percent and 32.5 percent, respectively, year-to-year. Compared to the previous year, the proportion of agricultural produce that China imported in 2008 from ASEAN and the EU dropped by 1.6 percentage points and 0.5 percentage points, respectively, while the proportion of agricultural produce that China imported from the US, Brazil and Argentina rose by 2.4, 3.3 and 1.7 percentage points, respectively.</p>

              <p>I'm just speculating here but i believe that our high debt to GDP is mostly internal/public debt (I'm no economist, but i think those debts are mostly estimated payouts of CPF).</p>
              <p>Our external debt on the other hand is much lower (11.27% to GDP). Meaning to my understanding, that we are actually less vulnerable to speculation and economic crashes because Singapore is not as exposed to sudden exchange rate inflation or deflation. Because of the lower external debt our debts have a lesser chance of ballooning suddenly without warning. Which i think is a healthy thing to have.</p>
              <p>I would say we have a good chance of becoming like Japan, overborrowing on the CPF(The primary reason i think why we had the flood of foreigners to replenish the coffers). But it's a lot less destructive from my understanding compared to the high external debt that the US has.   </p>
              <p>HongKong on the other hand has 200.48% external debt but 14.5% public debt. Taiwan's better on that count with 14.01% external and 30.9% public. From an economic point of view Taiwan seems very underleveraged but talking with my Taiwanese friends i think this has more to do with decision making paralysis rather than good governance though that is my own personal opinion. .</p>
              <p>Yes, 99.5% of GDP is a scary thing that capture attention but when you break it down to its component it's "somewhat" not so terrifying.</p>

              <p>Perhaps your views that "the people's protest is not effective as the government is not listening" is based on your Singapore experience and not the USA ?</p>
              <p>If the loud protests on the US streets were not heard and taken seriously by the US government, will the Vietnam War ended with such ignominious results that scarred the memory of the US veterans that fought in that War ?</p>
              <p>If the loud protests on the US streets led by Martin Luther King were not heard and taken seriously by the US government, will the Civil Rights Act be written and acted on vigorously by the Federal Authority to crack down on any abuses by State Authorities or by determined citizens to be racial chauvinists ?</p>
              <p>If the loud protest on the US streets led by the extreme Right Wing were not heard and taken seriously by the present Obama Government, will Obama have responded with double the vigor and focus to tackle the skewed views that thrive on the ignorance and fears purposefully pursued and taken advantage by the Right Wing ?</p>
              <p>The Singapore PAP Government has always harp on the fact that organised public opinion impinge on the authority of an Elected Government and is therefore illegal when such opinions from the Citizens have no basis of legitimacy.</p>
              <p>The Singapore PAP Government had used the US experience as an excuse where organised dissent is disruptive without considering that when the Government bypass the Citizen's interests, then the voice of the Citizen must not only be heard, but be taken seriously.</p>
              <p>Compared to the experience of Singaporeans with the Singapore PAP Government, it has been allowing the citizens voice to be heard, but that the government has already decided before hand and has already considered all the possible objections before hand, and unless some other more persuasive objections are made by the Citizens - nothing else will be considered.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even in Hongkong and South Korea, public demonstrations on some passionate issues that concern the Citizens have surely brought the attention of the respective governments to focus on the issues raised.</p>
              <p>Public protests and demonstrations have changed the course of history in Poland, the Philippines, East Germany, and also Soviet Russia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The PAP Government is aware and worried about the power of such mass public protests that is caused by an accumulation of public frustrations or concerns that bring focus on a single issue.</p>
              <p>Is Singapore in anyway better when the Citizens are made dumb and their minds made blank by the PAP method of monopolising political power that allow them to control every aspect of Political Life in Singapore ?</p>

              <p>There is alot for Obama, his Administration, and the US citizens to do, and there is  little they can do to help themselves with the present status quo unless there is a global effort to rebuild confidence in the financial, manufacturing systems, and market share mechanism.</p>

              <p>Not neccessarily. Just because i don't drop dead from eating a hamburger doesn't mean it won't contribute to my demise if i eat it for every meal. And you are stating the end result, while i am observing the events that would ultimately lead to that end result.</p>
              <p>Actually i haven't listened much to Rush Limbach, i prefer Bill Maher, Ron Paul, Ralph Nalder and a little of George Carlin if i was feeling cynical enough.</p>
              <p>Personally i think the idea of survival of the strongest is a distortion of the original intent when you compare it to what actually happens in nature. What is strong in logic doesn't neccessarily win the argument, it is the obnoxious loud voice that wins out. The Bill O Reillys would shout you down by seizing on the one portion of your argument that is controversial and drown out the intent of the message.  </p>
              <p>The strongest is winning right now, but it is not the logically better one.</p>
              <p>The people that voted for Obama voted him because they believe in his policies. However, they are not the ones that would determine whether he could carry out those promises.</p>
