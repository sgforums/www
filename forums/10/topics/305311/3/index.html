              <p>Your very first statement is wrong... Singapore does not have enough workers to support the companies here. Why? Because the government is attracting a lot of companies and FTs.</p>
              <p>You might say that they could have less companies here, then there won't be any need for any FTs. Yet if there are less companies, the economy will not be as good as now; the production possibility curve of the Singapore economy would be much lower.</p>
              <p>The only way to have more people and less FTs is to have Singaporeans give birth to more babies. The stop-at-2 policy by the PAP was abolished too late. The solution now is, you want good economic growth but less FTs (which I believe is what most people wants), you have to go and give birth more so that in the long run, less FTs will be needed. I believe that budget surplus should be caterred to even more incentives for giving birth to babies. Afterall, a lot of behaviours in Singapore is altered by monetary incentives.</p>

              <p>I believe that foreign talents has difficulty to break in to the
              Japanese working industry is because of the language barrier and
              government policy. Many foreigner end up working as English teacher
              when first arrived in Japan. The job opportunity is rare for
              foreigner who can't speak native language because local people only
              speak Japanese.</p>

              <p>You have a point. Singapore prides herself as being multi-cultural and thus, foreigners from China and India will have an easier time merging into Singapore. The cultural barrier for foreigners is thus much lower in Singapore than in Japan.</p>

              <p>they will come back and tell you Japan has nearly 127 million population. Hence we need to have 5.5 mil Singaporeans before we don't need to rely on FT. But then, because Singaporeans don't give birth enough, no choice, have to import FT.</p>

              <p>Yes, Singapore has fewer mouths to feed, but then the few mouths at the top requires food that is of at least 3 times or more amount than that of Japan's. Also, the fewer mouths in Singapore are not as hardworking as the Japs, as pointed out too.</p>
              <p>Anyway, that wasn't a rebuttal, if you wish. I'm sorry if it sounds like one. I'm just coining a possible lame reason that our 'scholars' will give you. This is manifested in the phrase "they will come back and tell you" that I have used. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
