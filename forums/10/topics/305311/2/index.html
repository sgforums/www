            <div class='col-md body'>In the mid-1980s, Prime Minister Nakazone insistently articulated a vision of an "internationalized" Japan that was to claim political and social influence in global affairs commensurate with its economic power.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Thus, it is not altogether coincidental that the rise of foreign workers on the Japanese soil should occur in the mid-1980s, with the pull factors being Japan's continuing economic success and the decline of its low-wage labor pool, while the push factors were rural poverty in neighboring Asian countries and the unemployment of migrant workers in the Middle East.<br><br>Yet<br>Japan's ambivalent attitude to foreigners will probably prevent the country from welcoming an influx of immigrants that business leaders say could revitalize the economy and stave off a population crisis.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>The government has launched a campaign to boost the economy by doubling the number of foreign tourists to 10 million a year, but a November opinion poll showed a third of Japanese were against it. Almost all of those opposed said they feared a rise in crime.<br><br>Mini conclusion:<br>Japan's govt do want more foreign workers to help the economy, yet it is the Japanese who do not want them. Still, there was an obvious rise in the number of foreign workers in the 1980s when the Japanese economy was booming.<br><br>References:<br><a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-11/27/content_285162.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-11/27/content_285162.htm</a><br><a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1132/is_n1_v44/ai_12243973" rel="nofollow">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1132/is_n1_v44/ai_12243973</a></div>

Busineses do that frequently. I'm not sure how big a role the Government played in that. I don't think that follows the current understanding of Foreign Talent which is to get the people with the ideas to work in your country.<br><br>For (3) I remember high density music cassette tapes but I think those came out about the same time as the CD and there were some sort of restrictions put in place by the US to prevent those competing with CD. That idea has since died out.<br><br>Also I remember those casette type read write optical discs. Which has also been replaced by RWCDs. Those became obsolete due to their unreliability arising from some sort of deterioration of the discs, not sure why, but I heard rumors that the Windows operating system didn't support it and was part of the reason it deteriorated. Those have also vanished from our market.</div>

              <p>phil30k, my main point is to drive across the point that Japan did rely on foreigners to build up the country.</p>
              <p>And in the booming economy of the 1980s, there were a number of foreign workers in Japan, all contributing to the economy. The Meiji Restoration was raised as an example of the first step that Japan took to allay itself with the western powers. The Tokugawa regime has just ended, and public sentiments towards foreigners still tended more towards the policies of the Tokugawa regime.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, cassette tapes did come from Japan, and instant noodles, etc... You are right... And so did some other technologies... But the fact remains that Japan did "import" a lot of foreign technology, adapt and modify, then repackage and sell them out. The origins of those technologies are not from Japan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I believe to really understand their culture and economy, you have to learn their language and immerse in their culture. How many of those who commented here, with the exception of some, have actually go and learn their culture and language? Or have actually worked in Japan? If only Singaporeans are half as humble as the Japanese...</p>
              <p><br>The fact that their labour force is more than 30 times that of Singapore is already overlooked. Didn't communist China also adopt a closed-door policy, surviving on the sheer number of consumers within their own economy, and the vast amount of land allocated to agriculture?</p>

              <p>Many PRCs there btw. Even in this forum, there are a few Singaporeans who migrated there. During their booming period, many foreigners were working there (pls google). It is only when they start to slump did they start kicking some out.</p>
              <p>Or you could teach Singaporeans to be more hardworking than now. Do you know how much overtime they do? They are not Europeans, die die must knock off at 5.</p>
              <p>Then again, you could help Singapore to reach 20 mil population so that we have a larger workforce. Like that don't need foreigners also. Or just be like China, with 1.3 billion pple. Really don't need foreigners to work also can function.</p>
              <p>If they are really that good, their economy wouldn't be in a slump for such a long time while the rest of the world was booming.</p>

              <p>Singapore's 900k FTs and FWs don't all come from China too. 1.5 million foreigners for Japan might be a small percentage, but it is certainly a huge number.</p>
              <p>And according to the MIT Encyclopedia of the Japanese Economy by Robert C. Hsu, in the 1980s, many small businesses began to hire illegal foreign workers willing to take low-paid undesirable jobs shunned by the japanese. Rather than letting this happen too much in Singapore, wouldn't it be better if it was legalised, especially if the economy requires it?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I chose Hong Kong because their usable land area is roughly the same as Singapore's due to their many mountainous areas. And HK, having China as her hinterland, has so many other factors that will make it a better trading place than Singapore.</p>

              <p>I am not against foriegn talent if they are real "talents" nor i am against the low end workers that help to built the economy, The difference between the old guards and the current PAP is now they use population as a means to grow the economy rather then just using FT with special skills to fill the gap. That is the difference. Now we have the average joes taking up Singapore PR and there isnt a choice because of the falling birth rates and failing to develop R&amp;D in the 90s.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I believe that foreign talents has difficulty to break in to the Japanese working industry is because of the language barrier and government policy. Many foreigner end up working as English teacher when first arrived in Japan. The job opportunity is rare for foreigner who can't speak native language because local people only speak Japanese.</p></div>

              <p>Many PRCs there btw. Even in this forum, there are a few Singaporeans who migrated there. During their booming period, many foreigners were working there (pls google). It is only when they start to slump did they start kicking some out.</p>
              <p>Or you could teach Singaporeans to be more hardworking than now. Do you know how much overtime they do? They are not Europeans, die die must knock off at 5.</p>
              <p>Then again, you could help Singapore to reach 20 mil population so that we have a larger workforce. Like that don't need foreigners also. Or just be like China, with 1.3 billion pple. Really don't need foreigners to work also can function.</p>
              <p>If they are really that good, their economy wouldn't be in a slump for such a long time while the rest of the world was booming.</p>

              <p>singapore  has enough workers to support the companies in terms of numbers.</p>
              <p>Its a question of how capable is our system able to produce the workforce with the required skills.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I remember that some years back there was a big batch of poly grads in engine who have been trying to switch line due to whatever reasons. Once upon a time , people were welcome to take engine. see-see-do-do , many jumped in. and then...</p>

              <p>we need visionary education system to educate and train workers for the future. how difficult to understand this?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>without vision, even with enough manpower, there will be shortage of skilled professionals.  skilled professionals got their job after they study certain courses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>education should be free to allow all to stand equal opportunity to learn and empower themselves.  Australia proves free education is possible and admired by all in the world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>with budget surplus, why not invest in our citizens? should also invest in citizens regardless of race language or religion and FAMILY TIES.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and then nebber forget, sgp is tiny with tiny population to train, educate and control. A so-called 1st world country (of course i must say i agree), with no more than 1 city to manage. 40 sq kilometers?  what i mean is, sg is lucky as it is tiny and large countries are not as lucky. They may not be able to train all their citizens well.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if the plan is to continue relying on FT, for the sake of employers or otherwise, sg will continue to increase its reliance on FT which is nebber good.</p>
