And it was easy to make a mistep and offend people and this had a huge impact on doing or running businesses.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Japanese have a deep sense of pride and honour. The surrender during WW2 was a blow to their dignity. Thus, the people were of one mind to build up the country up again.<br><br>Just think of Hitler and the German people after WW1.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by reddressman:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi,<br><br>When Japan became world power,<br><br>they did not rely on FT.<br><br>By the word 'rely' I do not mean ZERO reliance.<br><br>I mean you can characterise Japan's rise as not relying on FT.<br><br>It so SELF - RELIANT that foreigners could not break into the market.<br><br>Yes, there are some minority that are there now. But that is nothing.<br><br>So, Why JIPON aber to boleh while the rest wannabees not aber leh?<br><br>Did Jipon have a better system of producing their own talents and cultivated their own talents and placed their citizens 1st?<br><br></div></blockquote> Japan was a superpower even before WW2!! Meiji Restoration began in 1968, they changed to western cloth, brought in many western engineers, teachers ....the FT doing jobs that nobody in Japan could do. You watch the movie Samurai? Who says they did not rely on foreigners?<br><br>Today, do you know how many PRC, Korean, Philippinos ....in China? the only different from Singapore is the absence of many Indians, due to cultural discrimination. They are there in restaurant business, entertainment business ...but because of the very strong Japanese cultural heritage, foreigners cannot penetrate into the society.<br><br>In the case of Singapore, the only difference is that singaporean don't have the strong cultural heritage to defend foreign culture, instead many leave to join another culture. Blame the government, blame other singaporeans, better blame your parents, why you not born in an FT family.</div>
