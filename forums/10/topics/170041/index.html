            <div class='col-md body'>Further to my original posting under 'Does Lee Kuan Yew and his family think we Singaporeans are DUMB?' and the responses received, I think the issue here is not whether Singapore is a democracy or an authoritarian state or even whether how successful Singapore has been economically.......The ISSUE here is how is that 4 family members, being MM Lee, PM Lee, Ho Ching and BG Lee Hsien Yang, who are all closely related be able to control the key multi billion dollars financial portfolios in Singapore mainly being GIC, Temasek and Singtel....OOOH!!! by the way i'm sure all of you are aware that the main and only shareholder of Temasek is the Finance Ministry. And make a guess who is the Minister of Finance in Singapore..??? Our dear Mr Prime Minister is the Minister of Finance!!! Where exactly are the check and balances here when everyone holding the key portfolios are related within the Lee family???? The funding used by the Ministry of Finance, GIC and Temasek is the hard earned money of Singaporeans who slog day and night to make ends meet......Does the Lee family have the God given right to stick their fingers into every pie!!! Isn't there anyone else in Singapore qualified enough to run this portfolios??? or are we all Singaporeans simply DUMB for the Lee family??....I can name you 10 other people, within the government or the private sector, who are fit enough to be the Chairman of GIC or to run Temasek...No accounts are ever published of our secretive hedge fund being GIC....Temasek has only lately been releasing basic details of its annual performance.......So how much is Ho Ching, PMs wife and CEO of Temasek being paid here exactly???<br><br>Singaporeans are not even allowed to view the 'Financial Disclosure' of all cabinet members....According to the prime ministers office...'All ministers are required to disclose their private interest' (including sources of income, assets and liabilities) to the President via the Prime Minister...This disclosure are done in confidence and not made public'....interesting point to note here is that financial disclosure to be done via the PM....who exactly verifies LKY and PM Lee Hsien Loongs assets and liabilities???? The President does?? The President who lives in the Istana, where the Senior Minister works from the Istana and I bet the PM has an office in the Istana as well.....All checks and balances under 1 roof!!!! Are we fools !!! In England under the 'Freedom of Information Act' any British citizen has the right to view all the assets and liabilities of their leaders....everyone in America knows how poor or rich George Bush is....but we poor Singaporeans dont know what is going on besides constantly being assured that check and balances are in place!!!<br><br>As a Singaporean with no political ties and who pays taxes..I believe we have every right to question the government here on who the gate keeper of our hard earned income saved is and what is going on behind the scenes in all this closely related family appointments!!!!<br><br>I think Mr Lee Senior and the PM has to remember that the Lee family and the PAP work for us Singaporeans NOT us Singaporeans working for the Lee family and the PAP!!!! We the working class in Singapore are the shareholders of Singapore Inc NOT the Lee family and the PAP!!!!<br><br>To put all questions raised at rest, I once again call for a an Independent Board of Enquiry, headed by a judge and non PAP party members, into all the appointments held by the Lee family members!!!<br></div>
