              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I urge the govt to consider amending the law to abolish death penalty for drug trafficking. The reasons are as follows:</span></p>
              <p>1. Death penalty is an inhumane punishment. It should not be used lightly and inappropriately.</p>
              <p>2. The motive of drug trafficking is for money. So acts of drug trafficking don't deserve death penalty.</p>
              <p>3. Drug traffickers should not solely be blamed for the availability of drug in Singapore. There are sellers of drugs who buy from traffickers and sell them to drug addicts.</p>
              <p>4. Drug addicts buy drugs voluntarily. If you are not interested in narcotic drugs, you would not take it even if it is free of charge.</p>
              <p>5. Many Western countries view death penalty very negatively. Punishing people from these countries with death penalty would result to controversies and bad publicity for the country.</p>
              <p>6. Abolishing death penalty for drug trafficking would be a humane act which should be a value espouses by the National Kindness Movement.</p>
              <p>ã€€</p>
              <p>I appeal to you and all MPs to actively support this suggestion.</p>

              <p><br>Drug traffickers deserve death ! The only think I want to say is that more stringent procedures to differentiate between who is the drug smuggler and who is the drug user. Depends, and then we also have to be careful to identify who is the drug mule. Some drug mules were tricked into taking the drugs because they didn't know as somebody slip the drugs into their luggage. So we got to more careful so don't catch the wrong person or innocent peple.</p>
              <p>Other than that, intentional drug traffickers deserve death. Drug syndicates kill people and rival businesses. So many people get killed to smuggle the drug here. Also the consumption of drugs kill so many users, render them useless to society because addiction make them unable to work and become burden to families. Drug addicts also steal and hurt innocent people to extort money to help them buy drugs. THere are cases drug addicts go crazy, hallucinate and start killing people.</p>
              <p>Drug traffickers are in the same league as Pedophiles, Serial Killers and Murderers.</p>

              <p>I feel that the government is right in implementing this death penalty on drug smugglers. As humans, we are always looking for ways to pleasure ourselves, and sadly, consuming drugs have been a way to relieve pain and suffering, physically and mentally. This is good, however there are too many side effects that come hand in hand. </p>
              <p>If substance abuse consists of needles, the risk of transmitting STD is there. Drugs are not readily available, so I presume that the cost of these drugs should be pretty high. Where are they going to find the money to sustain their lifestyle, stealing and robbing? </p>
              <p>The sad thing is, once you try it for the first time, chances are you will be very likely to return to that drug and abuse it again. If we can deter these people from coming in, and even let these potential abuser from even trying the first time, the death penalty must stay. I'm all for the death penalty. </p>

              <p>I think we said this from the bottom of our heart, do you want your son or youngster become runners or druggies? We might be influenced by other countries who do not have capital punishment due to their homogenous believe with regard to their religion and strong human rights culture that forbid their govt or anyone being voted to rule to change it. If given a chance, I believe Obama will love capital punishment to deter all his drug and druglord problem in USA, but he is hand tightened, as the western believe and culture do not believe in taking one life.</p>
              <p>We on the other hand, had this laws in our country, by and large, it had serve us well, and even in a multi religious society, its still in line with the Asia conservatives strict laws, given china and most muslim states also have death penalty. Therefore, in views of all the arguements presented here, I will said that we are actually blessed with such laws and orders that had served us well and deterred many from getting abused with drug and its vice activities. Thanks you</p>
