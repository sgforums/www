              <p>we are initially born like the early men, who haunt, naive and
              behave like animals, but since civilisation takes over, and we
              learn to eat in a proper manner, treat each other with respect and
              care for each other, but in civilisation, some of us become more
              evil, and these are dangerous, we call it intellectually evil,
              people knows and planned their evil deeds to destroy one another,
              you can see it in your everyday life.</p>
              <p>If you let a child to roam by him/herself, he/she will get into
              bad influence easier than doing the good thing, cos human by
              nature, preferred fun and the easy way out of life, they hate
              discipline and routine life. But if you care for the child, groom
              him up with all the good habits and knowledge, he become
              civilised.</p>
              <p>Having said that, there two kind of evil, one are good at heart,
              but living in a evil condition and thereby leading a evil life, you
              can see some gangsters are actually good at heart and some really
              very nasty. I call this the white spot among the black surface, and
              if you look at another kind of evil which is the most dangerous,
              these are evil living within the good peoples, I call it the black
              spot among the white surface. These are cunning people who can kill
              or eat you even without you knowning.</p>
              <p>In taiwan, my buddhist master nun in a nunnery which i
              attended, tho buddhist by nature, she taught me the logo of taoism.
              If you look at it, you can see the white and the black spots within
              the two separate surfaces, and this go round and round, forming the
              world surrounded by earth, wind, fire, storm, rain, sunny etc etc.
              I also asked my Master, why there must be evil, can we not have
              evil, she said, evil is in everyone emotion, it just that the good
              one knows how to stop it, however, without evil, this world cannot
              survive, the ying yang rule applied.</p>

              <p>Ah.. I forgot about the reply to my post.</p>
              <p>Anyways u were talking about civilisation ? What is civilistion ? Civilization may be defined as a society of human beings living 
              according to more or less, a defined pattern or social, cultural and 
              possible religious doctrines. And people who do lead their lives 
              according to this set pattern would be considered in the circle of 
              civilized beings.</p>
              <p>Even if you say we were like animals, I am sure then the mother does not eat the young ? And perhaps they were more "savage" in your eyes now fast forwarded a few thousand years, but given the time and situation then, were they not "civilised" ?</p>
              <p>No doubt civilisation has made people become more evil,a few, some or majority I dont know, but beside the point of that, it still does not explain how man are evil to begin with.</p>
              <p>Eating in a proper manner, who says the way I eat my chicken is savage while u eating with spoon and fork are not ? Again the terms like civilized and savage are socially constructed. Unless you give a more clearer objectively defined term, eventhough I understand what you are talking about, I have to add alot of assumptions for it to become logical and persuasive to me.</p>
              <p>While you are getting religious in viewing "evil" its fine and all, but if I input religion as factor, then it may mean that civilisation and religion are almost synonomous to the upbringing and nurturing of good and/or what good is. While I do not disagree, it still does not answer your thought that man or humans are evil to begin with.</p>
              <p>Letting a baby roaming around doing what he likes is not evil. Unless having fun and exploring things in an infant level is considered evil, then I got nothing to say. So again, u talk about nurturing by parents, again that does not mean that they are born evil. We all grew up and learn good and evil. If we were inherently evil, we will all be evil and at the young age we wouldve have murderous thoughts. Lack of knowledge or intellectual capacity does not equate to evil.</p>
              <p>All in all its good with your explaination but you have only explained it in a religious point of view of evil.</p>
              <p>Are we more "civilised" ? I dont think so. Compared to the dark ages. Technologically more advance ? Yes.</p>
              <p>Philosophy and Theology once debated the cause of evil in the world, 
              speculating whether it had a metaphysical nature:
              is it a fundamental part of the cosmos which competes with goodness?
              Or is it because of the free Will of Humankind?
              Then, of course, they debate free will vs determinism.</p>
              <p>While you give a more religious account, I was hoping for something more different then the usual.</p>
              <p>Each of us has a brain with a very large associative cortex.
              The largest part of a human brain is not hardwired at birth.
              The possiblities for each young brain are inestimable at that point in life.
              And the complexity of all the possible circuits that can develop in a human brain 
              are, well, mind boggling. According to science that is.</p>
              <p>In short, as we grow and develop, these circuits are connected, and when wired wrong, like a computer suffering from malware, causes it to do something contrary to the specifications intended.</p>
              <p>So are we evil since birth ? I have to disagree with you on that point. But opinions like assholes. everyone's got one. Its who's shit that stinks more is the subject of debate lol!</p>

              <p>A ten foot or longer pole.  From rear exit of alimentary canal out through the mouth, missing all the vital organs.  Still alive to enjoy the birds and the ants.  Bad things those Romans. believe me this, that group of hippies called Our Lord Saviour Jesus and his crew.  Lions and coliseums...</p>

              <p>1. Drug addicts suffer, get addicted, and cannot control themselves. It is illegal for anybody to possess illegal drug, so they get punished by the law as well.</p>
              <p>Do we need to show you how cigarette can spoil health of smokers? How else do you think cigarette manufacturers should be blamed?</p>
              <p>2. Drug smugglers bring in drugs, they should be hanged. Drug sellers buy drug and sell, they should be hanged. All 4 parties are responsible, and are punishable by law.</p>
              <p>Actually there is a 5th party, those who protect the drugs smugglers. they should be caught and put to jail, write a million words, "I will not protect drug smugglers".</p>

              <p>Julia Bohl was 23 when she was charged with trafficking over 687 grams of cannabis, which carries the death penalty if she was convicted.The amount was later reduced to 281 grams out of the block of 687 grams of vegetable matter, if you believed the chemist's analysis.

              <p>Ah.. I forgot about the reply to my post.</p>
              <p>Anyways u were talking about civilisation ? What is civilistion ? Civilization may be defined as a society of human beings living according to more or less, a defined pattern or social, cultural and possible religious doctrines. And people who do lead their lives according to this set pattern would be considered in the circle of civilized beings.</p>
              <p>Even if you say we were like animals, I am sure then the mother does not eat the young ? And perhaps they were more "savage" in your eyes now fast forwarded a few thousand years, but given the time and situation then, were they not "civilised" ?</p>
              <p>No doubt civilisation has made people become more evil,a few, some or majority I dont know, but beside the point of that, it still does not explain how man are evil to begin with.</p>
              <p>Eating in a proper manner, who says the way I eat my chicken is savage while u eating with spoon and fork are not ? Again the terms like civilized and savage are socially constructed. Unless you give a more clearer objectively defined term, eventhough I understand what you are talking about, I have to add alot of assumptions for it to become logical and persuasive to me.</p>
              <p>While you are getting religious in viewing "evil" its fine and all, but if I input religion as factor, then it may mean that civilisation and religion are almost synonomous to the upbringing and nurturing of good and/or what good is. While I do not disagree, it still does not answer your thought that man or humans are evil to begin with.</p>
              <p>Letting a baby roaming around doing what he likes is not evil. Unless having fun and exploring things in an infant level is considered evil, then I got nothing to say. So again, u talk about nurturing by parents, again that does not mean that they are born evil. We all grew up and learn good and evil. If we were inherently evil, we will all be evil and at the young age we wouldve have murderous thoughts. Lack of knowledge or intellectual capacity does not equate to evil.</p>
              <p>All in all its good with your explaination but you have only explained it in a religious point of view of evil.</p>
              <p>Are we more "civilised" ? I dont think so. Compared to the dark ages. Technologically more advance ? Yes.</p>
              <p>Philosophy and Theology once debated the cause of evil in the world, speculating whether it had a metaphysical nature: is it a fundamental part of the cosmos which competes with goodness? Or is it because of the free Will of Humankind? Then, of course, they debate free will vs determinism.</p>
              <p>While you give a more religious account, I was hoping for something more different then the usual.</p>
              <p>Each of us has a brain with a very large associative cortex. The largest part of a human brain is not hardwired at birth. The possiblities for each young brain are inestimable at that point in life. And the complexity of all the possible circuits that can develop in a human brain are, well, mind boggling. According to science that is.</p>
              <p>In short, as we grow and develop, these circuits are connected, and when wired wrong, like a computer suffering from malware, causes it to do something contrary to the specifications intended.</p>
              <p>So are we evil since birth ? I have to disagree with you on that point. But opinions like assholes. everyone's got one. Its who's shit that stinks more is the subject of debate lol!</p>

              <p>But for the offender, life in a small cell is a cruel and inhuman punishment, and death is great. Actually beheading by chopping off at one chop is the best.

              <p><br>That is why you must know where is the limit of respect line, we respect people of much variety, from dish collector to tyhcoon, the condition and atomsphere also determine our limitation. Like a guy, who dated me and got no money or lack of money to pay the bills, what kind of respect limitation can you give to such a guy?? Repect or no respect given differentiate from each individual, and that is why you got different thinkers, you got arguement, fighting, debate, forums etc etc to voice or express it out.</p>
