              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I urge the govt to consider amending the law to abolish death penalty for drug trafficking. The reasons are as follows:</span></p>
              <p>1. Death penalty is an inhumane punishment. It should not be used lightly and inappropriately.</p>
              <p>2. The motive of drug trafficking is for money. So acts of drug trafficking don't deserve death penalty.</p>
              <p>3. Drug traffickers should not solely be blamed for the availability of drug in Singapore. There are sellers of drugs who buy from traffickers and sell them to drug addicts.</p>
              <p>4. Drug addicts buy drugs voluntarily. If you are not interested in narcotic drugs, you would not take it even if it is free of charge.</p>
              <p>5. Many Western countries view death penalty very negatively. Punishing people from these countries with death penalty would result to controversies and bad publicity for the country.</p>
              <p>6. Abolishing death penalty for drug trafficking would be a humane act which should be a value espouses by the National Kindness Movement.</p>
              <p>ã€€</p>
              <p>I appeal to you and all MPs to actively support this suggestion.</p>

              <p>1) The wrong gets punished. I see nothing with that</p>
              <p>2) Yes money, thats why you need a stern punishment</p>
              <p>3) The one who sold and bought should be blamed. Who said sellers aint blamed ?</p>
              <p>4) Voluntarily commiting the offence ? I see what you mean there</p>
              <p>5) Bad publicity ? Check up how many countries actually has the death penalty as their punishment</p>
              <p>6) See 1</p>

              <p>You still fail to see the message.</p>
              <p>Reducing trafficking to a mere CIQ offence would encourage trafficking in drugs.</p>
              <p>Death is the ultimate deterrent, if that fails, then I advocate hold it at that level and not compromise.</p>

              <p><br>Sure, it is also impossible to prevent anything from coming into singapore, however, we can minimise it, by taking up the preventative measures, that is either thru laws, orders or censorship. And prevention is better than cure.</p>
              <p>By setting up a stern laws and orders here on drug smuggling, the laws have so far, serve us well, we may see some drug movement going out, but definitely, very minor, and surely very much less than other countries. So, why should we amend a laws that had served us so well thru out our nation building and so on? Aren't we kicking ourselves to abolish it? If the west do not serve capital punishment, that does not mean we have to follow them, we are no more their colonies, why should we follow them on those bad laws, we take only the good from them, leave the bad for themselves.</p>
              <p>If PAP is unable to eradicate people like you, you think the police can eradicate all smugglers?? it is a cat and mouse game ya</p>

              <p>the purpose of the death sentence is not to eradicate the drug problem but to reduce it.  the death sentence serves as a deterrent.  there are countries without the death sentence.  why bring drugs here when they know we have the death sentence?  if the mule doesnt want to die for his silly crime dont traffick drugs into singapore.  bring it to countries that do not have the death penalty. </p>
              <p>its simple and straight forward.</p>

              <p>The death sentence for drug traffickers is not to solve the problem, but to deal with the traffickers. Lesser punishment is not sufficient, the max is death.</p>
