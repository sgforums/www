              <p>Failing to murder the green green thing. What else is there for us to help our environment?</p>
              <p>we have to be hostile to illegal drugs.  Death penalty, no matter how abhorrent is iron, platinum and palladium chop and seal.</p>
              <p>Do you cry for the drug addicts? Do you cry for their mothers? Do you cry for their wives? Do you cry for their children?</p>
              <p>The profits from illegal drugs ----- Were the bullets bought by drug money in the oberoi Trident?  I heard some boom boom were financed as such.</p>

              <p>we are initially born like the early men, who haunt, naive and behave like animals, but since civilisation takes over, and we learn to eat in a proper manner, treat each other with respect and care for each other, but in civilisation, some of us become more evil, and these are dangerous, we call it intellectually evil, people knows and planned their evil deeds to destroy one another, you can see it in your everyday life.</p>
              <p>If you let a child to roam by him/herself, he/she will get into bad influence easier than doing the good thing, cos human by nature, preferred fun and the easy way out of life, they hate discipline and routine life. But if you care for the child, groom him up with all the good habits and knowledge, he become civilised.</p>
              <p>Having said that, there two kind of evil, one are good at heart, but living in a evil condition and thereby leading a evil life, you can see some gangsters are actually good at heart and some really very nasty. I call this the white spot among the black surface, and if you look at another kind of evil which is the most dangerous, these are evil living within the good peoples, I call it the black spot among the white surface. These are cunning people who can kill or eat you even without you knowning.</p>
              <p>In taiwan, my buddhist master nun in a nunnery which i attended, tho buddhist by nature, she taught me the logo of taoism. If you look at it, you can see the white and the black spots within the two separate surfaces, and this go round and round, forming the world surrounded by earth, wind, fire, storm, rain, sunny etc etc. I also asked my Master, why there must be evil, can we not have evil, she said, evil is in everyone emotion, it just that the good one knows how to stop it, however, without evil, this world cannot survive, the ying yang rule applied.</p>

              <div class="inset_panel">
              <div></div>
              <br>South
                   Korea's parliament voted Tuesday to legalize chemical castration as 
                  punishment for convicted child sex offenders after a series of violent 
                  assaults sparked outrage nationwide.</div>
              <p>The bill was first introduced
                   in 2008 in response to a high-profile case in which a 58-year-old man 
                  raped and assaulted an 8-year-old girl. The attack caused widespread 
                  revulsion and left the victim with lasting physical injuries.</p>
              <p>Government
                   policies, including the installation of more security personnel near 
                  school grounds as well as multiple surveillance cameras, have not 
                  prevented a series of similar cases.</p>
              <p>A 33-year-old man who raped 
                  and murdered a 13-year-old girl in February was sentenced to death last 
                  week. In another high-profile case, a 45-year-old man allegedly 
                  kidnapped a student from her elementary school and raped her in the 
                  basement of a church.</p>
              <p>South Korean legislators at the National 
                  Assembly passed the bill by a vote of 137-13. More than 140 lawmakers 
                  either did not make a choice or did not vote. The legislation would take
                   effect a year after being signed into law.</p>
              <p>The legislation, which
                   requires the South Korean president's signature to become law, would 
                  allow judges to sentence adult sex offenders who victimize minors under 
                  16 and have been diagnosed as sexual deviants to chemical castration.</p>
              <p>It was unclear if President Lee Myung-bak would sign it. He is on a visit to Latin America and his office would not comment.</p>
              <p>The
                   procedure involves the administration of testosterone-suppressing 
                  hormones intended to curb sexual drive. Offenders would also receive 
                  behavioral and psychological therapies.</p>
              <p>Dr. Howard Zonana, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, said questions remain on such treatment.</p>
              <p>"It's hard to say with a degree of exactitude on the effectiveness of chemical castration," Zonana said.</p>
              <p>He
                   said that for it to be effective, it must first be determined whether 
                  offenders are pedophiliacs, who have a strong attraction to children, or
                   non-sexual deviants possessing other underlying psychiatric disorders 
                  that cause them to act violently.</p>
              <p>If signed into law, South Korea 
                  would become the first country in Asia to legalize chemical castration, 
                  according to Yoo Jin-hee, an aide to Park Young-sun, a member of the 
                  assembly's Legislation and Judiciary Committee.</p>
              <p>In the United 
                  States, several states including Louisiana, California, Oregon and 
                  Arizona have laws allowing chemical castration. In Europe, countries 
                  including Britain, Denmark and Sweden offer chemical castration drugs to
                   sex offenders to control sexual urges on a voluntary basis. Last year, 
                  Poland legalized the procedure for offenders who rape minors under age 
                  15 or close relatives. It is administered on court order.</p>
              <p>The measure is just one of a long line that South Korea has turned to
                   after a spate of assaults. Parents formed monitoring groups to escort 
                  their children to and from schools. The government enforced the wearing 
                  of electronic ankle bracelets to monitor the movements of sex offenders 
                  and endorsed disclosing their identities to the public. The city council
                   in the southern port city of Busan offered 5,000 whistles to children 
                  to blow for help.</p>
              <p>Some critics of the procedure have argued that 
                  while it may stop sex crimes, it doesn't necessarily prevent other 
                  violent crimes. Civil liberties advocates have also called the procedure
                   barbaric, and some papers in South Korea raised ethical concerns. But 
                  many supported the move.</p>
              <p>"It's meaningless and useless to debate 
                  whether chemical castration by nature violates basic human rights," the 
                  Hankook Ilbo newspaper wrote in an editorial on its website after the 
                  legislation passed, saying that it cannot compare to the suffering of 
                  victims.</p>
              <p>David Benjamin, a Ph.D who is a clinical pharmacologist 
                  and forensic toxicologist at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center in 
                  Boston, said hindering physically arousal may not deter mental arousal.</p>
              <p>"Arousal
                   is in the brain," he said. "It transfers to a bodily function when you

              <h1>To my surprise, not only South Korea does chemical castration, so does US, Denmark, Sweden, UK and Poland.<br><br>SKorea votes to legalize chemical castration</h1>
              <div><em>AP - Wednesday, June 30, 2010 11:42:37 AM By SANGWON YOON</em></div>
              <div>&lt;!--Sharing Module--&gt;<br>South Korea's parliament voted Tuesday to legalize chemical castration as punishment for convicted child sex offenders after a series of violent assaults sparked outrage nationwide.</div>
              <p>The bill was first introduced in 2008 in response to a high-profile case in which a 58-year-old man raped and assaulted an 8-year-old girl. The attack caused widespread revulsion and left the victim with lasting physical injuries.</p>
              <p>Government policies, including the installation of more security personnel near school grounds as well as multiple surveillance cameras, have not prevented a series of similar cases.</p>
              <p>A 33-year-old man who raped and murdered a 13-year-old girl in February was sentenced to death last week. In another high-profile case, a 45-year-old man allegedly kidnapped a student from her elementary school and raped her in the basement of a church.</p>
              <p>South Korean legislators at the National Assembly passed the bill by a vote of 137-13. More than 140 lawmakers either did not make a choice or did not vote. The legislation would take effect a year after being signed into law.</p>
              <p>The legislation, which requires the South Korean president's signature to become law, would allow judges to sentence adult sex offenders who victimize minors under 16 and have been diagnosed as sexual deviants to chemical castration.</p>
              <p>It was unclear if President Lee Myung-bak would sign it. He is on a visit to Latin America and his office would not comment.</p>
              <p>The procedure involves the administration of testosterone-suppressing hormones intended to curb sexual drive. Offenders would also receive behavioral and psychological therapies.</p>
              <p>Dr. Howard Zonana, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, said questions remain on such treatment.</p>
              <p>"It's hard to say with a degree of exactitude on the effectiveness of chemical castration," Zonana said.</p>
              <p>He said that for it to be effective, it must first be determined whether offenders are pedophiliacs, who have a strong attraction to children, or non-sexual deviants possessing other underlying psychiatric disorders that cause them to act violently.</p>
              <p>If signed into law, South Korea would become the first country in Asia to legalize chemical castration, according to Yoo Jin-hee, an aide to Park Young-sun, a member of the assembly's Legislation and Judiciary Committee.</p>
              <p>In the United States, several states including Louisiana, California, Oregon and Arizona have laws allowing chemical castration. In Europe, countries including Britain, Denmark and Sweden offer chemical castration drugs to sex offenders to control sexual urges on a voluntary basis. Last year, Poland legalized the procedure for offenders who rape minors under age 15 or close relatives. It is administered on court order.</p>
              <p>The measure is just one of a long line that South Korea has turned to after a spate of assaults. Parents formed monitoring groups to escort their children to and from schools. The government enforced the wearing of electronic ankle bracelets to monitor the movements of sex offenders and endorsed disclosing their identities to the public. The city council in the southern port city of Busan offered 5,000 whistles to children to blow for help.</p>
              <p>Some critics of the procedure have argued that while it may stop sex crimes, it doesn't necessarily prevent other violent crimes. Civil liberties advocates have also called the procedure barbaric, and some papers in South Korea raised ethical concerns. But many supported the move.</p>
              <p>"It's meaningless and useless to debate whether chemical castration by nature violates basic human rights," the Hankook Ilbo newspaper wrote in an editorial on its website after the legislation passed, saying that it cannot compare to the suffering of victims.</p>
              <p>David Benjamin, a Ph.D who is a clinical pharmacologist and forensic toxicologist at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center in Boston, said hindering physically arousal may not deter mental arousal.</p>
              <p>"Arousal is in the brain," he said. "It transfers to a bodily function when you become aroused, but I don't know whether there has been enough scientific research to prove that hindering a bodily function can keep you from being aroused."<br><a title="http://www.mail.com/intl/article.aspx/science/0/apnews/science/20100629/u_as-skorea-chemical-castration?pageid=2&amp;amp;pCurr=1&amp;amp;pNext=2" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mail.com/intl/article.aspx/science/0/apnews/science/20100629/u_as-skorea-chemical-castration?pageid=2&amp;amp;pCurr=1&amp;amp;pNext=2"><br>http://www.mail.com/intl/article.aspx/science/0/apnews/science/20100629/u_as-skorea-chemical-castration?pageid=2&amp;pCurr=1&amp;pNext=2</a></p>
