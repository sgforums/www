              <p><br>That is why you must know where is the limit of respect line, we respect people of much variety, from dish collector to tyhcoon, the condition and atomsphere also determine our limitation. Like a guy, who dated me and got no money or lack of money to pay the bills, what kind of respect limitation can you give to such a guy?? Repect or no respect given differentiate from each individual, and that is why you got different thinkers, you got arguement, fighting, debate, forums etc etc to voice or express it out.</p>

              <p><br>When you want to do something, you have to prepare yourself well, the respect limitation given here is that you are not well organised, so I have my limitation in respecting you, dating me out with no money to pay for a dinner provide a clear picture of a person you are, and my limitation on that day, is that I paid for it, dun make a big mess out of it and still be friend, that is the limitation of my respect, for other girls, they may give you a tight slap and walk off making your a lame guy.</p>
              <p>I love and respect guy who are well organised, plan before doing it, it can be either going to a hotel or dinner or anything, but as long as he can organise it well, and not to burden me or put me in an embarassing position, I would gladly accepted him. But sad to say, many sing guys dun plan well, either they are too excited till hands and legs wobbling or they are simply, thinking of sex with us.</p>

              <p>Based on PRP's logic, no crime deserves a death penalty as he strongly believes that all criminals should be given 2nd or many chances to repent and it is not humane to kill a life no matter what heinuous crimes he or she has committed.</p>

              <p>Kill people does not mean automatic death sentence. Sometimes only 18 months jail, sometimes 6 years jail. Auto accidents, manslaughter.</p>

              <p>Arson, sometimes even with no deaths or injuries, death penalty.</p>
