            <div class='col-md body'>The MP5 is not issued to infantry formations, for reason obvious.  Police units within Changi will have access to the submachine guns should the situation arise. Why M-16s and SAR-21s?  The airport terminals aren't really tight confined places.  Though a carbine would be more efficient, such weapons are not available.
