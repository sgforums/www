            <div class='col-md body'>According to MM Lee his ministers were talents and million-dollar salaries have to be paid to them to retain such talents.<br><br>Based on such assumptions, people have been watching and waiting for years for him to prove that his ministers who have left the governmnet service and re-employed by the private sector have gone on to make waves in the private sector with making of the same million-dollar salaries justified by the making of great profits for such companies.<br><br>Ex-PM Goh Chok Tong himself was confident to predict that his ex-minister like Dr. Wong would make it big in the private sector. So today we are waiting to see if ex-government ministers like Dr. Wong, Dr. Tan, Mr. Lim, Mr. Yong etc had gone on to make million dollar salaries and successfully manage private sector companies after they left the service or were there merely special posts reserved for them in the GLCs to prove their talents were still wanted.<br><br>People will be waiting for Mr. Lim Boon Heng or Dr. Lee Boon Yang to make splash in the private sector to prove their perceived talents as advertised by MM Lee. They have been waiting for quite a while now to see if Mr. Yeo too will turn around private companies like Aztech or FHTK to prove his talents.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So the subservient State Times will have to report some news like ex-minister Yeo Cheow Tong returning to the private sector and doing well to prove further MM Lee's pet theory that his ministers were full of talents.<br><br>What comes across very clearly is that MM Lee's pet theory has not changed a bit that talents were to be found within the narrow confine of exclusive group of academic elites and nowhere else in the little red dot.<br><br>So the vintage MM Lee will continue to harp on his pet theory to attract this particular group of talents which to him is too small with big monies like million dollar salaries, big bonuses and life-long pensions.<br><br>But despite such extensive casting of net whom has he really attracted . Are they not some greenhorns or some who possess only high academic records. Has he really attracted those with rare passionate convictions advance ideas and entrepreneurship or those with proven practical implementation ability.<br><br>Obviously IQ representative of academic talents alone is not necessarily a quality of good leaders. Without EQ, highly qualified elites would be just plain flowers on the wall for decoration.<br><br>MM Lee should have found out for himself that if he wanted performance and delivery of result he could not rely on academicians alone.<br><br>He should look for the few little Thaksins or Lim Kim Sans who might not be so highly qualified but who are otherwise the rare group with implementation abilities very much harder to find as compared with the educated elites.<br><br>So who are the true talents fit to be our new leaders who could lead a more educated people in today's highly competitive globalized environment?<br><br>Can we attract them with higher salaries bigger bonuses and life-long pensions as MM Lee has assumed in all his policies?<br><br>There is a need to look at other more important factors e.g. environmental factor which may be even more important in attracting talents.<br><br>Why is it that MM Lee was unable to find more men with outstanding implementation skills like Lim Kim San or Dr. Goh Keng Swee in the later years from 1970s onwards.<br><br>Is it because Singapore does not have any more capable people who could measure up to the calibre of men like Lim Kim San or Dr. Goh Keng Swee.<br><br>I would think that not all people will be attracted to million-dollar salaries. Talents do not necessarily draw to monies. It is a two-way process in attracting talents as the talents too will have to decide for themselves whether the prevailing conditions will allow them to contribute their abilities or talents to a job well done.<br><br>Potential candidates do not respond lightly to praises from MM Lee or being spotted or invited for tea. Good men will not necessarily measure their calling in monies.<br><br>There are many other pertinent factors which MM Lee does not bother with for his own limited purpose. Remember Kong Ming (Zhu Ker Liang) had to be persuaded thrice with great show of deference before he finally accepted the offer of post of state counsellor to Liu Biu.<br><br>Real talents also do not work by currying favors of others or superiors. They usually are convicted to their belief or philosophy and will be people who are extremely proactive with independence of thought and actions.<br><br>Given our autocracy and self-centred authoritarian rule where one-man ideas is obeyed without question and the way many good and capable people were sidelined, demoted or forced to premature retirement how could he have attracted the true talents from among the very limited talents we have.<br><br>Therefore under such circumstances MM Lee will have to offer million-dollar salaries presumably as the only pragmatic solutions to attract talents but has he succeeded in this supreme and all-important task critical to our survival as a little red dot.<br><br>Today owing to his own failure in attracting talents what he has attracted might well be the mediocre people who dare not change the autocratic unworkable policies of the past but who would carry out orders or curry favor as the way to gain position of power for their own good.<br><br>To attract really good people to govern the country the authoritarian rule has to change. More ground work will have to be done and not just million dollar salaries before true talents could be attracted to come forward to serve.<br><br>So who at the end must change? If Singapore is to continue to prosper and talents will come forward there has to be total change of the politics and political environment to welcome and encourage team work and appreciation of excellence.<br><br>Today we could see some good men staying low-profile even within the cabinet to avoid getting themselves into trouble.<br><br>I am asking only for change or reconsideration of all the hype about attracting talents with money or elitism. There is a need to let good people be identified of those who are truly passionate and working diligently to serve the people to produce the greatest benefits for the greatest number.<br><br>If MM Lee insisted his talent hunting was still effective and pragmatic and his million-dollar incentivizing of good people to join as ministers as correct let him first prove that his ex-ministers have indeed the ability to lead in private sector after they left service.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is nothing at all for him to prove.   All he can do is to "package" the ministers by praising them, playing with words to brainwash people into believing him that his ministers worth millions.   A good product in no time will prove to consumers that it is worth the money to continue to buy the same product for consumption.   In the case of the ministers, the more they implement policies and act, all we can see is that they are getting worse to worst and nothing they have or have to offer are worthy for the good of the nation.</div>

Have you really immersed yourself so much into deep thought that you forgotten a very simple basic logic? A very basic economic theory? I'm very sure if I dig out my economics textbook, there is an explanation about this. This is a very simple truth.

He acquired certain talents from the ground up - ground zero.<br><br>Today, he does not appear to let anyone else work the way up and insisted to find ready champions like David Beckhams or Tiger Woods who asked for millions who might not necessarily deliver.<br><br>How is he going to recognize passions, commitments and create conditions within his government to allow the good and committed winners to come up in the rank and not suppress the little Lim Kim Sans or Thaksins all over the place because of his preconceived bias for ready status or paper qualification. How is he going to create a less oppressive governing system to encourage growth of team work and collective management excellence. He needs to think total and create a total management excellence so that it is possible for grooming and spotting all the true talents as an integral part of the whole process of talent hunting and talent grooming.<br><br>For years now he has been over-relying on getting ready champions which exist for their own particular one-time one-off performance in the past not not necessarily guaranteeing future success.<br><br>He himself was a little short on implementing ability as well unlike his Lim Kim San or Dr. Goh Keng Swee or Ong Teng Cheong so really he should change and make way for a more rounded and team work collective leadership one which will truly lead a more highly educated people today.<br><br>Assumptions which were relied on in the past has not worked and unless he himself change people will be misled by pure assumptions not proven.</div>
