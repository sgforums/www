            <div class='col-md body'><br>Govt wants to step up its engagement of citizens: PM Lee<br><br>Oct 12, 2006<br>AsiaOne<br><br>More and more Singaporeans are speaking up or writing in, and stepping forward to serve the community, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said tonight.<br><br>The government encourages this as it wants more people to care about issues, take them up and shape the character and life of Singapore society, he added.<br><br>Mr Lee, who was speaking at the Feedback Unit's 21st anniversary dinner in Pan Pacific Hotel, also announced that the unit's role would be expanded and its reach widened to engage all Singaporeans from every walk of life. To reflect this bigger role, the unit's name will be changed to REACH or Reaching Everyone for Active Citizenry@Home.<br><br>Other than tapping the new media, including blogs and SMS, extensively, REACH will have an interesting feature on its website (http://www.reach.gov.sg) in the form of an electronic townhall where Singaporeans can engage government agencies on multiple issues through real-time chats.<br><br>The traditonal role of the feedback unit will continue but there are plans to re-organise the various feedback groups to bring in new members and to take into account shifts in focus areas, including cross-agency issues that do not fall neatly into functional silos, Mr Lee said.<br><br>The told the gathering: "The government is committed to stepping up its engagement of citizens. But I hope Singaporeans also understand that good government cannot be based on feedback alone. On nearly every issue, there will be a range of views and ideas. Much as we would like to, it is impossible to make everyone happy with every individual policy." He added that at the end, it is the government's duty to decide based on the best interests of the nation.<br><br>The Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports released a statement tonight about the revamp and unveiled a logo for REACH.<br><br>It said REACH will also extend its bridge to Singaporeans living, working or studying abroad. Keeping in touch with these Singaporeans will enhance their sense of commitment and belonging to Singapore, the ministry statement added.<br><br>At home, REACH will work closely with community and grassroots organisations to reach out to more heartlanders.<br><br>The revamp follows a month-long public consultation exercise in September on ways to better engage Singaporeans to cultivate a more active citizenry.<br><br>The statement said 81 per cent of respondents felt that the Feedback Unit should continue its role in gathering feedback on government policies and issues, while 74 per cent wanted to see the unit continue as a bridge between the government and the people.<br></div>
