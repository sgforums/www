              <p>Charities expect public donations to fall in 2009<br><span>SINGAPORE: Charities in Singapore are bracing themselves for the worst in 2009, and some have already seen corporate funding dip in the last quarter of 2008. <br><br>Getting the public to donate is set to be harder in 2009 with the economic crunch. <br><br>One charity, the Singapore Red Cross, said it expects donations to fall by at least 20 per cent in the coming year. <br><br>It is stepping up fund-raising activities, like holding its annual flag day a month ahead in January. The Red Cross held its flag day late February this year, and raised S$180,000. <br><br>It also plans to have another fund-raising gala dinner in September as part of its 60th anniversary celebrations. <br><br>The humanitarian organisation said it needs to raise at least another S$2 million or about US$1.4 million next year to run its operations, which include running a home for the severely disabled, blood donation drives and subsidised first aid training for the public. <br><br>The Red Cross' annual operation costs come up to about S$6 million, with about S$3.5 million coming from the government. <br><br>"I'm very reluctant to cut our services, because this will affect the people who will need it most. We may have to cut on training. We could delay that," said the chairman of the Singapore Red Cross, Tee Tua Ba. <br><br>"We've already frozen all pay increases. We're also not filling up posts that have been left vacant through resignations and retirements. If need be, we may cut bonuses for our staff." <br><br>Another charity organisation, the Boys' Brigade, was forced to dip into its reserves for the first time this year, after corporate funding fell by half during its annual year-end donation drive. <br><br>"We just need to work harder and push our timetable a little bit earlier... We just need to talk and reach out to more people and other organisations that we've not been talking to," said the chairman of the Boys' Brigade Sharity Gift Box 2008, Lui Chong Chee. <br><br>The Red Cross has no plans to dip into its reserves yet, adding that donations given to disaster relief will not be touched. <br><br>To woo young donors, the Red Cross is taking its appeals online through websites like FaceBook. It also plans to recruit more volunteers to work on its corporate fundraising projects. <br><br>Community Chest, the fund-raising arm of the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), has also lined up some key fund-raising activities, such as a charity show on MediaCorp's Channel 8 in March. <br><br>NCSS is also exploring other avenues to help charities reduce costs. <br><br>- CNA</span></p>
