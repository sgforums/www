              <p>I have read the coverage on PM Lee interview on Channel News Asia
                      recently. What caught my eyes was naturally about the "next General
                      Election". Nope. It is not about any speculations on whether there will
                      be a General Election this year but rather how our Prime Minister made
                      his statement here.<br><br>The very first sentence read "The<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Government</span> will leverage on new media in the next <span style="font-weight: bold;">General Election</span>,
                      Prime Minister Lee Hisen Loong has said". I am not very sure whether
                      the Prime Minister has actually uttered that SPECIFIC wordings because
                      I do not have the chance to watch the whole interview but it seems to
                      me that it must be a "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Government</span>" stand on new media during "<span style="font-style: italic;">General Election</span>".<br><br>First of all, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">GOVERNMENT</span>,
                      which is filled with civil servants, has nothing to do with General
                      Election apart from making sure that the election is carried out in a
                      FAIR and JUST way. <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>During General Elections, the Cabinet will only be a care-taker government. Political parties and members <span style="font-weight: bold;">SHOULD NOT</span> utilize public resources for their political campaigns. How close PAP
                      has observed such democratic rules is up to anyone's guess. </strong></span><br><br>But
                      if the CNA report is "presenting trusted, unbiased and informed
                      opinions" as what the Prime Minister has proclaimed, I guess it just
                      demonstrates that CNA, its reporters and editors have actually thought
                      that there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>absolutely NOTHING WRONG FOR A POLITICAL PARTY, even
                      though it is the ruling party, TO UTILIZE GOVERNMENT RESOURCES DURING
                      GENERAL ELECTIONS!</strong></span><br><br>If CNA is, as proclaimed, a TRUSTED NEWS
                      PROVIDER, then the Prime Minister must have uttered the very specific
                      words that the GOVERNMENT is actually CAMPAIGNING by LEVERAGING on New
                      Media DURING GENERAL ELECTIONS! So who is the GOVERNMENT CAMPAIGNING
                      FOR during GENERAL ELECTIONS? This is a very FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION that
                      citizens of any DEMOCRATIC country should ask the ruling party.<br><br>I
                      am really beginning to doubt whether the ruling party takes DEMOCRACY
                      SERIOUSLY or not! Or is it just WAYANGING about being Democratic while
                      deep down its heart, it just takes for granted that PAP=GOVERNMENT and
                      GOVERNMENT=PAP? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And that PAP could utilize all the GOVERNMENT resources
                      for its political interests? </strong></span><br><br>Well, maybe I am still very naive
                      after witnessing the pork barrel politicking of PAP in using GOVERNMENT
                      HDB upgrading, GRC and Electoral Boundary redrawing as political tools
                      to attain political interests for itself, I still hold the belief that
                      Democracy still exists in Singapore with the basic fundamental
                      principles intact. I must be wrong in believing that PAP still believes
                      in Democracy. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is just basically a DICTATORIAL political party which
                      only WAYANG about Democracy by having some elections with all the rules
                      skewed heavily to their political advantages.</strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>From this little
                      report here, I must say that I am more convinced that Democracy is
                      already dead in Singapore, in principle.</strong></span> People from the Prime Minister
                      to the reporters and editors of local media no longer believe in the
                      basic fundamental principles of Democracy any more. Unless there are
                      enough brave souls that could stand up to such absurdity in the system,
                      win a few GRCs via that totally skewed and impossible odds against the
                      PAP + Government machineries + Media, I do not see how Singapore could
                      evolve and progress democratically. <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>I would actually urge the
                      PAP to do away with such a pain of going through the motion of General
                      Elections where they themselves do not respect the fundamental
                      principles of Democracy and declare Singapore a dictatorship once and
                      for all.</strong></span></p>
              <p>If PAP does not even respect the fundamental principles of
                      Democracy, why do they need to try to Wayang about General Elections?
                      If they could not even differentiate what is PAP as a political party
                      and what is the role of government,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> then just equate
                      PAP=Government=Singapore. It will really save us a lot of time and
                      trouble in playing such Wayang game. </strong></span><br><br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></p><blockquote>CNA - THE Government will leverage on new media in the next General Election, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said.<br><br>In
                      an interview with Channel News Asia to be aired on Tuesday night, he
                      noted the growing influence of the Internet on politics, citing the
                      recent United States presidential election as an example and said
                      Singapore would go the same way.<br><br>President Barack Obama's
                      campaign, for instance, used new media to put out their messages,
                      organise and even raise money. But PM Lee said the change here will not
                      be an an easy one.<br><br>'We are still learning. It is not easy to
                      make this transition. It is like going from sea to land or vice versa,
                      you are changing your medium and you need to get comfortable with it.
                      But we are working hard at it.'<br><br>He also said the party was on
                      the lookout for more MPs comfortable with new media. His remarks are
                      the latest sign of the Government's changing mindset towards new media.<br><br>Last
                      month, Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts Lee Boon
                      Yang said that the Government is 'fully into' e-engagement, when
                      responding to suggestions made by the Advisory Council on the Impact of
                      New Media on Society.<br><br>Since then, Government agencies have also
                      begun responding to forum letters posted on The Straits Times website.
                      PM Lee stressed, however, that traditional media will always have a
                      place in presenting trusted, unbiased and informed opinions. But he
                      didn't dismiss online views outright.<br><br>'Well, there is a place
                      called the Wild West and there are other places which are not so wild.
                      And the new media - some of it are Wild West and anything goes and
                      people can say anything they want. And tomorrow take a completely
                      contrary view and well, that is just the way the medium is,' he said.<br><br>'But
                      even in the Internet, there are places which are more considered, more
                      moderated where people put their names down and identify themselves.
                      And there is a debate which goes on and a give and take, which is not
                      so rambunctious but perhaps more thoughtful. That is another range.'<br><br>The interview on the evolving media landscape was in conjunction with Channel News Asia's 10th anniversary in March.</blockquote><p></p>
