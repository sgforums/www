            <div class='col-md body'>To Lazerlordz, fymk and iveco, my name is jia rui, the person whom you criticise for bootlicking. I am happy to be a Singaporean and I want to come home. That is the difference between you and me. Honestly, if you or your friends are so tired of living here, by all means, emigrate. Singapore will be a better place without people like you around who have NO constructive ideas on how to make this place a better home but only dares to voice your opinions using pseudonyms in forums like this. I challenge you to use your own name and write in to the newspapers with your views on the your realities of life here. Go ahead. I stand by my views unreservedly. This is my position. At least I dare to voice my views. Unlike cowards like you. You are pathetic to say the least. And before I went to Australia 2 years ago, I have been living in Singapore all my life so I do know the realities here and unlike other Singaporeans who emigrate, I am coming back. I sincerely hope all three of you leave Singapore for good since you just can't seem to have anything positive to say about this place. Pathetic cowards is the best description for you.</div>
