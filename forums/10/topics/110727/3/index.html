            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Give me your reason why i should quit.Can u speak for many ppl?</blockquote>And can YOU speak for the people when you ask the government to resign? Do you know what kind of turmoil it will cause? The ruling party has almost completely interwoven with the government and the civil service. Your wet dream of getting the government to resign may sit well with you, but do you think the country can still function without a judiciary, legislature, or cabinet? We don't have an oppostion large or experienced enough to replace the incumbent. Who's going to run the country, YOU? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>miong is right, any change that is to be effected must be gradual. The ruling party is too deeply entrenched into all aspects of Singaporean life- politics,  healthcare, education, economy, defence. It's not something that can be done overnight. We must use our votes responsibly to effect change, either through   the building up of a stronger and more credible oppostion to fight for our rights, or the very least make the ruling party sit up and take notice, and not to take its position for granted.<br><br><blockquote>Agreed. That's what the Ukrainians did last Nov to Dec...they stood up against their autocratic govt and Russia to make sure the current President was elected!<br><br>We shd do that bit by bit too!</blockquote>We could do that. But I doubt Singaporeans have the courage to stand up and take to the streets like the Ukrainians did, or even the Fillipinos during 'People Power.' Look, most crowds don't even have the social responsibilty to help someone being attacked by Bengs. Storming the Istana is not only ridiculous but also goes against the grain of most Singaporeans, and mob rule usually comes to a sticky end without good leaders to follow up. Look how many twits the Indonesians have put in power after Suharto.<br><br><blockquote>PAP leaders are honest &amp; decent ppl.</blockquote>Now coming from someone who supposedly hates the government, I find this sentiment quite amusing. Clever and efficent I give it to them. Honest and decent? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> That's stretching it.<br><br><blockquote>Our billionaires' sons.Hope some of them have a strong sense of duty and believe in fighting for their rights.</blockquote>And how do you think they got to be billionaires? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> They're not in a hurry to lose their fortunes, I tell you that.<br><br><blockquote>The electorates of the opposition wards votes for oppostion MPs.The 2 oppostion MPs (one of whom is a lawyer) should fight for their rights when their constituencies are discirminated against for estates upgrading.</blockquote>Don't you think they've tried?

            <div class='col-md body'>the fact is that .. we shall still let pap hv a over-whelming seat in the parliment , the government has done some great job in lifting singapore economic although , the people hv to suffer because of this ... we dun even hv a decent oppostion party that could actually run singapore like our current government does so in that case , it's better that the current government run the country cause at least , they would hv know how singapore shall be run and carry on from there . but .......................................................... what we need is a larger opposition seats in the parliment which could over-turn or hv a decent policy that will actually implement by the oppo party .. look at our poor mr chiam and mr low , often their suggestion goes into deaf ear and actually i dun think those pap even bother to hear their speech or idea ... just look at mr chiam lift-upgrading issue ..... if we hv like let's say at least 70%pap-30%oppo , we could hv some stronger voice in the parliment and more flexeble ideas being implement . at least now , it isn't a one-sided affair and rather , we could hear some good banters in the parliment ..  sometime , i dun know why the oppo leaders bother to even turn up at the parliment meeting when the whole house doesn't seem to pay them any attention ...  we need stronger opposition voice and not opposition running the country .. so my idol mr chiam will not get bully  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
