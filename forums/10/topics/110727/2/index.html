The government is like that because it's trying to adjust to the whim and fancy of all their citizens. If they want a park, they give them a park, if they want more sheltered walkways, they are given sheltered walkways.<br><br>Look at today's rock-climbing accident for example. They want the government to improve the safety of rock-climbing. What bullshit?! Rockclimbing is a risky, almost extreme sport, no matter how safe you make it. The people who enjoy rock-climbing are given a choice to stop whenever they feel it unsafe. If you're meant to fall and die, it's fate, no amount of government or divine intervention will save you or improve the safety.<br><br>The government are afraid that eventually the people won't vote for them, so they'll go to whatever lengths to ensure that they stay in power, how? Appease the citizen's ridiculous claims. Oh and let's NOT talk about Emperor Lee's (you-know-which-Lee) speak Mandarin campaign... or else.<br><br>Our standard of living improved so much and so fast that our society hasn't caught up yet. That's why the overnight cropping up of kiasu and kiasi aunties and uncles out there making us all look really bad.</div>

In my old estate, I live in little india and we are riddled with problems but the governement had never visited us nor upgraded any thing until election. The only thing that got upgraded was the life but it took 3 years (wah liew!) and a lot of bubu.  Now I live in the east and its still the same. The place is repainted only when the MP are visiting otherwise, the roads are unsafe and things continue as before. Sometimes I cannot understand how did my old place, being so far away from Tajong Pagar become a part of it and also how did Serangoon North and my current place be called Marine parade.  Its just that every time election comes, the grc groupings are adjusted ... to ensure a sure win. Lets not be a hypocrite lah, the current system might as well just be made up of 2 GRC for the whole country : PAP and non PAP GRC.  Its not as if we don't know and are fools who cannot see through all that power play.<br><br></div>

In my old estate, I live in little india and we are riddled with problems but the governement had never visited us nor upgraded any thing until election. The only thing that got upgraded was the life but it took 3 years (wah liew!) and a lot of bubu.  Now I live in the east and its still the same. The place is repainted only when the MP are visiting otherwise, the roads are unsafe and things continue as before. Sometimes I cannot understand how did my old place, being so far away from Tajong Pagar become a part of it and also how did Serangoon North and my current place be called Marine parade.  Its just that every time election comes, the grc groupings are adjusted ... to ensure a sure win. Lets not be a hypocrite lah, the current system might as well just be made up of 2 GRC for the whole country : PAP and non PAP GRC.  Its not as if we don't know and are fools who cannot see through all that power play.<br><br></div></blockquote>It's very ture! Basically, nothing much been done; even the areas cleaniness were not done tip top.  Of course, we didn't expect tip top but reasonable. When big shot is visiting their areas, the <strong>hypocrite civil servants </strong>will put up grand show to make the condition tip top.  Why like that? Just becoz the big shot is coming and they have to waste extra money to put up a show at our expense which we have to make up by paying the conservancy charges ultimately.</div>
