            <div class='col-md body'>this reminds me..<br><br>Although i live in serangoon north,we are offically under  marine parade,which is under goh chok tong.well the reason for this is that some years back the oppostion almost won this area, the pap only winning by a margin of 1 or 2%,with their usual "promis" tactics.so after winning,they put serangoon north offically under marine parade,and since goh chok tong was a prominent figure then,no 1 would bother to contest here.the worst thing is, the area(serangoon north) never got upgraded,and during the elections theres was no campaigning here, no ministers visited us.In addition,from the general sentiment here, it appears that most of the people here believe they were cheated by the PAP.</div>
