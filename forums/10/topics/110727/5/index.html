            <div class='col-md body'>For a long time, the PAP- despite all its faults and mistakes- have been able to hold on to their seats and their arrogance because their language about the opposition being "liberal", "foreign-minded" and too "democratic" have been effective in the heartland of Singapore.<br><br>They have always stated that they are for the people and they stand for a good domestic general policy- issues that are close to people's heart- namely: education, healthcare, basic financial issues like the year end bonuses and taxes; social stability, housing, social values, the issue of babies and even religious values.<br><br>Because of the fact that the current opposition, maybe to its fault, hasn't emphasised these issues as well they had emphasis on democracy, they are easily protrayed as "liberals".<br><br>So in order to counter that, and for any credible party to truly challenge the PAP's control, then that party must not only talk about democracy, creative thinking and what not but also have a credible heartland policy that speaks for the people on the street- and especially so for the old, the weak, the children, young parents.<br><br>The PAP's domestic policy regarding S'poreans and the heartland isn't actually very strong. If you check their policies very closely, you will find that there are a lot of loopholes and also more stuff that actually benefits the rich more than those who stay in the HDB.<br><br>So if that credible party can not only establish a clear domestic policy, but also communicate to the heartlanders that not only just highlights the weaknesses of the much-vaunted PAP domestic policies, but also offer their own solutions, and not just temporary ones to the existing problems- then they will have a chance. And as always, an emphasis on the poorer, the older ones, and the children's education and upbringing problems that young parents may encounter and issues regarding taxes, both direct income taxes and indirect ones as well always helps.</div>
