That time, only 3 men were needed. The number has been doubled since 1997. I just hope LHL will reduce the size of the GRCs during the next election.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think most Singaporeans are too engrossed in chasing the 5 or 7 Cs to care about politics. So be it and just wait till theres more economic and social issues to jolt everyone up...so the quake or tsunami didn't hit us, but what about other problems that are 'so near yet so far'. Can one sleep through the effects of globalization and other world issues or let them drown our complacency? Don't we just like to think we are the world's first in everytihng? When it hits, it will be very strong, sharp and painful...The political maturity iss still very low and to see just whos the white and black sheep, engage in frivilous speculations or to assasinate the characters of opposition members just because we are told this or that won't be useful. And those talk about being gracious, or getting more youth involved and perhaps express their 'teenage angst' doenst seem very practical. What's the solution, well, I am not paid 5 figure salaries to be the think tank? BTW, what is the use of those lift upgrading? Say, if someone lives on the 2nd or 3rd floor, wouldn't it be faster to use the stairs? How much will it increase the value of the flats? Stairs would be good for exercise..or there will be more cases of morbid obesity. Okay, enough of very mindless ramblings, thats what this forum is intended for.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PRP:</div><div class="quote_body">For the policy on estates upgrading,it seems the major criterion in the minds of PM &amp; ministers concerned were whether the beneficiaries are PAP supporters or non-supporters.</div></blockquote></div>

Sylvia Lim &amp; Poh Lee Guan are high-calibre people. But the WP is too small. How about a coalition government with NSP?

Your sole objective seems to be getting the govt to resign. When others challenge you to prove that you have something better to replace it with, you flippantly dismiss these concerns, with a heck-care attitude no less.<br><br>Implying that what you want to do is to get the government to resign first, before carrying on with the next phase of action, <strong>without elaborating on what will happen in the transition period.</strong><br><br>I don't think I need to explain the 'absurbity' of this, because even a toddler realises that <strong>you cannot take action without first thoroughly planning what the next step will be.</strong><br><br>Unless you have a bloody good idea what the next step will be after the government resigns, you have no credibility in anyone's eye, not just mine.<br><br><blockquote>Perhap u are jealous with my ability or u have monetary interest in this topic.</blockquote>Of course I'm jealous friend... after all, if ignorance is bliss, you must be the happiest man on earth. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote>U are one of the few surfers who think that my opinions in this topic are absurb.If u can't find my opinions are correct,then of course i have no credibility in your eye. </blockquote>No offence mate.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> but I'm not the only one who thinks that your plan to get the government to resign before thinking of what should follow next is absolute cock...<br><br>in fact, I can safely say that this group contains significantly more than those who support your half-baked scheme. I've browsed through the thread and while most here would be glad to see the current incumbent go, no one seems particularly keen on your wet dream of getting the government to resign completely.<br><br>A nation cannot function without a government, especially one like Singapore where the population have been bred into subservience and depedency by the system...<br><br>What needs to be changed is not the government, but the <strong>ruling party.</strong> Next time, get your facts straight.</div>

They are not more exceptional or capable than any average man on the street, although the controlled press tells the world otherwise. Take away the PAP kangaroo court and their abuse and use of litigation suits a lot of capable people will come out.</div>
