Others felt that the influx of foreign workers was responsible for Singapore’s rising unemployment.<br><br>As the recession continues to bite, such bread-and-butter issues remained at the top of Singaporeans’ list of concerns - judging from their postings on Reach since President S R Nathan delivered his address at the opening of Parliament on May 18.<br><br>Out of the more than 250 postings sent to the official feedback channel, some contributors identified Singapore’s open-door policy for foreigners as the reason for the rising unemployment rate here.<br><br>These contributors were also “concerned that the presence of large numbers of foreigners could result in our societal values and norms being eroded”.<br><br>Contributors remained divided over the issue of foreigners in Singapore. According to the Quick Poll on the website, 82 per cent of the 73 respondents agreed that to collectively build the nation’s future, Singaporeans need to appreciate the contributions of non-citizens and new citizens. The respondents agreed that newcomers “must make the effort to integrate into Singapore society”.<br><br>The issue of foreigners aside, several Reach contributors cited the high cost of living, stagnant pay, job insecurity and a high-pressure education system as reasons for their current state of stress.<br><br>There were those who felt that there is a need for the Government to look after low-income Singaporeans “who require the most help at this critical time”.<br><br>Still, some contributors expressed confidence that Singapore would emerge stronger from the current recession.<br><br>They agreed that a responsible Government and the constant refinement of policies would enable Singapore to keep pace with the changing global landscape.<br><br>Contributors also welcomed the political changes announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong recently, such as the increase in the number of Singapore Member Constituencies and Non-Constituency Members of Parliament.<br><br>However, the contributors noted that while this meant more diverse voices in Parliament, it need not translate to more voting powers for the opposition.<br><br>The “general stamp of public approval” - as seen in the feedback sent to Reach - “is a nod that the Government is going in the right direction”, said Reach chairman Amy Khor yesterday.<br><br>“The encouraging responses are also an indication that Singaporeans are coming forward to voice their concerns on a platform where they know their views will be heard and carefully considered,” Dr Khor said.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC090610-0000044/The-things-they-worry-about-,,,"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #417e15;">http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore...orry-about-,,,</span></span></a></div>

These are meant to help the new workers for six to nine months as they settle into their new workplace, said ACMI executive director Elizabeth Tan.<br><br>Said NTUC FairPrice managing director of group business Seah Kian Peng of the donation on Monday: 'Migrant workers are an important part of the community. It's a group who we want to look after as well.'<br><br>The foundation, with workers' welfare as one of its six strategic aims, has given out $7.2 million and is pledging to give out 20 per cent more this year.<br><br>One volunteer Madam Moreen Tay, 59, helps prepare food every Monday with her husband, Stephen Kang, 67, even though she is battling cancer for the fourth time and undergoing chemotherapy.<br><br>She and her husband started volunteering when their 35-year-old son died in December 2007. She said: 'I live day to day. I enjoy helping here because we are doing something with a purpose.'<br><br>About 120 to 150 lunch packs, each consisting of rice, vegetables and a meat or egg dish and costing about $1.50, are given out each weekday.<br><br>Bangladeshi worker Zahir Uddin, 31, estimates that the free lunch helps him save about $3 a day. This is a good portion of his wage as workers like him may earn about $18 daily, and more if they work overtime.<br><br>ACMI said about $45,000 would go towards funding the soup kitchen - which gets donations of rice from the Buddhist Lodge - while the remaining sum would fund other programmes for foreign workers, such as training courses, social outings, hospital visits and legal aid.<br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_360132.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #417e15;">http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking...ry_360132.html</span></span></a></div>
