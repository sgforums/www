              <p><br>"<em>If you are not saying that division of labor is equal, and it cannot be</em>" - have you understood what "TALENT" is, and how they separate individuals to take up the different tasks determined by the different level of skill needed ?</p>
              <p>Being in the business of managing a Bar, surely you are involved in the application of Work Permit for your "foreign female talents" ?</p>
              <p>Or are they working without work permits ?</p>
              <p>Surely, you will be the first one to know better than anyone in this Speaker's Corner - about the conditions that the Labor Department will  issue Work Permit - and the difference in Work Permits issued for the girls in your trade, compared to that of domestic help, and that given to a Bangladesh worker for the menial labor required for construction and shipyard activities, or that given to the Super Tertiary Educated needed by the Bio-Science Industry or the Banking-Financial Sector ?</p>
              <p>Can the uneducated CEO get a workpermit ?</p>
              <p>Yes, if a Company - such as NTUC Comfort, or General Electric or SHELL - is prepared to sponsor such a person, or if none is available - the person will have to invest at least $250,000 to be able to get a permit to reside here.</p>
