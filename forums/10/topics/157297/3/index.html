            <div class='col-md body'>Yes! Why not? It might just affect the world's economy esp the South East Asia's one... But other than that, nothing. Some countries might even be happy to see the world without Singapore... Something to ponder about.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This thread is amusing. Someone mentioned the world cannot live without Singaporean food. Having resided in the UK for about 2yr, I can tell you the only people who miss Singaporean cuisine here are Singaporeans themselves. Moreover, the quality of the Singaporean cusine here is worse than BAD. Which British will fancy bad food?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by lionnoisy:<br>* 10% global market share for semiconductor wafer foundry output<br>* Home to the world's top 3 wafer foundry companies<br>* Home to the world's top 3 sub-contract assembly-and-test companies<br>* Home to 4 of the world's top 10 fabless IC design companies<br>* 30% global market share for hard disk drives<br>* 25% global market share for retail POS impact printers<br>Singapore's achievements in the Biomedical Sciences (BMS) industry include:<br><br>* 30% of world market share of the manufacture of hearing aids<br><br>#1 in the world for marine coatings for ship repair and maintenance<br><br>u have to dig out the ability of Sg.Dunt under value Sg.[/b]</blockquote>1. if Singapore is the home to the world's top 3water foundry companies, it is not surprising if Singapore has 10% global market share for the semiconduct wafer foundry companies.<br><br>2. our government provides foreign companies with tax breaks and very flexible tax schemes if they were to set up their international or regional HQ in Singapore.<br><br>3. The Singapore government implements a very pro-employer employment scheme. As a result, foreign companies wouldn't mind to employ skilled labour in Singapore, at the expense of our long-term future:<br><br>a) Countries like the US (70%), France (63%) and UK (45%) provide a very high pension rate to their citizen employees, while our government implements our pension (CPF) at a miserable rate of 13%, ie. less than half the optimum.

I didn't know that hearing aid falls under the Biomedical Science (BMS) sector. Isn't the hot area of the BMS sector stem cell manufacturing and distribution? I also didn't know that the world's handicapped is a very very affluent population.. So what if Singapore is the top manufacturer for hearing aid? It is an extremely niche area in the BMS<br><br>Can the world live without Singapore?<br><br>Can Singaporeans live without Singapore?</div>
