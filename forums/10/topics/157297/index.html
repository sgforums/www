One of their competitive edge was to store the instrument sound samples in the software to be loaded into the memory from its drivers rather than from the card itself when memory chip on cards were so much costlier at that time (16 years ago).<br><br>Nowadays most soundcards can store its sampling sounds on chip in the card. However the software standards have improved by leaps and bounds.<br><br>Singapore have to remain its standard as a banking and finance hub for safe transactions for $$$$ activities.<br><br></div>

One of their competitive edge was to store the instrument sound samples in the software to be loaded into the memory from its drivers rather than from the card itself when memory chip on cards were so much costlier at that time (16 years ago).<br><br>Nowadays most soundcards can store its sampling sounds on chip in the card.
