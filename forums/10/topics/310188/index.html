              will be appropriately qualified based on professional experiences
              because your appointment will have to be scrutinised by the
              parliamentary committees of one expertise or another.
              <br> <br>To be appointed to his job, Greenspan was scrutinized by no less
              than the Congress who will ask relevant questions of his experiences.
              <br> <br>Those who are appointed as chief of CIA or FBI will similarly be
              scrutinized for solid experiences and successful operations in tackling
              major crimes.
              <br> <br>Down here, it is a matter of elitism and connections. As one
              ex-lecturer from NUS some Linsey has pointed out, it is not what you
              know that determine one's rise in the corporate ladder but who you
              know. Obviously a certain protectionism is operating here for all top
              jobs. If you are known to the MPs or PMs and one of the known elites,
              you will be invited to tea or eventually fill the minister or other top
              job.
              <br> <br>So after so many years we still do have have people with sufficient
              solid experiences to handle economic restructuring to value-adding
              technology driven model which create jobs or transport problems or a
              Warren-Buffet system of investing people's surpluses to help in
              lowering costs and saving of our surpluses for retirements.
              <br> <br>This kind of government has caused us many lost opportunities due
              to promotions of ignoramuses to positions of incompetence as pointed
              out in the Peter Principle.
              <br> <br>Now our costs of living are rising, with all citizens getting
              poorer by the days and months due precisely to this kind of governing.
              <br> <br> There is no dedicated professionalism being practised except for talking big and denying problems.
              <br> <br> If this is not complacency and failures what is complacency?
              <br> <br> Who is the chief of all such complacency?</span></td>

              <p>Whether MM Lee has described the MS's escape as a sign of complacency in his government or incompetence, it is enough acknowledgement there lies a major problem today in our system of governing the country.</p>

              <p>The prime cause of complacency or incompetence in our system as I see it is self-deception about one's talents based on elitism or connection.</p>
              <p>Professionalism is just as important a criterion as education. If we want to have talented ministers or top people paid superscale salaries to run our police, (who lately have become so pathetic that it has been shirking responsibilities with constant excuses like non-seizable offence to avoid actions against assaults and similar crimes) we ought to have totally dedicated professionals who would pass the highest standards adopted in their respective jobs.</p>

              Hi Robert,
              
                       MM Lee mentioned during a visit to Bahrain that 
              complacency is a factor which lead to MS's escapre from the dentention centre. He mentioned as long as MS is still in Spore, he posed no threat but if he managed to escape to other countries, there is a possibilty of MS striking back at Spore. It already been days since his escape n there is no sign of success, what is ur opinion that he might already escapred to other countries?

              <p>If it is an accidental and unpremeditated escape, do you think he could have got away so neatly leaving so many unanswered question like whether he has escaped throught the ventilation or some other opening at the toilet from which he was said to have escaped.</p>
              <p>Obviously from all the evidences so far, his escape has been miraculous given that fact that he is a terrorist of some calibre or intelligence who has escaped custody before.</p>
              <p>So based on such evidences available todate MM Lee obviously was trying to control damage by saying nice things about how difficult it is for him to do harm as long as he is in Singapore.</p>
              <p>For all we know, he may not want to escape out of Singapore. His mission is to drive a plane to crash on our icon like the Changi Airport. So he probably has inside help from his own cell mates or prison officers befriended by or sympathetic to him to have allowed him to escape so cleanly against all odds.</p>
              <p>If he is indeed such a terrorist of high intelligence described as wily by MM Lee and his mission is to launch an attack on Singapore he would be staying put in his hide out and buy his time and very soon launch an attack against one of our icon which will fit his mission nicely. Why run away from Singapore when his target is Singapore,</p>

              Hi Robert, possibility of this terrorist escaping to Indonesia is maybe to get reinforcement to strike Spore as
              
              JI is based in Indonesia but a committee of inquiry already been set up to determine the cause of the escapre, do u think anybody will be implicated in by the committee?

              <p>Hi Will4,</p>
              <p>If they being the terrorists want to hit us, they could work from several strategies. One is to recruit and establish their own network here within Singapore. When the time is right they will act. Can anyone really say that there is totally no JI recruitments going on currently within Singapore to follow through their plan. Can the government totally eradicate such discreet and low-profile recruitments.</p>
              <p>JI may be supported financially by Al Qaeda and its plan is to attack Singapore when the time is right.</p>
              <p>It may not be at all easy now for Al Qaeda to attack from outside as there is a higher risk to bring in those gears and explosives from outside. Working from within may be more appropriate. With internet anything today is possible. It is a matter of patience.</p>

              <p>With the calibre of MSK being shown by his ability to breakout from a tight Detention Centre run by the Internal Security Department - which is supposedly guarded by Gurkhas - {see Francis Seow writing of his experience in this Whitley Detention Centre in "To catch a Tartar''} - we should not doubt  his ability to make a dramatic impact while still in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Does he need to breakout of Singapore, and plan a hit from outside ?</p>
              <p>If he cannot escape the tight cordon thrown around this Little Red Dot - and with every agency intensely and constantly looking out for him - he can simply make the ultimate sacrifice - according to his personal religious beliefs - by hijacking a Petroleum Tanker Truck and blow himself up by driving into some high value target in Singapore.</p>
              <p>MM LKY said that no one is infallible, which contradict his belief that he has always been infallible, and with the attitude being made into a hallmark of his Political Choices.</p>
              <p>Is he now admitting that he has been wrong - which has led to this current state of complacency ?</p>
              <p>The attitude of invicibility and infallibility was his creation to reinforce the aura of supermacy of himself, his Political Selections, and his Political Party - and that no one in Singapore is more able then himself and those whom he has annointed.</p>
              <p>Is he admitting that he is fallible afterall ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps MM LKY should apologise for the errors in his judgment of those whom he had incarcerated in the past, and wasting the lives of those whom he had wrongly accused and never dared to bring them to trial even as he claimed that he has the evidence.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans deserves a better reason for the present situation then what MM LKY is prepared to reveal.</p>
