This is a huge embarassment to the indonesian government....<br>THIRD TIME I wonder if anybody now will dare to risk going to bali<br>on holiday when anytime you could get your head blown off.&gt;<br><br>Don't think the terrorists are interested in embrassing any govt.<br>Their obession is to wreak havoc in any country they perceive as<br>their enemy and they are using Islam as a means to that end. But<br>they are not interested in the Islamic faith per se. They are<br>actually bigots who can only accept their brand of Islam and, of<br>course, tolerate no other religions<br><br><i>towards foreigners, yes it's true that many australians and<br>foreigners are victims of these attacks but I believe that subtely<br>these attacks are engineered towards the indonesians muslims<br>instead.<br><br>First of all if you attack foreigners, foreign agencies will hunt<br>you down and you are on the run for the rest of your lives. but if<br>these terrorists attack their own muslim people in the name of god<br>but using the west as a pretext target and in the process muslims<br>get killed or suffer, who do you think muslims everywhere will<br>direct their anger towards: god? the invisible perpetrators? or<br>their government for being inefficient in preventing these attacks?&gt;<br><br>Almost all the responses I read have been condemnation of the<br>attacks (the act itself and not so much on anybody or govt). Though<br>some suggested social factors and policies by political leaders,<br>local as well as global, to be contributing factors, none blamed<br>the govt for being inefficient in preventing attacks.<br><br>It is simply impossible to prevent all attacks if the terrorists choose<br>to terrorize a country. The efficiency of a govt is, therefore, not<br>measured by its ability to prevent attacks but by how well it<br>responds to attacks.<br><br>Also, you seemed to have forgotten that 90% of the Balinese are hindus<br><br>country, if a nation has a history of traditional tribal faction<br>and ethnic violence democracy will never work out. Surarto knew his<br>people were like this thats why he ruled with an iron fist, during<br>his reign where were these terrorists ... they were like mice with<br>a hardly more than a whimper but now that he is gone they are like<br>lions with a roar and teeth that bite and they are unstoppable.&gt;<br><br>During Suharto's time terrorism was mainly confined to Middle East.<br>Terrorism only spread globally and mutated after Al Qaeda blasted the WTC on 11  Sep 2001.<br></i></div>

There is a saying that said hungry people is always angry. If he had stayed on in power, it will be the same because the people had already not trusted him already, army leadership is also split. After Suharto stepped down, the economy is in a disaster. The Habibie govt tried to pick up whatever pieces it could, only for eighteen months. The time is too short to do anything positive. Wahid also managed to do something positive by allowing Chinese Indonesian to celebrate Chinese New Year openly for the first time in Indonesia, considering the fact that they are being discrmininated. This encouraged Chinese Indonesian to invest in Indonesia once again. Megawati done little to Indonesia.<br>Yudoyono is trying hard to clamp down on corruption, considering that it is a<br>culture for many year. Look at the Governor of Aceh already put in prison, Banten<br>governor already stripped of his position. Terrorist like the JI managed to get support is because there r many poor people who r desperate to survive, to get hungry on the street is a terrible thing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I think the reason Suharto managed to control Indonesia well during thirty two year in power is because managed the economy fairly well but do not forget the one hing he had the support of the army. </blockquote>The Indonesian economy was not well managed, but Suharto had the military.<br><br><blockquote><br>People can managed to get job well but in the 1997 economic crisis, people were retrenched n could not gey job easilty, prices of basic goods were increasing. There is a saying that said hungry people is always angry. If he had stayed on in power, it will be the same because the people had already not trusted him already, army leadership is also split. After Suharto stepped down, the economy is in a disaster.</blockquote>Had Suharto wanted to stick to pwoer, he would have been able to do so, I guess he lost the stomach for more violence.<br><br><blockquote>The Habibie govt tried to pick up whatever pieces it could, only for eighteen months. </blockquote>Habibie was a coconut head.<br><br><blockquote><br>The time is too short to do anything positive. Wahid also managed to do something positive by allowing Chinese Indonesian to celebrate Chinese New Year openly for the first time in Indonesia, considering the fact that they are being discrmininated. This encouraged Chinese Indonesian to invest in Indonesia once again.<br></blockquote>Wahid did try but he kept reshuflling the cabinet and got too many people angry.<br><br><blockquote><br>Megawati done little to Indonesia.</blockquote>Mega is downright corrput and bloody useless.<br><br><blockquote><br>Yudoyono is trying hard to clamp down on corruption, considering that it is a<br>culture for many year. Look at the Governor of Aceh already put in prison, Banten<br>governor already stripped of his position. Terrorist like the JI managed to get support is because there r many poor people who r desperate to survive, to get hungry on the street is a terrible thing.</blockquote>Bambang has a great image. But his job is really tough. If the Isians don't support him, he won't get much done either.</div>
