But <strong>several of those barred were invited by both the World Bank and IMF to attend the meetings, as part of an effort in recent years to reach out to non-government organisatio</strong>ns.<br><br><strong>"We believe that all individuals who have been accredited to the annual meetings should be allowed to attend," </strong>the two organisations said last Friday. "We strongly urge the Singapore Government to act swiftly and reverse their decision on entry and access to the meetings for these representatives."<br><br>Singapore generally has a low tolerance for political protests and unruly behaviour, sometimes invoking extremely punitive laws against foreigners. The Government previously banned outdoor protests at the meeting.<br><br>Accordingly, several groups have organised protests on the nearby island of Batam, a part of Indonesia, but it was not clear whether Indonesia would let them take place.<br><br>Leaders of the bank and the fund are due to meet with scores of finance ministers this week.<br><br><strong>The move by Singapore was especially embarrassing for the bank's president, Paul Wolfowitz, who has made his appeals for proper governance a cornerstone of his 15 months at the bank and called on poor countries around the world to strengthen the role of NGOs.</strong><br><br>The annual meetings have been a focus of protests over the years by dissidents demonstrating against trade, environmental and economic policies of the richest countries. Such protests have nearly shut down some meetings, but in recent years the protests have been peaceful.<br><br><strong>Both the World Bank and IMF have tried to quiet the rebellion by inviting groups to their meeting. For this week's session, they have accredited nearly 500 representatives from more than 45 countries,</strong> they said on Friday.<br><br>Among the individuals barred from Singapore was Antonio Tricarico, coordinator of an Italian group, Campaign to Reform the World Bank.<br><br>"It's completely astonishing," he said, "in particular because the World Bank welcomed us to go and even our government cleared our participation."<br><br>The Singapore police said in a statement that the annual meetings of the bank and the fund would "attract the attention of many, not least those who may want to use the ready platform and presence of the international media to stage events that will pose a security threat to Singapore".<br><br>NEW YORK TIMES<br><br></blockquote></span></div>

Local press reports said about 20 names are believed to be on the blacklist.<br><br>With demonstrations forbidden here, foreign activists decided to hold protests and an anti-globalization conference in the nearby Indonesian island of Batam, which is 45 minutes away by ferry from Singapore.<br><br>Critics say Singapore has merely reinforced its image as an authoritarian state despite its phenomenal economic progress.<br><br>Nacpil blamed the IMF-WB for picking Singapore to host the meetings despite knowing its track record as far as protests are concerned.<br><br>Sameer Dossani, executive director of the activist 50 Years is Enough Network, said: "If the Bank is interested in accountability and preventing corruption, why are they holding their meetings in a police state that has openly said it plans to cane protestors?"<br><br>While a recent World Bank survey ranked Singapore as the easiest place to do business, the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) gave it dismal marks for press freedom.<br><br>Singapore placed 140th out of 167 countries in RSF's 2005 World Press Freedom Index, ranking below countries like Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Russia, Sudan and Yemen.<br><br>Yet it is also Singapore's reputation as an oasis of political and economic stability in often volatile Southeast Asia that has made it a key destination for foreign investment.<br><br>A low crime rate, a clean environment and an efficient and reputedly incorruptible bureaucracy have also won worldwide admiration.<br><br>"By now, people know what the image of Singapore is, and they realize we are who we are," said Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.<br><br>"We're one of the most disciplined societies in the world because the environment we live in is special," he was quoted as saying in the local newspaper Today.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Typical Reponse of those in power...you can either shut up or ship out. Haha, beware the international storm of criticisms. Think of the way that foreigners will view the tourism industry after this...there's a Hokkien saying for this "Kiang Ju Ho, Mai Kei Kiang" Think it will apply to the army of pencil pushers and policy makers. Frankly...its been in my mind for quite some time that Politics is nothing but Stupidity in Suits.</div>
