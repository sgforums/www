            <div class='col-md body'><br>Singapore deports 3 animal rights activists planning nearly nude protest<br><br>SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore deported three animal rights advocates who planned to stage a semi-naked protest outside a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet in the city-state, authorities and the activists said.<br><br>The trio from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, planned a demonstration Friday in which two women were to stand outside a local KFC restaurant, each wearing nothing but a banner reading "Naked Truth: KFC Tortures Chicks," the group said in a statement.<br><br>The two women were PETA members Ashley Fruno of Canada and Sonia Astudillo of the Philippines, while the third member was the group's Asia-Pacific director Jason Baker, an American citizen based in Hong Kong, the statement said. PETA said the protest was canceled.<br><br>The group staged a similar protest outside a KFC restaurant in Bangkok, Thailand, last month.<br><br>Singapore police said in a statement they deployed officers to find and interview the activists on Thursday and Friday in response to calls reporting that the trio had been "behaving suspiciously." The statement did not give details of what the activists were doing nor identify the callers.<br><br>"Based on their profile and records, police assessed that they would be participating in an anti-KFC campaign as PETA activists and will speak without a permit," the police statement said late Friday.<br><br>Police said the three were asked to leave the city-state by Friday, and that Singapore's immigration authorities had canceled their social visit passes.<br><br>Singapore has been tightening security measures ahead of the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank on Sept. 19-20.<br><br>Singapore says it will strictly bar outdoor demonstrations, which even under normal circumstances are rarely seen in the city-state because of tight restrictions on expression. Its leaders say such controls have helped turn the tiny resource-poor island into one of Asia's economic powerhouses.<br><br>Â© 2006 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

            <div class='col-md body'>The root of the problem may not lie with IMF/WTO. Our lack of understanding of control and law and order may be the source of problems which resulted in so many problems over the years.<br><br>It all probably got started years ago when we were once affected by some Hock Lee Bus or students' boycott of class.<br><br>Arising from those incidents, our leaders have developed a legalistic control minset ever since which started from the premises that there should be law and order and everything can be solved by passing of laws to control which will solve all problems.<br><br>Today we have all kinds of laws controlling all aspects of human conduct and behaviour including chewing gum law, window-falling law and petrol-topping law etc.<br><br>Such a legalistic mindset is based on the assumption (largely unproven) that people are rebellious and need to be controlled based on some anecdotal past experience.<br><br>Sadly it is also part of human nature that the more is the control, the more people want to break from control and the more people want to break away from control, more control will have to be put in to prevent any breakaway of the control which at this point might have deviated from the original purpose and objective of control.<br><br>The outcome of such legalistic control is there is a constant need to pass more and more laws and put in extreme control including control on freedom of expression, and participating in political process which is the real source of instability.<br><br>Law and order is a mere justification or presentation as may not be real problem here with tonnes of laws at our disposal to ensure controls. Objectively we are not in danger of loss of law and order. Citizens are compliant to the extent of being docile and are now much more educated and younger people need new forms of outlets and freedoms.<br><br>The only problem is there is a lack of understanding about law and order. Contrary to conventional logic disorders may not be caused by citizens but by the legalistic control mindset which may become paranoid about control. It got started years ago by our history and once it got started, it became necessary to control and put up more control to suppress resistance to control which may go out of proportion resulting in control attaining a life of its own until self-destruction.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just wondering, did they deploy like 20-30 SOC troopers with their riot gear to corner them, shower them with the water jets, lob CS gas and then move in on them? Haha...was hearing it on the radio that the police spokesperson said that every soverign country has every single right to deport unwanted visitors.So yeah...there you have it.<br><br>This actually shows how backwards our society is, where opinions are not allowed and we have to seek approval just to express them. Look at Hong Lim Park, imagine if the trio were to seek permit and protest there by giving speech, who would listen or even bother to go down? The SM once said in a National Rally that we as S'poreans are "kia see" and  "kiasu" , it really shows that we really are "kia see" but unlike other countries, we are not as "kiasu" to allow our citizens to express themselves. Anyway, with the population becoming increasingly educated, I suppose that many of us youngsters will someday break away this "glass-ceiling" which ceases our progress to greater heights and take us to be the leading society in every sense</div>

PETA said the protest was canceled.<br><br>The group staged a similar protest outside a KFC restaurant in Bangkok, Thailand, last month.<br><br>Singapore police said in a statement they deployed officers to find and interview the activists on Thursday and Friday in response to calls reporting that the trio had been "behaving suspiciously." The statement did not give details of what the activists were doing nor identify the callers.<br><br>"Based on their profile and records, police assessed that they would be participating in an anti-KFC campaign as PETA activists and will speak without a permit," the police statement said late Friday.<br><br>Police said the three were asked to leave the city-state by Friday, and that Singapore's immigration authorities had canceled their social visit passes.<br><br>Singapore has been tightening security measures ahead of the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank on Sept. 19-20.<br><br>Singapore says it will strictly bar outdoor demonstrations, which even under normal circumstances are rarely seen in the city-state because of tight restrictions on expression. Its leaders say such controls have helped turn the tiny resource-poor island into one of Asia's economic powerhouses.<br><br>Â© 2006 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
