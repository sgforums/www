              <p>Karpal Singh was banned and denied his practicing certificate from representing the four suspended muslim school girls by the Supreme Court of Singapore eventhough in the past, he was allowed to represented clients in Singapore. That case involved the ban on hudud policy by the MOE, if allowed in 2002 would be regarded the first time a constitutional challenge was raised in Singapore against the gov. </p>
              <p>Moral of the story... if u are practicing in Sg, u stay away from any Constitutional and Administrative matters against Singapore and you will be A.OKAY. lol. Safest is to just stick to commercial. haha</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Speaking to the crowd, event organiser Jolovan Wham said both foreigners and Singaporeans should have the right to freedom of expression, referring to the arrest of 21 Malaysians on Saturday for illegally gathering at Merlion Park. Mr Wham, a social activist, then read out a statement by 200 Malaysian social workers and counsellors working here who called for free and fair elections and a strengthened social welfare system.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The other speaker was poet Alfian Sa'at who apologised on behalf of the Singapore government for "these repressive laws on demonstrations", in reference to Saturday's arrests. Nine other Malaysians had also been warned days earlier for participating in a protest last Wednesday. He then read out a monologue from his play "Parah", which is about race relations.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Most in the crowd wore black and were issued yellow candles for a vigil. A significant number appeared to be Malaysians who came to observe the event. Several signs expressing support for Malaysia were laid on the ground in one corner of the park. Said businessman Mr Chong Chin Chun, 43, who is a permanent resident from Malaysia: "Our neighbours are here to speak out for us, I will feel very shameful if I don't turn up to support."</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Was it a Chinese or a wider Malaysian tsunami that caused the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition to lose its share of the popular vote to the opposition? Is Malaysia more polarised along racial lines or is there a sharper urban-rural divide?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The air has been thick with these questions and the ill-effects of a bitterly fought election that has divided the country.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; font-style: inherit; line-height: 1; font-family: inherit; float: left;" src="http://www.straitstimes.com/sites/straitstimes.com/files/1205(3).jpg" alt="" width="275" height="458">Cut through the political fog and rabble-rousing though and it is clear the underlying issue facing Malaysia hasn't changed in the last 50 years.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Indeed, it took a well-aimed potshot from across the Causeway to make that quite clear to me.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">That's how I felt when I read what former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said in the heat of the hustings.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Speaking at a rally in Selangor, he attacked the opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP) for wanting to sow discord between Malays and Chinese, and referred to Singapore's People's Action Party (PAP).</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"DAP uses the PAP way. When PAP was in Malaysia, it used the slogan 'Malaysian Malaysia'. It said Malays took everything, others nothing. Is that true?" he asked.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Writing later in his blog, he said: "The meritocracy promoted by the DAP will mean diminishing opportunities for the Malays in education and in business. This will result in Malays becoming less and less qualified and poorer."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Ouch?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If any nerves were jangled here, you wouldn't have noticed as there was hardly a whimper, save for a reader's letter in The Straits Times Forum Page from a Malay Singaporean who wrote that the community was doing rather well.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Perhaps it was just as well. No need to add oil to a raging fire, not when it's no longer Singapore's fight.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What then is the issue about?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For older Singaporeans, it is an all too familiar story.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When the two countries separated in 1965, it was their differences in race policy that led to the break-up.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Thereafter, Singapore took a merit-based approach while Malaysia continued its policy of promoting affirmative action and special rights for Malays, with incentives in business, education and housing, under its bumiputera policy.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For readers too young to know those tumultuous days, here's an exchange from one particular debate which goes to the heart of the issue. It took place in the Federal Parliament in Kuala Lumpur in May 1965 between then Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Tun Dr Mahathir who was an Umno MP.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dr Mahathir: They (Chinese Singaporeans) have never known Malay rule and cannot bear the idea that the people they have kept so long under their heel should now be in a position to rule them.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Mr Lee: If we delude people into believing they are poor because there are no Malay rights... where are we going to end up? You let people in the kampungs believe that they are poor because we (the Chinese) don't speak Malay?... Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social or education policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indians and others opposing Malay rights.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Almost 50 years later, these same issues are being replayed in Malaysia, this time between contending political parties and their supporters.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">At issue is whether affirmative action has benefited the majority of Malays and the country as a whole, or enriched only a select few, as the opposition contends.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But the more fundamental question is the one Dr Mahathir so starkly raised, which is the permanence of Malay rule in Malaysia.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Singapore did not accept this, its leaders arguing that that was not their understanding when they agreed to the merger. For non-Malays in Malaysia, however, separation was not an option, and many left the country to start afresh, including to Singapore.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It now looks like those who stayed have decided to throw in their lot with the opposition.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But can Malaysia accept a multiracial approach to governance and not one based on permanent Malay rule?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It is a question Malaysians must ultimately confront. We can only hope they will be able to do so peacefully. A successful Malaysia is good for Singapore.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But there are lessons for us here.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">First is the importance of looking after the interest of the minority races. Malaysia's experience shows that the grievances and injustices felt by the minorities will not go away but will build up and, if not addressed, can lead to much grief.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Singapore's multiracial approach is ingrained, but there is clearly much that can be improved. For example, there have been complaints by Malays and Indians over the years that they face discrimination when looking for jobs or homes to rent.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">These have to be taken seriously and action taken by the authorities or they will become entrenched norms.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Second, while key institutions such as the civil service, the judiciary, schools and the police and armed forces should be as professionally run as possible, they should take into account Singapore's multiracial society.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Last year, when Adil Hakeem Mohamad Rafee became the first Malay recipient of a President's Scholarship since 1968, it was a wait too long for the community and for Singapore.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Could more have been done to correct the imbalance without sacrificing meritocratic principles? It calls for greater effort and sensitivity to the idea that Singapore is a richer society because of the diversity of its people.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I believe this will become more evident in the years to come when China grows in strength and extends its influence even more in the region. Without the richness of its multiracial people, Singapore risks becoming another Chinese city among the many in the mainland, perhaps not even a first-tier one.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Preserving and nurturing multiracialism is hence an essential part of strengthening the country's cultural resilience.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Barely a month after being kicked out of Malaysia, Mr Lee threw this challenge for the future:</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Here we make the model multiracial society. This is not a country that belongs to any single community: it belongs to all of us. Over 100 years ago this was a mudflat swamp. Today, this is a modern city. Ten years from now this will be a metropolis. Never fear!"</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It was a fitting response then to Dr Mahathir.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Forty-eight years on, it still is.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">MALAYSIA'S Election Commission (EC) will act against those alleging that the opposition was denied victory in the recent general election because of fraud.</p>
              <p>   Its deputy chairman, Mr Wan Ahmad Wan Omar, said the commission had started gathering evidence which would be referred to lawyers for further action, reported the New Straits Times.</p>
              <p>   Mr Wan Ahmad said the opposition leaders had been spreading lies before the election and these untruths peaked on polling day.</p>
              <p>   For example he said, opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim tweeted about winning the election soon after the ballot counting started.</p>
              <p>   Mr Wan Ahmad said: "At 6.57pm on May 5, Anwar, through his Twitter account, said 'PR (Pakatan Rakyat) has won. We urge Umno and the EC not to attempt to hijack the results.'</p>
              <p>   "This was a blatant lie as there was no way of knowing the full result at that time. Even at 8.30pm, EC officers had only finished counting about 2,000 ballot boxes out of the 52,000."</p>
              <p>   Mr Wan Ahmad also took pro-opposition cyber-troopers to task for spreading similar false information that PR had won the election as early as 8pm on May 5.</p>
              <p>   He said this was an attempt to condition the voters into believing that PR had won the election, and reject any other result.</p>
              <p>   Mr Wan Ahmad explained: "They did this to convince Pakatan supporters and the people into believing that the opposition cannot lose.</p>
              <p>   "So if the election results do not favour Pakatan, they will reject it, claiming that the election was rigged."</p>
              <p>   He added that the post-election rallies called by the opposition were undemocratic.</p>
              <p>   "Their demand for people to reject the election results is akin to killing democracy. They should respect the people's decision instead of trying to kill the country's democratic process."</p>
