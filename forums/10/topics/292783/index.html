Many of them say even if they are not well, they cannot afford not to drive for just one day or half-a-day as otherwise they cannot pay the rental.  They are just surviving.  the ministers on the other hand have given themselves a ridiculously unjustified pay rise.  Even if they cut their pay by 75% they would still be overpaid!

Imagine, if this is practiced, the landlord will obviously rent out his office space to MNC which has better earning and small companies will have no office avail. And how to calculate the earning of a business if that office space is just for maybe a branch office? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In the current situation, the taxi companies goal is to rent out as many taxi as possible. More taxi mean more money rolling in for the taxi company whereas the reverse is true for the taxi driver.<br><br>More taxi on the road mean more competition and the taxi driver earning going down. At the end of the day, to sustain their earning, the drivers will have to resort to trick like playing hide and seek to earn more money.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Death of the Independent Operator<br><br>Tight commerce laws and regulations have caused the wealth to accumulate at the upper echelons of the many corporate pyramids here in Singapore. Take the example of Taxi drivers/companies here in Singapore.<br><br>Are taxi drivers still allowed to own their own vehicles? As far as I know, they are no longer allowed to do so. Forever tied to a taxi company via a leash. Forever subjected to the whims of the taxi company if they so choose to remain a taxi driver. Its not so bad, if the taxi drivers have strong union representation, but in Singapore, unions virtually powerless unless union laws are changed. Gone were the days when taxi drivers could own their own taxis, be and independent operator.<br><br>There is no justification of for the highly paid CEOs of the transport companies whose monthly salary that may feed up to half a dozen families of taxi drivers. Owning his/her own vehicle would benefit the driver in the long run, giving him/her greater responsibility and control over his/her earnings, which incidentally, does contribute to the narrowing of the income gap here in Singapore. Spread the wealth amongst the people, why must everything go upwards?<br><br>Taxi companies, as they get bigger, will get Â“top heavyÂ” with the needs to pay for huge office rentals, exorbitant salaries of senior executives and other resources, to manage the fleet of taxis. Leaving the onus of the taxi maintenance to the driver/owner is one way to go. Taxi companies should remain, to give those drivers who prefer rental a choice. Giving them a choice will then drive the taxi companies to give those who chose to rent, better perks for rental, or even lower rental costs. Also the freedom for taxi owners to rent out their vehicles when they are ill or unable to drive. Why must everything thing here in SG be so tight assed.<br><br>But thatÂ’s the trend of our countryÂ’s economy isnÂ’t it? Somehow, the Â“comfort zoneÂ” is always just an inch away, but still unable to reach it. This phenomenon is extremely prevalent in the middle lower income groups. CoÂ’mon PAP, give the little guy a chance to run his little business, and earn a little comfortable living.<br><br>Project manager who is exposed to both working in SG and Australia quoted saying "PMs in SGP have it easy, here in Aust, have to make the staff as happy as you want the customer to be. In SGP, just squeeze, staff have to comply, if not, there is always someone else cheaper to do the job."</div>

The freedom to be an independent operator? The freedom of choice. The Govt doesn't have to make a law, making independent taxi owners illegal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the crux of the issue is that delgro is the absolutely dominant operator and govt linked company. As a profit making entity with political backing, under capitalism, it has turned into a monster by implementing profit maximizing measures that do no benefit to the customers and workers under them.<br><br>That's capitalism, where capital exploits surplus value from the workers, and if possible, corner the surplus from customers. Sadly, this capitalistic beast is not only free from perfect competition, it is aided by the govt. Now dun get me wrong, i advocate competition. definitely. but only competition that benefits both consumers and workers.<br><br>This is if done correctly, organization, scale and technology can bring abt dramatic real savings and efficiency. The key is to let the company be owned wholly by citizenship alone. And they can vote CEOs out and decide on their pay. The goal of the company will not be to make profits, but to deliver a certain pre-agreed standard of service at the lowest possible cost.<br><br>There will be real-time bidding, and journey tracking and resource allocation. the customer will be charged exactly the benefit they derive and opportunity cost they incur on the driver. all will be recompensed correctly. Rental is kept to a minimal, and drivers will be increased naturally to a surplus until the business becomes too thin.<br><br>Everything will be fair and efficient then. WOW!!! looking forward to it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

However, under mercantilism, given the contemporaneous rise of the absolutism, the state superseded the local guilds as the regulator of the economy.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#Mercantilism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#Mercantilism</a></div>

These labourers, who must sell themselves piecemeal, are a commodity, like every other article of commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition, to all the fluctuations of the market.<br><br>Owing to the extensive use of machinery, and to the division of labour, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and, consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is required of him. Hence, the cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for maintenance, and for the propagation of his race. But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is equal to its cost of production. In proportion, therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working hours, by the increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of machinery, etc.<br><br>Modern Industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are organised like soldiers. As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the overlooker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering it is. " - Karl Marx<br><br></div>
