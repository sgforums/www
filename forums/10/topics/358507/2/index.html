              <p>Thank you.</p>
              <p>I speak your singlish. I understand your atrocious hokkien. And I understand what it is like and your fear of your govt. Probably the closest any white 'fuck' has come to knowing what you people are. But i'll admit i did sound pompous, sorry lah dun mean to sound like a cock. But i have never met anyone else, in the army or otherwise who is in sin city as long term as i am, plus can get veri annoying when u people keep askin me "why u cum to singapore?" as if they have no confidence in their own country lidat.</p>
              <p>But yes most of the PRs i see coming in i consider traitorous and parasitic. Especially the ones that just get enrolled into University, and after their course get granted automatic PR status without having served their due time of 2 years. Plus when what's his name said there are welfare/tax benefits that really pisses me off as well, especially if they do not do the 2 years.</p>
              <p>cenntralized government +Army + local schooling and living in HDBs is the starting essence of a Singaporean, + the food, but i think food is over-f*cking-rated because every city today has food and every city today wants to be "cosmopolitan" and a "global city." The 4 things i mentioned above are the basic elements of  what i believe makes Singapore unique.</p>
              <p>In case you guys can't discern my crititicism between the lines of the posts i make. Fine here's a little criticism out of many i have which i reserve for talking with other foreigners. (Because it is ungracious to bad mouth you people in front of you, because it really serves no purpose other than to hurt and it won't self correct anyone anyway. A gracious society takes centuries to flourish and go through the same develoment patterns we have done so in europe.)</p>
              <p>1. Most of you do not speak english properly in that you cannot communicate, but nevermind becoz i can also tok to ya'll no problem just like i tok to germans and aussies in their way because it is simply a way to communicate. U dun meet someone from China and insist on toking like some big fuck Big Ben english-moron right? So you communicate in the way which makes you understood. but people here don't speak english. But many Singaporeans think speaking English in an american accent or english accent is 'high class" like "golf" (haha; its not).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also it is interesting to note how Singaporeans badmouth Chinese the same way we foreigners badmouthed Singaporeans 20 years ago for exactly the same reasons. It is really interesting. And i am sure the Romans badmouthed us britainians a thousand years ago for the same reason we British badmouthed the Indians and other conquered/colonized peoples in the 1800s.</p>
              <p>Tip: It is very easy to discriminate against Singaporeans and write academically on the subject, simply because most of you are governed by mass campaign policies, thus it is easy to see all of you as a single group with prejudice; which is ironic since negative discrimination or prejudice is a myopic judgement of the entire population based on a few individuals. But in Singaporeans case, we can easily look at the masses of you and your campaigns to judge you negatively. You don't need me or anyone to criticize, it should be self evident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To bigots who hate PRs, yes i can hate them too, they suck. But don't ever speak to me as if i am an average parasitic PR because i am not. And i will defend my views and my earned rights.</p>

              <p><br>well, when i see a western PR, i would ask them "Yo! What bring you to the far east, Opium or spices??" and the conversation started. I still prefer to write and speak singlish, well, firstly, i cannot speak good english, secondly, singlish is part of our trademarks, foreigners like it, tho they may laugh over it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For me, I welcome the PRs, we are all humans, just from the different places and cultures, therefore it takes time to nurture. As what our MM said when i attended one of his speeches, singaporeans cannot produce enuf or dun want to produce, singaporeans are getting olders and living longer, so if you look at this demographic situation, are you going to do nothing about it? Well i may not be able to see the next generation, so to hell with it, why care so much?? but then we are responsible peoples, we need to provide our decendents a place or a better place. Without having enuf rice here, we have to import, that is the fact of it, without peoples to drive, to clean, to service, to trade, to bank, to care, etc etc..we will soon be a City of Old Folks home, and our youngs one will be taking care of 5 oldies instead of 5 youngs serving one oldie in the early years. We hv to get people in, especially the talents ones, you may not like it, me too, nobody like to have strangers in their house, but without them, who is going to take care of the house and tend to it. It is a very easy situation, attract the foreigners, the only worrying part is are we attracting the right foreigners. Yes, we may loose some of them or most of them, but what choice do we have, if out of ten, we get two, that is good enuf, and if get five, that will be a bonus.</p>

              <p>It looks like if there would ever be a foreigner worthy of judging you people as one of you, and telling you that this country sucks, I would be it. And my testimony would be credible because i have been through it. NS, schools, local discrimination, your Singlish language, your mandarin, your food and your fears. I would seriously be a credible candidate. I am a PR and I do criticize Singaporeans and Singapore. And when I am done with my uni course, i am leaving unless I can merge into the "foreign talent" class. </p>
              <p>But i have no plans to write anything. Besides authors like Rodney King have already written badly about Singapore, calling it a myth.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Thank you.</p>
              <p>I speak your singlish. I understand your atrocious hokkien. And I understand what it is like and your fear of your govt. Probably the closest any white 'fuck' has come to knowing what you people are. But i'll admit i did sound pompous, sorry lah dun mean to sound like a cock. But i have never met anyone else, in the army or otherwise who is in sin city as long term as i am, plus can get veri annoying when u people keep askin me "why u cum to singapore?" as if they have no confidence in their own country lidat.</p>
              <p>But yes most of the PRs i see coming in i consider traitorous and parasitic. Especially the ones that just get enrolled into University, and after their course get granted automatic PR status without having served their due time of 2 years. Plus when what's his name said there are welfare/tax benefits that really pisses me off as well, especially if they do not do the 2 years.</p>
              <p>cenntralized government +Army + local schooling and living in HDBs is the starting essence of a Singaporean, + the food, but i think food is over-f*cking-rated because every city today has food and every city today wants to be "cosmopolitan" and a "global city." The 4 things i mentioned above are the basic elements of  what i believe makes Singapore unique.</p>
              <p>In case you guys can't discern my crititicism between the lines of the posts i make. Fine here's a little criticism out of many i have which i reserve for talking with other foreigners. (Because it is ungracious to bad mouth you people in front of you, because it really serves no purpose other than to hurt and it won't self correct anyone anyway. A gracious society takes centuries to flourish and go through the same develoment patterns we have done so in europe.)</p>
              <p>1. Most of you do not speak english properly in that you cannot communicate, but nevermind becoz i can also tok to ya'll no problem just like i tok to germans and aussies in their way because it is simply a way to communicate. U dun meet someone from China and insist on toking like some big fuck Big Ben english-moron right? So you communicate in the way which makes you understood. but people here don't speak english. But many Singaporeans think speaking English in an american accent or english accent is 'high class" like "golf" (haha; its not).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also it is interesting to note how Singaporeans badmouth Chinese the same way we foreigners badmouthed Singaporeans 20 years ago for exactly the same reasons. It is really interesting. And i am sure the Romans badmouthed us britainians a thousand years ago for the same reason we British badmouthed the Indians and other conquered/colonized peoples in the 1800s.</p>
              <p>Tip: It is very easy to discriminate against Singaporeans and write academically on the subject, simply because most of you are governed by mass campaign policies, thus it is easy to see all of you as a single group with prejudice; which is ironic since negative discrimination or prejudice is a myopic judgement of the entire population based on a few individuals. But in Singaporeans case, we can easily look at the masses of you and your campaigns to judge you negatively. You don't need me or anyone to criticize, it should be self evident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To bigots who hate PRs, yes i can hate them too, they suck. But don't ever speak to me as if i am an average parasitic PR because i am not. And i will defend my views and my earned rights.</p>

              <p><br>Hi, just to clarify that I also a PR from one of the neighboring countries n also served NS. What Rodney King wrote in his book contained the painful truth about the country but the book is no longer available at the bookshop.</p>
