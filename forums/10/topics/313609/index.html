                                    enough Singaporeans with real drive, abilities and ambition. 
                                    By Seah Chiang Nee, littlespeck.com<br> Apr 6, 2008 </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">MANY 
                                    years ago, at a time when Singapore was preparing for general 
                                    elections, I ran into an old friend who appeared anxious 
                                    to talk to me.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">I was 
                                    then an editor of a newspaper. “I need to chat urgently,” 
                                    he said, excitement written all over him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A thought 
                                    struck me and I asked: “Have you been invited for 
                                    tea?” Surprised, he said yes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“Invited 
                                    for tea,” is Singapore political jargon meaning that 
                                    the person – in this case a corporate chief executive 
                                    officer – is being headhunted by the PAP to stand 
                                    as a candidate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">My hunch 
                                    was right and he was duly elected and became a Cabinet minister.<br> <br> The tea interview remains the PAP’s unique way of 
                                    recruiting political leaders for Singapore, starting work 
                                    as a Member of Parliament and ending up, it is hoped, in 
                                    the Cabinet</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    chosen ones are not experienced politicians rising from 
                                    party ranks, but straight from company boardrooms or the 
                                    professions, the armed forces or the civil service.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Many 
                                    are scholars and novices (some call them political virgins) 
                                    who don’t have to campaign hard for votes since the 
                                    group polling system makes it difficult for the weakened 
                                    Opposition to beat them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In fact, 
                                    many PAP candidates win on walkovers – some of them 
                                    repeatedly – and move into Parliament without a single 
                                    vote having been counted.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In this 
                                    manner, the mandate for Singaporeans’ representatives 
                                    frequently comes from the party rather than from voters.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In the 
                                    “brains” department these people will not be 
                                    found lacking, but few have the political attributes to 
                                    bond – or empathise - with ordinary people, especially 
                                    the poor.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    system, however, does work well for much of Singapore’s 
                                    43 years of independence – if one measures it by the 
                                    sparkling economic progress and clockwork efficiency.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In the 
                                    21st Century, however, this system of headhunting an exalted 
                                    leader like any common corporate figure – with a similar 
                                    offer of high wages and perks – may be losing some 
                                    of its shine for some candidates and voters.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Doubts 
                                    of its effectiveness are growing. For one thing, no one 
                                    will ever know the real talents that pass by, missed by 
                                    the search; or those who find the system unacceptable.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">This 
                                    form of centrally planned leadership succession may not 
                                    appeal to people with real drive, abilities and ambition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Last 
                                    week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong admitted difficulties 
                                    in finding “a fourth generation” leadership 
                                    – especially a successor for himself.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">He expanded 
                                    his 18-man Cabinet by two, adding new finds Law Minister 
                                    K. Shanmugam and Acting Manpower Minister Gan Kim Yong.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">But 
                                    the real shocker was his virtual rejection of all in the 
                                    present batch of ministers as possible PM material, unless 
                                    he “is run over by a bus”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    main points he made in an interview with two local newspapers 
                                    last week were:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">* He 
                                    will be PM until he can “find and groom” a successor 
                                    who should be ready to become PM in 13 years’ time, 
                                    in 2021 when he ill be 69.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">* Since 
                                    he is only 56, Lee says he will look for people who are 
                                    now in the 30s and early 40s. This has all but ruled out 
                                    all his subordinate ministers – disappointing those 
                                    who aspire for the top post.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">By keeping 
                                    all the older ministers and taking in two new ones, Lee 
                                    appears to be trying to strengthen his hands – only 
                                    a month after Malaysia’s election shock.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It is 
                                    not known if the two events are related. It will not be 
                                    surprising if Lee, jolted by Malaysia’s ruling front’s 
                                    election blow, will quickly strengthen his grip on power.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">PM Lee 
                                    may be ensuring absolute loyalty among his ministers, especially 
                                    in view of his father’s advancing age. Without Minister 
                                    Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, his leadership could be vulnerable 
                                    to challenge.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Lee 
                                    is also trying to raise his public image and show he is 
                                    in total charge and will remain in charge for a long time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    PM, who was once treated and cured of cancer, has dispelled 
                                    the notion of his tenure’s “temporariness”, 
                                    possibly no more than 8-10 years before he gives up.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Lee, 
                                    who became PM in 2004, has surprisingly been quiet, non-active 
                                    and rather overshadowed by his more assertive, high profile 
                                    father, who is 84.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">There 
                                    have been long periods when he has not attended any public 
                                    function or made a speech.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A recent 
                                    example was the escape from detention of the Jemaah Islamiah 
                                    leader Mas Selamat Kastari, when the PM kept quiet as though 
                                    it were a non-event.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It was 
                                    only after his father made a comment, condemning the authorities 
                                    for “complacency”, that the PM followed suit, 
                                    using the same word. It’s not good for his image.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Cynics 
                                    here, however, are not impressed with the professed difficulties 
                                    in finding good leaders.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“It 
                                    is propaganda used to impress people that only the PAP is 
                                    qualified to lead. Actually, they are just bureaucrats who 
                                    make mistakes like leaders elsewhere,” one opposition 
                                    supporter said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Many 
                                    Singaporeans believe that the calibre of the present crop 
                                    of technocrats is not comparable to that of the founding 
                                    leaders, who were thrown up by the throes of history.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It was 
                                    the unselfish leaders (salaries were then very low) like 
                                    Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Keng Swee, S. Rajaratnam, etc, who achieved 
                                    greatness for Singapore in its first 25 years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Where 
                                    will the next PM come from? He could be headhunted from 
                                    outside the party – or even from Singaporeans abroad 
                                    – and groomed for a decade.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Of course, 
                                    an election can change all this. Lee Kuan Yew has warned 
                                    his people not to expect victory all the time.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>yes, were they not told of the severe lesson on complacency?</em></p>
