It has only given the elites an opportunity to do some of their own window dressing. Whether the real lessen will be learned and ministers will set examples on more accountable and transparent practices will remain a big question mark. They will continue to tell the population to pay the elites more salaries and more bonuses in order to justify their current highest salaries which the citizens have not had a hand in approving.<br><br>Ministers will be appearing on media to preach about how accountable and transparent the new NKF is and everything is brought under control but in real fact everything will remain the same as before and old problems soon forgotten.<br><br>There will be all kinds of talking about being caring to the less fortunate but are those in charge of our funds and taxes caring to the people?<br><br>They will continue to talk about elites' entitlement for more monies to justify their constant self-promotion to no end. Even younger ministers are learning quickly how to talk out of instead of solving people's problems. No wonder the 938 callers are reacting negatively to the NKF saga by asking: "Where is our monies".

Well.. thats a very hypothetical IF... I digress..<br><br>Well, however I do agree that being a CEO of a VWO with the scale and means of NKF should be paid a decent wage... but bonus of 12 months for a few years running, especially with the economy in bad shape... its a hard pill to swallow. So what exactly are the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) of NKF? What performance benchmarks were so well attained to warrant a 12 month bonus to NKF's CEO. Is NKF's KPIs the number of patients it treats, or the number of patients it turn away because they dun qualify..? or is it the amount of money that NKF raise during the charity shows. The effectiveness of NKF should be measured by the number of patients it treats...regardless of race, religion, social status.... and not by the dollars and cents raised during charity events... nor the number of cars that donors won....nor by the amount of publicity the public saw....<br>NKF's policy of determining who it should serve must be changed.<br><br>If NKF doesn't have such a huge reserve, one can understand why they refuse to help middle-class patients... but it seems that with all the money on offer for lucky draws and cars... not to mention the CEO's pay packages and expensive bathroom fittings... one cannot help but wonder why there are kidney patients who were refused help by NKF.<br><br>Lastly, while Mr T.T Durai has not done anything against the law... except maybe for his non-disclosure of directorship in another company which counts NKF as one of its main customers. I am wondering if there are any breaches in commercial law here... is there any corruption involved?<br>The absence of integrity here... is sadly..omni-present</div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">I think that the bonus scheme of Durai is actually linked to the top civil servant bonus for the year.

If PM Lee must know the reason why checks and balances did not work in NKF case, I think the reason is clearly established in the above-stated ministerial reply to parliament. There is clearly a lot of justification, generalization and assumptions which at the end covers up the whole lots of problems.<br><br>PM Lee can instruct the ministers to be candid instead of making all kinds of general assumptions that mull over problems. He can instruct the ministers in being more objective and candid so that NKF and GLCs will not learn to copy them.<br><br>If the top do not set the tone on corporate governance there can be no improvements or remaking of Singapore to talk about.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by robertteh:</div><div class="quote_body">Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan spoke on the NKF saga said: "People should not over-react or pre-judge on what has happened"<br><br>Mr. Durai and the whole board have resigned because of expose in the SPH/NKF defamation suit about excessive salaries, 12-month bonuses, first-class air travel and golden taps in Durai's private closets.<br><br>Are these expose not factual? Why there was this continual cover=up for 13 years and finally when facts are out the ministers are still trying to stonewall the issue calling it "overeacting or pre-judging the issue".<br><br>Are the people over-reacting or pre-judging issues arising out of facts disclosed finally in this court case?<br><br>I remember I attended the annual Feedback Unit's annual conference at Suntec in 2002 and stood up to ask Dr. Vivian the first question from the floor at the conference:  "The high cost of living and doing business in Singapore is the number-one issue affecting the nation, what will your Remaking Singapore committee do to help solve this problem.?"<br><br>Dr. Vivian's reply (as far as I could remember): Cost has two components the fixed cost and variable cost. Over the variable cost there are portion over which the government has no control. He understood people's concern and would be looking into this problem.<br><br>Today, after all the Remaking of Singapore, has Dr. Vivian solved the high cost problem. All we know and experience after all the remaking by his committee is that there will be more transport fare and other fee increases.<br><br>If PM wants to build an inclusive society, he has to make all the committees effective and not as a means to justify existing shortcomings and finally ending in covering up the problem as has happened to the handling of high costs.<br><br>The NKF case is just a tip of the iceberg. People are not over-reacting or pre-judging so it is Dr. Vivian who should adopt a more candid approach and not resort to the same cost-cost gerrymandeering way to avoid solutions in the whole remaking exercise while trying to cover-up (not brought up for solution) real problems and issues again !!! P<br><br>eople waited long enough to get an answer why the NKF was not revealing information and be more transparent and it was finally spilled out in a court case.<br><br>It is the government's lack of transparency at the ministers' level that is the root of the problem !!! </div></blockquote>I totally agree with you again Robertteh! This whole episode is beginning to have a bad after taste. I think that the government is trying to cover-up this as it might lead to more undesirable info to the public. Particularly the amount of bonus that the top people get in the government sector!<br><br>Really sucks!<span style="color: darkred;"></span><span style="color: darkred;"></span></div>
