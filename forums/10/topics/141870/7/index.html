Durai told reporters he 'strongly believed in change'.<br><br>Barely an hour earlier, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan had announced Mr Durai's resignation as chief executive officer of the NKF at a hastily convened press conference.<br><br>Mr Durai, who initially avoided answering reporters' questions after the press conference, was smiling as he said: 'I have been running NKF for 37 years and I think it's time that a new leadership takes over because I strongly believe in change... a new style.'<br><br>Asked if quitting was a tough decision to make, Mr Durai, 57, said 37 years was a long time and the time had come for a leadership change.<br><br>After dropping his defamation suit against The Straits Times on Tuesday, he maintained that he had done nothing wrong and said he would not resign 'unless people want me to'.<br><br>Overnight, thousands of outraged Singaporeans called for his resignation through online petitions, letters to newspapers and calls to the media.<br><br>As of last night, almost 40,000 people had signed an online petition calling for his removal. By yesterday, more than 6,800 NKF donors had cancelled their regular donations too.<br><br>On Wednesday morning, too, the walls of the NKF headquarters were vandalised with graffiti attacking him.<br><br>Yesterday afternoon, Mr Durai and NKF chairman Richard Yong sought Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan's views on how to go about restoring public trust in the organisation.<br><br>Mr Durai offered to step down and asked the minister if that would 'be helpful'. Mr Khaw told him it would.<br><br>About three hours later at the press conference, a red-eyed and drawn Mr Durai sat looking down most of the time. He looked to Mr Khaw, seated beside him, almost every time reporters put a question to him.<br><br>The minister did most of the talking during the press conference, which was telecast live over Channel News Asia. After the hour-long session, he left immediately, flanked by Mr Yong and vice-chairman Alwyn Lim.<br><br>A former lawyer, Mr Durai started as an NKF volunteer when he was an undergraduate in the 1960s. After 21 years as a volunteer, he took on the top post in 1992.<br><br>In the past decade, the NKF grew to become Singapore's largest charity, with an income of about $100 million in 2003 and about 1,000 employees.<br><br>It also expanded from helping kidney patients, to providing health screening for the masses and starting a fund for cancer patients this year.<br><br>After yesterday's press conference, Mr Durai refused to answer reporters' questions until someone asked if he had anything to say to the public.<br><br>He replied: 'I want to thank the donors of the NKF for helping me in the past 37 years to build a great institution which has achieved iconic status in the world.<br><br>'I pray that donors continue to support the NKF henceforth.' </span><br><br>I watched the press conference and his response to reporters outside the office. I couldn't help but notice a certain <span style="text-decoration: underline;">smugness </span>in him while he answered questions.<br><br>Similarly, when quizzed on the difficult choice of stepping down and the reasons why, he chose to focus on his achievements over the last 37 years and that he believed in change. Hence the impression he gave was that he felt <span style="color: red;"><strong>the reasons why he was stepping down was becoz he believed in fresh faces to take over his 'glittering record', not becoz he was forced out by public outrage.</strong></span><br><br>Clearly TT Durai still thinks he has done nothing wrong, whether ethically or morally. The arrogance in his smile seemed to underline his defiance to public opinion. Not one shred of humility was offered nor any form of apology from either him or the board regarding the whole fiasco.<br><br>Makes me wonder whether he deserved any respect in the first place.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think alot of people are really compassionate....<br><br>read ST Forum and other online forums whereby people implored people not to stop donations... but I for 1, disagree. we should stop donating, at least for now, even tho Durai &amp; his BOD have resigned.<br><br>their reserves of $262 m is really a huge sum. many charities who serve the needy cannot even raise $1 m a year to cover their operating expenses.... people should divert their funds to these other needy as well.... NKF is not the ONLY charity in Singapore....<br><br>the nkf patients are not, i repeat, NOT in IMMINENT danger of losing their financial assistance. their reserves, already confirmed by their ex-CEO is that it can last 30 years (even if miscaluation or add in inflation and patient influx, maybe iso 30 years, 10 years?)... nkf is already in a much more enviable situation as compared to other charities...<br><br>2/3 Singaporean donate to nkf...translate to abt 2 m people..... only abt 7 k people cancelled their donations.... see how compassionate we are....<br><br>nkf albeit a really successful fund-raiser has many questionable concerns that we the public should get them to address and that we should keep in mind.<br><br>they have the money, means and clout to organize mass fund-raising activities, infiltrate into our education system to use little children to "sell" the donation to a compassionate society. now they must reflect on their reserves, practices, mission statement and moral obligation and do some moral good in light of the negative publicity....<br><br>my qualms abt them are:-<br><br>1. their staff had stood behind Durai 100%. so the new BOD, if have differing opinons on how to run the place, would not have the support?<br><br>2. the operating expenses of their spanking nice building would probably amount to a tidy sum of donations that could have been put to better use.<br><br>3. the ratio of staff to patient is very low.... why does nkf need 900+ staff to serve 1800 patients? do they have 1 doctor/ nurse/ attendant to 2 patients? operating costs becomes very high... should not a charity be "saving" money rather than spending more money.... alto conventional marketing is to spend abit to reap more, but that's commercial...not "NOT FOR PROFIT".<br><br>4. a full and proper disclosure of previous years expenditures should be made known to the public. we never know, maybe they had abused the fund over a long term and spent more than necessary out of the donations on non-necessary items. alto its like digging up the past, but we deserve to know.<br><br>5. a personally-paid public apology from Durai and his BOD for their unrepentent attitude.<br><br>6. mislead of public by inflating patient numbers - pure dishonesty and yet they suffer no repercussions from that from a legal point.... what message is that?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br></div>
