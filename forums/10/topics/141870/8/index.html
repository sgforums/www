            <div class='col-md body'>Posted by ra8865 who is a super supporter for someone who cheats people of their donation.<br><br>Â“Yes I do support Mr Durai, Why : Because I have worked there I know how relentlessly he worked for that organisation. Because I know if he had to work for a profit organisation he would have earned 10 times more than what he gets now. And if you still don't believe me I have an article from the Chronicle of Philanthrophy hopefully you can form your own opinion after hearing what experts say : http://philanthropy.com/free/articles/v14/i24/24003301.htm."<br><br><span style="color: red;"> Yeah I also work so hard for the comapny did I get as much as him? Ever wonder why he never open a company for himself and join NKF since you say he can earn 10 times more? why work when you can cheat  and get more out of it rite?  </span><br><br>"Your ten dollars and my ten dollars do not mean a thing if they don't come together to help a needy."<br><br><span style="color: red;"> Yeah the thing is that I donate my $10 thinking I could help people and you spent your $10 on yourself liao and still want to get my $9.20 to spent on your own stuff.</span><br><br>"40 years of his life when he worked relentlessly with little public support no one gave a thought to that. The money is not in his coffers but in the NKF Fund."<br><br><span style="color: red;"> Work 40 years in where? in a office ordering people? haha kiddding me rite? no money in his coffers? then explain why $600k goes into his pocket?<br><br>IF HE CAN  PROVE TO US ALL THAT HE IS WILLING TO DONATE BACK ALL HIS $600k TO NKF THEN I WILL SAY HE IS A GOOD GUY. SINCE ALL OF US HAD DONATED ALL OUR MONEY WHY NOT HIM? SCARE TO LOSE MONEY IS IT? OUR MONEY IS EARN THROUGH OUR SWEAT AND BLOOD AND WE DONATED TO HELP OTHERS BY WHY IS IT GOING TO HIM? IS HE A PATIENT IN NKF? </span><br><br>He has one of the best business practices in NKF. practices which are followed in large business houses like GE and Walmart and Nordstrom.<br><br><span style="color: red;"> Yeah to bluff people like you to believe that he is working so "darn hard" to get money for the patients  </span><br><br>"Training programs where an employee is taught practices which are taught in business schools like Harvard."<br><br><span style="color: red;"> So does the training program also teach you on how to cheat donations of people and buy gold taps with it? </span><br><br>"I understand he gets a huge amount of money but if you read the article you will know his counterparts in America earn much more than this. Have offices larger than his and have perks he can't dream of."<br><br><span style="color: red;"> So does that give him the rite to take $600k of our donation and pocket it up? Are you willing to give me 75% of your salary for my spending?</span><br><br>"His dream was to make NKF a global organisation. Great personalities like Pele, Mr Jain (The Dean of Kellogs Business School), Infosys Chairman and the Mike G termed as the topmost direct mail fund raiser have visited and lauded NKF for its practices. We had interns and employees graduated from the Harvard Business School, CEIBS, Insead working in NKF."<br><br><span style="color: red;"> Wonder why all go NKF? COs you take our donations and pay for yourselves. Donations come at no cost unlike in a company where you need to buy goods or make goods and must guess whether the people wants it or not.<br>NKF = 0 % input, 100% profit. Of cos I will join!<br></span><br><br>"You get monkeys if you pay peanuts. Will any one of us work for anything below our worth. We don't mind remaining jobless till the time we don't get something substantial and we expect people with brains grit and determination to work for salaries not worth them. "<br><br><span style="color: red;"> In singapore we have no choice we need to feed our family, not like someone who can actually be driven by someone. you do not mind remaining jobless but we mind cos we are not like you who cheats people money first then runs away and says " I do not mind"  </span><br><br>"Although I am not working for NKF anymore I still support Mr Durai and I know Truth always prevails. If you read the article you will know that the head of Red Cross was pressurised to leave as well because of the amount she earned and I am sure that's what we will do to heads of charity organisations. We don't want our charity organisations to be as good as our Profit organisations where we hold shares as we don't get direct dividends on it."<br><br><span style="color: red;"> Of course u do not want to have shares cos in a private company if the company profits you have to pay people who holds the shares. you wish to take all the money to yourselves rite? Why share when you can eat all? Wonder why are you not working in NKF any? Did they kick you out for taking too much coffee money ? Or have you taken so much donation from us that you scare that the police will probe you for cheating? </span><br><br>"I am sure you will have your own opinions about the salaries and the "Golden Tap".<br>and I am not sure if you are hating me for this. But the only question, I am asking myself is<br><br>Would we work for a charity organisation at 1/3rd the salary we would be getting in a business organisation?<br>Would I work 10 - 12 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year for 13 years in the same organisation without any rewards or increments?"<br><br><span style="color: red;"> Have you ever been working at all? Or working in NKF has made you lazy or dumb? They are people who are willing to do it without a single cent and work 20 hours and 7 days a week for more then 30 years.<br><br>I wonder at times do the NKF staff themselves ever donates to the funds themselves?<br><br>If they do not donate then why should we donate? </span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm pretty amazed at how easily the media can lead Singaporeans around by their noses.<br><br>Everyone is so "outraged" at Durai's salary...<br><br>Has everyone forgotten how much our own ministers pay themselves for public service positions?<br><br>Have they forgotten about a certain "minister", whom after years of bleeding the coffers, creates positions for himself at ridiculous pay scales after he should have retired!?  TWICE!?<br><br>Shit rolls downhill as they say.  Top ranking public servants entrusted to take care of the public's well-being are paying themself millions while the standard of living around us are going higher and higher and the average Singaporean makes a tiny percentage of what they make.<br><br>I'm not surprised that Durai looked to them as a shining example of "fairness" and paid himself that amount.  Even Goh Chok Tong's wife said it's peanuts...  Yes, peanuts compared to what our ministers are scooping, with both hands, out of our pockets.</div>

Mr Durai and his buddies<br>really deserve their fantastic pay. i'm happy for them! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">singaporeans were suckers of the NKF show anyway.</span> it was amazing how they really psychoed the "1900 112 6868" into everyones head. TV-frikking-Mobile! big hand to durai! great marketing strategy, your earned it, dude! (no, i'm not being sarcastic.)<br><br>couldn't any of you see it from the beginning? the donation cards our children have been bringing back from NKF (stating its 'compulsory')the *emotional* pathetic faces of the kidney failure poverty stricken retards, (please, quit BEGGING! 2 outta every 5 dollars probably go to the Big Guys) the way the mediac0ck and overseas actors *risked* their lives, (come on, nobody does things for free. seriously. especially the sound and lighting. you think Unusual Productions are gonna do that for free? BS.)<br><br>somehow, "I told you so" just doesn't seem enough. =)<br><br>it all culminates in this. i can imagine the thousands of singaporeans now feeling SO darn suckered. i mean, BIG TIME. woohoo. many being buddhists, shallowporeans really need to WAKE UP that donating a few dollars aint' gonna do any good to your Karma, HULLO!??<br><br>me? heh. never saw the need to donate to what tsunami BS, or nkf, or cancer crap (yeah right, thousand and one organizations all for 'tsunami fund'. please lah. and its not that i don't want to donate. its the WAY they persuade you to donate through the shallow shows.) if you want to help anyone, use your own hands, go down and do some serious groundwork. NKF was a scapegoat. Similar charity organizations who might have been naughty are probably scampering to cover their @sses as well. nothing is what it seems! (think of all that money pouring in! oooh, just a little pinch here and there won't make a difference.. will it?)<br><br>Lets face it. health is alot about taking care of your body. EVEN if you are poor, there are ways to maintain a healthy body and lifestyle. its all in your mind and attitude. are the govt bodies not doing enough to promote healthy eating and active lifestyle? i doubt so! look at the numerous posters everywhere, and even tv adverts. but people are ignorant, they want to "enjoy life". so when you get cancer or kidney failure and have wasted all your money on booze or ciggies, you want help from the public? wtf? of course, of course, there ARE cases where these poorfishes are really down with 'hereditary' diseases and stuff, or really that miserably poor. but i believe alot of your health is in your hands. if you don't take steps to keep active and eat healthy, wholesome foods, dont' come begging when you're down with disease.<br><br>i've gently tried to promote this conscious eating and living habits among people i know, but many shrug it off as me being too "health conscious". well, i know we all are gonna die one day, but its whether you die suffering from PREVENTABLE diseases or you die in good shape saying, "i've lived the good life to the fullest."<br></div>

You have to show the accountability, that the people you have in place are going to be held accountable for their actions and then show the transparency. You have to fully disclose...all information to the public to allow them to generate that trust and credibility factor back in."<br><br>Other companies faced the same kind of setbacks.<br><br>There have been cases where people donated their own money thinking it was going for a specific purpose only to find that it was being diverted elsewhere.<br><br>In the weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks, Americans donated more than US$500 million to the Red Cross.<br><br>But not long after, it emerged that fully 40 percent of those funds were going to administrative costs and other Red Cross concerns.<br><br>When that came to light, people, not surprisingly, were furious.<br><br>And the head of the American Red Cross had to resign.<br><br>At the United Way they were not surprised<br><br>Mr Owens said, "Anyone can tell you it takes a second to lose credibility and a lifetime to gain it back. But when you're dealing with an issue of charitable organisations and these organisations are depending on the donations and dollars to sustain their operations, that snowball effect has to happen a lot quicker."<br><br>United Way has learned the hard way that in the wake of a financial scandal, transparency is what matters most. - CNA/ms<br><br></div>
