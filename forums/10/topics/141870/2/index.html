            <div class='col-md body'>I do not know how NKF was first set up and whether anyone from the government is supporting it financially or resourcefully.<br><br>If it is an entirely non-government owned and its board is paying salaries out of its own private phianthropic foundations etc purely private charitable organization, it may be quite a different matter whether its toilet is plated with gold or chrome. No body will care how such charitable organization pay the salaries or bonuses to its executives.<br><br>If NKF is blessed or endorsed over time by the government and has used the government's name (ministers' or high officers) to lend influence in any way to promote charitable activities, then the citizens or ST have every right to ask such a charitable organization for accountablity and opening of the books because government's influences or resources are being used for private organization purposes.<br><br>Even if the government has good reason to do so it should be held accountable for such lending of influences or facility as they properly belong the public.<br><br>The reason is very simple - such a government-backed charitable organziation may be tapping on public facility to advance their own totally different sets of objectives first-class travel or luxurious decorations for their own offices which will then be departing from the original set of purposes shared or subscribed to at first by the government.<br><br>I think this case sadly portrays a lack of accountable differentiation how to lend support private organization subject to its own rules while public facility or influence is being tapped.<br><br>Actions should immediately be taken to prevent our government to be used by private organization or individual to serve private objectives because of possibility of losing control where publicly induced donations might end up - first class travel or luxuries in officers' offices or extremely over-generous salaries or bonuses.<br><br>The public has the right to prevent any public resources being used directly or indirectly to serve the objectives of private organization no matter how worthy is the cause because of problem with potential control or misuse.<br><br>PM has just drawn up a list of rules for the ministers to prevent abuses, underhand or corruptions or receiving or gifts etc. which can happen due to similar loss of control over potential influence peddling or misuse.<br><br>It is only proper and timely that any form of subtle wrong doings that can happen with influences be recognized arising from this NKF case and actions be taken urgently to prevent influences or resources of government directly or indirectly being tapped to help causes of individuals or charity organziations no matter how worthy is their cause because of practical control problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i am sure even the NKF patients and relatives will be angry after reading this.<br><br>THE National Kidney Foundation falsely inflated the number of patients it treats and understated how long its financial reserves would last, its chief executive Mr T.T. Durai conceded yesterday.<br><br>Mr Durai admitted in court that if NKF's reserves of $262 million were used simply to treat dialysis patients, they would last 30 to 40 years, not three years, as the foundation has long claimed. He also admitted that the NKF had made 'a few errors' over the years in telling the public how many patients it treats.<br><br>But he denied that there was a deliberate strategy to mislead the public, saying that he and his colleagues 'honestly believed' they should raise as much money as they could for the 'patients of the future'.<br><br>In May last year, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan informed Parliament that the NKF had treated 1,414 patients in 1999 and 1,512 patients in 2003.<br><br>The previous month, the NKF had told The Straits Times that it needed about $2,600 a month to support each of its 2,000 patients, a total of $62.4 million per year.<br><br>The charity cited those figures to bolster its argument that its reserves were not excessive. Based on its expenditure of more than $60 million a year for dialysis, the reserves would last three years, it said.<br><br>But yesterday, during the defamation case NKF had launched against Singapore Press Holdings, the court was shown how the NKF in fact spent far less on dialysis than the public had been led to believe.<br><br><span style="color: red;">According to its 2003 audited financial statement, it spent $31.6 million that year on dialysis and transplantation. Of that amount, $22.9 million came from dialysis fees it collected from patients and a further $1.5 million came from other related income.<br><br>So NKF was out of pocket by only $7.2 million, noted Mr Davinder Singh, who was acting for SPH.</span><br><br>He asked Mr Durai: 'If you stopped all fundraising activities and concentrated purely on treating kidney patients, the NKF can continue for at least another 30 years without raising a single cent. True or false?'<br><br>Mr Durai initially disagreed, saying that no one could be sure patients would continue to pay their share for the treatments. But he finally agreed that NKF's assertion that the reserves would last only three years was 'not accurate'.<br><br>'It is not accurate; in other words, it is false?' asked Mr Singh.<br><br>'Yes,' said Mr Durai.<br><br>He told the court that this impression had never been corrected.<br><br>'We always took the point that if the patients do not pay the moneys for dialysis, the reserves would last only for three years. That is the way we answered the public,' he said.<br><br>But Mr Singh noted that even if the NKF had to foot the entire dialysis bill of $31.6 million a year, its current reserves of $262 million would last more than eight years.<br><br>He suggested that there was a 'conspiracy', a 'deliberate strategy' to create a false impression of need so that NKF would get more money, a suggestion Mr Durai rejected.<br><br>Mr Durai also denied that his performance bonus was linked to the amount of donations NKF received.<br><br>Mr Singh then asked him why he would not come clean on the matter.<br><br>'The money is for the people,' said Mr Durai.<br><br>'And your taps,' retorted Mr Singh.<br><br>NKF had sued SPH over an article written by senior correspondent Susan Long, which recounted an incident in which expensive fittings, including taps, had been installed in the bathroom of Mr Durai's private office suite.<br><br>On the question of how many patients the NKF actually treats, Mr Singh noted that the organisation's estimates had changed over time.<br><br>A letter written to The Straits Times in April last year by the chairman of its Children's Medical Fund board, Dr Gerard Chuah, had claimed that the NKF had 3,000 patients.<br><br>Mr Singh pointed out the number had been overstated by about 1,000.<br><br>Mr Durai said he realised there was a mistake only after the letter had been published, but had not corrected it.<br><br>Mr Singh asked: 'So in addition to the travel and the reserves, we now know that even the number of patients that were being put out as being treated by NKF was erroneous and remains uncorrected; right?'<br><br>'Yes,' Mr Durai replied.<br><br>When asked why he had done nothing to correct it, he said: 'It was an oversight. I did not think it was of material importance. The donor gives us money because of the brand of the NKF and I did not think it was so important at that point of time to correct this error.'<br><br>Mr Singh suggested that the number had been inflated to create a false impression of need. In fact, according to Mr Khaw's reply to Parliament last year, NKF's 'share' of kidney patients in Singapore had dropped, from 54 per cent in 1999 to 44 in 2003.<br><br>Mr Durai maintained that NKF had not deliberately set out to create a false impression to attract more funds. He also disagreed that the failure of the NKF management to correct the errors amounted to mismanagement.<br><br>'Whatever we did was to grow the programmes,' he said. 'We did it not with deliberateness to deceive anyone at all.'<br><br>-- sharonl@sph.com<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moral Bankruptcy was the key to NKF's success. If it wasn't for its "inflation" of the pains and suffering as well as the untold hardships of its patients, i highly doubt that it would have achieve the stature it would have today.<br><br>Honestly, how much money does go to the patients, taking into accounting the procurement of new equipement, staffing of the core functions? Seeing that the patients have to fork out so much with the NKF only paying for a small remainder just makes me wonder how did manage to "decieve" the public (on the people under its auspices) for such a long time and such a big scale?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Arising from the disclosure of many wrong-doings and total lack of transparency in NKF/SPH defamation lawsuit, it is clearly established that the government should not lend influence no matter how worthy is a cause to private company or individuals in pursuing their private agenda and objectives.<br><br>The same things that have been unveiled in this case might well have happened to private companies using their influences of MPs while sitting on their board and collecting director fees from such private companies.<br><br>If PM LHL really wants to prevent any further wrong doings and doesn't want so many cans of worms, then the right thing to do is nip the problems at the bud. He should not permit many MPs who are already receiving high pays for attending parliament meetings and a few meet-the-people to become directors of private companies.<br><br>PM and MPs will not have the time or resources to check on abuses by private companies and their boards or individuals and many things happening outside might be beyond his control.<br><br>In any event as posted in another thread, presently the so-called corporate governance being promoted is only a kind of standard setting and look-good presentation and not something that is implemented by companies at work level.<br><br>The more MPs are involved by becoming directors of private businesses lending influence to individuals and private businesses as in NKF case, the more likely government might be taken for a ride with private companies' pursuing their own agenda due to loss of control by the MPs who being in receipts of fees might be too helpless to raise issues with wrong doings.</div>
