            <div class='col-md body'>Already the NKF is sticking to its guns despite the revelations of mismanagement with its spokesmonkey, Michelle Ang, saying today that Durai wasn't given a chance to explain his side of the story and was forced to answer "yes" or "no" in court.<br><br>I'M THOROUGHLY amazed at the will to self-preservation some of the scums of earth possess!!!<br><br>They are also resorting to the dirty old trick of holding Singaporeans hostage by parading their patients in public and publicising sob stories of how the crisis in 1988 almost did them in and how if funds stop, patients will suffer.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>SINGAPOREANS, Please tell your friends and families, these patients can go KDF.  KDF can take over NKF's facilities and all those highly paid idiots at NKF can be retrenched.</strong><br><br><strong>NKF IS NOT THE ONLY CHARITY CATERING TO KIDNEY PATIENTS.</strong></span><br><br><strong>And a slowing down of donations will not affect NKF because it has reserves enough to last 30 years!!!!!</strong><br><br>Finally, Singaporeans must keep up the pressure on them for them to remove all the scumbags and come clean with their finances.  Richard Yong said that the directors are all volunteers who collect nothing in fees.  Are we to believe this after all the lies from Durai?<br><br>Let us not rest until NKF can EXPLAIN:<br><br>1. What other side of the story is there to a $960 tap?<br><br>2. What other side of the story is there to 8 cars and a mercedes for Durai's wife's personal use???<br><br>3.  What other side of the story is there to a shower built just for Durai with expensive bath mixer???<br><br>4. What other side of the story is there to 12 months' bonus?  My CEO who founded one of the largest banks in the region didn't even get 12 months!!<br><br>5. What other side of the story is there to all the prevarications of Richard Yong and Gerard Chuah to the press?<br><br>Finally, if you see Durai's wife driving that mercedes, remember to spit at her.</div>

The patients will not suffer unless they (NKF) withholds the funds and subsidies.<br><br>They (NKF) must be accountable for their actions and deeds..<br><br>Maybe the IRAS should be looking into this bonus/salary issue??????</div>

In court, during cross examination, your integrity is put on the block. You answer only what is asked of you and no more. If he wanted to tell 'his side of the story', he should not have thrown in the towel after 2 days, at which time michael khoo could have put him on the stand and Durai could then give his 'speech'. So he has only himself to blame for being naive.<br><br>Davinder Singh simply stuck to his task of ripping Durai's and the NKF's integrity to shreds. Durai put up an evasive front numerous times by refusing to answer a straight yes or no during questioning and his manner of response was clearly likened to that of a snake. At times, he was even flippant:<br><br>Quote: "You should ask Mr Richard Yong that"<br><br>~ on responding to whether he should have corrected Richard Yong's press release that the CEO did not fly first class.<br><br>It is indeed disturbing that this is the level of ignorance some people are still mucking around in.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A lesson we can all learn from here is -<br><br>never get entangled with SPH (Singapore Press Holdings).<br><br>TT Durai  made the worst decision in his life - sue Straits Times.  To me, that is tantamount to suing the Government !<br><br>Anyway, I have no sympathy towards him even though the blame isn't entirely on him for his fantastic high salary.  The entire board of directors (consisting of mostly very old folks) in NFK should  take the blame.  Government should sack them and replace them with younger people!</div>
