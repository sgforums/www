Well.. thats a very hypothetical IF... I digress..<br><br>Well, however I do agree that being a CEO of a VWO with the scale and means of NKF should be paid a decent wage... but bonus of 12 months for a few years running, especially with the economy in bad shape... its a hard pill to swallow. So what exactly are the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) of NKF? What performance benchmarks were so well attained to warrant a 12 month bonus to NKF's CEO. Is NKF's KPIs the number of patients it treats, or the number of patients it turn away because they dun qualify..? or is it the amount of money that NKF raise during the charity shows. The effectiveness of NKF should be measured by the number of patients it treats...regardless of race, religion, social status.... and not by the dollars and cents raised during charity events... nor the number of cars that donors won....nor by the amount of publicity the public saw....<br>NKF's policy of determining who it should serve must be changed.<br><br>If NKF doesn't have such a huge reserve, one can understand why they refuse to help middle-class patients... but it seems that with all the money on offer for lucky draws and cars... not to mention the CEO's pay packages and expensive bathroom fittings... one cannot help but wonder why there are kidney patients who were refused help by NKF.<br><br>Lastly, while Mr T.T Durai has not done anything against the law... except maybe for his non-disclosure of directorship in another company which counts NKF as one of its main customers. I am wondering if there are any breaches in commercial law here... is there any corruption involved?<br>The absence of integrity here... is sadly..omni-present</div></blockquote>What if I'm working in LTA?

            <div class='col-md body'>A friend found this gem in a blog - singaporeangle.blogspot - and emailed me:<br><br>Charity or helping the poor and needy<br><br>Rather, I want to tell a story--and this time, it's a real life present day story--about the Aravind Eye Care System, based in Madurai, India (hat tip to this book; scroll down).<br><br>In brief, Aravind is a profit making institution providing healthcare--specifically, for the eye; and very specifically, the cataract eye surgery. The equipment and service is world class. The quality of care compares favorablely with the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, UK, so much that British patients have been travelling to India to get their surgery done there in recent years. (A resident from Harvard Medical School who was there at one point also remarked that he was getting more clinical experience than any of his classmates in Harvard, as he got to see many instances of rare eye diseases that back in Harvard, you only get to read about.)<br><br>At this point, one might think: must be expensive to go to Araind. And that's where the shocker lies: 60% of the patients are nonpaying patients while the remaining 40% pay about US$50 to $300 for cataract surgery. (It cost about US$3000 for the equivalent surgery in the US.) Even allowing the differences in cost of labor, the contrast is out of this world, considering the quality of care that Aravind provides. Furthermore, Aravind is not only debt free, runs a surplus, but has been financially self-sustaining from day one. No government grants, no donations, never asked for them either. How is this even possible?<br><br>The founder, Dr. Venkataswamy ("Dr. V") says he was inspired by McDonald's. Nothing mysterious, merely the observation that an "In-depth attention to inputs and process steps guarantees high-quality outputs":<br><br>Dr. V has developed and standardized the Aravind process, in which the first step is more than 1,500 eye camps where the poor are tested for vision problems and those needing help are admitted. They are then transported to hospitals. This is different from the more popular on-site eye camps in villages and small towns in India. The conditions of sanitation and medical care in such camps cannot be controlled as well as they can be in specially designed hospitals developed for this purpose. In the Aravind process, technicians, often young women drawn from the local areas and trained in eye care only, supplement the work of doctors. Patient preparation and postoperative work are done by these technicians. Doctors perform only surgeries. The process flow allows a doctor and two technician teams to perform more than 50 surgeries per day. Because the process is so well developed, technicians and doctors are so carefully trained, inputs are fully controlled, and the system and values are rigidly enforced, Aravind boasts of an outcome rate that is among the best in the world. (Prahalad, 37; emphasis mine)<br><br>In other words, process innovation drives the costs way down, thus enabling very low prices, thus allowing Aravind to serve "Bottom of the Pyramid" customers--the poor and needy.<br><br>A thought (slightly revised July 16, 1100 -0400)<br><br>I do wonder if in the NKF uproar and the subsequent soul searching over how charity organisations should conduct themselves, an alternative has been overlooked.<br><br>"Charity organisation"--of the scale of an NKF anyway--did not, does not, could not survive on charity alone. It has to be thoroughly professional and business-like in efficiency--in translating the charity of the donors, on the one hand, into actual relief for the patients under its care, on the other hand. And there is no better way to guarantee this professionalism than by paying good money for the best brains that money can buy--and I am not talking about unnecessary toilet fixtures or shenanigans with the travel perk (after all, it is possible to overpay a CEO even in the profit making world).<br><br>There is thus an important sense in which the "charity organisation" is a misnomer: the small time donors putting in his $10 from a take home pay of $1000, the volunteers putting in time and effort, and the staff on half pay because he or she is there for the cause--that's where the charity resides. But the organisation--it cannot run on charity alone precisely if it wants to be the best steward for the charitable contributions of its supporters.<br><br>It is undeniable that Dr. V has deep compassion for the poor and needy--remember that 60% of the patients do not pay--that the very foundation of Aravind is inspired by his desire to do his bit to help the lot of fellow men. But what he runs is not a "charity organisation" of the kind that we might be familiar with, i.e., one that asks for and is sustained by our charity. And because it does not do that, the issues that plague us about how "charity organisations" ought to be run simply do not arise for Aravind.<br><br>Perhaps what we need to rethink is not how "charity organisations" should be run, but the more basic question of how the poor and needy could be helped. And it is not obvious that they are always best served by the charity of donors, that is, it is not obvious that that they could not be even better served by other means.<br><br>Something to think about for the aspiring social-entrepreneur.<br><br>Some more background on Aravind: Aravind started in 1976 with a 11-bed private clinic (in Dr. V's brother's house, no less). The mission: to eradicate all needless blindness in Tamil Nadu, if not in the entire nation of India. Today, the System consists of five hospitals, manufacturing centers for lenses, sutures and eye care related pharmaceuticals, training institute, international eye bank, a woman and child care center, a postgraduate institute of ophthalmology (awarding MS and fellowships, and a center for community outreach programs. The 1,500 bed hospital at Madurai alone performs some 95,000 eye surgeries every year. The five hospitals (Madurai, Tirunelveli, Coimbatore, Theni and Pondicherry) together perform 190,000 surgeries every year, 45% of all eye surgeries in the state of Tamil Nadu, 5% in the whole of India (Prahalad, 265-266).<br></div>

(Prahalad, 37; emphasis mine)<br><br>In other words, process innovation drives the costs way down, thus enabling very low prices, thus allowing Aravind to serve "Bottom of the Pyramid" customers--the poor and needy.<br><br>A thought (slightly revised July 16, 1100 -0400)<br><br>I do wonder if in the NKF uproar and the subsequent soul searching over how charity organisations should conduct themselves, an alternative has been overlooked.<br><br>"Charity organisation"--of the scale of an NKF anyway--did not, does not, could not survive on charity alone. It has to be thoroughly professional and business-like in efficiency--in translating the charity of the donors, on the one hand, into actual relief for the patients under its care, on the other hand. And there is no better way to guarantee this professionalism than by paying good money for the best brains that money can buy--and I am not talking about unnecessary toilet fixtures or shenanigans with the travel perk (after all, it is possible to overpay a CEO even in the profit making world).<br><br>There is thus an important sense in which the "charity organisation" is a misnomer: the small time donors putting in his $10 from a take home pay of $1000, the volunteers putting in time and effort, and the staff on half pay because he or she is there for the cause--that's where the charity resides. But the organisation--it cannot run on charity alone precisely if it wants to be the best steward for the charitable contributions of its supporters.<br><br>It is undeniable that Dr. V has deep compassion for the poor and needy--remember that 60% of the patients do not pay--that the very foundation of Aravind is inspired by his desire to do his bit to help the lot of fellow men. But what he runs is not a "charity organisation" of the kind that we might be familiar with, i.e., one that asks for and is sustained by our charity. And because it does not do that, the issues that plague us about how "charity organisations" ought to be run simply do not arise for Aravind.<br><br>Perhaps what we need to rethink is not how "charity organisations" should be run, but the more basic question of how the poor and needy could be helped. And it is not obvious that they are always best served by the charity of donors, that is, it is not obvious that that they could not be even better served by other means.<br><br>Something to think about for the aspiring social-entrepreneur.<br><br>Some more background on Aravind: Aravind started in 1976 with a 11-bed private clinic (in Dr. V's brother's house, no less). The mission: to eradicate all needless blindness in Tamil Nadu, if not in the entire nation of India. Today, the System consists of five hospitals, manufacturing centers for lenses, sutures and eye care related pharmaceuticals, training institute, international eye bank, a woman and child care center, a postgraduate institute of ophthalmology (awarding MS and fellowships, and a center for community outreach programs. The 1,500 bed hospital at Madurai alone performs some 95,000 eye surgeries every year. The five hospitals (Madurai, Tirunelveli, Coimbatore, Theni and Pondicherry) together perform 190,000 surgeries every year, 45% of all eye surgeries in the state of Tamil Nadu, 5% in the whole of India (Prahalad, 265-266).<br></div></blockquote>This real-life success story will not be believed by our leaders. Their emphasis to this day, is their own abilities.<br><br>Their own beliefs consist of meritocracy, leaderships and tax-and-recover pragmaticism. They will never go the reverse - 60% non-paying patients, process improvements through lowering costs. As we have seen ministry after ministry they will rather keep increasing costs rather be more competitive. They were on record emphasising that Singapore cannot depend on efficiency to become competitive, meaning the success will depend on their leaderships.<br><br>Their success model typically would be equated to success of meritocracy of leadership abilities and payments to the leaders of the highest salaries undreamt of in any developed country.<br><br>Unfortunately, while the above-stated self-promoted leadership approach might not be wrong in theory, in practice it has not been well proven in Singapore since the 1970s that their leaderships have worked as costs go to the roof to pay for all the high salaries without achieving the value-adding jobs or a technologically advanced economy.<br><br>Despite the obvious lack of progress in leading by talents and leaderships and neglecting the process management excellence like Aravind, they are not admitting their shortcomings or failures.<br><br>If someone has a good management system locally the leaders will not be too interested to try using it. They will want themselves to be successful based on their own concepts of talents, leaderships and their own proven forumula. To them putting another scholar somewhere to be in charge of a eye or cancer institute is much safer bet than to promote internal progressive improvements the way Aravind has done. Non-leaders and non-talents in Singapore will have to fend for themselves and it will be only when they have done it that the leaders will turn and have a look at lower-rung process solutions.</div>
