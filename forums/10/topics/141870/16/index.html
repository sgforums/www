Do they try to be creative or think out of the box in the way they are trying to stop our citizens from patronizing JB petrol kiosks or provision shops.<br><br>What is wrong in the first place with citizens buying cheaper stuff or services from JB. To me if the citizens can save monies, only certain businesses may be affected may be a few companies like our petrol kiosks but these are compensated by our citizens's savings thereby increasing their spending powers to pay for other services to support local businesses. The leaders must not just help the petrol companies or provision shops but think out of the box about our citizens greater spending powers which will increase the purchases of our own products and services from such greater spending powers. JB residents will in turn come over with their greater earnings to spend in Singapore.<br><br>It is common sense citizens will increase their spending power by chartering buses for kidney patients to seek cheaper treatments in JB. To begin with, let us license one tour operator to specialize in this. The tour operator can ply certain routes to pick such patients on schedule without hassle and should be able to turn it into a business. At the least, patients can have the alternative of fixing certain common pick-up point in the central or south to start such service.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To further save the overhead cost of running NKF, donors should petiton to tell NKF to sell its hotel like NKF headquarter or rent it out to get some income, in fact NKF administrative units should move to a more humble location to reflect its image of a charitable organisation.<br><br>To outsource its kidney dialysis operation to JB is something which our government could not swallow as our dignity is at risk and they will tell you that it is not feasible! Singapore is trying very hard to build a reputation of a medical centre in the far east as they have even gone to the extent of taking the risk of trying to separate two adult conjoint twin in the past, how could they allow such simple dialysis operation to relocate to JB?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The previous Health Minister said there was nothing he could do to lower medical costs because of %$#@*.<br><br>He even formed a parliamentary committee to challenge opposition MPs to prove him wrong.<br><br>Why was the medical costs subsequently reduced by taking out all the unessentials which the previous minister simply failed to do. So he had covered the high-cost or creative accounting after all and not because medical costs must be high or there was nothing he could do.<br><br>Because of NKF - denials and not telling the truth and not being open and accountable. The high costs of HDB flats and bus fares charged by the bus companies apparently are similar examples of problems not solved but covered up with excuses about rising wages and what-nots.<br><br>Why are our  leaders doing all these times with such denials and do-nothing ministers covering up problems?</div>
