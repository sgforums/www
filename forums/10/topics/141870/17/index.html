            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from CNA.<br><br>SINGAPORE : The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) has recently opened its accounts for all to see.<br><br>On Thursday, it revealed that its reserves will only last about six years.<br><br>It is doing this in the hope of mending public confidence.<br><br>41-year-old renal nurse Xu Chun has never been ashamed of donning her NKF uniform.<br><br>But since the NKF saga broke out in July, she has been mindful not to put on her NKF name tag in public places.<br><br>Xu Chun is not alone in suffering the backlash of public anger over the mismanagement of NKF's former CEO.<br><br>"My colleague wanted to rent a room but once the owner knew she was from NKF, she said no. And some of my other colleagues say some people threw eggs at the centre's doors," said Xu, who is the Acting Charge Nurse of New Creation Church-NKF Dialysis Centre.<br><br>But there are others out there who are still supportive of the charity.<br><br>"Early last month, an uncle walked in and wanted to donate $200. I was surprised and asked him why. He just said patients still need our support. I was really moved," said Nurse Xu.<br><br>In support of NKF, one of its past donors - the Thong Teck Sian Tong Lian Sin Sia Temple in Woodlands - has donated $100,000 to help kidney patients switch to peritoneal dialysis.<br><br>For past NKF donors like the New Creation Church, which gave $2.6million to build this dialysis centre four years ago, kidney patients' welfare is its main concern.<br><br>"As long as money raised is for the benefit of the patients, we'll still go ahead. This is regardless of how much they have in reserves as long as the reserves are accounted for and the money goes to the patient," said Deacon Matthew Kang of New Creation Church.<br><br>And this is the kind of attitude NKF hopes the public would adopt - to help it deliver its main mission of caring for kidney patients.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Seven years of reserve was clearly not measured in terms of patients' needs for treatments.<br><br>It is very clear that NKF has conceived some kind of grand plan to expand its network to cover some other areas outside its purview of kidney treatments. Why ? Is it not the MOH role to do so? People pay taxes and should expect a certain amount of assistance in getting treatments for illness.<br><br>NKF should not try to take over the role of providing full range of medical care of people from the government. It is for the government to relent on its harsh policy of the past to push medical care back to the people under the name of avoiding welfarism. It can easily set up an endowment fund and use the interests to sustain certain part of kidney treatments. It should not try to pass the buck back to the people. It should not try to use NKF or people's monies to keep building up reserves which at the end might not be put to patient use. Apparently NKF has been used to some extent to cover its own lack or shortcomings in such areas.<br><br>The grand plan to build more medical facilities is one but who is to safeguard the monies that it will not be misused to build more grandios buildings and more of the 7 wonders, plus a privately used fleet of Mercedes.<br><br>Cut out the hidden agenda to make NKF a medical institution to substitute the government's own lack of care for the medical needs of people, NKF can do much better. Just concentrate on reducing patient costs to serve the patients there will be no need for increasing the 7 years' reserv</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum<br><br>Be more realistic in assessing NKF reserves<br><br>UPON reading the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) report by interim chairman Gerard Ee, it appears that the sums do not add up.<br><br>It was stated that the present reserves of $206 million would last only 4.5 years in the worst-case scenario. There seems to be some calculation error.<br><br>The sum of $206 million, deposited in a bank account earning annual interest of 3.8 per cent, would garner $7,828,000. This plus the government subsidy of $4 million would give NKF an annual income of $11,828,000, without contributions from donations.<br><br>Presently NKF has 1,800 dialysis patients that it subsidises on average $70 per treatment. That subsidy would amount to $19,656,000 a year as each patient undergoes three sessions per week. That would leave a shortfall of $7,828,000 per year that has to come from NKF reserves. Dividing the reserves of $206 million by the shortfall of $7.8 million, it would take about 26 years for the reserves to run out.<br><br>It appears that the counsel for The Straits Times in its defence of the lawsuit filed by NKF was nearer to the truth when he said that the reserves would last 30 years.<br><br>The new NKF management has an obligation to present to the public, and especially to renal patients, a more realistic assessment of the situation. By singing the same T.T. Durai worst-case-scenario song with a new choir, it is unlikely to gain public confidence.<br><br>Although donations have dropped significantly from more than $2 million to $1.7 million a month, it is still a sizeable amount.<br><br>The $20.4 million in annual donations is more than enough to cover the $19,656,000 needed as subsidies for dialysis treatment for 1,800 patients without touching the reserves of $206 million, whose interest could cover inflation or expansion programmes.<br><br>I am a renal patient and have received dialysis treatment in Canada, China and Singapore.<br><br>In Canada, dialysis treatment is free for residents and citizens. The dialysis centres are remarkably clean, very spacious and well equipped. The medical staff are well trained and extremely friendly. Hot tea, coffee or water and biscuits are served to patients every hour, free of charge. All questions are answered in great detail and with patience.<br><br>In Guangzhou, China, the cost of dialysis for foreigners is a flat full fee of 400 yuan (S$83) per treatment. The Chinese dialysis centres are huge and surprisingly clean. They are well equipped with up-to-date imported dialysis machines, the same as those used in Singapore, if not better. Most of their medical staff are friendly and helpful.<br><br>In Singapore, the cost of dialysis for citizens at private centres ranges from $100 to $150 after subsidy. The centres are clean but patients have to provide their own blankets.<br><br>The medical staff are busy and have seemingly tight schedules and little time for explanations. Questions are often frowned upon and answers given are short and ambiguous. The typical answer is that, in Singapore, things are done differently. One cannot help but wonder why things are done differently when the dialysis machines and protocols are similar.<br><br>I have one simple request. Tell us how long the NKF reserves will last if a realistic and practical approach is adopted in managing it.<br><br>As renal patients, we accept the fact that our lives are shorter. Our lives need not be shortened further by unrealistic scenarios that would never happen. Please do away with the ambiguous language and ridiculous worst-case scenarios if public confidence is to be restored.<br><br>Cheong Wing Lee<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>Does NKF need huge reserves if it invests wisely?<br><br>I READ with great interest the report on the National Kidney Foundation's (NKF) reserves. I applaud interim chairman Gerard Ee and his board for the hard work and civic-mindedness in volunteering to help sort out the NKF tangle.<br><br>Indeed the mere fact that the annual operating costs have been reduced from $73 million to $52 million without compromising the quality of care is a testimony to the efforts of the new board.<br><br>But I am puzzled about the reinvention of the wheel - creating huge reserves much like what the previous NKF administration claimed was a necessity for survival.<br><br>With a current client base of 1,800 patients and an operating cost of $52 million, this works out to $28,889 per patient per year for treatment with NKF. How much of this is direct patient-care cost and how much is pure infrastructure cost? With an increase of 300 patients every year, the added burden could be $8.7 million a year!<br><br>Secondly, given the fact that NKF has reserves of $206.2 million in usable funds, if they are invested wisely with a low expectation of 3 per cent returns and if only 70 per cent of the funds are invested ($144 million), this will give returns of $4.3 million.<br><br>This will significantly reduce the funding needs. Is this factored into the computation?<br><br>Perhaps, NKF should convert all its current investable reserves into an endowment and get a good fund manager to manage the money such that it gives good and steady long-term returns.<br><br>Thirdly, I think it is unwise to argue that to prepare for any adverse situation in the matter of donations, NKF should have 10 years' reserves. How many charities in Singapore can afford to have this kind of luxury?<br><br>Just imagine every charity in Singapore adopting the same mindset as NKF, then we will be a nation of hoarders rather than good stewards.
