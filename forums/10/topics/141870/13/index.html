If there is criminal breach of trust, the matter could be very serious - it could involve issues such as misappropriation of assets by the organisation and skimming of cash, donations collected and not recorded - this is of course highly speculative, but the moment you call in the CAD, the issue is quite serious."<br><br>The NKF said the matters had been referred to the authorities, and so it was not at liberty to discuss them now.<br><br>In July, the revelations stemming from the high-profile defamation suit by NKF against Singapore Press Holdings led to the resignations of its former CEO Mr T T Durai and the entire NKF board.<br><br>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan then reiterated the Government would not hesitate to take action if investigations showed up any wrongdoing.<br><br>He said: "Certainly if there has been fault, or acts which are wrong, we have to act. You know my position on these sort of these I don't condone such practices."<br><br>The CAD's presence at NKF shows that action has indeed been taken.<br><br>Investigations are expected to take some time before the public will know the exact nature of the "grave concerns". - CNA /ch<br><br><img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b249/ahpek/emoticon/36_2_29.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Some Singaporeans were surprised by news that the National Kidney Foundation had requested the assistance of the Commercial Affairs Department to investigate "certain matters of grave concern" - while others said it was all a matter of time.<br><br>But the CAD's probe has got many talking about the NKF once again.<br><br>Singaporeans are wondering what CAD officers could be looking into at the NKF.<br><br>While many hope the investigations will bring about greater transparency at such a big charity organisation, others say donations may once again be affected.<br><br>One person commented on it affecting public confidence, "...I mean you're supposed to be a charity organisation but yet you have investigators coming in to check you; that's of serious concern."<br><br>Another however noted, "It does not mean that CAD goes in and it's immediately a major problem. It's just to rectify and to make sure that the implementation and policies are adhered to."<br><br>A third said, "It's a question of the public being surprised once and now it's a second time. So it's something that's really unexpected."<br><br>"Let's be very fair. With the new management on, we should give them the benefit of the doubt. In fact, I've reinstated my donations," noted one person.<br><br>"With this, I guess donors will stop donating. I just feel very sorry for the people, the patients at NKF, they're going to suffer the most. We'll see how it goes," said another.<br><br>But one charity hopes the CAD's involvement will not affect donations to welfare organisations.<br><br>Lee Kim Siang, Chairman, Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society, said, "It's an optimistic kind of thing, it's a positive thing. We should not look at it from a negative or pessimistic point.<br><br>"It isn't that way. After all charities have to go on. It has to go on. Out there a lot of people require help. We must continue to help but we do it better.<br><br>"How can it be wrong when we're discovering things that ought to have been discovered. When we're looking at things that were already there. And we're now trying to find out the extent of these things and then put it back. And put it back means the future will be better. Everybody will be more confident, everybody will know what should be done, what shouldn't be done. And the whole charity scene will be that much better."<br><br>The Society has been in existence for some 26 years - offering more than 50 charity programmes and services, including running the Ang Mo Kio Hospital. - CNA/ms<br><br><img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b249/ahpek/emoticon/36_2_30.gif"><br><strong>JAIL!
