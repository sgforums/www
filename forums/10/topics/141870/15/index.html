Wrongs will always be wrongs and cannot be covered up or closeted as skeleton in the proverbial cupboard. They will not be solved by themselves and will breed bigger problems. They may be more NKF like universities ordering chairs worth $2,200 and work sites with short-piling and highway with under-estimated subsidence due to liberalities in overseeing of contractors. Look at one work site accident after another they all share one common characteristic - lack of process management to ensure consistent follow-through implementations of safety measures reported in previous inquiries like the Hotel New World collapse. We have so many scholars employed in public service but none can solve these implementation problems and prevent more negligence and building or highway collapses.<br><br>In companies they will lead to malpractices and losses. In government problems not solved will create discontents and dissatisfactions which will surface into NFK denials which one day will have to explode into public outcry and even overthrow of system.<br><br>Our government has claimed excellence and world-class standards. Let them prove to citizens with real actions to solve simple problems before making any further claims of such excellence.</div>
