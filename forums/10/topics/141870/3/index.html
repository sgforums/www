            <div class='col-md body'>How could they do such a thing??<br><br>i'm not so concern about the people doing dangerous stunts and stuffs. I very much more concern about the sick patients who made their efforts to go there to view the performances and even get to tell their personal stories to the public.<br><br>The sad part is that when majority of the money donated doesn't go to them, this actually creates a whole big joke out of this event... even more so, the sickly and the needy.<br><br>They need our help most. When we give, we must give with a good intention, not just to think of the rewards that we might eventually receive in return. The best form of giving is give without any expectations, and then when the reward comes, it will be even more worth it.<br><br>This is obviously making a fool out of these sickly and needy personels by parading them and told to narate their stories such that the money can go directly into the big boss's filthy pockets.<br><br>I'm not discouraging people to donate, in fact, I actually encourage people to donate to help the needy. But rather, donate wisely. If anyone approaches u on the streets to help donate to any needy foundations to help those sickly and needy people, ASK first. ASK where the money goes, and find out carefully in DETAIL of how exactly they handle such a thing.<br><br>Wisdom is the key this time to defend against selfishness.</div>

It is a plain truth now that even without your donations, the funds in NKF can go for 30 over years!

            <div class='col-md body'>BOYCOTT NKF .until we receive a satisfactory reply both in words and actions ie overhaul its top management including the CEO and Board of Directors(since they are in cahoots), greater transparency, etc.<br><br>I urge all NOT to donate to tomorrow's NKF Cancer Show and to make it a farce for all to see. If you really care for cancer patients, you should donate to Singapore Cancer Foundation. SCS has already made clear they are NOT related to NKF Cancer Fund in the Straits Times Forum about 2 weeks ago.<br><br>Anyway, for others who care for the kidney patients, the intention is not to boycott donation and deprive them forever. Rather, it's to force change within the organisation. Anyway, as with the evidence on its reserves, NKF patients will not be affected with just one year of boycott anyway.</div>
