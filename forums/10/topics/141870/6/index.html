A charity organisation that has been getting its funding from the public. But we must admit he is a capable man, successfully establishing NKF as one of the most known and trusted charity organisation.<br><br>There doesn't seem to be a problem if he has used his entitlement for business class to travel on first class. Afterall, he is not a volunteer. He is an employee who has been hired so as to lead the organisation forward.<br><br>What is the justifiable amount of bonus that one should get in a charity like NKF? Shouldn't this be benchmarked to some where? A 12 month bonus is grossly exorbitant, especially when the message thrown across was that -though there is a huge reserve, it will dry out some day. Shouldn't any extra income collected in the annum be put into the reserve or spent for the benefit of the patients?<br><br>The bottomline is that who is keeping all these tabs on these charities? Why were they allowed to have such an operating budget where they can afford to have expensive taps and all. Shouldn't the funds mainly go to the welfare of the patients? Extra funds other than put in the reserves should go to purchasing more dialysis machines or higher subsidies for the patients. Is there a necessity to establish NKF as a world class professional body? Is this the vision of NKF?<br><br>Can we stop the donations because we are furious with the management of funds? The stopping of funding does not mean that the reserves will be used FOR the patients. This shortage of funding may just turn to be a reason for increasing the payment by the patients themselves!<br><br>These are just my thoughts. The accountability of charity organisations has really become questionable.</div></blockquote>It's 600k a year works out to be 50k a month<br><br></div>

If not, leave him alone. He wasn't the one who shot that stupid comment. He has done enough good for Singapore for one to believe in his integrity and wisdom.<br><br>If your wife insists on being the shrew she is despite her 'education' are you sure you can keep her in control?<br><br>And about GCT's boss. Is it news that there are evidently 2 factions in the PAP? The quiet seat warmers who goes about working steadfastly and the other camp who is the power house? GCT is a great and patriotic man who has stood firm in office despite the seat warmer joke and pulled singapore through the troubles in the past few years.<br><br>So be grateful and criticize only the guilty. As for the other ladies, whether they have been invited or have decided to turn down the offers to be patrons, that's their business and prerogative.</div>
