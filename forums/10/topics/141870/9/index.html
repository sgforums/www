            <div class='col-md body'>Anybody wondered how Durai could have drawn such a big salary and at the same time get a 12-month bonus?<br><br>The bigger issue here is since NKF is a charity organisation, it should be under some government body right? Could Durai's bouns be the same as the other high-level civil servants? Meaning, Durai's bonus scheme could be consistent with some guidelines from the civil service right?<br><br>Think about it, the entire S'pore's high-level civil servants' bonus could have also been 12 months! If so, then Durai would not be the only guilty party right?<br><br>I'm not 100% sure about this... could anyone confirm this?<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The issue is: Whom did Durai consult with before he sued the two parties who alleged potential abuses like Durai's first-class travels..<br><br>Did Durai consult his members of the board or get the patron's or government blessing in doing so.<br><br>If he did get the government's blessing behind his earlier defamation actions against the two whistle blowers, the government should now be morally upright to own up and advise NKF new board to make relevant amends or apologies to these two whistle blowers who had sacrificed for the public good.<br><br>The minimum is to publish an apology if NKF has admitted the first-class travels or the golden taps. After all the new NKF should want to start afresh like what the PM has promised. If indeed so, then it should come clean and start with a correct image in order to show its willingness to admit mistakes and be transparent in future.<br><br>After all the whole episode has clearly established one fact that Durai has indeed travelled first class and spent extravagantly the public donation monies for his own purpose.<br><br>I am sure Khaw Boon Wan wants the new NKF board to be clean and upright. If so then the new board should correct the past rash or wrongful acts by admitting those abuses which were not admitted in the earlier lawsuits until Davinder spilled the facts wide open. The new NKF should see fit and proper to do the right thing.<br><br>May be Gerald Eee will do so to win back trust and confidence to NKF again for NKF as well as for the government officers who had been informed and given blessing to those two earlier suits. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The funny thing is that if T.T Durai didn't sue SPH and its senior writer Ms Susan Long, these rotten beans wouldn't be spilled... and people would still be happily donating to NKF on Thursday's show. and the two persons who were earlier sued by T.T Durai under similar circumstances would still be misjudged...and Singaporeans will still live in ignorance and bliss.... and T.T Durai will continue to get his 12 months bonus and who knows... more taps in gold-platings...

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes indeed the key issue is about transparency in NKF and even the government.<br><br>Here is one post to Feedback Unit to ask ministers to be candid and objective in anwering queries in parliaments:-<br><br>A Reply to Forumer who produced a minister's reply on NKF reserve in 2004:-<br><br>QUOTE: "If this is the kind of ministerial reply to people's queries, Singapore's standard of corporate governance will continue to be low and self-centred.<br><br>PM Lee said in the press conference in USA that something has gone wrong with the NKF Board in not providing the necesssary checks and balances on the CEO.<br><br>It is now clear from the ministerial reply to query in this instance that IT is full of inaccuracy and lacking transparency in giving vital information to parliament with regard to patient subsidy (lately found to be only S$300 per month not S$3,000 as reported) and how long the reserve will last to carry on treating the 2000 patients.<br><br>I remember the same inaccuracy was given to parliament about transportation costs and HDB flat subsidy. If PM Lee must know the reason why checks and balances did not work in NKF case, I think the reason is clearly established in the above-stated ministerial reply to parliament. There is clearly a lot of justification, generalization and assumptions which at the end covers up the whole lots of problems.<br><br>PM Lee can instruct the ministers to be candid instead of making all kinds of general assumptions that mull over problems. He can instruct the ministers in being more objective and candid so that NKF and GLCs will not learn to copy them.<br><br>If the top do not set the tone on corporate governance there can be no improvements or remaking of Singapore to talk about.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan spoke on the NKF saga said: "People should not over-react or pre-judge on what has happened"<br><br>Mr. Durai and the whole board have resigned because of expose in the SPH/NKF defamation suit about excessive salaries, 12-month bonuses, first-class air travel and golden taps in Durai's private closets.<br><br>Are these expose not factual? Why there was this continual cover=up for 13 years and finally when facts are out the ministers are still trying to stonewall the issue calling it "overeacting or pre-judging the issue".<br><br>Are the people over-reacting or pre-judging issues arising out of facts disclosed finally in this court case?<br><br>I remember I attended the annual Feedback Unit's annual conference at Suntec in 2002 and stood up to ask Dr. Vivian the first question from the floor at the conference:  "The high cost of living and doing business in Singapore is the number-one issue affecting the nation, what will your Remaking Singapore committee do to help solve this problem.?"<br><br>Dr. Vivian's reply (as far as I could remember): Cost has two components the fixed cost and variable cost. Over the variable cost there are portion over which the government has no control. He understood people's concern and would be looking into this problem.<br><br>Today, after all the Remaking of Singapore, has Dr. Vivian solved the high cost problem. All we know and experience after all the remaking by his committee is that there will be more transport fare and other fee increases.<br><br>If PM wants to build an inclusive society, he has to make all the committees effective and not as a means to justify existing shortcomings and finally ending in covering up the problem as has happened to the handling of high costs.<br><br>The NKF case is just a tip of the iceberg. People are not over-reacting or pre-judging so it is Dr. Vivian who should adopt a more candid approach and not resort to the same cost-cost gerrymandeering way to avoid solutions in the whole remaking exercise while trying to cover-up (not brought up for solution) real problems and issues again !!! P<br><br>eople waited long enough to get an answer why the NKF was not revealing information and be more transparent and it was finally spilled out in a court case.<br><br>It is the government's lack of transparency at the ministers' level that is the root of the problem !!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why did they approve Durai's "12 MONTHS" bonus indeed ?<br><br>The other question that has been missed is that :<br><br><strong>HOW MUCH HAS THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS BEEN PAID ?</strong><br><br>If they approved Durai's "12 MONTHS" bonus, how many months have they approved to be paid for themselves, AND also the Executive and Non-Executive staff of NKF - (who will certainly deserve their bonuses more than Durai) ?<br><br>Supposedly, one should think on the "safe side" that the Patron's position is "HONORARY" and that the position does not enjoy remunerations of any kind.<br><br>Was the Board of Directors "handpicked" by Durai - which will probably explain for the ease in getting approval for the "12 MONTHS"  ?<br><br>With a Patron from the Establishment, it will seem that Durai has borrowed a page from the National Stage, having justified and hidding behind the fact that his "12 MONTHS" was approved by the Board.<br><br>Does this not look familiar ? We have a Parliament with a majority controlled by a Ruling Party for more then 40 years, and with "hand-picked" elected Members, who also approved the <strong>$1Million PER YEAR salary to the Ministers </strong>?<br><br>No wonder the Patron responded that it was "PEANUTS" for the <strong>$1.8MILLION </strong>that was paid to Durai <strong>over a period of THREE Years</strong>, when her husband was paid <strong>$1MILLION PER YEAR </strong>!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I never bothered to read the lengthy article that made for a juicy front page in The Sunday Times, about NKF and the now very "popular" Mr T T Durai.<br><br>Personally, through the decades I have never donated a single cent to NKF simply because I find the organization, appear a little too posh. And I never paid any heed to those nicely printed little self mailing envelopes that find their way into my mail box. I always looked at it and remarked how well rpinted these flyer-mailers were. I mean, just look at the little flyers that The Salvation Army produce - single piece of thin paper, with cheaply printed text. No glossy colour presentations of some poor old chap's face and a sob story included.<br><br>So now, indeed, my doubts about NKF have finally and truly materialized, and not surprisingly, reveals a fat black worm.<br><br>Our government should take a magnifying glass, and go around to scrutinize each and every charitable organization, including City Harvest, to see if there are more fat worms wriggling in bliss behind fancy charitable establishmemts.<br><br>We make measely monthly wages, rock in our boats under these stormy economic times, and have to tale care of aging parents under prevailing medical costs. Worms like these who make obsene monthly wages should be culled from our society, and charitable organizations must be made to be TOTALLY TRANSPARENT with their fund collecting activity as well as accounting books. This should be made regulatory. A Standing Order of sorts.<br><br>Remarks like "25k is peanuts for an organization with xxxxx amounts in reserves", smacks of ignorance. Ignorant of people in Singapore whose paycheck may be just S$1000 per month and who yet donates perhaps $50 to NKF. These people with low income who yet donates, are truly the rich ones. Not in the pocket, but in their hearts. So therefore I say, these people in the upper management of Singapore, may not be short in IQ, but sure are aneamic in EQ. How do we loose our local talents, it is also through the lack of EQ.<br><br>So as usual, shit has again hit the fan, now it's clean up time. Start wiping off the specks of crap all over the place.<br><br></div>
