The law here only bully the weak.  Asking others not to donate is not wrong on high bonus reasons is not wrong.  If ask, i will say so and why.  Is that wrong?    its not even defamatory or criminal.<br><br>like the massive floods of covered warrants which cannibliise the main shrs and normal warrants in order for sgx to make more money.   Cover warrant add no value to companies except harmful to speculators and good for issuer.<br><br>The MAS makes so, Speculating in cover warrants is not harmful but speculating shrs is.  There are strict regulation and chargeable for manupulating and speculating in shrs but not cover warrants,   Why , Big banks and private groups are the issuers.   these cover warrants only have life span of 6 mnths and bring weathly gains for issuers.<br><br>The NKF maybe doing good for patients but has bad governance and made bad use of their patrons and pitiness of patients to cover its bad tracks, it even manage to convince the civil court here on the first class law suits.<br><br>Somehow i get the feeling justice here are always in favour of big and powerful organisation, one example is the price that goverment pay to acquire properties for development, buy dirt cheap and sell damn high.</div>
