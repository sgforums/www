            <div class='col-md body'>It may be just a wayang kulit done for show for CPIB or CAD to investigate Durai's wrongs disclosed so far.<br><br>If white elephant placards and T-shirts cannot be tolerated, what will be the problem with charging him? He would have been charged sometime ago.<br><br>From the daily news, ministers seem to be giving inkling and dropping hints that Durai might not have committed any legal wrongs despite all his excesses with golden taps, 8 months' bonuses from the charity monies, his concealments about traveling first class with charity donation monies until his own forced admissions in the NKF/SPH lawsuit..<br><br>Even if he had done some wrongs in his preemptive defamation suits against the 2 volunteers, or condoned or approved business dealings with some directors or ex-directors of NKF, yet Durai might claim he had not done any legal wrong. Ministers did not try to push for his prosecutions but did say certain things in his favor.<br><br>Another reason why CPIB might not charge him with criminal offences: If he is charged for criminal offences it may send an unfaorable signal to the population that government itself like NKF was practising what Durai as seen to be doing.<br><br>Government itself was feet-dragging when it comes to has responding  to citizens' complaints against complaints about lack of accountability and transparency, in HDB flat pricing, resale levies, double-charging or double-taxing on lands and services, over-extending its own high reserves, over-paying themselves million-dollar salaries and unheard of 8 months' bonuses etc.<br><br>Will those who are in charge not shiver if Durai decided in court to contest the charges on the ground that patron Mrs. Goh has approved his salaries or even the bonuses.<br><br>Where will the GIC or Temasek stand if GIC and Temasek are singled out as companies that practise what NKF has been practising suing people for criticism or non-disclosed 1st class travelling and extravagant spendings of public monies and interests in contracts or non-compliance with regulations.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(As posted to Feedback Unit <a href="http://www.feedback.gov.sg" rel="nofollow">www.feedback.gov.sg</a> on 31.1.2006)<br><br>The strong public reactions of the disclosures of wrong doings made by the Management Audit clearly show there were serious underlying problems with the way the old NKF was being run.<br><br>Whether the wrong doings disclosed by the audit or CPIB constitute legal offences or not the wrong doings so far disclosed were of extremely serious nature and unacceptable and its root cause will have to be totally eliminated.<br><br>If new laws governing charity disclosures have to be passed, they should be passed so that there will be no more wrong doings again and again in the future.<br><br>Incidentally, Yellowish's views as posted here give rise to great concern for if he is a staff or workign for NKF, his views show that there are still people who do not regard the wrongs but something which can be explained away.<br><br>Is this the kind of solution we want in spending so much time and efforts on the part of the government and the spending of public funds in doing the management audit aimed at addressing the public concern of wrong doings by those running the charity.<br><br>If yellowish has his way, I am sure the new NKF will be the same as the old NKF, without accountability and transparency, likely to use fallacious and false information regarding reserve or engaging in questionable purchases or first class air travels.<br><br>Surely the new NKF ought to declare their intention that they are clean and honorable and will not try to use the charity fund for improper purposes or repeat the same problems.<br><br>NKF has been a hard fought public battle. The public has expressed itself unequivocally that it wants its donation monies to be applied vigorously for saving the lives of patients. Should any one wants to use those monies for other than such purpose such as to hoard a 10-30 year reserve to lessen the political fallout over high costs of medicare let him explain to the public to gain public support for such political cautionary diversion.<br><br>It is hoped that the NKF team team will not again try like the old NKF has done to explain away public concern expressed and deny them of proper use of donation monies to save patients' lives. It would certainly be repetition of past denials if Yellowish way of thinking is also the current thinking of the minister Khaw, Gerald Ee or the new NKF team.<br><br>There should be proper open and accountable solving of the NKF problems not some quiet investigation left to the discretion of CPIB ending with finally covering of the problems on some doubtful legality issues which were not even debated by independent panel.<br><br>....................................................</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So in 2003, the subsidy for kidney patients was only 10.5cents out of every $1! From sammyboy forum:<br><br>PeasantMoNkEy (PMonkey10)  	1-Mar 20:59<br>Steve Chia's Parliamentary Speech BEFORE the NKF Scandal Broke:<br><br>Extract of NCMP Steve Chia's Speech in Parliament in July 05 on the NKF debate:<br><br>Sir, it is this betrayal of trust of the public. The public had trusted the NKF management to be honourable in their dealings.  They had implicit trust that the money they had donated was being put to good use, by subsidising and helping the kidney patients.  Singaporeans, young and old, healthy and sick, are constantly encouraged, urged and, to some extent, pestered to donate their limited hard-earned money to the NKF to help the needy kidney patients, and they have done so, not knowing how the donated money is to be spent.<br><br>Some members of the public had worked out the NKF figures and emailed me.  In the 2003 NKF Report, NKF had spent $31.6 million on dialysis and transplantations but collected back $24.4 million from its patients, thus spending only $7.2 million on subsidising the patients.  Yet, it collected $68.2 million in donations with a fund raising expense of $16.6 million.  Sir, this worked out to a cost of 24.3 cents per $1 raised, which is within the charity fund raising law.<br><br>However, if you include the public relations, education, administration and salary expenses, we realise that the non-clinical-related expenses are actually $37.5 million.  This is 55% of the donations received and that means, for every $1 that the NKF raised or received, 24.3 cents go to the fund raising exercise, 30.6 cents go to the public relations, education, administration and salaries, 34.6 cents go to the NKF reserves, and I repeat, only 10.5 cents go directly to subsidise the patients.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>NKF hires law firm as it considers action against former board</strong><br><br>Legal team looking into contracts with Forte, Protonweb<br><br>By Michelle Quah<br>April 11, 2006<br>The Business Times<br><br>(SINGAPORE) The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) has hired one of Singapore's top law firms, Allen &amp; Gledhill (A&amp;G), to look into possible legal recourse against the charity's former board of directors, sources have told The Business Times.<br><br>BT understands that a team from A&amp;G - led by Senior Counsel K Shanmugam, head of litigation and dispute resolution - has begun work into whether the NKF's new board has grounds for action against the former directors.<br><br>A BT source said: 'If you remember, what (accountancy firm) KPMG found in their special investigation of NKF last year were basically management lapses and a lack of transparency, rather than specific crimes. That makes criminal action against the NKF's former employees difficult. So the new board is looking at civil action first.'<br><br>Attempts to reach Mr Shanmugam yesterday were unsuccessful.<br><br>BT understands the A&amp;G team is looking at the two contracts entered into by the old board with Forte Systems and Protonweb Solutions several years ago. The two deals involved NKF payments to the companies even though they were said to have failed to deliver some services.<br><br>The Protonweb deal, worth $4.5 million, saw payments being made by the NKF to Protonweb even though the call centre's services were delayed and there was a shortfall in the number of hours delivered. In the case of the Forte contract, which cost the NKF $3.3 million, the software was not delivered on time and Forte was said to have failed to meet the contract specifications.<br><br>Both companies were owned by Pharis Aboobacker, said to have been a friend of the then NKF CEO, TT Durai. The former board was made up of members such as the then chairman Richard Yong and board member Matilda Chua. Mr Durai was not a board member.<br><br>The NKF's new board, led by chairman Gerard Ee, said at the time the KPMG report was released that it was considering action against the charity's former executive committee members in relation to these contracts. 'The terms of these contracts were unusual, and the attitudes of the exco members to the poor performance of these contracts were extraordinary,' the NKF's new board said then.<br><br>Mr Ee, speaking to BT yesterday, confirmed that his board was looking at the avenues they have for legal action against the former board members of the charity, and that the two contracts are areas they are looking into.<br><br>'Our solicitors, Allen &amp; Gledhill, are looking into whether we have any actionable grounds, and we'll wait to act on their advice,' he said. 'We'll announce our course of action at the appropriate time.'<br></div>
