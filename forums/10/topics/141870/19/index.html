When the saga first started, we saw many ppl actually took action to cancel donation, we saw ppl putting protest signs outside NKF building. We never find singaporean going all out as in this case. Its a lost of faith in an orgn well supported by the government.<br><br>Now it is interesting to see what the government would do. If the watchdogs failed in NKF case, can they also fail in other charitable orgn, and any other orgns that manage public funds?<br><br>when it comes to election, it is just a tick at a different place and that is not difficult to do.</div>
