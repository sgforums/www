            <div class='col-md body'>An entry in singabloodypore.blogspot.com shows that the cover-up of the NKF  wrongdoings is even worst than the wrongdoings themselves:<br><br>I highlight these statements made by the Ministers not to show how silly they now in retrospect because Mr Khaw Boon Wan has admitted as much. Words like Â“dupedÂ”, Â“misledÂ”, Â“naÃ¯veÂ”, and Â“oversightÂ” were used liberally in the aftermath of the KPMG exposē.<br><br>Parliamentary statements in 2004, however, indicate otherwise.<br><br>For example, in Parliament on 19 April 2004, NMP Braema Mathi had raised the concern of NKFÂ’s computation of the amount of donated money going to the beneficiary. Second Minister for Finance Lim Hng Kiang brushed off the matter and concluded that NKF wasÂ” on quite a sound record.Â” The following was the exchange:<br><br>Braema Mathi: Â“Â…NKF, in the public domain, has made two announcements of 52 cents coming back to the beneficiary, as well as 56 centsÂ…What I am raising here with this incident is that different definitions do go into making up what comes back to the beneficiary in terms of a precise dollar value. There needs to be greater consistency in the factors that go into such computation.Â”<br><br>Lim Hng Kiang: Â“Â…[NKF] put up the press release and explained the differences between 52% and 56% go to the beneficiaries. I recall also that they indicated in the press release that about 26% goes to the reserves. So, actually, if you add up the two numbers, nearly 80% goes to the beneficiaries. I think that puts NKF on quite a sound record.Â”<br><br>The NMP also brought up the question of transparency and suggested that NKF reveal the salary of its CEO. Mr Lim left it to the NKF to decide whether it wanted to tell the public (remember, this was in spite of the misgivings many quarters had over NKF). He said:<br><br>Â“Â…this is a decision by NKF whether to disclose the salaries of the CEOs. Here, I have some sympathy for their dilemma. If they do not disclose, then there will be critics who say they are not transparent. If they disclose, there will also be critics who will say that whatever they pay are too high. So I think they are caught between a rock and a hard place. I think it is their decision not to disclose.Â”<br><br>If there was ever any doubt that concern was brought to the direct attention of the Government, it was removed by this statement from Ms Braema Mathi: Â“NKF's reservesÂ…[are] in dire need of better governance.Â”<br><br>To put the publicÂ’s unease over the NKFÂ’s compliance with regulations, Mr Lim Hng Kiang told Parliament in 2004:<br><br>Lim: Â“Mr Speaker, Sir, it is important to have clear guidelines on the raising and utilisation of funds to maintain public confidence in our non-profit organisations and their programmes. There are essentially three questions the public is most interested in. First, what methods are used to raise the money? Second, how much of the charity dollar is used to raise funds? And, finally, how is the money spent or saved?Â”<br><br>Of the three questions, the third is the most relevant to the issue today: Was NKF in compliance with regulations over how the money spent or saved?<br><br>PAP MP Charles Chong asked Minister Lim point-blank: Â“Sir, could the Minister tell us whether the National Kidney Foundation is in full compliance with all the current guidelines that he mentioned just now in the collection and utilisation of the funds that it receives from the public?Â”<br><br>Mr Lim did not mince words: Â“Mr Speaker, Sir, the NKF is in full compliance with the regulations.Â” (emphasis added)<br><br>From the above parliamentary exchanges, it can be seen that the Government was alerted to questionable practices in the NKF. Not only did Mr Lim ignore these warnings he categorically told Parliament that he had Â“full confidenceÂ” that NKF had complied with regulations.<br><br>Then there was the matter of the National Council of Social Services (NCSS). On Dec 31, 2001, the NCSS revoked the IPC status of NKF. The NCSS took action because it saw the problems within the NKF. And yet, within a month the Ministry of Health reinstated the NKFÂ’s IPC status.<br><br>Now read what Mr Lim told Parliament in 2004: Â“[The Ministry of Finance] has certain criteria by which [it] evaluates applicants who want IPC status, and these criteria are set by IRAS, and we make sure that people who apply have to qualify before they are given this IPC status.Â” (emphasis added)<br><br>In other words we are given to believe that there was an active search for answers from the NKF before NKF was given clearance to reclaim its IPC status.<br><br>Before we go further, letÂ’s do a quick recap. There were several occasions in which NKFÂ’s operations were questioned:<br><br>Â· Criticisms by NKF volunteers which led to Durai taking defamations suits against them in 1997 and 1998.<br><br>Â· Letters to the press from 2002-2004 questioning NKFÂ’s practices.<br><br>Â· NCSS revoking NKFÂ’s bid for IPC status.<br><br>Â· Statements in parliament pointing to problematic operations in NKF.<br><br>With all these warning signs, can the Government claim that it was Â“misledÂ” and that it was an Â“oversightÂ” that allowed the abuses to continue for years?<br><br>What is especially noteworthy is that the Government not only ignored these warnings, it actually overruled the NCSS. This indicates that the Government felt that the concerns of NCSS were misplaced. Remember that Mr Lim had told Parliament that the MOF Â“makes sureÂ” that applicants for IPC status the criteria that it sets before approval is given. How can the Government say that it Â“makes sureÂ” and gives the assurance that the NKF was in Â“full complianceÂ” with the guidelines, but then later claim to have been Â“misledÂ”?<br><br>..........<br><br>There are several urgent questions that need to be asked:<br><br>1. Why did Lim not make greater effort to look into the matter of how the expenditure was computer when it was pointed out to him that there were discrepancies? Even if the audited reports did not raise any alarm, there were plenty of other sources that had, repeatedly through many years, drawn the attention of the Minister to the problems. Why were these ignored?<br><br>2. Not only were warnings ignored, the Government actually overruled NCSSÂ’ decision to rein in the NKF. Did the Government seek the feedback of NCSS and find out why it had revoked NKFÂ’s IPC status? If it did, what did the NCSS tell the Government? If not, why not?<br><br>3. What questions were asked of NKF before the IRAS reinstated the NKF its IPC status?<br><br>4. Why is the MOF keeping so quiet?<br><br>The scary part is that if TT Durai had not sued, NKF would have gone on merrily doing what it did.<br><br>Clearly there was no transparency. The mystery over what happened when the Government overruled the NCSS and reinstated NKFÂ’s IPC status remains. The Government said it was all right for NKF not to reveal DuraiÂ’s despite mounting evidence that there was abuse.<br><br></div>

These negative side ... &gt; full story<br><br>&gt; more related stories<br>Related sections:<br><br>Health &amp; Medicine<br>Matter &amp; Energy<br><br>"Current dialysis machines are based on 30-year-old technology and employ filter systems that are only about 28 percent efficient," said Michael Baker, chief executive officer of Home Dialysis Plus, the firm developing the device.<br><br>"By employing the microtechnology being developed at OSU's College of Engineering, the filter efficiency skyrockets to about 90 percent," Baker said. "And we're able to reduce the dimensions of a dialysis machine from the size of a refrigerator to the size of a piece of carry-on luggage, which makes treatment portable."<br><br>Baker said that more than 600 jobs could be associated with the device when production begins.<br><br>OSU researchers and Home Dialysis Plus officials say the reduced size and increased efficiency will improve the lives of dialysis patients because treatments will be done in the home while patients are asleep at night. Many dialysis patients now have to limit travel and other opportunities due to time-consuming treatments that can take up to four hours.<br><br>"A growing number of studies indicate that longer and/or more frequent in-home dialysis offers not only superior therapy, but also the opportunity to reduce costs," Baker said. "These revelations are prompting more and more dialysis patients to demand the health benefits, the convenience, and the quality of life that in-home dialysis has to offer. We launched Home Dialysis Plus to give dialysis patients the life-improving technology they've been asking for."<br><br>Home Dialysis Plus was founded by Altman Browning and Company, a Portland product development firm that has been working closely with researchers at the OSU College of Engineering to develop the new microtechnology for use in the dialysis application. Researchers say the technology, known as multiscale materials and devices, or MMD, could eventually enable development of a wearable dialysis device, or even an implantable version.<br><br>"MMD technology is allowing us to reduce a filter that is more than eight inches tall by three inches in diameter to the size of about four sugar cubes," Baker said. "As this technology develops, the possibility of an implantable dialysis device becomes very real."<br><br>Jim Curtis, a certified hemodialysis technologist, works as area manager for Fresenius Medical Care North America, a company that operates 11 dialysis clinics throughout Oregon. He said that "MMD technology has the potential to revolutionize the artificial kidney because it enables such good surface area in such a small space. Many studies show that patients are better off dialyzing less rapidly, but over a longer period of time."<br><br>Citing a recent Canadian study that compared patients who underwent traditional dialysis treatments (three times a week for approximately four hours) to patients who underwent nocturnal dialysis (eight hours of dialysis nightly), Curtis said recovery time following treatment was reduced from approximately six hours to about seven minutes.<br><br>"Nocturnal dialysis gives patients more time in their lives because they spend this time sleeping anyway," Curtis said. "And they don't have to spend hours every week feeling washed out or nauseous before and after treatments."<br><br>The leading causes of kidney failure are diabetes and hypertension, Curtis said. By 2011 the number of people suffering kidney failure is expected to be 600,000 in the U.S. alone.<br><br>In addition to being a fraction of the size of current dialysis machines, the Home Dialysis Plus device will operate much more quietly and is designed to not look like a typical piece of medical equipment, but to blend into a home environment, Baker said.<br><br>During the 1960s, Dr. Richard Drake developed the Drake Willock dialysis machine, which rapidly became the best selling dialysis system in the world. Drake's Portland-based company, DWS, Inc., employed 250 employees before it was sold in the 1970s. Drake, now retired, says the use of MMD technology in the Home Dialysis Plus filter is an important advance.<br><br>"That is a major breakthrough, because filters have always been a problem," he said. "Reducing the size and increasing the efficiency is very important."<br><br>Although other companies, like Hewlett-Packard, are partnering with OSU researchers to employ MMD technology in new devices, Altman Browning is the first company on the brink of commercializing a viable product.<br><br>"This is an exciting example of how the MMD technology we're developing here at Oregon State University, in partnership with other Oregon universities and businesses, will dramatically improve lives," said Ron Adams, dean of engineering at OSU. "It also illustrates how this technology can lead to new companies and new jobs here in Oregon and beyond."<br><br>Researchers at OSU are partnering with researchers at the University of Oregon, Portland State University, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and other institutions to develop MMD technology, which U.S. Senator Ron Wyden has predicted will be an "economic sparkplug" for the Pacific Northwest.<br><br>"MMD technology has the potential to spawn an entire industry, one that could rival the microelectronics boom of the 1950s and 60s," Adams said. "The Home Dialysis Plus product is just the tip of a very large iceberg."<br><br>MMD technology includes the use of microchannels, which enable high rates of heat and mass transfer and are the reason for the high rates of efficiency in the Home Dialysis Plus filter.<br><br>OSU researchers are also developing an MMD technology-based portable cooling system for the U.S. military that will be used by soldiers, firefighters, and emergency personnel working in hot or hazardous conditions.<br></div>
