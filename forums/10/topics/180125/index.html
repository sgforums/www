            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yeah..... I know Malaysia is constituitional monarchy because they got a King who is Sultan from each of the Malaysian states. Then they rotate every reign. Then during the tsunami disaster the papers also mention Royal Malaysian navy etc.<br><br>I think its because right... some people confuse the democracy in Malaysia with republic. Many republics are democracy but not all democracies are republics, like UK and Thailand etc.<br><br>I think right, its an error on their part of journalists lah. Because they report on so many countries they blur liao. Don't need to get hyped up over these. Don't make such general assumptions.<br><br>I thought Singapore's sultan used to be the Johor one? Then later Singapore was sold to the British, then decades later in 1860s it became crown colony already. Maybe my history facts are wrong?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Johor Sultan was not from royal family.<br><br>He was the Prime Minister to the Sultan in Singapore. Then he moonlighted as a pirate chief cos he was broke. The British then bribed him with title of SULTAN in return for giving up piracy, and betraying his pirate friends to the British. Peace came to the traders in Straits.<br><br>The new sultan and his kids became very Anglo......some even married Ang Moh women........note the Johor prince who whacked the Brazillian party on Pulau near Tioman looks like white punk.....</div>
