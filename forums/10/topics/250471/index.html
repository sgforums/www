Â– Anonymous<br><br>Tuesday Â• April 24, 2007<br><br>P N Balji: Editorial Director, balji@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>IN A country which has made succession an obsession, two top achievers, both with a banyan-tree approach to management, have left their high-profile jobs and must be asking themselves: What went wrong?<br><br>The story of Mr Philip Yeo and Mr Tan Kin Lian is a sad one indeed.<br><br>Instead of being remembered for his achievements in making Singapore a safe bet for investors or in creating Jurong Island out of practically nothing and turning it into a hive of activity for the chemicals industry, or for having the daring to plunge into research and development (R&amp;D) when there were many naysayers, the Philip Yeo story is having an unpalatable footnote.<br><br>He has left the driver's seat at A*Star for a non-executive job as chairman of Spring Singapore without fulfilling his R&amp;D dream and without identifying and mentoring a successor. Even worse was getting into another round of verbal sparring with a young bond-breaker whom he had already dealt with two years ago.<br><br>In the case of Mr Tan, taking NTUC Income from an asset base of $28 million 30 years ago Â— when this young man with a hard-luck story joined the organisation as general manager Â— to $17 billion when he left as CEO is no mean feat.<br><br>When Today was launched in November 2000, Mr Tan was one of the very few corporate chieftains who saw the need for competition and supported the product with advertising dollars and by endorsing it personally on TV.<br><br>He was a breath of fresh air in a corporate world known for having "no comment". He angered his rivals when he spoke his mind about the ills of the insurance industry, stumped motor workshops when he went on a one-man crusade against inflated accident claims and raised eyebrows when he wrote about social issues, definitely not in a politically-correct way.<br><br>Anecdotes and statistics tell only half the story. The other half is about a man who had a tight control on nearly everything that happened in the insurance cooperative. Every press release, even an innocuous one-line statement, had to be approved by him. Every advertisement had to be vetted by him. It was central control all the way.<br><br>And when it came to succession, there was really nobody in sight.<br><br>With a new chairman on board, attempts were made to bring in a couple of scholars and heavyweights, the most striking of them being insurance industry heavyweight Stanley Jeremiah. But Mr Jeremiah left in a huff last year, thus precipitating Mr Tan's departure.<br><br>What went wrong in a story that should have ended as sweetly as it started for both luminaries?<br><br>They didn't know when to step down, or at least step aside. And they had not identified and nurtured a successor.<br><br>When a leader has a successor at the ready, the thought of leaving the scene is always at the back of his or her mind.<br><br>Of course, when to step down is not a science. There is never a right time, never a perfect occasion. There is always the next target to chase, the next battle to fight.<br><br>World champion boxer Muhammad Ali never knew when to stop. He came rumbling back after winning the world crown thrice. The result: Humiliating defeat after defeat.<br><br>So, all you leaders out there: Take a leaf from former South African President Nelson Mandela's book. Jailed for 27 years, he went on to become President, identified a successor, handed over power after just one term in office and rode into the sunset a contented and happy man.<br><br>In those five years in power, he set the tone for his country and the world by pardoning all the brutal wrongdoings of whites during the repressive apartheid years.<br><br>That, in my book, is a great leader.<br><br>Copyright MediaCorp Press Ltd.

Â– Anonymous<br><br>Tuesday Â• April 24, 2007<br><br>P N Balji: Editorial Director, balji@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>IN A country which has made succession an obsession, two top achievers, both with a banyan-tree approach to management, have left their high-profile jobs and must be asking themselves: What went wrong?<br><br>The story of Mr Philip Yeo and Mr Tan Kin Lian is a sad one indeed.<br><br>Instead of being remembered for his achievements in making Singapore a safe bet for investors or in creating Jurong Island out of practically nothing and turning it into a hive of activity for the chemicals industry, or for having the daring to plunge into research and development (R&amp;D) when there were many naysayers, the Philip Yeo story is having an unpalatable footnote.<br><br>He has left the driver's seat at A*Star for a non-executive job as chairman of Spring Singapore without fulfilling his R&amp;D dream and without identifying and mentoring a successor. Even worse was getting into another round of verbal sparring with a young bond-breaker whom he had already dealt with two years ago.<br><br>In the case of Mr Tan, taking NTUC Income from an asset base of $28 million 30 years ago Â— when this young man with a hard-luck story joined the organisation as general manager Â— to $17 billion when he left as CEO is no mean feat.<br><br>When Today was launched in November 2000, Mr Tan was one of the very few corporate chieftains who saw the need for competition and supported the product with advertising dollars and by endorsing it personally on TV.<br><br>He was a breath of fresh air in a corporate world known for having "no comment". He angered his rivals when he spoke his mind about the ills of the insurance industry, stumped motor workshops when he went on a one-man crusade against inflated accident claims and raised eyebrows when he wrote about social issues, definitely not in a politically-correct way.<br><br>Anecdotes and statistics tell only half the story. The other half is about a man who had a tight control on nearly everything that happened in the insurance cooperative. Every press release, even an innocuous one-line statement, had to be approved by him. Every advertisement had to be vetted by him. It was central control all the way.<br><br>And when it came to succession, there was really nobody in sight.<br><br>With a new chairman on board, attempts were made to bring in a couple of scholars and heavyweights, the most striking of them being insurance industry heavyweight Stanley Jeremiah. But Mr Jeremiah left in a huff last year, thus precipitating Mr Tan's departure.<br><br>What went wrong in a story that should have ended as sweetly as it started for both luminaries?<br><br>They didn't know when to step down, or at least step aside. And they had not identified and nurtured a successor.<br><br>When a leader has a successor at the ready, the thought of leaving the scene is always at the back of his or her mind.<br><br>Of course, when to step down is not a science. There is never a right time, never a perfect occasion. There is always the next target to chase, the next battle to fight.<br><br>World champion boxer Muhammad Ali never knew when to stop. He came rumbling back after winning the world crown thrice. The result: Humiliating defeat after defeat.<br><br>So, all you leaders out there: Take a leaf from former South African President Nelson Mandela's book. Jailed for 27 years, he went on to become President, identified a successor, handed over power after just one term in office and rode into the sunset a contented and happy man.<br><br>In those five years in power, he set the tone for his country and the world by pardoning all the brutal wrongdoings of whites during the repressive apartheid years.<br><br>That, in my book, is a great leader.<br><br>Copyright MediaCorp Press Ltd. All rights reserved.<br></div></blockquote>That old man still wants to control Singapore.  He can never let go.  He is no where/way to be compared to Mr Bill Clinton.  Clinton has a heart for his people (read his book).  He is superb!!   Clinton has a heart for charity, too!  What does that old man do for charity?</div>

With an intellect like yours, I wouldn't even dream of likening your intellect to that of a dog's - that'd be an insult to the great canines.

For the record, Clinton's royalty for his autobiography (My Life) was also the highest in US history at the point he clinched the deal - and this is a book that's a genuine bestseller in many parts of the world, not like those penned by a criminal that lays claim to being a bestseller only in the territories over which he has a jurisdiction.</div>
