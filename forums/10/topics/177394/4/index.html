Their govts are corrupt dictatorships that needs to distract the populance away from their own inadequacies. Thats why they need somebody to blame for their own failures.<br><br>And when the people indulge in blaming others for their own failures rather than taking responsisbility for their own problems, they end up being poorer and poorer for it. So they keep blaming others for their problems and keep hating when others get richer.<br><br>Arabs are actually smart people but they are very poor. Its a system error man!<br><br>A friend of mine who visited Saudi Arabia told me that the people are actually very poor because the govt wants to keep them poor and illiterate so that they can be controlled and not over throw their own govt.</div>

The cartoons were simply flimsy excuses by fanatics to stir trouble on purpose. The Danish papers should not be blamed.<br><br>2.

Even if we disregard the "great hollow one" posts, we still cannot deny that there are many instances where we see muslim leaders taking obviously anti-christian views which manifests itself again, in decisions and even words.<br><br>A recent example that appeared on local newspapers is when a deceased former muslim who converted to hindu received an islamic last rites instead of a hindu one. That shows the lack of respect the govt had on other religions.<br><br>The more recent uproar over the pictures as published by the DANISH newspaper, which had no religious sympathies, nor official religions connections, saw the murder of a catholic priest in response.<br><br>Also, AMERICAN embassies in various countries are under attack although we know that it wasn't an american newspaper that published the pictures but a DANISH newspaper.<br><br>That shows the extent of the biasness by the muslim leaders and followers.<br><br>The fact that those MILLIONS of muslims are not even showing dissapproval of such misdirected violence by the FEW THOUSAND muslims show how deeply rooted this anti christian, anti catholic and anti american bigoted views are.<br><br>I know your first response, the americans had it coming, they were not right in invading iraq, isreal blah blah blah...<br><br>The christians and catholics are more concerned about each other than muslims.

However, what do you as a Muslim propose should be the world's reaction to this mounting violence committed in the name of Islam?  If the rest of the Islamic community chooses to keep silent in the face of violence committed by their "black sheep", what choice do you leave others when dealing with the problem but to see the problem as one of Islam?</div></blockquote>Really, I am not aware that Atobe is a Muslim. However blurberry and protonhybrid made it obvious in their posting style that they are people do not consume pork and pray five times daily.</div>

I'm not a very religious person too despite being a sunday school teacher and also a high profile member in various christian youth establishments.<br><br>When people talk bad about my religion, I do net declare the extermination of a race or religion, nor do I mastermind the death of hundreds.<br><br>I do not believe that its a problem of non-religious people but its more the problem of the simple minded millions of muslims that are being misled and manipulated by the few extermists thereby causing the few thousand muslims to act against islam by killing and murdering.<br><br>Perhaps ethical and responsible clerics should speak out more to teach their people what real islam is about.</div>
