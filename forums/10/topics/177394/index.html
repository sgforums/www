            <div class='col-md body'>Yes... Even though i believe that it is wrong for the Danish company to provoke them by printing the cartoon and muslims around the world have the right to feel angry. But they should not react by attacking foreign missons. This suggests that the muslim religion preaches violence and not peace, love etc... Moreover, they feel that it is alright to blow themselves up among innocent people in the name of god or whatever and the printing of a mohammad is like a unforgivable sin.. Doesn't make any sense at all! Some even call for the total destruction of a nation or even race... the ironic part is that their quran tells them to be peace-loving people.. I feel that they are too extreme and should take a step back and ask themselves why are they acting like this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Put it this way<br><br>As a singular event, its uncalled for the Danish newspapers to use freedom of speech as an excuse to mock a religion, worse, to put Islam and terrorism in the same light by potraying Mohammed as a terrorist.<br><br>But if you look at the overall picture, i think the rest of the world no longer empathise with the Muslims. One main reason is the excessive violence committed, not by all, but a significant number of Muslims, from the likes of Osama to the protestors who burned down Danish embassy in Beirut.<br><br>The second important reason of course, is the desecration of religious places by some Muslims, that are left ignored by the rest of the Muslim world, and which members of the religions concerned did not incite violence or protest vehemently. A lot of people see it as hypocrisy on the part of Muslims.<br><br>I think this event is regretable, but I rather the Muslims make a stronger stand against violence.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Islam | Christianity conflict has been so deeply deeply rooted, since day one of Gaza strip conflicts with Isreal, for sacred grounds since ancient times, US/UN sanctions and involvement for fuel etc.<br><br>Its not just abt these comics, this is just a trigger that sparks a chain of events, and in this period of high tension, at a time like this, where technology wires anything so effectively internationally, the Dannish ppl really asked for it. You all watch the movie by Brad Pit and Orlando Bloom - was it Trojan or something, Bloom eloped the Queen and triggered a war , Bloom asked for it.<br><br>They claim freedom of speech and expression, but their insensitivity transcends borders to ppl of diversed believes and culture, is forcing insults down their throats and asking for reaction, isnt it passive aggressive? US is now still bombing Muslim states. Reaction in violence cannot be humanely correct, but cant be entirely unexpected in this case, given the inclination towards violence.  Why put yourself in the spot when , when u can see it coming.<br><br>Some Brit or US TV station broadcasted a song gloating over Chinese being washed off during the Tsunami disaster right? It was dried out in no time. When would they learn that they cant get away everytime? Some things save for bedroom whispers, freedom of expression under the blankets would save lifes. Beyong that learn to respect others would mean to respect lifes, yours and millions of others.</div>

Even though i believe that it is wrong for the Danish company to provoke them by printing the cartoon and muslims around the world have the right to feel angry. But they should not react by attacking foreign missons. This suggests that the muslim religion preaches violence and not peace, love etc... Moreover, they feel that it is alright to blow themselves up among innocent people in the name of god or whatever and the printing of a mohammad is like a unforgivable sin.. Doesn't make any sense at all! Some even call for the total destruction of a nation or even race... the ironic part is that their quran tells them to be peace-loving people.. I feel that they are too extreme and should take a step back and ask themselves why are they acting like this.</div></blockquote>I ALMOST agree with you and think this is the first time i saw a rational post in relation to brewing tension in the world of politics.<br><br>you see both these extreme reactins, IMHO, are wrong. freedom of expression does NOT exist in any part of the world, nor did it ever exist. ONLY the extent varies, but freedom is curbed.<br><br>then isn't danish and other european solidarity with supposedly "freedom of speech" absurd? also isn't it absurd that because one newspaper published it, all danish citizens are boycotted?<br><br>i dont support either of these extremes sorry to say.<br><br>it's not wise to boycott ALL danish products, goods, etc because one newspaper published it. and especially to burn down embassies where most people are innocent doesn't help at all.<br><br>I'm sorry in this case you're wrong in saying "middle east muslims are too extreme". I'd say both sides were wrong in going to such extremes.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was common for the Muslims in (Singapore, Malaysia + Indonesia) till the 70Â’s to practice a more tolerant and compassion form of Islam. Its a fact that South ArabiaÂ’s Wahabism Influence created a more extreme form which unfortunately had penetrated some of our muslim brothers. Regrettably none of the governments in these countries, including Singapore had earlier detected South ArabiaÂ’s negative influences. The changes were so obvious and yet our leaders were blind!<br></div>
