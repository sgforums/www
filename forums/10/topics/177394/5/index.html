You'll be pleased to learn that, thanks To the concerns of citizens like yourself, we are creating a new division of the Terrorist Retraining Program, to be called the "Liberals Accept Responsibility for Killers" program, or LARK for short.<br><br>In accordance with the guidelines of this new program, we have decided to place one terrorist under your personal care. Your personal detainee has been selected and scheduled for transportation under heavily armed guard to your residence next Monday.<br><br>Ali Mohammed Ahmed bin Mahmud (you can just call him Ahmed) is to be cared for pursuant to the standards you personally demanded in your letter of punishment. It will likely be necessary for you to hire some assistant caretakers. We will conduct weekly inspections to ensure that your standards of care for Ahmed are commensurate with those you so strongly recommended in your<br><br>letter.<br><br>Although Ahmed is a sociopath and extremely violent, we hope that your sensitivity to what you described as his "attitudinal problem" will help him overcome these character flaws. Perhaps you are correct in describing these problems as mere cultural Differences. We understand that you plan to offer counselling and home schooling.<br><br>Your adopted terrorist is extremely proficient in hand-to-hand combat and Can extinguish human life with such simple items as a pencil or nail clippers. We advise that you do not ask him to demonstrate these skills at your next yoga group. He is also expert at making a wide variety of explosive devices from common household products, so you may wish to keep those items locked<br><br>up, unless (in your opinion) this might offend him.<br><br>Ahmed will not wish to interact with you or your daughters (except sexually) since he views females as a subhuman form of property. This is a particularly sensitive subject for him, and he has been known to show violent tendencies around women who fail to comply with the new dress code<br><br>that he will recommend as more appropriate attire. I'm sure you will come to enjoy the anonymity offered by the burka -- over time.<br><br>Just remember that it is all part of "respecting his culture and his religious beliefs" -- wasn't that how you put it?<br><br>Thanks again for your letter. We truly appreciate it when folks like you, keep us informed of the proper way to do our job. You take good care of Ahmed - and remember...we'll be watching.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>Cordially...Your friend,<br>Don Rumpsfeld<br></div>

Remember that hitler was a very outstanding orator who managed to woo his audiences and get himself voted in as chancillor.<br><br>The same case for mao. His people believed that mao can bring them a better life and they truely believed in him.<br><br>Power comes in great numbers. When the majority believes in something, even the biggest guns and newest technology cannot stop them. The americans found that out the hard way in vietnam.<br><br>The high profile clerics and mullahs have shown that they can stand against the biggest guns and media propaganda machines and speak out against various anti muslim actions by the west, how can they be unable to speak out against their own errand muslims who misrepresent their faith and give their God a bad name?<br><br>The respected muslim community leaders are very quick to condemn various degradatory actions against muslims and islam yet they do not speak out against the terrorists who use islam to conduct atrocities? We're not talking about freedom fighters who behead foreign invaders in their land. We're talking about those who destroy american embassies in response to danish insults. Those who kill priests for danish actions. Why do the mullahs and clerics not speak out against such actions? These embarassing behaviour are giving muslims a bad name. Conducting such senseless crimes in the name of their God is more insulting than various pictures of the prophets.<br><br>As for my second and third questions, you answered my questions with more questions. You liken your response with a: since others have done it before, I do not see why can't the muslims do it too. You justify errand behaviour with precedence set by other errand behaviour.<br><br>Just because the helpless civillians have always been targetting, doesn't mean we should target them again. Just because muslims have always been called "terrorists" doesn't make it ok for me to call them that, right? Especially  if I know better.<br><br>The "final solution" to the "jewish problem" was a bad idea. The americans and russians made sure hitler knew that. The dropping of the A bomb is still being debated till this day. It could be as our textbooks said, to save american lives, or it could be racism, or even just a need to test the bomb! If I ever because a professor of history, I'll tell people that the americans had 2 extra bombs and they needed to dispose of it!<br><br>As for the isrealis, can you prove that they treat the palestinians as second class subhumans?<br><br>I believe that they do take very strong steps against the palestinians, but without full understanding of their situation, we cannot comment on their need to protect themselves against the palestinians.<br><br>Similarly for saddam, he gassed the kurds. The americans have been condemning that for many years. I believed that there is more reasons as to why he wanted to gas the kurds but without full understanding of the facts that saddam had on hand, we cannot comment on his decision to gas the kurds.<br><br>The HDB quota is there for a very sensible reason although I am unable to explain and bring full justice to the substantiation of such actions. Remember, our govt base all their policies on pragmatism, not emotions. They do not do anything to alienate any race or religion, unless there is a very very good substantiation to it.

His people believed that mao can bring them a better life and they truely believed in him.<br><br>Power comes in great numbers. When the majority believes in something, even the biggest guns and newest technology cannot stop them.

We're not talking about freedom fighters who behead foreign invaders in their land. We're talking about those who destroy american embassies in response to danish insults. Those who kill priests for danish actions. Why do the mullahs and clerics not speak out against such actions? These embarassing behaviour are giving muslims a bad name. Conducting such senseless crimes in the name of their God is more insulting than various pictures of the prophets. </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Are you stretching geography and news across continents and mixing events to fit your narrow views of Islam, Muslims and their Religious Leaders ?<br><br>How do you get your information to form the opinion that is printed here -  from newspapers, newsreels, TV, or the Internet ?<br><br>Your rope is certainly very long, "lassoing" the mullahs reacting against Danish Cartoons - who authorise the destruction of US embassy in Syria, with those "mullahs" authorising murder priests in southern Thailand.<br><br>With all these criminal acts by those thousands giving the billions of faithfuls a bad name, do we need the additional efforts of misunderstanding and narrow views from "pals" with similar slanted views as the Resident "no brainers" ?</span><br><blockquote><strong><br>As for my second and third questions, you answered my questions with more questions. You liken your response with a: since others have done it before, I do not see why can't the muslims do it too. You justify errand behaviour with precedence set by other errand behaviour. </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">The answers are in the answers when you respond to those questions.<br><br>Your interpretations to my question merely scratch the surface of the question, think deeper and you will crystallize the answers to your own questions.</span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Just because the helpless civillians have always been targetting, doesn't mean we should target them again. Just because muslims have always been called "terrorists" doesn't make it ok for me to call them that, right? Especially  if I know better. </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Whether the Acts of Terrorism is carried out by outlaws or by the State, Civilians have always ended up being the casualties of War - whatever the moral background or persuasions for the attack being carried out.</span><br><blockquote><strong><br><span style="color: darkred;">The "final solution" to the "jewish problem" was a bad idea. The americans and russians made sure hitler knew that. The dropping of the A bomb is still being debated till this day. It could be as our textbooks said, to save american lives, or it could be racism, or even just a need to test the bomb! If I ever because a professor of history, I'll tell people that the americans had 2 extra bombs and they needed to dispose of it! </span></strong></blockquote>Are these reasons sufficient "justification" for the killings that had occurred in WW-2 : whether by US, Japanese, or Germans ?<br><blockquote><strong><br>As for the isrealis, can you prove that they treat the palestinians as second class subhumans?<br><br>I believe that they do take very strong steps against the palestinians, but without full understanding of their situation, we cannot comment on their need to protect themselves against the palestinians. </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">How many ways can we interprete the act of discrimination ?<br><br>How do we interprete the arrogance of the Israeli Government in ignoring the UNITED NATIONS call to return to the International Border Demarcation Lines as recognised by the World Body ?</span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Similarly for saddam, he gassed the kurds. The americans have been condemning that for many years. I believed that there is more reasons as to why he wanted to gas the kurds but without full understanding of the facts that saddam had on hand, we cannot comment on his decision to gas the kurds. </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">I find your reasons morbid in your need to know more before condemning Saddam Hussein for his acts of atrocity towards the Kurds.<br><br>How many different reasons do we need before we can fully understand the facts for gassing men, women and children of all ages ?</span><br><blockquote><strong><br>The HDB quota is there for a very sensible reason although I am unable to explain and bring full justice to the substantiation of such actions. Remember, our govt base all their policies on pragmatism, not emotions. They do not do anything to alienate any race or religion, unless there is a very very good substantiation to it. Racism occurs everywhere. Chinese restaurants practise it in every western country. One price for the english menu, lower price for the chinese menu, and better service if you order in cantonese. Blatant racism there. You want to complain? </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">The HDB Quota system came about PRIMARILY as a consequence of the Election Results of 1990 - in which it was discovered that voting were made along ethnic lines.<br><br>With the bulk of the votes from the minority going to the Opposition, it nearly ended with some constituencyies being lost from the grip of the Ruling Party - due to a larger then normal concentration of minorities in that ward.</span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Perhaps you may fare better in clarifying my doubts as posed in my 3 questions rather than use precedence of other mistakes by others to justify the muslim response.<br><br>Thanks. </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Hopefully the explanations given here will help, but it will require a large capacity on your part to be more intellectually challenged.</span><br><br></div>
