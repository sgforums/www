I was introduced to his wife and 8 children and later shown around his bungalow house. At the entrance to his house and the living room, huge Arabic writings and a huge picture of the grand mosque in mecca was displayed. However, in one of his childrenÂ’s room was an altar of some Hindu gods with an oil lamp and incense burning. In the next room was another altar of Jesus and mother Mary with a burning oil lamp. I was told that he had to promise his father that he will carry on the family tradition (that is one child to be a Hindu and another child a catholic). Now, his children will have to follow suit. Although both he and his wife are staunch muslims they still honoured this strange family tradition.<br>If only more people are like this family this world will have less religious problems!<br></div>

Even though i believe that it is wrong for the Danish company to provoke them by printing the cartoon and muslims around the world have the right to feel angry. But they should not react by attacking foreign missons. This suggests that the muslim religion preaches violence and not peace, love etc... Moreover, they feel that it is alright to blow themselves up among innocent people in the name of god or whatever and the printing of a mohammad is like a unforgivable sin.. Doesn't make any sense at all! Some even call for the total destruction of a nation or even race... the ironic part is that their quran tells them to be peace-loving people.. I feel that they are too extreme and should take a step back and ask themselves why are they acting like this.</div></blockquote>I agree it doesn't make sense at all.  God does not need anyone to do His fighting for Him or to right any wrong done to Him.  I am sure He is able to do that Himself.  What gives anyone the right to kill scores of innocent people in His name?   But then, there are lots of crazy people around who think they can score points with Him.</div>
