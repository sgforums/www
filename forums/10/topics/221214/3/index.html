            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I agree with the original thread. Somehow because of NKF, I have lost all faith in "charity" organisation. It use to be that the tin cans only come out once every other Sat. Now it is everyday and a few charity groups at the same time, and I have not even heard of half of the charities the poor kids are collecting for! They really had us fooled with their big budget shows, sob story letters (with our name on Dear so and so even). They made us feel they are sincere. Well obviously he was not paid peanuts for it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .<br>But what amazes me is that the directors of NKF had so much time to liquidate their assets and actually RUN away. I mean was Richard Yong in disguise and using a fake passport! Shouldn't their properties be seized and held by the court since they were guilty of corruption and should be prosecuted.<br>The police should know they are a flight risk but the NKF pple can move and operate freely!<br>I feel that this matter was handled very poorly. The government should appease the people i.e. voters by acting swiftly and firmly thus we will feel that they have acted in an unbiased way against such perpetrators who have abused our trust and money for more than 20 years!</div>
