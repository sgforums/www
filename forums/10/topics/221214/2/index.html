Durai is allowed to go over sea which is permitted by local authority, which is like giving him a choice to flee or come back for trial. Has any one in Singapore history being given such special privilege before? Is this not the case? Don't forget he has Singapore queens to back him up. Everyone knows old NKF is a can of worms, are there a bigger can of worms out there? Will NKF exposes a bigger can of worms in Singapore?</div>
