            <div class='col-md body'>Wonder what you guys think of the situation so far. It's a huge mess I must admit, but I think the palestinians are to blame for it, using their city as a shield and a terrorist base.<br>The next issue is, after the firefight, the clean up begins. Who do you think should be responsible for the cleanup? Already the palestinians are getting maimed by all the booby trapped aread left by their own militants and now they have the nerve to complain that IDF sappers have not cleared the place for them! <a href="http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=155517&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContrassID=0&amp;sbSubContrassID=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=155517&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContrassID=0&amp;sbSubContrassID=0</a><br><br>On the issue of the UN fact finding mission, I think it is only right that neutral military personnel be sent verify the claims of the palsetinians of 400+ 'massacred' vs the Israeli claim of 40 militants KIA. It's a shame that it had to come to this, but sending in diplomats who have never witnessed the horrors of FIBUA to verify Jenin is a huge mistake. These civilians will just see rubble and be immediately biased against Israel. Rather neutral military observers are needed as they are trained to assess such situations and verify the Israel position that there was a huge and hard fought battle.<br><br>Israel could have levelled the place with bombs and artillery, but they chose to reduce palestinian casualities by sending the infantry in.<br>As one militant happily explaimed when he saw the IDF troopers coming in "allah be blessed, it is a godsend...we will kill them all here...we have women and children and they won't fire"<br><br>With attitudes like this, it's no wonder the Israeli public has swung far right. The monster that is Ariel Sharon is the inevitable creation of the terrorists. Now they have only themselves to blame for putting this hawk into power.<br><br>it's just...sad.</div>

The Mitchell and Tenet plans offered as an adjunct to peace, a couple of years ago, would have brought the idea of a fully independent, self contained Palestinian state a lot closer. In exchange the PA would work to try to ensure Isrsels security. That is the basic idea. Yes, both plans fall short of what the PA wants, and whaty it essentailly gave was control of Gaza, along with PA enclaves of control inside the West Bank, and I believe on control of East Jerusalem(not too clear on the last point). But what did they expect, the Israelis to just cave in hand over the entire West Bank in one fell swoop? C'mon, if this were to occur, Israel would be 7-8 miles long at its widest point. Do they even think the Israeli would accept that overnight? The Israelis wouldn't get what they wanted from the plans either, but they were willing to make concessions for peace. Thats what negotiations are about right? For all parties to compromise until a solution is reached?<br><br>The plans were not perfect, but if implemented properly, what it would give is confidence and trust to both sides, and would act as a prelude to further negotiations. It might not produce a breakthrough in a year, but who knows in 5 or 10? Mistrust was built up over 40 years, did they think the Israelis would trust them overnight? What it basically required was for each party to trust each other tentatively, and use that as a basis for further talks. Israel accepted, Arafat didn't. What we see is a direct result of that.<br><br>By consistently refusing to ensure Israels security, and using the suicide bombers to continually try to pressure Israel into more concessions, hoping the Israeli public would eventually tire and give him what he wants, Arafat miscalculated by forcing the Israelis into a corner, and inviting the ensuing backlash. Hes trapped, hungry and uncomfortable? Serves him right. he had a chance to make peace with Rabin and Peres, and become a statesman in the process. Instead he chose war and to become a 'lau hero'.<br><br>FWIW, IMO the wars in the MidEast, were all either started by the Arabs or goaded by the Arabs into starting. They lost all of 'em, and now they come crying like spoilt brats to  try and use world opinion to get back what they lost fair and square.<br><br>Moral of story: Don't start what you can't finish<br><br></div>

Appreciate it if you could share.</div></blockquote>The ancient detail I don't have. What happened in more recent times is that after WWII, Britain administered Palestine. In 1947 the UN voted to force Britain to hand over Palestine into 2 separate entities, one under Jewish admistration and one under Palestinian. Problem was, there are significant minorities of the other side in land under each side's control. Thus the last few months of British rule was marked by fighting as both side strove to gain the upper hand. The Palestinians were supported by the Arabs while the Jews were supported by Jewish expatriates from all over. Things exploded into full scale conflict in 1948 after the Brits left, and eventually the Jews won and Israel was born, with the West Bank and Gaza under Arab control. A few more wars were fought, in 1956 when Nasser tried to nationalise Suez Canal(ended with UN ceasefire- no lands lost either side), 1967 when continual provocation forced Israel into launching a pre-emtive strike(6 day war- Golan Heights, Gaza Strip and West Bank captured), 1973 Yom Kippur War(surprise Arab attack, Sinai lost by Egypt - returned in 1979 as result of Camp David accords), and 1982(and 1985 IIRC) when Israel invaded Lebanon to secure a buffer zone to 1)drive the PLO out of Lebanon and 2)to stop cross border attacks on N Israel. In between there have been low level conflicts and skirmishes, particularly in the late 60s/early 70s, those are the major wars.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you Viper. Under the Oslo accords for example, the Israelis were more willing to budge, but afarat refused to, hoping to use terror as a tool to goad the Israelis into surrendering more. I think he obviously thought that the Israelis would have no more stomache to do battle after their withdrawal from Lebanon.<br>He's also obviously miscalculated the fighting spirit of the Israelis.<br>Sharon came into power because of how arafat refused to reign in his suicide bombers and this triggered a huge shift of public opinion from 'peace is possible' to 'only if we kill them all first' modes. This, i hold arafat and those islamic terrorists like hamas commands fully responsible.<br><br>The only reason why the IDF undertook this recent 3 week incursion was to protect the Israeli public from a wave of suicide bombers, let loose by arafat and sponsored by saddam. I think people who tell their children that to strap a bomb onto themselves and to detonate it in the hope of killing a few soldiers are demented and twisted.<br>And yes, the Israeli public wholeheartedly endorsed the recent incursions cos they all felt that enough was enough. As for those reservists who refused to serve, they refused to serve in the enforcement of patrols in the occupied territories, NOT in the incursions into the terrorist infested cities of ramallah, jenin etc. Get your facts straight, and yes, as viper suggested, change your damned nick. It's highly offensive.<br>Lest we forget too quickly, all the times the wars were fought, it was because the arabs wanted to (as sadat called it) 'drive the Jews into the sea'<br>If these arabs refuse to acknowledge the fundamental tenenat of Israel's existence, how can Israel ever view them with anything more than hostility and suspicion?<br>It also doesn't help that arab leaders and the palestinains openly declare to want to wipe the Jews of the earth every time they stand in front of a camera.<br><br>the reporting is biased...all we see are pictures of lone and masked palestinaian terroris standing against an israeli tank...what a publicity coup for these terrorists! What the World's press refuses to show is how badly Israel has been pushed into a corner.<br>They don't show the devastation that the suicide bombers bring, and they don't show the dead Israelis scattered on the tarmac. It just ain't fun news.<br>It's always better to sell pictures that people want to see...that of the big modern IDF 'bullying' the poor underarmed terrorists. And that's the sad thing. People blind to the fanatical fundamentalism of these terrorists, and who prefer to call them freedom fighters. What an insult to the term ... these are people who walked away from freedom and walked away from negotiation and embraced militancy.<br>I have a friend who serves in te IDF and I write him an email almost every day to see if he's still alive.

I'm quite sure that the people in this forum know where your sympathies lie and what point you're trying to emphasise. Shouting is rude.<br><br>As Shotgun said, there'd be less civilian casualities if those cowardly palestinians stopped hiding behind their women folk.<br>Their womenfolk...what a convenient excuse. Can't drive, can't walk around without men from the family, can't go to school, can't seek medical treatment, can't go to school, but hey! They can be used as a human shield for hamas and fatah terrorists to cower behind their veils.<br><br>Hey girl! you can't go to school, but you'd be a martyr if you strap this thing to your chest and blow yourself up. That's your purpose in life. Oh yeah, and if you survive, come home, wash the dishes and don't let me catch you studying cos i'll burn your books.<br><br>As for the terrorists, I find it extremely repugnant for them to make a 'home video' of each 'martyr' (i call them victims) before they are sent out to die.<br>It's strangely ironic. The leaders like arafat and saddam and those in hamas all preach suicide bombing...but are poor followers of their own doctrine. I guess if you're the head honcco, it's ok to ask innocent young men and women to go blow thmselves up (for the great cause...72 virgins await) but someone has to stay around here to ask more people to go huh.<br><br>"young men, blowing yourselves up is your god-bound duty! You will all become martyrs, better than me! but much as i'd like to join you in self sacrifice, i have an appointment later with other leaders who just sent their legions of bombers off. Then i have to speak to CNN to tell you what a good job you did"<br><br>How pathetic.<br>If Saddam and araft belived so much in martyrdom, they should lead by example. I'm very sure the Israelis wouldn't mind that. (and I'm sure neither would the rest of the world)<br><br>Real leaders practice what they preach.<br>When the ANC renounced violence and turned itself into a legitimate political party, most of its leaders lad down their arms and called on their followers to do the same. Those that refused were expelled from the group.<br><br>Unfortunately, the snake that is arafat offers flowers in one hand and bombs in the other. with such a mixed and equivocal message being sent to the Israelis, it's no wonder that they don't trust him.<br><br>"Hey guys, I really really do want peace with the Israelis, but just to keep them on their toes, here are a few more human bombs coming your way."<br><br>Ah.

Iraq did the same, Taliban did the same so why wouldn't Palestinians do that? They are so eager to cry foul if the civillians are killed.

Their mind are really twisted to the degree that the can justify whatever they do but condemn anyone who do the same to them....<br><br>I have no sympathy for the fanatics muslims or anyone who call for a Jihad. However, I still think that Israel do need to be very careful and exercise restraint when they hit back. Afterall, this is non conventional war. Do have to take civilians into account.<br><br>US would have felt what the current Israeli army is going through after the Somalia black hawk issues. My hearts go to those Israeli soldiers in the heat battles.<br><br>BTW, the Palenstinians did get a kick when they blew up a Merkava 3. Well, I think they just got lucky that their trap worked. I still think Merkava is still the best protected tank in the work. An Abram M1A2 or Leo 2A6 would suffer the same fate if hit by the same mine.<br><br></div>

I presented facts, but U all chose to view it under a pro-Israel's stance.<br><br>Suppose Singapore is invaded one day, won;t U all do the same? Won;t U all hide behind rubble and kill one more person trying to invade your nation?<br><br>These people, viewed under their circumstances are freedom fighters. Who wants war? Who doesn't want a peaceful enviroment to allow their children to grow in? But unless Israel and their allies PRo-right US stop all their double sided ways...there will be no peace.<br><br>Sudaimiki formerly known as FuckSpore4ever</div></blockquote>Give way? Give way to WHAT?  The Palestinian people aren't even a nation.  They should count themselves lucky they aren't, cos I would probably declare war officially, instead of this overt "covert" war.<br><br>Now, as for Lord Moyne, let us consider.  Lehi, the organization that perpetrated the the assassination.  They considered the brit to be responsible for the deporation of immigrant ships.  That was why he was targetted.  2nd, consider the era of 1940, and 1948, people were fighting for their independence from the British colonial rule.  Unfortunately, Lehi's activities included the attacks of british government officials, as well as military targets.  Eventually,  when they murdered Swedish count, Folke Bernadotte, they got themselves outlawed and hunted. Finally tried in a military court with long jail terms.<br><br>Compare this to the ruckus in the Middle East now.  The stark differences stand.  Hamas is targetting civilian populations, killing women and children.  Utter bullshit if you say they were targeting military personnel, cos Israeli government keeps the bulk of military personnel near border zones, well away from civillians.  Finally, Lehi was eventually captured, closed down, trialed.  Has this happened to Hamas?  As Arafat even taken any other steps to stop Hamas's attacks?  Arafat's words are worth NOTHING, it is the Hamas leaders that are in control of the situation now.<br><br>If you think about it yourself, now.  Sure, Lehi, the Jewish "Terrorist" organization commited acts that are not tolerable.  But they were doing this to get out of Colonial rule.  Both Singapore and Malaysia was under heavy British influence and control at that time.  Tell me, was it pretty?  The Brits abandoned us when the Japs came in charging.  Do you think that the Jews would have tolerated the British at that time?  What the organization did was wrong, but they carried it out in desperate times, where many others around the world were trying to forsake their Colonial masters.<br><br>What are the Palestinian's trying to escape from?  "Oppressive Jewish Masters?"  I tell you, nobody wants conflict.  Israel, an ESTABLISHED country, has no reason to seek conflict with a people that doesn't even own the land they sit on.  As far as they are concerned, they'd rather mind their own business.... not that their Arab neighbours allow that is.<br><br>Read the book?  More like read the bookS, and examine results for various sources.  Books tend to be biased, thus its better extract from more sources and obtain your own opinion.</div>
