In fact, I do not condone sucide bombings on children and women. All I wanted to point out is that, it was wrong to link all muslims to evils like Hilter. A few black sheep should not implicate all. Even 99% are bad but there is still one 1 % which are rational and willing to accept good arguments, it still does not justify any group criticizing the 1% because of the wrong that the 99% have done.<br><br>And no, I have not accepted your point of view. It is too extreme for me. But to each his own. I choose to believe in peaceful co-existance between moderate muslims and other communitities in the world, while you are entitled to your own opinions.<br><br>Anyway, If you want to contest your claims about Israel, search for Sudaimiki or RAIDER. They are more interested in that aspect.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Raider and Sudaimiki are just plain biased in their views towards Israel and there is nothing that we can do to correct that.<br>But before I waste more time dealing with their insular, anal, pedantic and myopic views here are a couple of parting shots.<br><br>1) Nothing justifies the bombing of innocent non-combatants. The ends do not justify the means. If that were the case, and Israel seeks so much to eliminate the palestinian problem, they would have started sterilising all palestinian women to curb future terrorists, or just firebombing all the palestinian areas. No sweat. Just press a button and 'poof' no more terrorists and baby and women killers.<br>Obviously Israel does not endorse the sort of techniques that the muslim terrorists espouse. True, Israel may have it's 'dirt' too - like its kidon hit squads who assassinate militants and terrorists, but do you see mossad, shin bet or aman blowing up mosques or palestinian restaurants with the SOLE aim of causing widespread civilian casualities? Obviously those muslim terrorists have no hesitation in doing so. It's sick how they can think that by blowing up a cafe they are advancing the cause against the 'zionist' entity. Please. It's a legitimate independent state, and has been since 1948. It has a name and it is Israel.<br><br>2) **But the palestinians only have rocks and AKs, how are they expected to fight the Israeli military?**<br>Well, no one said that fighting was a suitable solution for anything. remember that PLO started off as a terrorist organisation, and in many ways is still one today, refusing to give up its rabid (yes rabid like in referring to the dogs they are) militancy. Many times have come and past where the US / Norway and other 3Ps have tried to broker peace agreements - which has been refused by the palestinians everytime.<br>If they choose to fight, then that is something that they have chosen. Then don't bloody complain when Israel retaliates. Before those terrorist dogs started hitting Israeli civilians, IDF forces did not enter palestinain cities. No one is complaining if a hamas terrorist assassinates an Israeli officer since that is part of the 'dirt' in an undeclared war. But Israel obviously has the right to hit back if those terrorists hit at defenceless civilians.<br>The way to peace and acceptance is to put down the arms; and accept peaceful negotiations, to renounce terrorism as a legitimate tool of war and to stop encouraging suicide bombers.<br><br>Do you think world opinion will still be with Israel if the palestinains all put down their arms and Israel still continues its military operations? of course not. Israel will suffer huge deficits in its global goodwill. But the more the terrorists sprout out, the more Israel will retaliate.<br>Everytime the Israelis reacted, it's only cos the terrorists moved first.<br><br>3) on the morality of sending children to their deaths and martyrdom - that is the most utter and disgusting SHIT i have every heard in my life. To tell me that the koran, a work of peace and tolerance, can be contextually interpretated to justify suicide bombings (which surprise surprise is illegal) is horrific. to further encourage young children to be martyers for 'the cause' is even more repugnant. children should be in school, building a future for palestine; not training under the watchful eyes of corawdly hamas,fatah and islamic jihad dogs who send them to their deaths and give their parents a home video of their last moments.<br>No matter how vicious the british were in India, it was Ghandi's passive resistance that won the day and shamed an empire. If the palestinains put down their guns and their damned explosives belts, and Israel still continues acting in its present capacity then yes, i will unequivocally condemn Israel.<br>But such is not the case. Israel is merely acting in self defence.<br><br>I think that Ariel Sharon is a monster and a brutal man and I have no love for him. But to see that it is the muslim terrorists who give him new life everyday is perhaps, ironic.<br><br>As I've said in earlier posts, it doesn't matter what the cause is. The moment it involves the killing of innocent non-combatants, then it must be condemned. The IRA lost a lot of support when then started targetting British civilians in the 80s, esp when they tried to blow up the then PM, Thatcher. But the mainstream IRA have since renounced their ways, and initiated political dialogue; and it is only a few splinter groups who still believe in the way of the gun. Look at the peace process in N. Ireland now. It may not be the smoothest one, but the levels of violence has sunk in almost inverse proportions to political progress and achievement.<br>Yes the palestinians have legitimate greviences, no one is denying that, butso do the Israelis, but the moment the palestinains turn baby killers and terrorists, then they should be wiped out.<br>If the palestinains want to be taken seriously, then they must talk, not self-destruct (don't mind the pun)<br>Same goes for the FARC, the shining path, red army, and a whole host of other loony organisations.<br><br>I have nothing but support and encouragement for the palestinain cause, but i have nothing but contempt for the palestinians and the terror that they now support and if that is the way that they want to live, by the sword, then by Jehovah, I sincerely hope that Israel scyths every single last one of them down like the terrorist dogs that they are.<br>Terrorists have no part in a peace process. Pity the moderate palestinians and shame the terrorists. There is no reason to view them as an inseperable whole.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ariel Sharon may be a brutal man.  Unfortunately, he is facing brutal circumstances.  Day after day, week after week, bombs explode here and there, killing innoncent lives.  Is there a way he can NOT react in a brutal manner to defend his people?  All members of military forces around the world, pledge to defend their country against threats, foreign and internal.  Is it not part of the IDF's duty to act against the threat of suicide bombers?  Personally, I feel that its about bloody time the IDF acted on these terrorists and their networks.<br><br>The IDF siege of Jenin may be a wrong step, but its in the right direction.  Rather than sitting back, on the defense against "innoncent" looking people strapped with bombs, they took the offense against the people instigating the suicide bombers.  Unfortunately, their siege was fruitless, as the man named "Arafat," was not captured.  With the EU backing the Palestinian leader, it is unlikely that such similar raids will take place again.<br><br>My opinion on what to do with terrorists like Osama Bin Laden;  Jail him in the same cell as Slobodan Milosevic.</div>
