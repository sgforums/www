Many things could have been done by both sides at many points in time, but they weren't.

Then all chinese and indians and other races should go back to their respective homelands based on your arguments? Stupid isn't it? The palestines were there since 7 A.D or even earlier. This gives them as much right to the Israel's to the land. Further more under the 1948 treaty, there was to be a Israeli and Palestine state. Look what has happened today.<br><br>First in giving Israel their land, would they gain anything in return then ? There was no significant contributions nothing.

That is why I wonder why the world is repeated criticizing the Israelis for taking out the leaders of the terrorist organizations, calling it "assasinations" and asking Israel to stop. These people are civilian in their clothing only, by leading a military campaign against Israel and ordering attacks on civilians, they have declared themselves to be legitimate military targets and therefore when they are attacked, they do not have the right to complain and accuse Israel of violating the rules of war.<br><br>Sudaimiki, Israel kills women and children? I cannot argue with that. The IDF itself has admitted that women and children were indeed killed by the offensive, and during its targeted killings of the murderers, terrorists and madmen of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, PFLP, Al-Aqsa or whatever they call themselves. However we must take things into perspective. While I do not condone the killing of women and children, just simply answer me this: Which is less justifiable? The killing of women and children accidentally while attacking a legit military target whos hiding among them? Or killing women and children deliberately when they're out for a stroll or just eating lunch, with no soldier or military target in sight??<br><br>And as for the shooting of children during the stone-throwing phase of the intifada, the soldiers were condemned for shooting unarmed, protesting children. Well, to these people, let me ask you to stand still in front of me while I grab the biggest rock I can throw and hurl it at their face. If I don't kill you or injure you seriously then I'll happily condemn the IDF for shooting unarmed, defenceless children.<br><br>Your attitude is the precise reason why blood continues to be shed today. : His fathers brothers nieces uncles cousins aunts sisters father killed my fathers brothers nieces uncles cousins aunts sisters father 40(or 600 or 6000) years ago, therefore I'm justified in getting revenge. Of course the war will not stop. And this is a attitude problem thats happening with extremists on both sides, not just the Palestinians<br><br>As for the statement you've made above which I've quoted, thats just so typical. Lose an argument and you start ranting about how the other side in unreasonable unfathomable headstrong bulls with attitudes that left a lot to be desired.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>***** Do U think it is that easy stopping Hamas if the Jews don't give way? During the time when Rabin and Peres or even Barak was in charge, there was significantly less sucide bombing with exception from th extremist. Why? This is because the Palestine were willing to believe that Israel was willing to give peace a chance. However under the far right now, what have they shown so far? Reduction of territories, killing of children. *****<br><br>Yes I agree that suicide bombings were reduced in the past. But what I questioned is Arafats failure to even attempt to stop them,  which as we have seen, has led to him graduating to even encouraging them. Do you think the Palestinians were the only ones who wanted peace? Did the Israeli public not celebrate when the first Oslo accords were signed in 1993? Did they not support Arafat's initial efforts? So why did it change? It changed not because the suicide bombings did not stop, it changed because he did not even lift a finger to try and stop it.<br><br>As for Israel not compromising, what do you call Israels acceptance of the Tenet and Mitchell plans, even though they fell well short of Israeli demands? The were willing to hand over the Gaza Strip, and hand over partial autonomy of the West Bank and E Jerusalem for a start, and continue discussions on eventually ceding all control of the West Bank. If these are not compromises, what are they? But what did Arafat do? He said no, he wanted all of West Bank and Jerusalem, and refused to call in Arabic to stop suicide bombing and try his utmost to ensure Israeli security. In short, he wanted everything but gave away nothing. So who did not compromise?<br><br>***** U claim that everything was done to make the Israelis look bad....have U all ever try considering yourself in the Palestine shoes? When face with tanks and infantry trying to destroy your homeland, would U all not try means and ways to defend your home? So what a shipment of rockets where found? Can it fight the best pilots in the world trying to reduce your home to rubble? *****<br><br>Yes...of course I would. I would defend my home by attacking the tanks and the infantry attacking my home. Not walking into a cafe carrying a bomb and blowing myself up, along with innocent women and children. Thats murder, not defending their homes. The soldiers and tanks are destroying their homes, not the women and children. They were just drinking coffee and eating pizzas.<br><br>*** U all claimed that I was biased. But looking at Your post, there hasn't been a single moment U all been condemning Palestine again and again. I presented facts, but U all chose to view it under a pro-Israel's stance. ***<br><br>We presented facts as well, lots of them. For starters,<br>1) Arafats refusal to condemn suicide bombings and stopping it.<br><br>2) Terrorists attacking women and children instead of facing the soldiers like they should.<br><br>3) Israel reducing its demands in the hopes of peace while the Palestinians refusing to budge at the negotiating table.<br><br>These are facts as well, and I've presented these. But to use what you said, you chose to view these facts using a pro-Palestinian stance. Haven't you become the pot that called the kettle black?<br><br>***** Suppose Singapore is invaded one day, won;t U all do the same? Won;t U all hide behind rubble and kill one more person trying to invade your nation? *****<br><br>Like I said. I would, but by shooting at the invading army, trying to kill their soldiers, destroy their tanks, shoot down their planes.  That makes me a freedom fighter defending my family and my home. Not by blowing up a cafe full of women and children, regardless of their nationality. That makes me a cowardly murderer who does not have the balls to fight his oppressors<br><br>I refuted your arguments point by point, why don't you do the same instead of slapping us with childish tags like "pro-Israeli". I've said I don't like Sharon before, I disagreed with his policies and I hate his politics. I already called the recent operations and overreaction, yet I've not even seen you make one statement acknowledging the Palestinians could have done more to prevent this. Who's biased now?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Viper52 (edited 26 April 2002).]</div>

I'm bigger than that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Its true... our views are coloured by what we get to read. American newspapers are not always good sources to start on this topic 'cos its inherenly biased towards Israel. But that is precisely the point: why do they see a need to skew it unless the "truth" is in need of some creative re-interpretation... Furthermore, they are not the only ones doing it... Mid-Eastern newspapers do the same thing for the other side.<br><br>But what i do feel, is that while America  remains consistent in its support for Israel, the Mid-east oil states expresses support or solidarity with the Palestinians only when there's a crisis or when it suits their purpose. A very good example is 1990. That Saddam Hussein actually tried to link the Palestinian issue to his invasion of Kuwait... thats twisted reasoning and no one else was fooled but thats exactly the point.<br><br>No Arab state has consistently sounght to rehabilitate the situation.

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>After years of intermittent fighting between the Israelis and Palestinians, the two bitter enemies have finally taken the historic step to abandon the Middle East peace process, and to give war a chance to settle their differences.<br><br>In a brief statement, the Israeli government said, "Despite years of so-called peace talks, we have made no progress in resolving all our issues with the Palestinians. We believe that time has come to take the next, logical step, which is all-out war. We hope that this new development in our relationship will lead to a final, lasting settlement between our two peace-loving peoples."<br><br>In response, a spokesman for the Palestinian Authority had this to say. "We welcome this bold new initiative by the Israeli government. No longer shall insane hatred be constrained by talks of peace. Hopefully, all the really crazy militants on both sides will blow themselves up, and leave the rest of us alone."<br><br>Both sides were quick to act to this new development. Israeli troops swept through and occupied most of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, including Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's headquarters in the city of Ramallah, while Palestinian militants were seen busily handing out bombs and explosive belts to their recruits.<br><br>There was no official comment from the White House, which has tried to broker a last-minute peace deal between the two parties. But highly placed sources, who declined to be named, said that President George Bush's immediate reaction had been "that's so crazy, it just might work!"<br></div>

The Palestinians are not as poorly armed as u state them to be, mr. offensivenick.  The IDF managed to sieze one massive shipment of arms, finding them to contain katushya rockets, as well as other heavy weapons.  Poorly armed?  I think not, Palestinian terrorist groups just like parading their AK-47s, then showing them getting brutally wounded.<br><br>Freedom fighters my foot.  If u call people who targets children, and unarmed civilians freedom fighters, then you bring great shame to real freedom fighters like Ghandi.  Freedom fighters are heroes, not cowardly people who murder children.  If Robin Hood existed, he would have been the example of freedom fighters.  Not these crazed men who strap explosives to their backs.<br><br>In anycase, why should the Palestinians be fighting for freedom at all?  The land was never theirs, their land was the various province of southern Syria.  Unfortunately, they were kicked out of their land, and none of the arab nations would take them in.<br><br>"Return all the territories conquered in the 1967 war in exchange for normalization of ties?" Bloody bullshit if you ask me. Surrendering regions like the Golan Heights is like surrendering crucial and advantageous ground.  Why should any country surrender any amount of land that was captured in a defensive war?  Literally mobbed by her arab neighbours, yet she survives and pushes the invaders back to where they came from and beyond is no easy feat.  Consider the land reparations if u may.<br><br>According to the Resolution 242 (1967)<br>of 22 November 1967, quote, "(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;" The resolution called for return of territories and not return of ALL territories.  That Israel has already met.  Now why should any of the Arab countries insist on getting the remaining land back just to "normalize" ties?  Sounds like bloody blackmail to me. Israel should not return the occupied territories as a warning to everybody around the world,  YOU don't start wars without consequences.<br><br></div></blockquote>If they (the suicide bombers/snipers) have the capabilities to match the IDF, they would not have restort the targeting of civilians.Btw, we all noe tt national service is compulsory for all isrealis, dosen't tt makes all the "civilians" part of the IDF tt robbed their land n humilated them for the last 40yrs?<br><br>What would u do if u r raised in a refugee camp in what used to b ur land,see ur people humiliated everyday by the ones tt robbed u of all ur rights,witness the killings of ur famaliy members in what they call "security measures",bombardments becomes part of everyday life........<br><br>I would not hestitate to sacrifice my life in order to inflict maximium damage on the invaders that cause me n my ppl all this misery.<br><br>Resistance fighters or terrorists.

Because it is morally repugnant to fail to see the distinction between military and civilian targets and kill civilianS DELIBERATELY and kill kid because they are your potential enemy. It is morally repugnant to DELIBERATELY walk into a cafe strapped with explosives, to blow yourself up together with women and children.<br><br>BTW, no one robbed them of their land. Look at the military balance at the start of each war in the MidEast, 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973. Each time the Israeli were outnumbered by the Arab armies who started the wars. The Israelis took the land fair and square from the Arabs who attacked them first.<br><br>I've said this before and will say this again.
