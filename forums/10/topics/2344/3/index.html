But maybe you should examine the real cause of this instead of blaming everything on the israelis?<br><br>4.why is it that the arabs does not want the state of israel to exist at all. It was the reluctance of the arab world to make peace with Israel that causes all these.<br><br>5.Just as you said that these militant palestine stood up against invaders. Israeli soldiers are doing their job of protecting their home from being bombed by these brain washed murderers.<br><br>6.How would you like it, if soldiers go into a cafe in palestine and packed loads of C4 and then set it off while people are inside and then proclaimed that it is done in the name of protecting their homeland?[/B]</blockquote>1.OK,maybe i'm wrong.I'll put it this way,MOST of the isrealis r legimate military target so long as they belonged to the armed forces which includes reservists.(Does it make a difference when killing a group of "terrorists" when they r eating out in a restaurant n when they r preparing a sucide mission? In uniforms or not, most isrealis r soldiers)<br><br>2.This is the ultra minorities u r talking abt.The chances r so slim (who on earth wants to migrate there!)tt u'll have a higher chance striking 4D. Facts:Less than 18000 ppl migrates to isreal in the last 5yrs!<br><br>3.Isn't the occupation of palastine n the oppression of its ppl by Isreal the real cause?<br><br>4.Does this mean tt by disliking u gives u the right to kill me.<br><br>5.This one i agree,tic for tac.But ur perception is: Resistance of the Palestinans militias=Murderers/Terrorists-----Isrealis bombings/invasion N occupation of Plestinians towns=Security measures???<br><br>6.Thats exactly what the Isrealis r doing.Only difference is their methods of doing it-Fighterbombers on bombing raids/Heavy shelling from their artilleries. All these r carried out on palestinan towns filled wif INNONCENT CIVILIANS!</div>

What constitute a uniform??? a common dress code... AKA... commonality... In some poor countries... Uniform is a luxury... thus no uniform... but something close to combatant clothings... such as camo... But.. this basis is insufficient... as the key to commonality is not so much on uniform...

I am sorry that I have to say that but that's the truth. If the so called "freedom" fighters attack a military installation during fighting, that's legitimate. It is absolutely wrong to kill civilians while they are just sitting in a cafe enjoying a meal.<br></div></blockquote>I cannot agree with U more mfscrewu. IT is justified to bomb children and women whoa re defenseless and at home as long as U are doing it under the Israeli mandate. In fact as long as U are under that and US supports U...even the UN can be refused a chance to probe the issue in Jenin. I love this....Everything is sooooo fair here.<br><blockquote><strong><br>Your notion of every israelis is a legitimate military target is absolutely wrong. Have it ever occurred to you that some of the victims are new immigrants and some of them have not even served their national service? How would the world react if Israel start to classify every palestine as terrorist?<br></strong></blockquote>Have it ever occur to U that these palestines have no place called home and they are trying to find some or believe in some happiness when they shift to Jenin or West Bank or Hebron? Choose to believe it or not...as long as U are palestine, the Israeli's will view U with a different eye, there is no need to classified. And of course based on your line of argument, it is equally correct to drop bombs on a people, who don;t even have a airforce to being with, and hence killing children and women...very justified indeed.<br><blockquote><strong><br>Humiliation...maybe. But maybe you should examine the real cause of this instead of blaming everything on the israelis? If the palestine have every right to their country, why is it that the arabs does not want the state of israel to exist at all. It was the reluctance of the arab world to make peace with Israel that causes all these.<br></strong></blockquote>Read this excellent article given to us by Shotgun before commenting on this<br><a href="http://www.rmcs.cranfield.ac.uk/warhist/wars/yomkippur.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rmcs.cranfield.ac.uk/warhist/wars/yomkippur.htm</a><br><br>The Arabs are more than willing in the past and even more so now...{i.e. Saudi Arabia willing to give diplomatic recognition} it is just as Shotgun said...they have develop land to such an extend that they do not wih to give it up without a fight...that will be more correct. In such cases, it will be left to the drawing board to solve such issues.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Just as you said that these militant palestine stood up against invaders. Israeli soldiers are doing their job of protecting their home from being bombed by these brain washed murderers.<br></strong></blockquote>And Palestines doing the role of protecting their families against government sanctioned killing of whom unfortuately for the soldiers in IDF, they receive the beating end...while Sharon admires his prized trophies one by one.<br><blockquote><strong><br>How would you like it, if soldiers go into a cafe in palestine and packed loads of C4 and then set it off while people are inside and then proclaimed that it is done in the name of protecting their homeland?</strong></blockquote>[/B][/QUOTE]<br>How would U like it then when U are playing with your children in one moment and suddenly a bomb turns them into toast in the other?<br><br>These palestines, those who are not terrorists, too are trying to protect themselves and their family from harm's way. And given any advantage that can save their communities lives even by one day, they would do it. There is no such thing as honour in a war. No matter how hard the top brass would claim or try to enforce it, there will be instance of black sheep floating around. And No Frill, even U will uphold your honour when fighting such a war, it does not gurantee that the rest of your cohort will expecially when placed in an extremely unnatural situation like war.
