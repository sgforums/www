            <div class='col-md body'>The real issues being debated by people are:<br><br>(1)    NKF's past misdeeds are all known to the ministers e.g. its claims how long the reserve would last, CEO's excessive pay packages, low per dollar donation contribution ot patient's subsidy, ineptness of its board of directors etc, extravagant spending on mercedes and flying first-class using public donation monies ...<br><br>(2)    Minister appears to have supported NKF's policies or practices...in rhe past.<br><br>(3)    Lack of transparency and accountability and use of creative accounting to mull over reserve and patient's subsidies.<br><br>No matter how wrong NKF is, such issues appear to affect the ministers and the whole government as well. If the curent debates are to result in fruitful changes, the ministers will be the ones to change.<br><br>If not the whole exercise will be another justification to mull over existing poblems wasting public monies again...like what the NKF Report has hinted: MOH regulatory authority missing past opportunities in making necessary change.</div>

There is no certainty.<br><br>Let me tell you a story. When i was talking to a chinese national, he was so nationalistic and anti Japanese which led me to conclude he was brainwashed by communists complete control of education and media. There is no reason why a younger generation will hate Japanese unless the media and education continues to propagate it. I tried to hint to him that he was brought up in this propaganda enviroment and he admits that his upbringing did affect him,but he rebuted me that i was the same - partly brainwashed by Singapore ideology.
