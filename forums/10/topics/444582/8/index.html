              <p>don't think Hong Kong is doing well as Singapore in any way!</p>
              <p>First of all, they are different. Before 1997, they were colony of the UK, the head of state was a the governor, after 1997, they have Chief Executive, there were no president nor prime minister, there were no election. They came under the umbrella of the British Empire and the PRC.</p>
              <p>The governor of HK made as much money as possible for their queen, that is why before 1997, many projects were given to the british to ensure as much money go back as possible. Could the HK people do anything? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"> After 1997, the people are still trying to interpret the Basic Law.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"></p>
              <p>Ask the HKger if they have the right people in the government, and none will say they do. For the rich are in control of the major business, especially properties in HK. The government tried to build cheap housing like in Singapore for HK, the property tycoon said as long as you don't affect our business, and the project èƒŽæ­»è…¹ä¸­ã€‚For the smart HK people, it is better to make the money in private sector, and if the company is big enough, they can also influence the politician who serve the people.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
              <p>The HK government don't manage HK as our government, when their economy down, beijing government let the PRC tourists come in, when they need to boost their financial services, the beijing government allow RMB to be traded off shore in HK; no water, the GZ government connect the tape, and who dare to attack HK, when you would be facing the PLA, just have the é£žè™Žé˜Ÿï¼Œto inspire the movie industry....the main task of the HK government, in the meantime, is to handle the PRC immigrants including the pragnant china women, please the many Maria who try to stay there permenantly, and train their people to speak mandarin, to capitalize on the influx of mainland tourists. </p>
              <p>Compared to Singapore, there is one thing they do extremely well, they run the MTR very well....may be we should call our system MTR instead of MRT. </p>
