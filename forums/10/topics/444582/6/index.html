              <p>Where on earth are they so caring towards us on pay????  Fat hope.</p>
              <p>The sickening parasites depress salary of the Singaporeans.   Feedback:    Now you go CDC or agencies for jobs they always expect you to lower your salary expectations.     Jobs offered mostly are lower pay  than the current or previous jobs Singaporeans are holding.   The worst is constant increase of the costs of living.   They want Singaporeans to get lower pay and cope with the constant increase in costs of living.</p>
              <p>Seems like they want to make themselves, their cronies and the rich the only people who can draw high pay in Singapore.</p>

              <p><strong>Proposed ministerial pay formula "flawed": Workers' Party<br> <span class="update">Posted: 06 January 2012 2004 hrs </span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The 
              Workers' Party (WP) said the recommendations of the Committee to Review 
              Ministerial Salaries are a step in the right direction towards grounding
               political leaders with a stronger sense of public service and mission.<br><br>It
               hopes Ministers and MPs will see political office primarily as a noble 
              undertaking which allows them to improve the lives of fellow 
              Singaporeans, rather than as a career option to be weighed against 
              high-earning individuals in the private sector.<br><br>However, it said 
              the Committee's proposal to peg ministers' salaries to the 1,000 top 
              income earners has created a flawed formula.<br><br>It said these individuals make up just 0.06 per cent of the workforce and are unrepresentative of the general population.<br><br>The
               incomes of these "super-rich" Singaporeans generally rise much faster 
              than the rest of the population, potentially escalating the salaries of 
              ministers in subsequent years.<br><br>Rather than an approach that 
              assumes top earners are also top talent, WP recommends a 
              whole-of-government, people-up approach to determining ministerial 
              salaries.<br><br>The WP said it identified this approach in the way 12 developed economies determine their politicians' salaries.<br><br>The
               economies are Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, 
              South Korea, New Zealand, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the 
              United States.<br><br>In most of these economies, a minister's salary is
               set at multiples of that of an MP, which is in turn set at the salary 
              of a senior management grade in the civil service.<br><br>This is the approach Singapore should take, as political office is in the genre of public service, said the WP.<br><br>The
               WP proposed that MPs' allowances be pegged to the salaries of 
              divisional directors in the civil service excluding the Administrative 
              Service.<br><br>Civil service salaries are currently competitively bench-marked to general wage levels of Singaporeans.<br><br>The salaries of ministers and the Prime Minister should be set at reasonable multiples of an MP's allowance, said the WP.<br><br>The
               opposition party said that it is supportive of a variable component 
              which accounts for both national objectives achieved through a 
              whole-of-government effort, as well as the individual performance of 
              ministers.<br><br>While the suggested National Bonus incorporates some 
              indices, the WP said the formula should reflect that some national goals
               are longer-term in nature, requiring an assessment over the term of a 
              government and not annually, while some bonus payments may also need to 
              be deferred.<br><br>The WP also proposed doing away with the Annual 
              Variable Component, saying that this is unnecessary since there is 
              already a National Bonus based on national economic outcomes.<br><br>It said the sum of the total variable components should be capped at a reasonable number of months.<br><br>The
               WP also believes that the procedure for any review or change of the 
              salary structure for political office should be transparent and subject 
              to parliamentary approval.<br><br>The opposition party said its MPs will
               expand on the above proposals when Parliament debates on the motion to 
              adopt the Committee's recommendations on 16 January.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              <p>Who is Grace Fu?</p>
              <p>Grace Fu is the daughter of James Fu who was once a political detainee and later became press secretary to the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. James Fu was a reporter with the Sin Pao Press from 1955 to 1957. He then moved on to Nanyang Siang Pao and worked there for the next 5 years. In 1963, 111 people in Singapore were arrested under the ISA in a pre-dawn swoop now known as Operation Coldstore, after a meeting in Malaysia among PAP leaders, the British and the Federation. Amongst those arrested were Lim Chin Siong and James Fu.</p>
              <p>Grace Fu’s father was later released and joined Radio Television Singapore (RTS), the predecessor of current Mediacorp. He was promoted to become the Editor of RTS from 1966 to 1970. In 1972, he was appointed as Press Secretary to the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. And in 1980, he was promoted to Deputy Director of Information at the Minsitry of Culture, retiring from public life in 1993.</p>
              <p>Grace Fu graduated with a Bachelor of Accountancy (Hon) in 1985 and obtained a MBA from NUS in 1991. She began her career with the Overseas Union Bank as an auditor. After her MBA, she worked in various executive positions in the Haw Par Group.</p>
              <p>In Oct 1995, Grace Fu joined PSA Corporation as an Assistant Director of Finance. Three years later in Oct 1998, she became the Financial Controller of PSA Corporation and three months later in Jan 1999, she was promoted to the position of EVP of Finance. After another 3.5 years in May 2002, Grace Fu was promoted again to become the Deputy Group President (Corporate Services) and CFO of PSA Group. From Apr 2003 to 2006, she was appointed CEOs of subsidiaries within PSA Group.</p>
              <p>She left PSA and ran for politics under the PAP umbrella in 2006 General Election. She was elected as MP for Jurong GRC. On 1 August 2006, Grace Fu was appointed Minister of State for National Development and on 1 April 2008, she was promoted to Senior Minister of State, and was appointed in the Ministry of Education, concurrently with her appointment in the Ministry of National Development. Following her re-election in 2011, she was appointed Senior Minister of State in two ministries, the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.tremeritus.com/2012/01/07/the-grace-fu-saga/">http://www.tremeritus.com/2012/01/07/the-grace-fu-saga/</a></p>
              <p>Ms Fu was an ordinary performer in school and uni. Her first job was the result of former PSC Chairman Lee Heng Seng who was Deputy Chairman of OUB giving her a job. After a few years she moved on to Haw Par. All this nothing special. Then went to PSA and suddenly she must have gained additional grey cells and became a high flyer. Imagine when she first stood for Parliament in 2006, the PM stated in Fullerton Square that she will be appointed as MOS.</p>
              <p>Her father was the first card carrying communist to change sides after his arrest during Operations Cold Store and the first batch to be released. To attract others he was given a prominent position in Govt. He was in same cell as Jek Yuen Tong, former member of cabinet who crossed years before. What an irony She is now SMOS, Jek's son went to head MSD. New MPs Janil and Ong Ke Yung are both sons of ABL communist front hardcore brigade.</p>
              <p>Grace reminds me of Lim Boon Heng. She shared the story with the press and how she and her husband could not afford to buy a house after marriage and had to stay with her parents in their Palatial Bukit Timah House. What a sad story</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.sammyboy.com/showthread.php?107650-DIS-grace-fuL">http://www.sammyboy.com/showthread.php?107650-DIS-grace-fuL</a></p>
              <p>So Grace Fu is the third generation sons and daughters of those first generation PAP stalwarts. In line with the likes of Arthur Fong, Janil Puthucheary, Rin Tin Tin etc.</p>
              <p>All these people have connections - with the almighty Party, the govt-linked companies, the whose-who of the movers and shakers of Singapore.</p>
              <p>And here Singaporeans are conned into believing that this country is as meritocratic as it can be.</p>
              <p>And here these attas orang demand that we treat them special with $$$ because they are so talented as they claimed? - not connection, I say? </p>

              <p>If they have joined because of pay, then this pay cut will
              certainly hurt them. If you put yourselves in their shoes, eg they
              are using 50% of their salary to pay for some investments or
              properties and now they have to "scrimp and save"......anyone in
              that situation would be unhappy too.</p>
              <p>Anyway, this pay issue will still be a thorny one come 2016 GE.
