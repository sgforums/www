With all the ammunication of ISA and defamation suits, and knuckle dusters on on side and a bare lady finger on her, she has practically no chance in a jugular match. However she did at least stand up and be counted. Those who stood their ground are not many.</div>

By setting up firms here, chances of creating jobs will be higher. I hope this is right?<br><br>I believed that higher personal tax. Can be ranged, but to be fair, treated equally, make it same. Since the corporate tax is reduced. The government will be able to recover some from the personal tax.<br><br>The higher you earn, the more you paid after deducting all the items that you are allowed to claimed. Are you against this? I am willing to do so.<br><br>GST currently 5%, any increase will have direct impact on commoner. Do you wanted it. I would not encourage, cause I care for the commoners.<br><br>One may live in Nothingham forest, but he may not be that Robin Hood. Robin Hood is named by the commoners, not anyone can name himself as one. No offence.<br><br>Surprising, I am coming back to this topic.."Tian Shi, Di Li, Ren He"<br><br>Basic step..(Don't tell me reegan, don't give me bush) be rationale when you comments only if you lived here and singaporean.<br><br>Lower Corporate Tax - You don't come someone come. Door always opened to foreigner corporate and healthy for SME.<br><br>Higher Personal Tax - This will encourage the rich to fork out more. Foreigner loved singapore can pay more too. We loved singapore, let all love singapore together. Don't you.<br><br>Wages Packages - Never ask for reduce, high is good..I wouldn't wanted to see any possibilities of growing corrupted officers because he can't pay for his lexus or basic needs. On the basis, all must increase.<br><br>GST - leave it there, don't change it since already enforced.. Wrong / right doesn't matter..just carried on.<br><br>Progress Package - take some from the personal tax to give the poor and needys..(Needed no to give all, but real needys)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> I studied no much...but I am man milk feeded <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
