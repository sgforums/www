            <div class='col-md body'>If COE is used as a substitute to vehicle excise duty, as announced and there is no such gerryamndering to keep charging the punitive excise duty subsequently contrary to original announced intention, there will be nothing wrong with praising COE as the system to implement.<br><br>The point of contention is that minister who announced COE as the ultimately fairer way to price road usage did not keep his word. So I am asking whether ministers have the integrity or honesty in serving the people. Can we trust them with such responsibilities when they have signally failed to keep their words of honour as seen in this episode.<br><br>If indeed COE and subsequently ERP are the fairer way to solve our road congestion problem, then all the previously punitive taxes and fees including the vehicle excise duty it seeks to replace should be withdrawn and not by gerrymandering retained to increase revenues.<br><br>Whether any increases in govenment revenues will be put to good use to benefit the people in lowering the ever-increasing costs of living or doing business is any body's guess so do not give the optimistic view that they will go towards lowering taxes. Records of the government speaks for itself. Surpluses which the people contributed will be sunk in vote buying and all the prestigious projects which only look good from the outside. Wait till all see more GST and fee increases once election is over.<br><br>The point we are making here is that if minister has told parliament when COE was introduced that it is a fairer way to tax road usage to solve congestion problem, then he should mean what he said and not after COE was introduced to keep charging the very punitive vehicle excise duty. That is double taxation which is against humanity in any nations and by any human standards.<br><br>Such double taxation has been causing the costs of living of a large section of vehicle-dependent people to go up. This group of the population is by no means small. Do we have a caring government who will understand such problems - struggling with subsistence.<br><br>People can understand certain policies like COEs or even GST but it is the integrity and honesty of ministers we are concerned with now in this issue not whether COE was justified.<br><br>Double charging and wrongful and flawed executions and gerrymandering of the policies will cause major problems.<br><br>Some people tend to believe the government's assurance that higher taxes of certain people will help to lower taxes or lessen the people' cost burden. Is that assurance truthful on records. What has the govenment done to lower the costs of essential welfares and wellbeing and services. Basically the government does not use surpluses even in bad times as recommended by ex-President Ong Teng Cheong who finally was left very demoralised. So do not use such propaganda to keep practising anti-entrepreneurial and anti-progress tax-and-recover policies.<br><br>The yearly surpluses are not only enforced on government budget but every statutory board is making surpluses or breaking even. So people pay more and more the govenrment is getting richer and richer. Who will suffer at the end when the economy cannot grow being deprived of liquidity and vibrancy. How many people can understand such government policies are costing us jobs and loss of economic competitiveness?<br><br>The new leadership under PM Lee did not show it has set a more discernible objective to use surpluses to lower the costs of living such as by way of creating endowments from surpluses to lower high transportation and medical and utlity costs which easily take up 60% of household income of lower income earners.<br><br>So think again and do not keep saying things to further propaganda and gerrymandering by the ministers such as the saying - rob the rich to pay for the poor.<br><br>The ministers are not helping the poorer section of population as the essential services are taking up a high proportion of their income. So it is certainly untrue to believe them that they are robbing the rich to pay for the poor.<br><br>It is a fact that every sector of the economy is suffering the poor, the middle class and the rich as well. Our talents simply do not know what is the meaning of struggling for a living and by its actions the government is killing the goose that lays the golden egg.</div>

However, a heavy penalty (say 3 times the COE value) will be served to the owner of the 2nd / 3rd car and so on. That may also applied to carpark.
