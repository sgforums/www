              This post is not about Walter Woon. Rather its regarding how can a former AG who prosecute people is now the appeal judge siting on the high court hearing those very own cases he prosecuted in the past two years? Its like you are presiding on cases that you already been dealt with? Very strange lah...This AG to appeal judge role change. A total conflict of interest I think.

              Walter Woon to take over as A-G  
              By Ben Nadarajan and Chong Chee Kin

              SINGAPORE will get a new Attorney-General (AG) in Professor Walter Woon Cheong Ming from Friday. 
              The current Solicitor-General takes over the job as the country's top prosecutor from Mr Chao Hick Tin, who will return to the judiciary after a two-year tour as AG. 
              
              Prof Woon, who made his mark as a law academic, a Nominated Member of Parliament and as an envoy before becoming Solicitor-General, will be post-independence Singapore's fifth AG. 
              
              The AG's role is to be the Government's main legal advisor. He also decides which criminal cases to prosecute. 
              
              Mr Chao will resume his former post as a Judge of Appeal in the Supreme Court, making it a total of three Judges of Appeal on its roster. 
              
              The appointments were announced on Wednesday by the President, in concurrence with the advice of the Prime Minister. 
              
              Prof Woon's vacated position as Solicitor-General will be filled by Mrs Koh Kuat Jong, the current Supreme Court Registrar. 
              
              Prof Woon's legal career began with his being called to the Singapore Bar in 1985, four years after graduating from the National University of Singapore's law school with first class honours. He also holds a masters in law with first class honours from Cambridge. 
              
              Although credited with having written several books on law - the one on company law makes it to the reading lists of law students and lawyers - he has a colourful side as well, having authored crime novels and been a top school debator.
