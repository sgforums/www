            <div class='col-md body'><br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/discuss-singapore/message/17317<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/news_display.php?id=632<br>&gt;<br>&gt; More lies by local media on Chee<br>&gt; 5 November 2004<br>&gt; The Singapore media is clearly determined to stay at the bottom of<br>&gt; press freedom rankings.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Ms Sue-Ann Chia's report Chee `lied' about visits to avoid court<br>&gt; hearing (ST, 5 Nov 2004) could not be anymore slanted even if one<br>&gt; tried.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Ms Chia wrote that "The Taiwan visit [in February 2004] was missing<br>&gt; from Dr. Chee's sworn statement to the court in which he listed the<br>&gt; places he had visited between February and September."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What she omitted to report was that Dr Chee had told the court that<br>&gt; the date in question was 6 September 2004 during which the hearing<br>&gt; was held. Dr Chee had stopped in Taiwan enroute to the US for his<br>&gt; fellowship in February 2004. How was February relevant to the date in<br>&gt; question which was September? Ms Chia intentionally omitted Dr Chee's<br>&gt; reply to make it out that Dr. Chee had intentionally hidden this from<br>&gt; the public.<br><br>The line of argument is that there is a pattern of deception from Chee<br>as he did not explain in detail of his Taiwan "stopover", just covered<br>it as part of his fellowship as he said:<br><br>"Before I had left for the US for my fellowship, I had informed the<br>courts on 31 January 2004 that I would be away from February until<br>August 2004 and to postpone all matters regarding the case until my<br>return."<br><br>While Chee complained Singh was missing details, he did the same.<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; Dr Chee had also said that although the fellowship officially started<br>&gt; on 1 March 2004, he had to leave earlier to stopover in Taiwan (for<br>&gt; Dr Chee's wife to visit her parents and to break the journey up as it<br>&gt; was difficult for children to make the long journey in one go).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In addition he had to arrive in the US in advance in order to look<br>&gt; for housing, a school for the children, and other logistical<br>&gt; arrangements. All this may not be within the official fellowship<br>&gt; period by were certainly tasks that were related to the fellowship.<br>&gt; Of course, the local media again did not inform the public about this<br>&gt; matter.<br><br>How many days he spent in Taiwan and how many days he spent in US to<br>take care of these errants and other logistical arrangement? Why<br>missing these details?<br><br>To say that all these "may not be within the official fellowship<br>period" sound fishy. Are we talking about Chee's time was owned by<br>NED fellowship program 24X7 during the whole period. If not, then all<br>he need to do was work out some flex-hours with NED to swap some of<br>his office hours with his private hours. If his family stayed in<br>Spore, he would have avoided all these troubles.<br><br>It raise a question of the nature of his "gatecrashing" Mr Goh and Mr<br>Koo's conferences. Were those visits "within the official fellowship<br>period"? Was he acting on his own or on behave of NED?<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; Channel News Asia reported: "In actual fact, Dr Chee was on holiday<br>&gt; in Taiwan with his family." Dr Chee had explained that it was<br>&gt; impossible for him to leave his three children with his wife and in-<br>&gt; laws in Taiwan and return alone to Singapore as his in-laws were not<br>&gt; in the best of health. The report, of course, deliberately left out<br>&gt; Dr Chee's explanation.<br><br>From TODAY's report, a media in this "totalitarian" state did reort it:<br><br>Chee quizzed over priorities<br><br>Friday Â• November 5, 2004<br><br>Saying that his in-laws are not in good health, a visibly-agitated Dr<br>Chee, who was arguing his own defence, retorted that he could not<br>possibly leave his wife to take care of his three children Â— the<br>youngest one being only one month old.<br><br>But Mr Singh pointed to another trip that Dr Chee had made to Hong<br>Kong in August Â— which he failed to mention in his affidavit detailing<br>his travel history Â— and said: "Everything you've told us is so<br>dramatic ... But days after your baby was born, you flew to Hong Kong<br>to preach about democracy. You could leave the baby then and there was<br>no problem.<br><br>That was because his sister had helped look after his family when he<br>went to Hong Kong, Dr Chee argued.<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; This kind of journalism is what one would expect from totalitarian<br>&gt; states where the government chokes information flow, freedoms of<br>&gt; expression and justice in the country. But then again, nobody ever<br>&gt; disputed that Singapore was run by a dictatorship.<br></div>
