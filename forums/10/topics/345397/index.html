              <p><strong><span class="contentpagetitle"> Singapore's limits</span></strong></p>
              <p><em>The Wall Street Journal<br><br><strong>It's time to rethink the corporatist model.</strong><br></em><br>It's
              not often that a Singaporean official concedes the limits of the
              city-state's economic engineering. But the downturn is proving so
              severe that the Finance Minister said in yesterday's budget speech that
              the government's stimulus package "will not get us out of the
              recession," but rather "help avert an even sharper downturn."<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> That ought to be a wake-up call for Singapore, where government built a
              modern metropolis by hoarding its citizens' capital, plowing those
              savings into designated industries and opening itself up to foreign
              trade.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Yesterday's S$20.5 billion ($13.7 billion) package -- a whopping
              8% of GDP -- looks like past stimulus plans: a broad mix of supply-side
              measures to help businesses, public-sector spending and cash handouts
              to stave off social discontent. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What it doesn't acknowledge is that
              Singapore's growth model itself needs rethinking.</strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>The
              export-led economy is falling on its face.</strong></span> Minister Tharman
              Shanmugaratnam predicts the city-state is "likely to experience" the
              deepest recession in its history. The government will tap its reserves
              to help pay for the stimulus package. Growth contracted 16.9% in the
              fourth quarter last year.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Trade and Industry has
              revised down GDP forecasts twice this month already, and expects the
              city-state's growth to contract 2% to 5% this year. The pain is now
              leaking into the domestic economy as consumers retrench.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore's
              economy would be more resilient if it were better balanced. </strong></span>Consumption
              composes only about 40% of GDP -- far less than other developed Asian
              economies, nearer to 55%. Yesterday's budget doesn't do much to change
              long-term incentives to consume. The government announced a 20%
              income-tax rebate for one year, but no permanent cuts. Nor did it cut
              the 7% goods and services tax. Singaporean workers and businesses
              invest a total of 34.5% of wages into the state pension fund, but
              receive less than a 2% return from the government. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>That's a measly
              payout compared to what private funds return over long investment
              periods.</strong></span><br><br>The government could unleash more productive,
              sustainable growth by trimming back its public sector and allowing the
              economy to diversify on its own. Cutting the corporate tax to 17% from
              18%, as it announced yesterday, will help attract investment.</p>
              <p>But the
              city-state's bureaucrats have a habit of trying to pick winners, which
              sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. In recent years the bets have
              been on financial services, biotechnology and gambling. Yesterday's
              budget contained special tax incentives for the fund-management
              industry. Better to let private actors make those decisions based on
              market forces.<br><br>Mr. Tharman said yesterday that "no one knows how
              prolonged or deep this recession is going to be" and he pledged further
              measures to help if needed. The best help for Singaporeans would be
              expanded, permanent opportunities to work, save and invest with more of
              their own money, rather than relying on government to do it for them.<br><br><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123264905073306835.html#articleTabs%3Darticle"><em>http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123264905073306835.html#articleTabs%3Darticle</em></a></p>

                        at best 1 percent growth in 2009, at worst, minus 2 percent. I assume it
                        is the minus 2 percent figure that needs revision. </span></span></p>

                        revealed that we received 10.1 million <a name="return2"> visitors</a> in 2008,

                        hitting us through our exports and tourism, but it should also be noted
                        that of all the countries in Asia, we were the first to tip into a
                        recession. This happened when our third quarter shrank 6.8 percent from
                        the second, following the second quarter's 5.3 percent decline from the
                        first. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters in which the GDP

                        important, it is not the only kind of question we can ask. A different
                        question might also be worth pondering: Are we following the right
                        economic model?</span></span></p>

                        economic history, but equally, they are engineered through developmental
                        policy. Have they been the wisest moves?</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Consider this: We were the first Asian country to go into a recession,
                        and then, not slipping by one or two percent in the declining quarters,
                        but tumbling head over heels five, six and now twelve percentage points,
                        as mentioned above.</span></span></p>

                        economic performance, while not bad overall, has tended to booms and
                        busts. We've had two busts in the last decade and we're now into our
                        third. It feels like we're riding rodeo.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">I sometimes wonder how much of that is due to the way our economy is
                        structured. A large percentage of Singaporeans produce goods and services
                        for export; we do not produce for our domestic needs. Instead we import
                        just about everything we need. Look around your own home -- from the corn
                        flakes to the TV set, to the shampoo. Look too at the nationality of your
                        domestic maid, if you have one, or the guy who is sweeping the void deck
                        at 6 a.m. in the morning. (Yes, our town councils insist that municipal
                        workers must wake up at that unearthly hour to do cleaning -- why, I have
                        no idea.)</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">We earn money from abroad and we basically spend our money buying
                        things and services from aboard. We are therefore highly exposed.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">But if our economy were slightly different, and more of us were
                        producing and consuming domestically, we'd be a bit better cushioned.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Let me give you a simpler, layman's example. Take a household where all
                        adults go out to work and earn cash. None of them looks after the kids,
                        cooks, does the laundry or cleans the house. Paid help comes in to do
                        these things. In fact, no adult family member even knows how to cook,
                        change diapers, mop the floor or wash clothes.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Everything's hunky-dory so long as the outside jobs are good and
                        highly paid, but the moment the jobs disappear and cashflow dries up,
                        the adults are stuck. They still have to pay the maid, cook, cleaner,
                        gardener and washerwoman, not to mention the plumber, electrician and
                        housepainter, because they don't have the ability to do any of these tasks
                        themselves. If they don't keep the help, they go hungry and unwashed, so
                        they have to retain the "imports". This is a household that can
                        go from plenty to broke.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Take another household. Some adults go out to work, but they decide
                        that one or two should stay at home to raise the kids, cook meals, do the
                        laundry etc. In addition, they grow their own vegetables in the little
                        plot of land they have, or maintain an aquaponics garden on their balcony.
                        The situation still gets bad if outside jobs disappear, but at least meals
                        continue to be cooked, the children are bathed, the clothes washed and mended.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Which household do you think Singapore resembles?</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p>Our domestic economy is very weak and we have become too reliant on our
                        export economy. Doubtless, our government will say that this cannot be
                        helped, since Singapore is so small. We don't have the economies of scale
                        to produce things for ourselves. And protectionism is no cure.</p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">This is too glib. While indeed, we can never be as self-reliant as big
                        countries are, I think there have been three policy "old faithfuls"
                        that have contributed to the way things are and may need to be reexamined.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> <br> <strong>Investing in the export-oriented sector, neglecting the
                        domestically-oriented sectors</strong></span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">The first is that we have consciously directed our investments at
                        export-producing industries. And by investments, I mean investments in
                        people as well. The technicians we train from among Singaporeans end up
                        working in multi-nationals' (MNCs') factories. The technicians who come to fix our
                        air-conditioner at home are from Myanmar. Why is that?</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">MNCs are treated royally when they locate here. They get all sorts of
                        grants and research support. Local enterprises geared for the local market
                        are, relatively speaking, starved of assistance, propagandistic news
                        headlines notwithstanding. Over the years, one side thrives, the other
                        side struggles and is eventually replaced by imports.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Widening income gap reduces
                        domestic consumption, constraining market for domestically-oriented
                        industries</strong></span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">The second factor is the income gap that we have allowed to widen. It
                        is a well-known fact that rich people save more than poorer ones. Not only
                        that, when they do spend, they spend proportionately more on luxuries,
                        which must be imported brand names to have any cachet.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">The result is that domestic consumption is kept down in favour of
                        either money stashed away in bank accounts by those who have loads of
                        them, or spent on BMWs and cooking lessons at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris. When domestic
                        consumption is kept down, the industries that supply this side of the
                        economy tend to wither.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> <br> <strong>Star-struck by economic fads</strong></span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">The third "old faithful" is our tendency to chase the latest
                        economic fad in an attempt to maximise our external income. When IT was
                        the rage, we put all our eggs in that basket. Then it was bioscience. More
                        recently, when financial wizardry was in fashion, we let it nearly
                        dominate our economy, and referenced the obscene salaries in that industry
                        as our benchmarks. Each has led to grief.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">But how else to grow fast unless we ride with the latest trends? What's
                        wrong with hitching ourselves to the growth engines of the
                        day?</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">They problem may well be that these
                        "growth engines" tend to be bubbles. That's why they
                        grow (inflate) the way they do. Why are we so starry-eyed? This
                        characteristic may be why our economy goes into booms and busts.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">At no point am I advocating protectionism, which is the raising of
                        barriers to imports, investment or even the movement of people with
                        skills. The question I pose shouldn't be reduced to a simple yes/no
                        question of resorting to protectionism or not. The question is: Have we
                        deliberately pursued for years a policy of domestic disinvestment, in our
                        vain effort to be a high-flyer?  <img src="http://www.yawningbread.org/images/bar_red.gif" border="0" alt="" width="4" height="12" align="bottom"></span></span></p>

              <p>Meh.. I have argued with God Knows how many fuckers that we need to have a more balanced economy. They always give the same refrain: We are too small! Have they ever fucking decided to try think beyond that? Nyet. They just go on and on about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, good luck to them. Our economy is going down the shit hole, and even companies like Intel is closing down factories. Intel shut down 2 factories (or something) in Penang. We are soo... screwed. Not even all the help the government give in this budget will do us any good if they don't address the root cause of hte problem.</p>
              <p>And very few fuckers think about the implications of the CPF system. It is a tax, and no less a tax. Tehy will return money, but it is still a <em>lost opportunity cost</em>! To use the proper economics word. Oh well, we reap, what we sow.</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The reason Singapore is doing so badly, </span>triggered by the US crisis, no doubt (but anything could have triggered it as the economy was sitting on a time bomb anyway) because the despots are greedy, bent on controlling the economy and doing business so as to "legally" siphon public money into their own pockets and enable them <span style="color: #ff0000;">to feed their cronies and dogs that is licking their asshole and tasting their sh!t.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
