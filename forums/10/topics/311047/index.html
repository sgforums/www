              <p>It does not take much to be a financial genius these days. Just accept as bible what Warren Buffet, George Soros, Alan Greenspan and now Jim Roger say .... and u will have the whole world's professionals in Finance &amp; Investment dancing to your tune and doing exactly what u want them to do. Incidentally these same people mentioned here made their billions on Wall Street ..... and Wall Street was the cause of the Great Depression in the 30's, the Asian Financial Crisis in 1998 and today Wall Street's present to the world is the Subprime 'woes'. While the rest of world reel from all these Wall Street's efforts to 'beggar' the rest of the world, Wall Street Ceos still enjoying big salaries and fat bonuses while their companies are 'drowning' from mistakes they make ... all at the expense of their naive and stupid shareholders.</p>

              <p>lionnoisy in sgforums since May 2005. <span style="color: #ff0000;">he cant use proper English for 34 months</span>!!.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PM Lee told pple like lionnoisy to buck up, but he still dunt can. In world class country is dis acceptable?</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.goodenglish.org.sg/site/">http://www.goodenglish.org.sg/site/</a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig6/rogers1.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-large; color: #ff0000;">S</span>INGAPOREANS should strive to speak proper English and stop peppering daily conversations with local expressions if they want to keep their competitive edge, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Friday, May 13.</p>
              <p>"Speak in full sentences, with proper sentences and cutting out all the '<em>lars</em>' and <em>lors</em>' at the end of each sentence," Lee said at the launch of the city-state's fifth annual "Speak Good English" campaign.</p>
              <p>The Cambridge-educated Lee said that, with three-quarters of Singapore's population English literate, the republic has significant competitive advantages over other Asian nations.</p>
              <p>"It is important for all of us to speak good English, because English has become the lingua franca of international commerce," he said. "English is our bridge to the world and helps Singapore to maximise our opportunities."</p>
              <p>Singaporeans speaking colloquial English will often end sentences with '<em>lah</em>', '<em>lor</em>' or '<em>mah</em>' -- suffixes derived from local Chinese dialects.</p>
              <p>They may also literally translate sentences from Mandarin to English, resulting in odd and grammatically incorrect phrases such as 'I go toilet' and 'You go where, ah?' -- when they actually mean 'Where are you going?'</p>
              <p>'Talk cock, sing song, play mahjong,' means idle talk.</p>
              <p>Children who quarrel are often heard to threaten each other with the words 'I don't friend you!', meaning 'You're not my friend anymore!'</p>
              <p>Singlish (Singapore English) also features terms like "<em>kiasu</em>" (being afraid to lose) and<em> "wowo king"</em> (someone who cannot fire a rifle straight).</p>
              <p>Lee also made special mention of text-messaging English, which is used by many of the city-state's handphone-crazy youngsters, saying it may affect the way they learn how to spell.</p>
              <p>In text-message lingo, 'that' is spelled 'dat', 'i see' becomes 'ic' and 'ttyl' means 'talk to you later'.</p>
              <p>"When our English becomes too mutated, we become unintelligible to others," Lee said. "We then have a big problem."</p>
              <p>Lee suggested establishing proper English as a service standard at the workplace and urged all teachers and parents to be ambassadors of good spoken English.</p>
              <p>Singapore, a former British colony, is host to thousands of multinational corporations and implements an annual campaign for citizens to speak proper English to keep its competitive edge.</p>

              <p><br>No one in the world could disagree with you.</p>
              <p>Just an example of those who choose to stay here.</p>
              <p>How about showing examples of those who resigned from this island?</p>
              <p>Those with eyes and some kind of IQ can understand that a billionaire can choose to migrate to anywhere he chooses because the world , this world, is based on Money. If you have 1 billion, there is no place where you cannot feel powerful.</p>
              <p>Money rules the world.</p>
              <p>A Billionaire can retire in any place that is rising in cost and that is already very costly. 'Costly' to common people who are employees. Even if costly to Employers who are just mere millionaires, it is still cheap to a BILLIONAIRE.</p>
              <p>So few are billionaires.</p>
              <p>Its quite unconvincing an example.</p>
