              <p>I mean the western world always had a superiority complex ever since the ancient times.</p>
              <p>could the fincial crisis be a deliberate attempt? There are a few people who have great amounts of influence on the world to set off a global chain reaction. The world can be a dark place</p>

              <p>I am interested in many conspiracy theories but not this one.</p>
              <p>I believe the West does not want to see the rise of Asia, especially China, but they have no reasons to engineer a crisis, which appears to threaten their superiority themselves.</p>
              <p>You know what, I know a British senior, who came to spend his retirement life in Thailand. He said that people in Britain are losing their home. British banks are shaky. Many British savers (he is one of them), who have avoided investing a penny in stocks and lived frugal for all their lives, are also finding themselves in danger because the interest rate there is heading towards 0. He also fears that he might be losing tenants renting his house in London if people there keep losing jobs non-stop. Pound Sterling has dropped 30% against Thai Baht. His passive income sources are being threatened. This is a very dangerous situation for the British because once they need to withdraw their principle, that means the country is on the brink of bankruptcy.</p>
              <p>I understand that in Asia Singapore is taking the hardest hit because it is the most open economy, which depends heavily on banking and services industries, export, and foreign trade. It has no agricultural sector. Moreover, 2 of your SWFs have made big losses from investment in countries that are the epicentres of this crisis.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, the West has no reasons to engineer this crisis.</p>

              <p>I believe the west has no ability to organise such a crisis.  It's simply not possible to orchestrate such a grand scheme.  Even if it was possible, such organisational skills would be better spent creating a formidable 'West'.  And while we're at it, isn't the 'West' most affected?</p>
              <p>Worldy, are you confusing the West with the USA?  They're not the same you know.</p>

              <p><br>Is it not obvious that the 'winners' were those - who were paid 'the Million Dollar' salaries, and 'hundreds of Millions of Dollars' in bonuses PLUS all the perks of the office that they held ?</p>
              <p>All of these 'super talents' who dreamed up new programmes that will disguise the losses from this mismanagement, and change these into new opportunities that bolstered the image of their invincible super talents.</p>
              <p>The arrogance of these super talented personalities will find each other out across the globe - like maggots attracted to the same leftover meat.</p>
              <p>The seller making so little effort to sell their programs to the eager buyer - anxious to justify the confidence given irregardless of the fiduciary responsibilities and expected diligence required of the position.</p>
              <p>The decision to accept the offers are so easily made from all the made-up data that have been presented in glossy brochures, impressive numbers, and the high profile publicity carefully crafted of the Company's image.</p>
              <p>Can anything go wrong ?</p>
              <p>Is this the creation of the West ?</p>
              <p>Or is this the creation of some financial criminals, who are no better than the bank robber ?</p>
              <p>In the past, Directors who do not fulfill their fiduciary roles with diligence have been prosecuted for causing the loss of the funds that have been entrusted to their care.</p>
              <p>Should we not hold these Directors for the losses of millions that belonged to so many individuals ?</p>

              <p>I forgot to also elaborate that the debts that I was talking about are debt/gross income(GDP) and household debt.</p>
              <p>A nation is comparable to an individual. The more debts, the harder one can dig oneself out of the rubble. The more the money one saves, the higher the chance one will survive the rainy days.</p>

              world?</p>
              <p>I mean the western world always had a superiority complex ever
              since the ancient times.</p>
              <p>could the fincial crisis be a deliberate attempt? There are a
              few people who have great amounts of influence on the world to set
              off a global chain reaction. The world can be a dark place</p>

              <p>I am interested in many conspiracy theories but not this one.</p>
              <p>I believe the West does not want to see the rise of Asia, especially China, but they have no reasons to engineer a crisis, which appears to threaten their superiority themselves.</p>
              <p>You know what, I know a British senior, who came to spend his retirement life in Thailand. He said that people in Britain are losing their home. British banks are shaky. Many British savers (he is one of them), who have avoided investing a penny in stocks and lived frugal for all their lives, are also finding themselves in danger because the interest rate there is heading towards 0. He also fears that he might be losing tenants renting his house in London if people there keep losing jobs non-stop. Pound Sterling has dropped 30% against Thai Baht. His passive income sources are being threatened. This is a very dangerous situation for the British because once they need to withdraw their principle, that means the country is on the brink of bankruptcy.</p>
              <p>I understand that in Asia Singapore is taking the hardest hit because it is the most open economy, which depends heavily on banking and services industries, export, and foreign trade. It has no agricultural sector. Moreover, 2 of your SWFs have made big losses from investment in countries that are the epicentres of this crisis.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, the West has no reasons to engineer this crisis.</p>

              <p><br>Actually i wouldn't be surprised if some of them thought they could pull this off to hurt the growth of Asia.</p>
              <p>But  i suspect that they severely underestimated the actual tsunami. Perhaps the bankers really did thought they could buy in assets for cheap by precipitating this crisis.</p>
