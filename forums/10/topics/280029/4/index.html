Therefore, taxis are less utilized, and this results in a higher profit per trip.<br><br>Coming back to petrol. 1.55 euros is ok what, here in Singapore, the price is 1.8+ or 1.9+. I heard it also hit $2 before. But yes, they probably travel further distances, so it will cost them more as they utilize more petrol.<br><br>Housing-wise, whether Germany has more land or not is secondary. The fact remains about the price.<br><br>In Singapore, HDB flat prices are artificially inflated by the HDB. Per unit cost can never be more than 50k I believe, but yet, they are charging at 100k+ to 300k+ or 400k+, depending on the size of the unit.</div></blockquote>I forgot to add this point above.<br><br>If I were to compare housing prices, I would compare Singapore to that of Hong Kong's, not Germany's.
