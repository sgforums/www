And of course that impact on your performance.<br><br>Back in my time in a local MNC, everyone is competing to see who will win "most no-life person award", by staying as late as they can in the office. Burning your weekends, the management will keep REALLY quiet and most don't even dare to ask for off-in-lieu.<br><br>Now, my life is better, in a US MNC, I get the flexibility to work anywhere as I am mobile, so I can go home on time. Of coz, if there are issues, I will get online from home to resolve them. But its a small price to pay to get rid of that stupid mentality of having people sit there from morning to night. I get off-in-lieus for OTs and working on weekends, so in that sense, I am lucky.<br><br>A local transport company interviewers told my friend that the official working hours are 8am to 5.30pm, but they expect her to leave the office no earlier than 8pm most days. Needless to say, my friend rejected the offer, and I hear that there is a high turnaround for that particular company.<br><br>A certain cooperative has in their contract stated terms in the line of "It is normal for you to sacrifice your weekends, and public holidays, and work OT, and you are not entitled to claiming off-in-lieu if you need to perform the sacrifice"<br></div>
