Chances are, there's a clause whereby it allows the company to terminate your service without any valid reason so long as it gives you 1 month notice in advance. (This clause has a serious implication, in that a company can terminate you even if you are a good performer, so long as it gives a month's notice)<br><br>The above are just comparisons of what I have gathered so far.<br><br></div>

I have ex colleagues who for no good reason were asked to leave.  When I was on attachment there, I worked with these 2 people and I find them kind and helpful and good in their work, unfortunately the nasty doctors and staff in SGH love to bully them.  SGH got rid of them immediately by paying them one month's pay without reason.  One of the despots who was responsible for this is old man lky's doctor.   This despot is despicable to get what he wants.  This despot judge people how much he likes the look of the persons.   He was trying so hard to get rid of this staff ever since he joined SGH.  SGH works like the ruling party, they are closely related to PAP.</div>
