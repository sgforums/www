Most of the items sold are junklets, garments, airline travel services; and seldom of the variety such as general stores like 7-Eleven and Cheers which are located at above-ground stations.<br><br>Nothing is available for anyone in a hurry to grab a quick bite or a drink, which are such a common sight in the many modern subway stations in Germany.<br><br>This no food and no drink approach is due to SMRT paranoia to the possibility of rats being bred in the underground system, as if the rats will not find its way into the warm labyrinth of the cavenous tunnels.<br><br></span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think that SMRT indeed has a duty-of-care towards the renters. But since SMRT dod not 'force' anyone of them to rent the space, the renters must somehow be a little more responsible. For eg. I tend to see so many shops selling the same stuff clustered together (i call it the buddle-tea syndrome), so how can all of them survive chasing that few customers?<br><br>maybe this setback will make our small-time business-people smarter: always be that little bit different in your business/service so that you stand out from the crowd, rather than competing with them using the exact same stretagies.</div>
