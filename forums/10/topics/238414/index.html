            <div class='col-md body'>Excellent point! I wonder how those fervent China-bashers would respond to this observation. The West is clearly singling China out. It does not matter that India is developing its nuclear weaponry. It does not matter that Japan is expanding its military prowess exponentially. It does not matter that the US has its military base in S Korea, Japan, the Phillipines and other "ally countires". But if China makes any move to beef itself up militarily, bang! they start to point fingers, condemn and demand explanation!!! God I am so sick of this hypocrisy. And yet some unthinking imbeciles do not hesitate to join the US in pointing fingers at China. Maybe they have a slavish mentality that whatever the West says must be right and therefore must be embraced wholly.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by chiabaliao:</div><div class="quote_body">That's hardly a fact but a western political agenda.<span style="color: red;"> They let off India so lightly. </span>China never spurned anything to do it right.

            <div class='col-md body'>@dreamerb:<br><br>i am from europe and i can say this.   the "west" like u say, is pointing fingers at china because.....they haven't learned anything from the "western problems"<br><br>it is true that the west is the main polluter but. it's the thinking that counts.<br><br>which means.   at the "rising time" of the west, there were no alternatives to polluting the enivonment, because the technology wasn't advanced enough.<br><br>now, 50 years later, the technology is aviable to avoid environmental polluting.<br><br>and the European Union will use them.   I am not sure about the US, but i think, after they have seen what the global warming can do to their country, they will use them too.<br><br>The main reason, why the western countries are "pointing fingers" at china (how u call it)   is, because china will grow "at any cost" (like "the bear" said) .<br><br>they dont even think about using new technology. that is the main reason.<br><br>it's true that china has a "right" to pollute, because western countries does that for many years, but think about this.<br><br>china is more than 3-4 times larger than the usa. and the main reason that western countries are trining to stop china from polluting is.   the usa is the main polluter now, but china will be in the future. and chinas pollution will be much greater than everything the us has done so far.   and if china do not stop NOW, it will be too late in a few years because environmental pollution cannot be "undone".<br><br>china has to stop when its pollution is lower than that of the us or it will be too late for the world.<br><br>for example..i have seen movies of green water in china. the humans are getting sick of drinking this water.    show me even ONE green water in europe or the us.  this example alone shows that china has to do something about their pollution.<br><br></div>
