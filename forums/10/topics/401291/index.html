              <p>During the recent China-Japan-South Korea summit at Jeju island, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao expressed his support for the eventual unification of the two Koreas when South Korea President Lee Myung-bak said his country’s goal is to get North Korea to open up its economy and strive toward peaceful reunification through that process.</p>
              <p>Wen’s pledge of support seems to contradict China’s official policy towards North Korea regime which has been on Chinese life-support for over a decade since a series of famines wrecked the economy of the Stalinist state in the 1990s.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-27430  aligncenter" title="northkorea" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/northkorea.jpg" alt="northkorea" width="557" height="375"></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Above: North Koreans pay their respect to their “Great Leader” Kim Il-Sung whose statue towers over the capital Pyongyang.</em></p>
              <p>Without China’s generous aid and support, Pyongyang would grow increasingly dependent on South Korea thereby paving the way for eventual dialogue and reunification between the two sides.</p>
              <p>The rising tension in the Korean peninsula today is caused partly by China’s reluctance to rein in the excesses of North Korea from its blatant refusal to return to the six-party talks and its periodic schizophrenic outbursts against the south.</p>
              <p>Despite evidence pointing to North Korea’s involvement in the sinking of the South Korean corvette “Cheonan”, China has refused to express a clear stance in the matter, calling for both parties to “exercise restraint”.</p>
              <p>A few days earlier, the North’s “Dear Leader’ Kim Jong-IL had travelled to Beijing probably to secure economic assistance from China again after its botched currency reform in the beginning of the year.</p>
              <p>China’s undivided loyalty to its communist ally is a crucial factor in keeping the latter from a much feared self-implosion which would have accelerated the pace of re-unification.</p>
              <p>A paper published in May by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington DC, written by two American academics, Bonnie Glaser and Scott Snyder, details the possible consequences in the event of a regime collapse in North korea: refugees pouring into China and South Korea, insecure weapons of mass destruction and the threat of uncoordinated military actions taken in North Korea by South Korea, China and America.</p>
              <p>Though it was never mentioned publicly, few leaders in Beijing would relish the prospect of a unified Korea right on China’s doorsteps which would disrupt the power-balance in Northeast Asia.</p>
              <p>China prefers to have a weak North Korea perennially dependent on it for handouts as a neighbor and a buffer against the prosperous South and its American ally rather than a unified Korean nation which is both economically and militarily strong.</p>
              <p>In less than five decades, South Korea managed to recover from the destruction brought about by the Korean War and transformed itself into an economic powerhouse in the world.</p>
              <p>If South Korea were to unite with the North, it would come to the possession of a one-million strong army and a nuclear arsenal, a scenario which Beijing will want to pre-empt from occuring.</p>
              <p>China’s innermost fears and insecurities of the reunification of Korea and the subsequent emergence of a strong Korean state stem partly from historical rivalry and animosities between the two nations.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-27431  aligncenter" title="goguryeomap" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/goguryeomap.png" alt="goguryeomap" width="309" height="419"></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Above: At the height of its power, Gorguryeo occupied two-thirds of the Korean peninsula and large chunks of Manchuria including today’s Liaoning and Jilin provinces in China. Korea’s English name is derived from Gorguryeo.</em></p>
              <p>In the first millenium, China was in constant conflict with two powerful Korean states on its northeastern frontier. The Sui dynasty fought three disastrous wars with the Korean kingdom of Gorguryeo which eventually led to its downfall.</p>
              <p>The succeeding Tang dynasty only managed to conquer Gorguryeo after three unsuccessful attempts with the loss of millions of lives. Even then, its attempt to govern the Korean peninsula was short-lived with another Korean state Balhae emerging from the ruins of Gorguryeo to challenge its supremacy in the Northeast.</p>
              <p>The relationship between the two countries only start to normalize during the Joseon dynasty when Korea effectively became a vassal state of the Ming dynasty after it relinquished all claims to the lands north of the Yalu river.</p>
              <p>China’s northeast is home to a significant number of ethnic Koreans, most of them residing in the Yanbian autonomous county bordering North Korea.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-27428  aligncenter" title="yanji" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/yanji.jpg" alt="yanji" width="400" height="282"></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Above: The Chinese city of Yanji near North Korea. Notice that the road signs are in both Chinese and Korean as mandated under the city’s law.</em></p>
              <p>While a rising proportion of the Korean population has been effectively sinicized over the years thanks to some shrewd government policies, the situation may change with a prosperous Korea as its neighbor rather than the present improverished North.</p>
              <p>Increased exchange between the two sides may spark off separatist tendencies in areas with a Korean majority such as the “Gando” corridor which is still viewed by some Korean historians as an inseparable part of Korea.</p>
              <p>Many Korean heritage sites and relics are found there such as the famous Goguryeo wall murals and the Gwanggaeto Steele in the border town of Ji’an along the Tumen river.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-27429  aligncenter" title="goguryeomural" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/goguryeomural.jpg" alt="goguryeomural" width="500" height="210"></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Above: The famous Gorguryeo wall murals found in Ji’an, Jilin province. Ji’an was a former capital of the Korean kingdom of Gorguryeo, known then as Guknae.</em></p>
              <p>With trouble brewing in Tibet and Xinjiang, Beijing will not risk starting a fire in its own backyard especially when the three northeast provinces have been ear-marked for economic development as part of a greater plan to revive China’s industrial dustbelt. </p>
              <p>A weak and dependent North Korea will not only help to secure its own borders, but will come in handy as a useful pawn to check on South Korea as well in order to maintain the strategic equilibrium in Northeast Asia.</p>

              <p>the answer here is simple, if China agreed to a united korea, game over liao.

              <p>Yes partially right....</p>
              <p>The perspective of China learned from the WWII is slightly different than the rest of S.E.A. and Western countries.  It actually goes much deeper than 1941. Perharps it goes as far as 1894 where Japanese soldier defeated Chinese resistance at pyongyang.</p>
              <p>2nd World War in the Far East was not One War, But Two Wars. </p>
              <p>China view the war started in 1931 - 1937. As compared to Dec 1941. Japanese offiensive against Manchuria. 1931- 32, Thereafter encroachment onto China Terroritory and fought all the way until Japanese surrender.</p>

              <p>I find the article perspective perhaps narrow views on China.</p>
              <p>If you read todays paper you See WEN JIABO has his picture taken with the General of Myanmar Military Junta. Who now has been accused of collaborating with North Korea on Nukes.</p>
              <p>Whats more coincidentally today is the first day of Defence Dialogue in Singapore. A symbolic and timely message well intended for its audience.</p>
              <p>China continue to view Myanmar as its strategic position since WWII where supplies were brought into China thru Burma to fought against Japanese.</p>

              <p>By 1950 international recognition of the Communist government had increased considerably, but it was slowed by China's involvement in the Korean War. In October 1950, sensing a threat to the industrial heartland in northeast China from the advancing United Nations (UN) forces in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), units of the PLA--calling themselves the Chinese People's Volunteers--crossed the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">YaluJiang River</span></strong> into <strong>North Korea in response to a North Korean request for aid. </strong>Almost simultaneously the PLA forces also marched into Xizang <strong>to reassert Chinese sovereignty over a region that had been in effect independent of Chinese rule </strong>since the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">However, I admire the South Koreans' desire to reunite with North Korea even though many of their relatives and friends were slaughtered mercilessly by their northern counterparts during the Korean War.<span>  </span>This is unlike the attitude and behavior of the Chinese descendants in Taiwan.</span></p>

              <p>VIDEO North Korean refugees in China’s Yanbian autonomous county</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>

The situation in North Korea is likely to be worse now following its botched currency reform in January this year. China regards the North Korean refugees as economic migrants and deny the United Nations High Commission for Refugees access to them, more than 70 percent of whom are women.</p>

              <p><strong>By Takashi Yokota from Newsweek</strong></p>
              <p>The two Koreas seemed headed for a dangerous collision ever since international investigators determined that North Korea had torpedoed its Southern neighbor’s warship Cheonan.</p>
              <p>The North’s National Defence Commission called the investigations a “farce” and threatened “all-out war” if Seoul and the international community imposed sanctions.</p>
              <p>South Korean President Lee Myung-bak responded by promising to push for sanctions at the United Nations, to cut off trade with the North, and to resume anti-North propaganda along the demilitarized zone. Adding to the alarm, four North Korean submarines left a naval base along the Sea of Japan, putting the South Korean Navy on high alert.</p>
              <p>This fracas may not be all it seems, however; because North Korean leader Kim Jong-il seems to be seeking a face-saving way out.</p>
              <p>Even as the North’s fire-breathing generals threatened war, the political leadership is adopting a more diplomatic, if not quite conciliatory, tone.</p>
              <p>The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, which claimed to be speaking on behalf of the entire government, said it would react to sanctions by freezing inter-Korean relations, as well as scrapping the North-South non-aggression agreement.</p>
              <p>The Foreign Ministry also issued a statement dedicated mostly to blasting the United States, but ending with a claim that its broad aim remains to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.</p>
              <p>Translation: the softer side of Kim Jong-Il’s regime wants out of this mess.</p>
              <p>Seoul, which wants to ease tensions before hosting the G20 summit this fall, made sure to offer the North a way out. In his statement, Lee demanded that Pyongyang “apologize and punish those responsible for the attack,” laying down relatively easy terms for the North to resolve the conflict.</p>
              <p>Pyongyang may be preparing to comply. Even before the North was officially blamed for sinking the Cheonan, the National Defence Commission dimissed Kim Il-chol, its highest-ranking naval officer, citing his “old age.”</p>
              <p>Kim is said to be in his late 70s, but so are many commission members. Observers speculate that Pyongyang may cite Kim’s dismissal to claim it has already punished the man responsible, and perhaps to set the stage of an apology.</p>
              <p>Kenneth Quinones, a former State Department negotiator and a Korean expert, says a “similar dynamic” guided North Korea’s response when one of its submarines infiltrated South Korean territorial waters in 1996.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, moderate elements in Pyongyang persuaded the military hardliners to apologize. And Pyongyang’s declaration that it will no longer deal with the South while Lee is in office may be read as a call to China to step in and mediate.</p>
              <p>Far from escalating, says Quinones, Pyongyang officials “seem to be trying to keep some hope open for negotiations.”</p>
              <p>As long Kim can do so without looking weak, he seems to be serious about finding a way out.</p>
