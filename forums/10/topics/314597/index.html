              <p>I was wondering and seriously pondering, to what an extent are our local universities biased towards foreigners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yesterday, while walking along a sheltered connector towards the canteen, I encountered a huge jam of human flow in the front. It was later that I found out that a group of PRC students are holding a signature petition rally for the Beijing 2008. There was this China student parading abt waving a full sized PRC flag, while the other student was holding a large plank card with writings, of support Beijing 2008 and stop western media from demonising PRC. Some other of their compatroits are manning the signature books........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was wondering, why did the university allow such events to be held? Last time, when the student union wanted to conduct similar signature gathering on banner, to protest against the increase in tution fees, the school step in immediately and stop the union from doing so. Emails were also sent to threaten the students of the consequences of participating. The sch used the execuse that such event may cause public nuisance, and may cause public disorder. So the PRC students waving the flag, blocking the walk way is not a nuisance? Besides, considering the sch have quite a number of western nation students, what if a scuffle broke out between them and the PRC students? Isn't such things a cause of concern? Lastly, if a student is to hold a "Pro-Tibet" rally, will the sch approve of this?........... </p>

But look at it this way, the campus security was having his meal in the canteen and has the full view of the entire event, he did not go and stop them. They were still having the rally, when I came out of the library 4 hrs later. Considering how fast the sch clamp down on students from criticisng the sch with regards to tution fees, no price for guessing whether they got a permit. Besides, all events are govern by the student union headed by lecturers as adviser. So the only way for them to hold such events without being shoo-ed away, is to get a permit......</p></div>

              <p>That's what I'm try to said......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the School OK-ed the PRCs students..... then indeed it is a case of double standard. If they did not even knows about it..... then it could be a case of slow action.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the part that " The campus security was having his meal in the canteen"...... I'm not too sure how well the campus security is being paid..... but I'm sure I wouldn't want to waste my own break time unless my Boss demand that I break-up the gathering.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its a simple case of "worker bee" thinking.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) I break-up the gathering on my own -</p>
              <p>Pro - Nothing happens.... the PRCs go away, I make a report, my Boss file the report.... lifes goes on.</p>
              <p>Con - PRCs students decided to make a bigger protest.... even pull in the Chinese Embassy into the matter.... my Boss need someone's head to drop..... guess who's Head will that be <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif">..... Ohh.... and I miss my meal break. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Pretend I didn't see anything......</p>
              <p>Pro - Still get the same pay without doing extra job.....</p>
              <p>Con - If my Boss wants me to break-up the gathering..... Have to do extra..... <strong><em>But at least the Boss will answer to his Boss</em></strong>..... my lifes goes on.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If any here thinks this is no possible...... <strong>THINK AGAIN</strong>..... this is how 85-90% of low paid worker behave at work...... which include ME..... if my Boss pretend to paid me.... do you think I would want to work extra <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> </p>

              <p>Therefore it is safe to said that if any Pro-Beijing 2008 gathering is not stopped..... Anti-Beijing 2008 gathering could start as well..... destorying the harmony of all international students in the School.....</p>

              <p>And if like you said earlier....

              <p>Fully agree. Singaporean youths are apathetic to anything like that. Afterall, their family can afford hike in school fees, they are only interested in graduating and get a good job....if things don't go well, then they either come to this forum and kpkb or migrate to australia.</p>

              <p>I was wondering and seriously pondering, to what an extent are
              our local universities biased towards foreigners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yesterday, while walking along a sheltered connector towards the
              canteen, I encountered a huge jam of human flow in the front. It
              was later that I found out that a group of PRC students are holding
              a signature petition rally for the Beijing 2008. There was this
              China student parading abt waving a full sized PRC flag, while the
              other student was holding a large plank card with writings, of
              support Beijing 2008 and stop western media from demonising PRC.
              Some other of their compatroits are manning the signature
              books........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was wondering, why did the university allow such events to be
              held? Last time, when the student union wanted to conduct similar
              signature gathering on banner, to protest against the increase in
              tution fees, the school step in immediately and stop the union from
              doing so. Emails were also sent to threaten the students of the
              consequences of participating. The sch used the execuse that such
              event may cause public nuisance, and may cause public disorder. So
              the PRC students waving the flag, blocking the walk way is not a
              nuisance? Besides, considering the sch have quite a number of
              western nation students, what if a scuffle broke out between them
              and the PRC students? Isn't such things a cause of concern? Lastly,
              if a student is to hold a "Pro-Tibet" rally, will the sch
              approve of this?........... </p>

              <p>It's 1989, not 1986. And from my experience and what I had read about, many PRCs'  from the younger generation (below 30) are clueless or knew very little about it. I remember sitting in front of the TV watching events unfold then ,  especially the scene  where a man stood in front of a column of tanks, blocking their path.</p>
