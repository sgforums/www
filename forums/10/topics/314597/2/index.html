              <p>I was wondering and seriously pondering, to what an extent are our local universities biased towards foreigners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yesterday, while walking along a sheltered connector towards the canteen, I encountered a huge jam of human flow in the front. It was later that I found out that a group of PRC students are holding a signature petition rally for the Beijing 2008. There was this China student parading abt waving a full sized PRC flag, while the other student was holding a large plank card with writings, of support Beijing 2008 and stop western media from demonising PRC. Some other of their compatroits are manning the signature books........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was wondering, why did the university allow such events to be held? Last time, when the student union wanted to conduct similar signature gathering on banner, to protest against the increase in <span style="color: #ff0000;">tution fees</span>, the school step in immediately and stop the union from doing so. Emails were also sent to threaten the students of the consequences of participating. The sch used the execuse that such event may cause public nuisance, and may cause public disorder. So the PRC students waving the flag, blocking the walk way is not a nuisance? Besides, considering the sch have quite a number of western nation students, what if a scuffle broke out between them and the PRC students? Isn't such things a cause of concern? Lastly, if a student is to hold a "Pro-Tibet" rally, will the sch approve of this?........... </p>

              <p>What I am putting forward, is a matter of concern. I am neither pro-Tibet nor pro Beijing. As our local unis are getting more internationalised, these issues of the foreigners may clash with the interest of the locals. The sch is an institution to study and receive knowledge, and most unions are not allowed to discuss policies of the state or other related stuffs. According to the govt, foreigners are not welcomed to politicise, put forward their ideologies to influence SG, so isn't what these PRC doing, contradicts this statement? My fear is that if these matters get out of hand, e.g. 11 of them rope in more of their compatroits to chant and shout slogans, or worst, get in a fight against western students. Our effort to promote SG as an international education hub will go to waste. Ppl will see the local unis as dangerous first, rather than the PRCians as dangerous.</p>

              <p>It's 1989, not 1986. And from my experience and what I had read about, many PRCs'  from the younger generation (below 30) are clueless or knew very little about it. I remember sitting in front of the TV watching events unfold then ,  especially the scene  where a man stood in front of a column of tanks, blocking their path.</p>

              <p><br>thanks for correction of the year. Those born after the 80s may be too young to remember the incident but they knew what happened. But i am sure many of them would know about the incident because there are many books written on June 4. Occassionally there are still articles written to assess the aftermath.</p>
              <p>The scene of a man stopping a whole column of tanks is a icon for call for freedom at that time internationally. It seems that the guy was not even a demonstrator but somebody living nearby. I admire his guts and trust that the driver didn't drive further, nobody need to be told what happened if you were run over by a tank.</p>
