              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> <strong>You destroyed SDP, MM Lee tells Chee</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p>By MICHELLE QUAH</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(SINGAPORE) There was no shortage of tension and drama at the High Court yesterday, as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew were cross-examined by opposition Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) leader Chee Soon Juan and his sister Chee Siok Chin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While Monday saw PM Lee labelling Dr Chee as 'a liar, a cheat, somebody who has brought discredit to the opposition and to Singapore', yesterday saw MM Lee share his views of the opposition party leader, when he called Dr Chee 'unscrupulous', a 'psychopath' and someone who 'destroyed the SDP'.</span></p>
              <p>The hearing is to assess the damages the SDP and the Chee siblings have to pay PM Lee and MM Lee for defaming them, in articles in their party newsletter two years ago. They had alleged that the Lees were corrupt and had covered up wrongdoings at the National Kidney Foundation (NKF).</p>
              <p>For the prime minister, it was his second day on the stand - and Justice Belinda Ang saw fit to move the session along swiftly by limiting the time of the Chees' cross-examination of him.</p>
              <p>Justice Ang also threw out many of their questions on the grounds of irrelevance - questions ranging from ministerial pay to HDB costs - which prompted Ms Chee to plead: 'You've already chopped off our arms, our legs - what do you want next, our heads?'</p>
              <p>The cross-examination of MM Lee was kept similarly tight, with a time limit of two hours - a matter ensured by the minister mentor himself when he challenged his cross-examiners to get to the meat of the issues. 'If they (the Chees) have important devastating revelations to make, they wouldn't be allowing you (SDP lawyer M Ravi) to put all these irrelevant questions to me, because it's time-wasting,' MM Lee said.</p>
              <p>He added: 'One reason why we have allowed this altercation to go on is because we are leaning over backwards to allow you (Dr Chee) enough rope to tie yourself up. And you have successfully done that.'</p>
              <p>The minister mentor said he had to sue the Chees for defamation as they had impugned the integrity of the government, of which he used to be prime minister.</p>
              <p>Defending the achievements of the government, MM Lee drew comparisons with Taiwan and Hong Kong - whose leaders have upheld Singapore as an example to follow. 'The final test is what Singapore was when I became prime minister in 1959, and what Singapore is now. We had less than S$100 million in the kitty. Today . . . global financial services assess Singapore to have sovereign wealth funds of over US$300 billion,' MM Lee said.</p>
              <p>He also criticised Dr Chee's leadership of the SDP and called him a 'political juvenile'.</p>
              <p>'The SDP was doing very well under Mr Chiam See Tong, and at one time captured three seats, and it became the de facto leader. You came in, and destroyed the SDP,' MM Lee said.</p>
              <p>He pointed out that Mr Chiam and Workers' Party leader Low Thia Khiang have successfully won their election bids without defaming anyone. 'But you have lost successively, because we have proved to the people that you are not to be believed.'</p>
              <p>When asked if he would consider mediation as a means of resolving his dispute with Dr Chee, MM Lee quipped: 'Your Honour, it is so bizarre a question, I will need Solomon to be revived - and I do not believe Solomon can mediate between a psychopath and sane, rational people.'</p>
              <p>The hearing continues today, for the various parties to make their closing submissions.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Sparks fly as opposition politician questions Singapore leaders</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE (AFP) - - Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew on Tuesday
              justified the city-state's strict political controls as he clashed in
              open court with his fiercest critic over a defamation case.</p>
              <p>Repeatedly questioned by opposition politician Chee Soon Juan about
              what he claimed was the absence of political freedoms and the rule of
              law, Lee pointed to Singapore's economic success as the "acid test" of
              his legacy.</p>
              <p>Lee, a Cambridge-trained lawyer, said Western liberal
              organisations have always been critical of Singapore's political
              system, dominated by the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) since 1959,
              but added that "we think we know better."</p>
              <p>In a day of drama at
              the Supreme Court, Chee, the secretary general of the Singapore
              Democratic Party (SDP), his sister Chee Siok Chin and their lawyer
              questioned the elder Lee and his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong,
              on the witness stand.</p>
              <p>The Lees -- the father was prime minister
              from 1959 to 1990 and his son came to power in 2004 -- have already won
              a summary judgement against the SDP, its secretary-general Chee and his
              sister.</p>
              <p>The two leaders had sued over allegations of government
              corruption made in an SDP newsletter ahead of general elections in May
              2006, and the hearings this week were held to determine the amount of
              damages.</p>
              <p>"Mr. Lee, we meet at last," blurted Chee as he sprang up
              to cross-examine the 84-year-old Lee Kuan Yew. "You have been avoiding
              me," he said, setting the stage for a series of heated exchanges.</p>
              <p>Chee
              focused his questioning on the lack of democracy and rule of law,
              prompting the judge to repeatedly warn him to ask only questions
              relevant to the assessment of defamation damages.</p>
              <p>"You have nothing of substance against me," Lee Kuan Yew told Chee in one of the clashes as Chee looked for questions.</p>
              <p>He
              said Chee was trying to "degrade" the court proceedings, and the Lees'
              lawyer chided the opposition activist for using the hearing to "insult,
              annoy and to scandalise" his clients.</p>
              <p>At one point, Lee Kuan Yew
              called Chee a "liar", a "cheat" and that he knew several doctors who
              described his actions as those of a "near-psychopath".</p>
              <p>Chee, who
              had faced jail terms and fines in his fight against the ruling PAP,
              accused Lee of having run the country "undemocratically" and of
              "crushing" press freedom.</p>
              <p>"I will take whatever you dish out," Chee said.</p>
              <p>Lee
              told Chee the final test of his legacy was what Singapore has become
              now -- a country favoured by foreign investors and ranked consistently
              worldwide as a business-friendly nation with world-class facilities and
              little corruption.</p>
              <p>Earlier in the day, Chee, his sister and their
              lawyer M. Ravi had also questioned Prime Minister Lee, who remained
              calm and composed.</p>
              <p>"Mr Lee, don't hide behind your counsel. Come
              out, be a real leader," Chee taunted the prime minister after the Lees'
              counsel repeatedly objected to the line of questioning.</p>
              <p>The Lees
              have already won hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages from past
              lawsuits against members of the country's tiny opposition and insist
              that they need to protect their reputations from unfounded attacks.</p>
              <p>Chee
              is already bankrupt after failing to pay 500,000 Singapore dollars
              (365,000 US) in libel damages to the elder Lee and another former prime
              minister, Goh Chok Tong, for remarks he made in the 2001 elections.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">PM Lee, MM Lee face Chee in defamation suit against SDP</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The High Court on Tuesday set time limits on the
              cross—examination of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor
              Lee Kuan Yew during the hearing to assess the amount of damages to be
              awarded to the two Singapore leaders in their defamation suit against
              the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP).</p>
              <p>This was to ensure questions stayed relevant, and it came after
              several delays and what Senior Counsel Davinder Singh said was the SDP
              trying to "turn the court into a political theatre".</p>
              <p>Mr Singh,
              acting for PM Lee and MM Lee, would not allow the SDP to repeat what he
              called its ’delaying tactics’ seen in court on Monday. Justice Belinda
              Ang agreed with Mr Singh that the SDP defendants should not be allowed
              to insult both his clients under the guise of cross—examination. Hence,
              time limits or guillotine times were set.</p>
              <p>However, when PM Lee
              took the stand, he had little opportunity to reply, as objections were
              raised repeatedly against SDP leader Dr Chee Soon Juan’s line of
              questioning, which was deemed as irrelevant.</p>
              <p>The Prime Minister did reply to a question from Dr Chee who asked if he knew what was on Dr Chee’s mind.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Lee replied that Dr Chee’s mind was of one who has been repeatedly
              exposed as a liar and cheat, harboured deep—seated resentment and been
              cut down to size and hence wanted revenge.</p>
              <p>The Lees have already won a summary judgement against the SDP, its secretary—general Dr Chee and his sister Chee Siok Chin.</p>
              <p>The
              two leaders had sued over allegations of government corruption made in
              an article published in the SDP newsletter, The New Democrat, ahead of
              general elections in May 2006.</p>
              <p>In assessing damages, the court usually has to look at the extent to which the defamation was carried.</p>
              <p>Senior
              Counsel Davinder Singh noted that the SDP had suggested during the
              hearing that only 5,000 copies of The New Democrat carrying the
              defamatory article had been circulated.</p>
              <p>Ms Chee had made this point as she contrasted the circulation with Singapore’s population of 4.6 million.</p>
              <p>However,
              PM Lee said the 5,000—copy circulation was not a good measure, as each
              copy would have been circulated to several people.</p>
              <p>The article
              was also carried on the SDP website, and SDP leaders had broadcast the
              points made during the sales of the newsletter at housing estates.</p>
              <p>Hence
              the lawyers for the Singapore leaders urged the High Court to award
              substantial damages, though they did not want to specify a sum.</p>
              <p>In
              2005, Mr Lee Kuan Yew was awarded S$200,000 in damages for defamation
              by Dr Chee during the 2001 General Elections, and the then Prime
              Minister Goh Chok Tong was awarded S$220,000.</p>
              <p>Mr Singh said "even
              if damages cannot be fully recovered from the defendants due to their
              bankruptcy, a ruling for substantial damages will go a long way towards
              vindication".</p>
              <p><strong>Minister Mentor Lee takes the stand </strong></p>
              <p>When
              Minister Mentor Lee took the stand later Tuesday, Dr Chee continued in
              the same vein — asking questions which Mr Lee’s lawyer had to
              constantly object to as irrelevant.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee alleged that Mr Lee
              had made it difficult for the opposition to compete on equal footing.
              MM Lee’s reply was that no government in any country helps to build the
              opposition.</p>
              <p>He contrasted Dr Chee with opposition MPs Low Thia
              Khiang and Chiam See Tong. MM Lee said that despite fierce competition
              from the PAP, Mr Low and Mr Chiam were successfully re—elected and did
              so without defaming anyone.</p>
              <p>MM Lee even suggested that with Dr
              Chee’s eloquence, he perhaps had a better chance than the two
              opposition MPs if only he could follow the Constitution and establish
              credibility.</p>
              <p>MM Lee even advised Dr Chee to find a way to pay up
              the damages awarded in his suits — like what veteran opposition
              politician JB Jeyaretnam did — and not mute himself politically as an
              undischarged bankrupt.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee still questioned MM Lee on
              Singapore’s human rights record — even though this had no bearing on
              Tuesday’s hearing — and the country’s ratings by agencies like Human
              Rights Watch and Amnesty International.</p>
              <p>MM Lee told the court that the agencies are liberal organisations which disagree with the way Singapore runs its social system.</p>
              <p>However,
              the Singapore government believes it knows better, otherwise it will
              not be where it is today. The final test for Singapore is not in the
              ratings, but the lives of the people and what Singapore is, said MM Lee.</p>
              <p>Four
              journalists were expected to take the stand on Tuesday. But Mr Singh
              decided not to call upon them as their evidence was already included in
              the Prime Minister and Minister Mentor’s affidavits, which were not
              challenged by the defendants.</p>
              <p>The hearing will continue, while the cross—examination of the two leaders has ended. — CNA/ir</p>

The obvious question that arises is whether such a state of affairs makes sense.</blockquote><blockquote><br>When I took the issue up with the head of TI’s Malaysia chapter at a conference,<br>he replied that he had given Lee the award based not on the senior minister’s human rights record but on his stance against corruption. The bizarreness of this logic notwithstanding it is akin to giving an award to a teacher for helping students do well academically in spite of physically abusing some of them.</blockquote>

              list of behaviour which she said scandalised and impugned the dignity
              of the court, such as disobeying instructions, interrupting counsel and
              witnesses and accusing the court of bias. The Chees will be giv<span style="color: #ff0000;">en the
              opportunity to respond on Friday. </span><br> <br>After lawyers from both sides presented their closing arguments,
              the court reserved judgement on the quantum of damages to be awarded.
              <br> <br>SDP's defence lawyer M Ravi said the court had become a spectacle
              for the ventilation of political hostility. He said the court is no
              longer an appropriate forum to conduct political battles under the
              guise of defamation suit.
              <br> <br>He asked for nominal damages of 50 cents to be awarded, because he
              said the plaintiffs had not proved their reputation had been seriously
              harmed.
              <br> <br>Responding to that, Senior Counsel Davinder Singh said a submission
              of 50 cents amounts to serious aggravation because it demeans the
              process and suggests that it is perfectly alright to run down the two
              plaintiffs.
              <br> <br>Mr Singh had asked for aggravated damages as Dr Chee had repeated
              allegations of nepotism, corruption and criminal conduct during the
              trial.
              <br> <br> He said the Chees had acted recklessly, aggressively and attacked the integrity of the plaintiffs. 
              <br> <br>In his closing submission, Dr Chee said he stood by what was
              published in the SDP newsletter "The New Democrat" and that even if he
              had to go deeper into bankruptcy, it was a path he could not run away
              from.
              <br> <br>He added he does not wish the Prime Minister or Minister Mentor any
              ill will 'despite what they have done and continue to do to me and my
              family'.
              <br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">But he would not be taking Mr Lee Kuan Yew's advice to pay up his suits so as to participate in the political process. -</span> CNA/ir</span></blockquote>

              <h1 class="clr">Court hearing on defamation damages against SDP ends</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: SDP chief Chee Soon Juan and his sister, Chee Siok Chin,
              will be back in the High Court on Friday to explain why they should not
              be held in contempt of court.</p>
              <p>Justice Belinda Ang said this at the end of a three—day hearing to
              determine defamation damages the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) and
              the Chee siblings have to pay Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and
              Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>The two Singapore leaders had sued
              over allegations of government corruption made in an SDP newsletter
              ahead of general elections in May 2006.</p>
              <p>In his closing arguments,
              SDP’s lawyer M Ravi asked the court for a nominal sum because he said
              there has been no proof that the reputations of PM Lee and MM Lee were
              harmed seriously by the article in SDP’s publication "The New Democrat".</p>
              <p>But
              Senior Counsel Davinder Singh, who is acting for the Singapore leaders,
              said the court should award his clients a sum for aggravated damages
              because the defamatory remarks were repeated.</p>
              <p>The High Court did
              not issue a judgement at the end of the session on Wednesday. It will
              sit again on Friday to hear submissions from Dr Chee and his sister. —

              <h1 class="clr">Singapore leaders seek 'unprecedented' damages</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE (AFP) - - Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew and his
              son Premier Lee Hsien Loong sought "unprecedented" damages Wednesday as
              the trial of an opposition leader for defamation came to an emotional
              climax.</p>
              <p>The Lees, stung by two days of cross-examination by Chee Soon Juan,
              secretary general of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), asked a
              Supreme Court judge to punish the pro-democracy activist for his
              behaviour in court.</p>
              <p>Their lawyer, Davinder Singh, said Chee acted
              like a "hooligan" and exhibited "loutish behaviour" when he grilled the
              two leaders on the witness stand and ignored the judge's admonitions
              about his manner of questioning.</p>
              <p>Singh said that despite a court
              injunction, Chee repeated allegations of corruption against the Lees in
              court and posted them on the Internet, an action that merits an
              "unprecedented award" of damages.</p>
              <p>"The case for substantial damages is very compelling," he said.</p>
              <p>Chee,
              summing up his defence, told the packed courtroom he stood by
              everything that was written in a party publication at the heart of the
              case, but added he harboured no personal hatred against the Lees.</p>
              <p>"I
              do not hate Lee Hsien Loong, I do not hate Lee Kuan Yew and I do not
              wish them ill for what they have done and continue to do to me and my
              family," he said.</p>
              <p>Chee had been found guilty of defamation over
              allegations of government corruption made in an SDP newsletter ahead of
              general elections in May 2006.</p>
              <p>The SDP and Chee's sister and fellow pro-democracy activist Chee Siok Chin were named as co-defendants.</p>
              <p>Defence
              lawyer M. Ravi, representing the SDP, said the Lees only deserved to be
              awarded a token 50 Singapore cents (37 US cents) because their
              reputations were not hurt by what the SDP and the Chees said.</p>
              <p>Hearings
              were held this week to determine the amount of damages and the Lees
              took the witness stand to press their case, allowing the defendants to
              cross-examine them.</p>
              <p>Chee, acting as his own lawyer, used strong
              language as he questioned the record of the Lees and the necessity of

              <p>The Lees -- the father was prime
              minister from 1959 to 1990 and his son came to power in 2004 --
              dismissed Chee's attacks and said he further damaged their reputations
              during the cross-examination.</p>
              <p>The Lees and other Singapore
              leaders have won hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages from
              lawsuits against members of the country's tiny opposition.</p>
              <p>Chee
              is already bankrupt after failing to pay 500,000 Singapore dollars
              (365,000 US) in libel damages to the elder Lee and another former prime
              minister, Goh Chok Tong, for remarks he made in the 2001 elections.</p>

              <p>She will certainly need a few heads to last through the her ordeal in attending to the proceedings with MM LKY observing the entire process like a hawk.</p>

              <p>orders,folding arms etc.</p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, please do give your noisiest lion efforts to have make possible the release of the entire ''vidoe recordings in court'' - and WITHOUT any censorship that let us see only the snippets that place CSJ in bad ways, and cutting out all the embarrassing moments that CSJ had placed the Lee's in.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can you do so without raising your "figure pointing", and raising voice in your usual noisy lion manner ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is doubtful that you can even get the Judge to shake her heads 3 times or less.</span></p>

              <blockquote>A <strong>kangaroo court</strong> or <strong>kangaroo trial</strong>, sometimes likened to a <a title="Drumhead court-martial" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drumhead_court-martial">drumhead court-martial</a> or <strong>Drumhead trial</strong>, is a sham <a class="mw-redirect" title="Legal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal">legal</a> proceeding or <a title="Court" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court">court</a>. Kangaroo courts are judicial proceedings that deny <a title="Due process" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process">due process</a> in the name of expediency. The outcome of such a trial is essentially
              made in advance, usually for the purpose of providing a conviction,
              either by going through the motions of manipulated procedure or by
              allowing no defense at all.</blockquote>

              <blockquote>Dr Chee: He (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) is talking about his integrity. Is this
              the same integrity that you are referring to when your government in
              1963 arrested all your political opponents under Operation Coldstore?<br><br>Mr Davinder Singh, counsel for the plaintiffs, rises to object.<br><br>Dr Chee (turning to Mr Singh): Let him answer, he wants to answer.<br><br>Judge Belinda Ang: Question is disallowed.<br><br>Mr Singh: Thank you, Your Honour.<br><br>Dr
              Chee: He wants to talk about integrity and I want to talk about
              integrity. Let's talk about integrity, Mr Lee. Is this the same
              integrity as you are referring to when you jailed Mr Chia Thye Poh for
              32 years, when you imprisoned Dr Lim Hock Siew for 19 years, and when
              depriving them all –<br><br>Judge Ang: Question is disallowed.<br><br>Mr
              Lee Kuan Yew: May I point out to you what Singapore was when I became
              prime minister in 1959 and what Singapore is now. We had less than $100
              million in the kitty. Now that the assets that we have and I am not
              disclosing this but Global Financial Services assessed Singapore's
              sovereign wealth fund at over $300 billion.<br><br>Dr Chee: I am impressed. Now –<br><br>Mr Lee Kuan Yew: If you are impressed, Mr Chee – Dr Chee, if you're impressed, you would not have made these allegations.<br><br>Dr Chee: Mr Lee, is this the same integrity where you're talking about declassified documents from London?<br><br>Judge Ang: Irrelevant.<br><br>Dr Chee: – that you have –<br><br>Judge Ang: The witness is not required to answer.<br><br>Dr
              Chee: And I would like – well, Your Honour, he's brought up integrity
              and I just want to be able to pursue that line just a little bit more.
              Is it the same integrity –<br><br>Mr Singh: Your Honour, I object to this line of questioning.<br><br>Dr Chee: That you are referring to, Mr Lee, where now we begin to know –<br><br>Justice Ang: Question is disallowed.<br><br>Dr

              <h1 class="clr">Court fines bankrupt Singapore opposition leader</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE, May 30, 2008 (AFP) - A Singapore judge on Friday fined a
              bankrupt opposition party leader for speaking in public without a
              permit, hours before the politician was due in court in a contempt case.</p>
              <p>Chee Soon Juan will be jailed for five weeks if he does not pay the 5,000-dollar (3,663 US) fine, Judge Jasvender Kaur ruled.</p>
              <p>Chee,
              secretary-general of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), is one of
              only a few people in Singapore to have spoken out against the ruling
              People's Action Party and has faced numerous legal battles with
              authorities.</p>
              <p>He has served previous jail terms for speaking
              without a permit, and was declared bankrupt after failing to pay
              500,000 Singapore dollars in libel damages to Singapore founding father
              Lee Kuan Yew and another former prime minister over remarks made in
              2001.</p>
              <p>Chee was charged with eight counts of speaking to the
              public without a licence between November 2005 and April 2006 -- just
              ahead of a general election -- according to court documents.</p>
              <p>His lawyer, M. Ravi, told AFP that he was free on bail while the court considers an appeal.</p>
              <p>He
              is due to appear in the Supreme Court later Friday to show why he
              should not be charged with contempt in connection with his behaviour
              during a hearing to assess damages in a defamation case involving Lee
              Kuan Yew and his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>The Lees
              have won hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages from lawsuits
              against members of the country's tiny opposition and insist that they
              need to protect their reputations from unfounded attacks.</p>

              <p>Chee has also been found guilty of defamation in cases
              filed by former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew and his son, Prime
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Singapore's high court has yet to
              rule on the amount of damages. (Reporting by Melanie Lee; Editing by
              Jan Dahinten and Sanjeev
              Miglani) - SINGAPORE, May 30 - A bankrupt Singapore opposition party
              leader was sentenced to five weeks in prison or pay a S$5,000 fine for
              speaking in public without a permit.</p>
              <p>Chee Soon Juan, leader of the Singapore Democratic Party, was on
              Friday found guilty of the offence committed on April 8, 2006. He has
              six outstanding charges of speaking in public without a license between
              November 2005 and April 2006.</p>
              <p>Singapore has tough laws on public
              gatherings, and protests are rare. An assembly of five or more people
              requires a police permit and offences under the Public Entertainments
              and Meetings Act could lead to fines as high as S$10,000 .</p>
              <p>Chee,
              who pleaded not guilty on the grounds of his constitutional right to
              free speech, was made a bankrupt in February 2006 when he failed to pay
              libel damages of S$500,000 to former prime ministers Lee Kuan Yew and
              Goh Chok Tong.</p>
              <p>"I continue to maintain that what I have done is
              well within the law and my constitutional rights," Chee told the court.
              Chee's lawyer M. Ravi said he will be appealing the conviction.</p>
              <p>The state prosecutor had asked for a "substantial fine" to act as a deterrent for other "like-minded" individuals.</p>
              <p>The Southeast Asian city defends its strict laws on public assembly citing the need for public order and safety.</p>
              <p>The
              Singapore Democratic Party is one of the more vocal opposition parties
              in Singapore. It did not get into parliament in the last election in
              2006 and 82 of the 84 elected parliamentary seats are held by the
              ruling People's Action Party which has been in power since Singapore's
              independence in 1965.</p>
              <p>Chee has also been found guilty of
              defamation in cases filed by former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew and his
              son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Singapore's high court has yet to
              rule on the amount of damages.</p>
