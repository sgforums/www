                  accusing Dr Chee Soon Juan of avoiding him in court, Mr Lee Kuan Yew
                  was working feverishly through his lawyer to restrict Dr Chee's
                  cross-examination of him.<br><br>This is vintage Lee, thumping his
                  chest in public while working behind the scenes to ensure that his
                  opponents are crippled even before the fight begins.<br><br>He did this
                  to the late Lim Chin Siong. While pretending to defend Lim, Mr Lee Kuan
                  Yew was working behind closed doors to ban his then party comrade from
                  standing for elections.</p>
              <p>He said publicly
                  that introducing a law (by the British colonial government) to ban
                  ex-detainees, of whom Mr Lim Chin Siong was one, is "disturbing because
                  it is a departure from the democratic practice." <br><br>But a
                  recently declassified British memo contradicts the Minister Mentor:
                  "Lee Kuan Yew was secretly a party with Lim Yew Hock in urging the
                  Colonial Secretary to impose the ‘subversives ban'." (See <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/perspective/special-feature/36-special-feature/302-lim-chin-siong-vs-lee-kuan-yew-the-true-and-shocking-history">here</a> for the full report.)<br><br>He
                  also did it to Mr Francis Seow. While challenging anyone who criticizes
                  him to join a political party and stand for elections, he threatened Mr
                  Seow not to join the opposition.</p>
              <p>His ISD goons threatened Mr
                  Seow during detention: "For your information, Lee Kuan Yew is running
                  for another term. And you will be locked up here...You can give up all
                  your ideas of going into politics." (Quoted from <em>To Catch A Tartar</em> by Francis Seow)<br><br>He's doing it now to Dr Chee. While issuing a <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/255361.asp">press statement</a> saying that Dr Chee is trying to "avoid having to cross-examine" him
                  and his Prime Minister son, his lawyer was working overtime in Judge
                  Belinda Ang's chambers yesterday to ensure that the Judge limits the
                  cross-examination when the plaintiffs take the stand.<br><br>Mr
                  Davinder Singh was hell-bent on ensuring that Dr Chee's Affidavit
                  Evident in Chief (AEIC) was struck out. This would severely curtail the
                  defendants' cross-examination of Mr Lee. The MM even instructed his
                  lawyer to apply to expunge Dr Chee's AEIC from the courts' records
                  because the document would "embarass" him.<br><br>Mr Singh gave a hint
                  of what was to come at the cross-examination. He urged Judge Ang not to
                  allow the defendants a "roving enquiry" when the Lees' took the stand
                  and to disallow the defendants to "cross-examine the plaintiffs on
                  political matters that had no relevance."<br><br>He also said that the defendants cannot prove corruption, nepotism, cover-up, etc because "we're past that point."<br><br> Contrast this with Mr Lee's brag that "if you defame us [and] if I'm
                  involved, I go to the witness box. And you can question me, not only on
                  the particular defamatory issue, but all issues in my life."<br><br>Aping
                  the MM, Mr Singh said in 2004, "[Dr Chee] has been carping about the
                  lack of democracy and transparency. He now has the opportunity of a
                  lifetime - a chance to cross-examine the plaintiffs and extract answers
                  to his pressing questions. What does he do? He flees."<br><br>Mr Singh
                  was, of course, referring to the previous suit in which the hearing was
                  convened before Dr Chee could return to Singapore following a
                  five-month fellowship at the National Endowment for Democracy in
                  Washington, DC.<br><br>Mr Lee dares to play such games because he has
                  control over the mass media and he knows he can continue to tell such
                  lies with impunity. Dr Chee can only depend on the Internet. The fight
                  to communicate with the public is as tilted as ever. <br><br>But we do not fret for we have one thing that is stronger than even the mightiest of despots. It is called the truth.</p>

              <p>In a statement issued on Thursday evening, both leaders said they are ready to be cross—examined in open court on Monday.</p>
              <p>Both
                  leaders had sued the SDP and its leaders for an article, headlined
                  "Government’s role in the NKF scandal", published in the party’s
                  publication "Demokrat" in April 2006.</p>
              <p>The High Court found the
                  article defamed PM Lee and MM Lee and both leaders successfully
                  obtained a summary judgement against SDP chief Dr Chee Soon Juan, his
                  sister Chee Siok Chin and the party.</p>
              <p>In their statement on
                  Thursday, both leaders said it appeared Dr Chee was once again trying
                  to avoid having to cross—examine the Prime Minister and Minister Mentor.</p>
              <p>Hearing resumed in Chambers on Thursday to strike out statements of evidence filed by Dr Chee.</p>
              <p>Senior
                  Counsel Davider Singh, who is acting for the leaders, said Dr Chee was
                  attempting to drag out proceedings to avoid next week’s hearing to
                  assess the amount of damages. The opposition politician, he said, was
                  employing delay tactics.</p>
              <p>Giving a detailed account of these
                  tactics, Minister Mentor Lee’s press secretary noted the assessment of
                  damages hearing was originally scheduled from May 12—14.</p>
              <p>Both
                  leaders had set aside time to attend and be cross—examined, but Dr Chee
                  tried his best to avoid the hearing. Instead, he had asked Justice
                  Belinda Ang to excuse herself.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee knew that if the Judge did so, the assessment of damages hearing would have to be postponed.</p>
              <p>When
                  this attempt failed, he asked for an adjournment to consider the two
                  leaders’ application to strike out the affidavits filed by the Chees.
                  The assessment of damages hearing was then re—scheduled to May 26—28.</p>
              <p>Furthermore,
                  two days (May 22 and 23) were set aside to hear the Striking—Out
                  Applications so as to complete all preliminary matters before the main
                  hearing starts. But Dr Chee went on to make all sorts of last—minute
                  applications.</p>
              <p>The hearing in Chambers on the Striking—out Applications will continue on Friday afternoon before Justice Belinda Ang. — CNA/ir</p>

              <p>Noisy Lion,</p>
              <p>Sometimes you tend to over-simplify issues and problems concerning the way government is treating the oppositions.</p>
              <p>No body really is or has been asking the government to help the opposition like allowing them to use the TV or estate banner posts to display their pictures as our MPs are doing for full 5 years of office without paying advertisement licence sees as citizens are being made to pay.</p>
              <p>No body nor the oppositions are asking the government for million-dollar salaries for the oppositions when they are doing just as important if not more arduous jobs in our circumstances where government is going all out to fix them.</p>
              <p>So it is not true as you are saying that citizens or anyone are expecting government to help the oppositions. But propagandists of the ruling party is clever or tricky in putting it like it is not the job of government to help the oppositions. Why this assumption when it is not the truth at all.</p>
              <p>Don't help the opposition never mind but do we have to run a government which uses the whole media taken over and controlled by them to fire at the oppositions and worse constantly threaten to fix them or sue them for any slightest remarks made in the course of election where both sides are trading insults which are made out as defamatory in the courts where judges are appointed by or with their consent.</p>
              <p>When you hear of opposition defamation cases in our type of courts where judges are appointed by or with the consent of our executive of government where the media are controlled and where the anti-opposition propagandas are blasted in the media day after day can you still say that oppositions are being helped in any way by the government as you seem to imply.</p>
              <p>The way MM/PM are taking the stand in court and asking CSJ to question them is like putting a multi-barrel machine gun at them and say I let you ask anything you want.</p>
              <p>So don't fool the citizens with such assumption that government is expected to help the oppositions. If the government does not go out of the way due to its own paranoid behavior to conduct non-stop lies and propagandas for fixing of oppositions and is prepared to change its own mindset and leave well alone and not try to help like raising GST to help the poor it will be a big step forward to get out of our selfish governing system</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">THE WISDOM OF LEE KUAN YEW</span></span></strong><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> <br><br>"If we are to survive as a free democracy, then we must be prepared, in principle, to concede to our enemies - even those who do not subscribe to our views - as much(sic)constitutional rights as you concede yourself." -<em> Lee Kuan Yew Legislative Assembly Debates Sept 21, 1955 </em><br><br><em>"</em>But we either believe in democracy or we not. If we do, then, we must say categorically, without qualification, that no restraint from the any democratic processes, other than by the ordinary law of the land, should be allowed... If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally. If you believe that men should be free, then, they should have the right of free association, of free speech, of free publication. Then, no law should permit those democratic processes to be set at nought, and no excuse, whether of security, should allow a government to be deterred from doing what it knows to right, and what it must know to be right... "- <em>Lee Kuan Yew, Legislative Assembly Debates April 27, 1955</em> <br><br>"Let us get down to fundamentals. Is this an open, or is this a closed society? Is it a society where men can preach ideas - novel, unorthodox, heresies, to established churches and established governments - where there is a constant contest for men's hearts and minds on the basis of what is right, of what is just, of what is in the national interests, or is it a closed society where the mass media - the newspapaers, the journals, publications, TV, radio - either bound by sound or by sight, or both sound and sight, men's minds are fed with a constant drone of sycophantic support for a particular orthodox political philosophy? That is the first question we asked ourselves. I would like to see minds stimulated and debate provoked, and truth refined and crystallized out of the conflict of different evidence and views. I, therefore, welcome every and any opportunity of a chance to agree, or to dissent, in order that out of thesis comes synthesis - thesis, anti-major premise, anti-premise, synthesis, so we progress... I welcome every opportunity to meet members of the opposition, and so do members of my party, over the radio, over the television, university forums, public rallies. We never run away from the open encounter. If your ideas, your views cannot stand the challenge of criticism then they are too fragile and not sturdy enough to last. I am talking of the principle of the open society, the open debate, ideas, not intimidation, persuasion not coercion... Sir, the basic fundamentals we asked ourselves...is whether the duties of the Minister of Information and Broadcasting are to produce closed minds or open minds, because these instruments - the mass media, the TV, the radio - can produce either the open minds receptive to ideas and ideals, a democratic system of life, or closed and limited. But I know that the open debate is a painful process for closed minds...But let me make this point: that 5 million adult minds in Malaysia cannot be closed - definitely not in the lifetime of the people in authority. It is not possible because whatever the faults of the colonial system, and there are many...they generated the open mind, the inquiring mind." <em>- Lee Kuan Yew Dec 18, 1964 Malaysian Parliamentary Debates </em></span></span></p>

I am told it is like making love-it is always easier the second time! The first time there may be pangs of conscience, a sense of guilt. But once embarked on this course with constant repetition you get more and more brazen in the attack. All you have to do is to dissolve organizations and societies and banish and detain the key political workers in these societies. Then miraculously everything is tranquil on the surface. Then an intimidated press and the government-controlled radio together can regularly sing your praises, and slowly and steadily the people are made to forget the evil things that have already been done, or if these things are referred to again they're conveniently distorted and distorted with impunity, because there will be no opposition to contradict." <em>-Lee Kuan Yew as an opposition PAP member during 1956 speaking to David Marshall</em></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"One-man-one-vote is a most difficult form of government. From time to time the results can be erratic. People are sometimes fickle. They get bored with stable, steady improvements in life and in a reckless moment they vote for a change for change's sake. This is the danger for Singapore, not in this election, because the results cannot be a disaster this time. But it can be in the future." - <em>Lee Kuan Yew, pre-election speech 1984</em> <br><br>The "vagaries" of the one-man-one-vote system "makes it an extremely hazardous system to run anywhere in the under-developed and the under-educated world...We are not exceptional: we are neither more intelligent nor better educated than many of our neighbours. We have been more fortunately endowed and enjoy a better standard of living, but I do not think the basic factors are materially different. Where the majority of your population is semi-literate, it responds more to the carrot than to the stick, and politicains at election time cannot use the stick, so this leads to a situation where he who bids the highest wins. At a time when you want harder work with less return and more capital investment, one-man-one-vote produces just the opposite. I do not think that it is a co-incidence that it has flopped in Pakistan, did not succeed in Burma, nearly came to grief in Ceylon..It has been abandoned, decried and condemned in Indonesia, and it is not held in high-esteem anywhere in Asia. It is not a tradition with the Malays nor with the Chinese to count heads: their custom has always been to listen to the dictum of the elder... Government to be effective must at least give the impression of enduring, and a government which is open to the vagaries of the ballot box when the people who put their crosses in the ballot boxes are not illiterate but semi-literate, which is worse, is a government which is already weakened before it starts to govern. If I were in authority in Singapore indefinitely, without having to ask those who are governed whether they like what is being done, then I have not the slightest doubt that I could govern much more effectively in their own interests. That is a fact which the educated understand, but we are all caught in this system which the the British export all over the place hoping that somewhere it will take root." <em>- Lee Kuan Yew 1962</em><em><span style="font-style: normal;"><span>  </span></span></em></span></span></p>

              <p>''SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew have said they are ready for a court hearing to determine damages claimed by them against the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) and its leaders Chee Soon Juan and Chee Siok Chin.''</p>
              <div><span style="font-family: arial;">ADVERTISEMENT</span><br>&lt;!--Vendor: Motif, Format: Expandable --&gt;</div>
              <p>In a statement issued on Thursday evening, both leaders said they are ready to be cross—examined in open court on Monday.</p>
              <p>Both leaders had sued the SDP and its leaders for an article, headlined "Government’s role in the NKF scandal", published in the party’s publication "Demokrat" in April 2006.</p>
              <p>The High Court found the article defamed PM Lee and MM Lee and both leaders successfully obtained a summary judgement against SDP chief Dr Chee Soon Juan, his sister Chee Siok Chin and the party.</p>
              <p>In their statement on Thursday, both leaders said it appeared Dr Chee was once again trying to avoid having to cross—examine the Prime Minister and Minister Mentor.</p>
              <p>Hearing resumed in Chambers on Thursday to strike out statements of evidence filed by Dr Chee.</p>
              <p>Senior Counsel Davider Singh, who is acting for the leaders, said Dr Chee was attempting to drag out proceedings to avoid next week’s hearing to assess the amount of damages. The opposition politician, he said, was employing delay tactics.</p>
              <p>Giving a detailed account of these tactics, Minister Mentor Lee’s press secretary noted the assessment of damages hearing was originally scheduled from May 12—14.</p>
              <p>Both leaders had set aside time to attend and be cross—examined, but Dr Chee tried his best to avoid the hearing. Instead, he had asked Justice Belinda Ang to excuse herself.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee knew that if the Judge did so, the assessment of damages hearing would have to be postponed.</p>
              <p>When this attempt failed, he asked for an adjournment to consider the two leaders’ application to strike out the affidavits filed by the Chees. The assessment of damages hearing was then re—scheduled to May 26—28.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, two days (May 22 and 23) were set aside to hear the Striking—Out Applications so as to complete all preliminary matters before the main hearing starts. But Dr Chee went on to make all sorts of last—minute applications.</p>
              <p>The hearing in Chambers on the Striking—out Applications will continue on Friday afternoon before Justice Belinda Ang. — CNA/ir</p>

              <p>In opening this thread, you did give an extract from the SDP website entitled - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yoursdp.org/component/content/article/1-singapore/475-vintage-lee-kuan-yew">What CSJ said  </a>- while you printed volumes of words in defense of LKY, why did you not go deeper into what was said by CSJ to find out the reasons for CSJ's purported attempts at delay tactics ?</p>
              <p>Do you know the significance of having your Affidavit Evidence in Chief being striked out - especially the major portions of it ?</p>
              <p>You litterally have nothing to stand on - simply no case to present your side to defend.</p>
              <p>Davinder Singh - the lawyer for MM and PM - has been accused by CSJ to be working overtime in the judges chambers ''to fix'' this before MM and PM appear in court, and prevent the bulk of CSJ's materials being mentioned in open court that will embarass both MM and PM.</p>
              <p>Is there any need for the trial to continue, or is this another "Political Show Trial" to hang CSJ ?</p>
              <p>In the first place, is the trial necessary when the charges by MM and PM are a result of their own self-inflicted imagined damage done to their own reputation - based on the words expressed by CSJ and the SDP concerning the various issues of public interests that started with the NKF scandal ?</p>
              <p>If the words have damaged the reputation of MM and PM, why will they not allow CSJ to defend himself and given reasons for the words used ?</p>
              <p>Why will MM and PM allow their lawyer - Davinder Singh to apply for the bulk of CSJ's defense in his Affidavit to be deleted ?</p>
              <p>How is CSJ to defend himself and the SDP ?</p>

                  way into the courtroom to take his seat next to SDP chairman Mr Gandhi

              <p>This is an interesting point. If speaking about the NKF case, Durai got sentenced to three month in prison in which he has not served his term b second he managed to go out of the country n employed in UAE in spite of his status as a bankrupt. Richard Yong only served some month out of his 15 month jail term n is serving on home detention scheme.</p>

              <p>Was your question misinterpreted, or did you mean something more then the simple questions asked - which you has now surfaced in a more ''baiting manner" ?</p>
              <p>Did you read what CSJ had written that resulted in MM and PM feeling that their reputation had been affected ?</p>
              <p>Much has been linked even by participants in several forums - not least by our very venerable robbertteh in this Speakers' Corner.</p>
              <p>If I should claim that my reputation has been affected by your writing on a general topic of public interest - { such as your accusing participants in this thread as being ''sheep and wankers'' for their die-hard cynicism towards the MEW }  - and my over-sensitivity or guilt will demand that I see your acts as inflicting damage to my reputation - can you defend yourself in a litigation proceeding that I will take out on you for the many different ways that I will infer your writings to have affected me ?</p>
              <p>MM's conduct and attitude towards his political challengers in the 1997 election - Francis Seow, Tang Liang Hong and J.B.Jeyaratnam - is already indicative of the type of politics that he is prepared to sink to.</p>
              <p>Ironically, as the God Father adapt in such hard politics he will accuse a young puppy in CSJ to practice gangster politics.</p>
              <p>His remarkable comments in rebuttal to Dr Catherine Lim's writing is even more revealing of the hoodlum dressed in white.</p>
              <p>Could he be a sheep in wolf's clothing, or a wolf in white sheep wool ?</p>
              <p>Either way he strive to be No 1 - as a Sheep or as a Wolf - you got to be careful who you call next as ''sheep''.</p>
