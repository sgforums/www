              <h1>Singapore opposition leader fined for public speech</h1>
              <p>Chee has also been found guilty of defamation in cases filed by former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew and his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Singapore's high court has yet to rule on the amount of damages. (Reporting by Melanie Lee; Editing by Jan Dahinten and Sanjeev Miglani) - SINGAPORE, May 30 - A bankrupt Singapore opposition party leader was sentenced to five weeks in prison or pay a S$5,000 fine for speaking in public without a permit.</p>
              <p>Chee Soon Juan, leader of the Singapore Democratic Party, was on Friday found guilty of the offence committed on April 8, 2006. He has six outstanding charges of speaking in public without a license between November 2005 and April 2006.</p>
              <p>Singapore has tough laws on public gatherings, and protests are rare. An assembly of five or more people requires a police permit and offences under the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act could lead to fines as high as S$10,000 .</p>
              <p>Chee, who pleaded not guilty on the grounds of his constitutional right to free speech, was made a bankrupt in February 2006 when he failed to pay libel damages of S$500,000 to former prime ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong.</p>
              <p>"I continue to maintain that what I have done is well within the law and my constitutional rights," Chee told the court. Chee's lawyer M. Ravi said he will be appealing the conviction.</p>
              <p>The state prosecutor had asked for a "substantial fine" to act as a deterrent for other "like-minded" individuals.</p>
              <p>The Southeast Asian city defends its strict laws on public assembly citing the need for public order and safety.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Democratic Party is one of the more vocal opposition parties in Singapore. It did not get into parliament in the last election in 2006 and 82 of the 84 elected parliamentary seats are held by the ruling People's Action Party which has been in power since Singapore's independence in 1965.</p>
              <p>Chee has also been found guilty of defamation in cases filed by former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew and his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Singapore's high court has yet to rule on the amount of damages.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Sister of SDP chief Chee Soon Juan held in contempt of court</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Chee Siok Chin, the sister of Singapore Democratic Party’s
              (SDP) secretary—general, Chee Soon Juan, has been held in contempt of
              court, while the case against Mr Chee has been adjourned to Monday.</p>
              <p>Justice Belinda Ang had asked the Chees to explain on Friday why
              they should not be found in contempt of court for their behaviour
              during a three—day hearing at the High Court.</p>
              <p>The hearing was to
              determine the defamation damages to be awarded to Prime Minister Lee
              Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew by the SDP and the Chees.</p>
              <p>Justice Ang cited 15 incidences which she said had scandalised the court and impugned its dignity and authority.</p>
              <p>In
              response, Mr Chee asked for his hearing to be adjourned because his
              newly appointed lawyer, opposition politician JB Jeyeratnam, was still
              in Johor. However, Ms Chee’s case was heard in court on Friday.</p>
              <p>Her
              lawyer, M. Ravi, argued that the court had the power to warn parties
              during proceedings if they were in contempt, and that a cooling—off
              period could also have been given.</p>
              <p>He said that nothing was done
              till the end of the hearing, likening it to a "football referee issuing
              a player with a red card after the game has ended".</p>
              <p>"It is like
              playing a football match when the red card is given after the game is
              over. It does not have the effect — that was the parallel I was trying
              to draw to the court.</p>
              <p>"Therefore, the court ought to have
              considered that very carefully and ought to give a reasonable judgement
              in order to go to the next step of sentencing," Mr Ravi said.</p>
              <p>Ms Chee will be sentenced in court on Monday, before her brother’s hearing.— CNA/so</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Singapore opposition leader sentenced to jail for contempt</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE, June 2, 2008 (AFP) - A Singapore opposition leader who is
              among a rare few to publicly challenge the country's rulers was
              sentenced Monday to 12 days' jail for contempt, in the latest legal
              ruling against him.</p>
              <p>A judge ruled Chee Soon Juan, 45, secretary general of the Singapore
              Democratic Party (SDP), had been in contempt because he said justice
              had been "raped" and "kicked" during a defamation case filed by
              Singapore's leaders against him.</p>
              <p>He remains free but Supreme
              Court Justice Belinda Ang Saw Ean ruled that Chee will be jailed if he
              does not file an appeal by late Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Ang also sentenced Chee's sister, SDP member Chee Siok Chin, to 10 days in jail for contempt. She, too, is free pending appeal.</p>
              <p>Monday's
              hearing briefly brought Chee and the city-state's other outspoken
              opposition figure, J.B. Jeyaretnam, 82, together in a rare public
              joining of forces by the country's tiny opposition.</p>
              <p>Jeyaretnam
              appeared in court as Chee's lawyer but later withdrew at Chee's request
              when Ang declined his application for more time to prepare his case.
              The lawyer said he had only received relevant transcripts the previous
              morning.</p>
              <p>Jeyaretnam last month filed papers to register the new
              opposition Reform Party. He made political history in 1981 when he
              became the first opposition politician elected to parliament, which has
              been dominated by the People's Action Party (PAP) since 1959.</p>
              <p>Ang
              rejected Jeyaretnam's argument that she withdraw from the contempt
              case. He said that since the contempt allegations arose from an earlier
              hearing before her, there could be a public perception of bias.</p>
              <p>"I would urge your honour to consider very seriously whether you should hear this case," Jeyaretnam said.</p>
              <p>"There is no option," the judge responded.</p>
              <p>Chee,
              his sister, and their party have already been found guilty of libelling
              Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew and his son, Prime Minister
              Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>The contempt proceedings stemmed from comments
              they made during a three-day hearing before Ang last week to determine
              libel damages in that case.</p>
              <p>Chee told the judge he did not intend
              to be in contempt and anything said came in "the heat of the battle"
              with his political opponents.</p>
              <p>"Mr Lee had said a few things. I had countered them," Chee said.</p>
              <p>In
              2006 he was jailed for a then-unprecedented eight days for contempt
              after questioning the integrity of the judicial system in a statement
              he read during his bankruptcy hearing earlier that year.</p>
              <p>He was
              declared bankrupt after failing to pay 500,000 Singapore dollars
              (366,837 US) in libel damages to Lee Kuan Yew and another former prime
              minister over remarks made in 2001.</p>
              <p>Last Friday a judge fined
              Chee for speaking in public without a permit ahead of a general
              election in 2006. He will be jailed for five weeks if he does not pay
              the 5,000-dollar fine, the judge ruled.</p>
              <p>Chee has served previous jail terms for convictions on similar charges.</p>
              <p>His
              latest sentence came as a California-based blogger who allegedly
              accused Ang of "prostituting herself" appeared in another Singapore
              courtroom.</p>
              <p>According to a court document, Gopalan Nair is charged
              with insulting Ang by sending an email which said she "was throughout
              prostituting herself during the entire proceedings, by being nothing
              more than an employee of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his son and carrying out
              their orders".</p>
              <p>Nair's lawyer Chia Ti Lik told AFP the comments essentially repeated those Nair made in a recent blog about the defamation case.</p>
              <p>A US embassy spokesman said it is "monitoring the case closely."</p>
              <p>Nair, a former Singapore lawyer who is now a US citizen, was remanded in custody for another week.</p>
              <p>The
              Lees have already won hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages from
              past lawsuits against members of the country's opposition and say they
              need to protect their reputations from unfounded attacks.</p>

              <blockquote>At the beginning of the hearing this morning counsel for Ms Chee, Mr M
              Ravi, argued that the transcript Judge Ang used for citing instances of
              contemptuous conduct came from Merrill Legal Solutions, a company
              contracted to record and transcribe proceedings.<br> <br>The Lees' lawyers of Drew &amp; Napier had paid for Merrill's services. A copy of the transcript was then extended to Judge Ang.<br><br>Mr
              Ravi pointed out that documents that were relied on by the court had to
              be made available to all parties. The defendants were not provided
              copies of the full transcript.<br><br>When Dr Chee approached Merrill
              earlier, he was informed that because Drew &amp; Napier had applied for
              the transcription servicess, a copy could not be given to him. The
              defendant was told he would have to contact the Lees' lawyers.<br><br>Judge
              Ang ordered Mr Ravi to proceed to make submissions on Ms Chee's
              punishment. When counsel finished, the Judge sentenced Ms Chee to ten
              days imprisonment.</blockquote>
              <p>But CSJ hided the fact from you. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Singh explained to court</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">that it is SG legal profession practice for transcript company</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">gave a copy of transcript to Judge .(All experienced lawyers know.)</span></p>
              <p>Singh blasted Ravi accusations as baseless,among other things.</p>
              <p>In my views,Singh's law firm paid the transcript.Why did they</p>
              <p>need give a copy to Chees?</p>
              <p>I think public think Ravi need to keep himself more familiar with court</p>

              <p><br>I find this extremely amusing.</p>
              <p>In a normal court of law, the plaintiff is suppose to show cause and provide evidence to sustain his claim. The burden of proof is on the plaintiff.</p>
              <p>It's all different here, all the time I see CSJ the defendant providing evidence to prove his innocence. But all the time his questions was "skillfully" objected and upheld by the judge.</p>
              <p>If he can even ask any questions to provide evidence for calling LKY what he did. What form of impartial system is this?</p>
              <p>It seems like what they say is true, you are guilty of a crime until proven innocent. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
