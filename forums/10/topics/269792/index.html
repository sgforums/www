            <div class='col-md body'><strong>OCCASIONAL OVERSUPPLY, SO...<br><span class="large">THEY COMPETE FOR MEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT<br>FOREIGN STREETWALKERS GATHER OUTSIDE BANK </span><br>By Tan Mae Lynn<br><br>July 23, 2007       </strong><br><br>RED-LIGHT district? More like daylight district.<br><br>Spilling over: Geylang residents say that more and more of the women are venturing out of their normal territory (the even-numbered Lorongs). They solicit openly in the daytime (left) and take up space in the coffee shops where they sit and chat with Ah Peks. - Pictures: Hedy Khoo<br>It's 9am and one of the first sights that greets people in the Geylang area are foreigners who cater to sex tourists and others.<br><br>The women continue to mill about looking for customers as the day progresses, while office workers go for lunch and shoppers hunt for bargains.<br><br>The women, who appear to be mostly China nationals, are out and about despite the mid-day heat. They can be seen soliciting for customers.<br><br>That's not all.<br><br>As a result of fluctuating over-supply and 'competition', a number of them have moved out from the traditional zone between Lorong 4 and Lorong 22 to the opposite, odd-numbered streets - from Lorong 23 all the way to the shophouses and coffee shops at Aljunied Road and Sims Avenue.<br><br>Some are even seen loitering outside a bank along Geylang Road.<br><br>During a check on a Monday afternoon, The New Paper on Sunday team saw at least 10 women loitering outside the bank.<br><br>While some stood around the corner, others paraded in front of the bank's main entrance.<br><br>More women were seen at the coffee shop a few metres away.<br><br>Some of them sat chatting with older men, while other women gathered in small groups of two to four, waiting for customers.<br><br>The bolder women would approach men going into or leaving the bank.<br><br>For instance, a driver of a lorry parked near the bank was approached as soon as he opened his door.<br><br>Waving the woman away, he quickly made a dash into the bank lobby.<br><br>In another instance, a man who appeared to be in his 50s was about to enter the bank when a woman walked up to him and held his arm.<br><br>Smiling at the woman, he declined her advances.<br><br>A 29-year-old, who gave her name only as Miss Yani, works in an office near the bank. She said: 'I've seen them approach passers-by and even the bank patrons.'<br><br>A boutique owner, who wants to be known only as Mr Teo, 43, said the boundaries of the designated red-light area should be clear and not blurred by foreign streetwalkers who come for short periods to Singapore.<br><br>The New Paper on Sunday team observed the women in action over three days earlier this week.<br><br>Around lunch time, between 12pm and 2pm, a handful of these women start to appear outside the bank. Right above the bank is a hotel.<br><br>Other than bank customers, their main targets appear to be men in their 50s and 60s, who pack the coffee shops nearby.<br><br>When asked what he thought about the women, a middle-aged man who emerged from the bank smiled and said: 'If you just say, 'don't want' and walk off, they won't bother you.'<br><br>JUST EARNING A LIVING?<br><br>The man, who had turned down advances from one of the girls, added: 'Aiyah, they're just trying to earn a living.'<br><br>One woman in her 40s, who declined to be named, said: 'I don't usually go to this branch (of the bank) because it's very messy here. The girls are just outside.'<br><br>Even the bank's Cisco officer is not spared.<br><br>Pointing to a corner of the building just outside the bank, the officer said: 'Every day, they are here. They don't approach the customers inside, but outside, they do.<br><br>'When I get off my duty and wait for my transport, they will also approach me,' he said, shaking his head.<br><br>When contacted, a spokesman for the bank said it had not received any complaints from their customers.<br><br>The spokesman said: 'Our primary concern is the security of the branch and the safety of our customers. We will not hesitate to inform the police to reduce any disturbance if necessary.'<br><br>The girls also slow down traffic at the cross junction of Geylang Road and Aljunied Road.<br><br>We spotted cars stopping by the side of the road, with drivers winding down their windows to bargain with the prostitutes.<br><br>However, not everyone is complaining.<br><br>Newspaper vendor Mr Goh, 51, says business is brisk because cars pull up alongside to get publications and ogle at the sexily-clad women at the same time.<br><br>Some end up driving off with a publication in hand, and girl in passenger seat.<br><br>Mr Goh said: 'An hour later, they are back, and then the girls continue to wait for other customers.'<br><br>Some shop owners are also pleased that the girls are driving human traffic to the area.<br><br>A pawnshop operator, who wanted to be known only as Mr Yang, said: 'The place has become very lively because of them. The coffeeshop is now always so packed that it is impossible to get a seat there.<br><br>'All tables are taken up, but the people there are older men. If I see an empty seat, the men would usually say it's reserved for their friends.'<br><br>Mr Yang's shop is directly across the bank, at the intersection with Aljunied Road. The 40-year-old said several customers walk into his pawnshop with women in tow.<br><br>'They pawn items on the spot, just to get money to pay for the girl's services. It's obvious. The minute they get the cash, they hand it to the girl,' he said.<br><br>On the women's 'new' working hours, Mr Yang noted that they start work earlier than he does.<br><br>When he opens his shop's door every morning at 9, the prostitutes have already stationed themselves at the shops across the street.<br><br>That said, there are others who would prefer the women to be contained in the designated red-light district and not venture further beyond.<br><br>Mr Low Say Wee, 33, a bank officer who lives in a HDB estate five minutes from Geylang Road, questioned: 'What if they start soliciting elsewhere?'<br><br>One coffeeshop worker across the street from Mr Yang's shop said there are many girls who walk along the stretch of shophouses throughout the day.<br><br>He said: 'We just let them be. It doesn't really affect business. Their clients sit in the coffee shops.<br><br>'Anyway, there are too many of them, you can't chase them away.'<br><br>He added that plainclothes police officers check the area regularly.<br><br>'When the police come, the girls just run, but after that, they still come back.'<br><br>While prostitution is not an offence in Singapore, soliciting is not allowed.<br><br>Anyone who solicits for the purpose of prostitution or for any other immoral purpose can be fined up to $1,000.<br><br>On second conviction, offenders can be fined up to $2000 or jailed up to six months, or both.<br><br></div>

About 20 of them were later arrested.<br><br>Vice moving into the heartlands, including Tanjong Katong, Joo Chiat, Jurong and Toa Payoh, made news during that period.<br><br>Last year, the authorities also clamped down on dubious massage parlours sprouting in HDB neighbourhoods.<br><br>Last week, it was Redhill in the news. The New Paper reported on how residents were incensed when a lone woman in skimpy red lingerie took to the streets to flash her wares.<br><br>Spillovers from the red-light district?<br><br>In Geylang, the place is now buzzing with a stream of girls from China and Vietnam.<br><br>We spoke to observers in the area, who said most of these freelance prostitutes from China are here on social visit passes, and they have a limited time to earn money. So they work both day night to double their income.<br><br>They also work away from the usual areas.<br><br>Instead of just keeping to their traditional haunt - the 'even-numbered' Lorongs in Geylang - many have decided to expand their business to the nearby commercial area.<br><br>For instance, more than 10 foreign women were spotted outside a bank along Geylang Road as they tried to look for customers there.<br><br>One man, who knows brothel owners in Geylang, said the geographical expansion of vice activities is a matter of simple economics.<br><br>INCREASE IN SUPPLY<br><br>There appears to be an increase in the 'supply' of prostitutes in Geylang now, but the demand is the same.<br><br>So the women feel they need to find new territory and new customers.<br><br>He said that there is tough competition from Vietnamese girls in the traditional red-light area of Geylang.<br><br>Going rates for China prostitutes average $60 for an under-one-hour service.<br><br>But Vietnamese girls as young as 20 years old charge a lower rate of $30 to $40 at most..<br><br>'The not-so-good-looking, older China prostitutes have to venture farther - as far as Aljunied and beyond, because there is less competition,' he added.<br><br>Many of those who ply their trade away from the brothels are 'freelancers' who hire pimps at $10 a day to keep a lookout.<br><br>These 'freelancers' are hungry for money and out to capture more clients. So they push the boundaries.<br><br>That said, the residents do not want the women venturing further out to the periphery and beyond Geylang.<br><br>Mr Low Say Wee, 33, a bank officer, who lives in a HDB estate five minutes away from Geylang Road asked: 'What if they start soliciting in my neighbourhood next?'<br><br>'We hope the authorities could make them stay in the designated red-light district area, instead of letting them move out too far.'<br><br>The police often conduct raids against such offenders, especially when such activities annoy residents and workers in the area.<br><br>Last year, police arrested 4,300 women for vice activities. In 2005, the number was 3,220.<br><br>In a major anti-vice operation in 2005, cops busted a vice ring that brought in women from Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, China, Mongolia, Vietnam and Cambodia. More than 100 women were picked up.<br><br>Last year, the cops also cleaned up Chinatown when they arrested foreign women from the streets as well as certain massage parlours.<br><br>Private investigator Lionel De Souza, a former police officer of 26 years, said: 'In my day, they only operated in certain brothels in Geylang. Now, they are seen in other places as they are getting more aggressive, more brazen.'<br><br>He feels that prostitutes should be confined in a certain area, so that their activities can be policed easily and effectively.<br><br></div>
