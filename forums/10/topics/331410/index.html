By Seah Chiang Nee.</span><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br>Sep 20, 2008 </span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"MY PARENTS have been affected by my failure - my heavy losses in the stock market during the past year. Every night I am having nightmares,” one trader recently wrote.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">His S$30,000 savings meant to be a deposit for a flat evaporated during the downturn, particularly in recent weeks when shares went into a tailspin.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“My loss is beyond my means, it is very painful and I don’t know what my future is,” said the lower-middle-class bachelor.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“I had to strive to rebuild my life or else I would have committed suicide.”</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">He is one of a growing number of people here who are hard hit by the current US banking meltdown, which has reached Singapore.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">At the same time, hundreds of anxious insurance holders have been flocking to the head-office of AIA branch in Singapore to check on their policies after hearing news that its US parent company, AIG was facing bankruptcy. </span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">They wanted to cancel their policies, even if it meant losing in investment and coverage. That the US government is providing US$85bil bailout to AIG did not stop the crowd.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Monetary Authority of Singapore has appealed for calm among holders of its two million policies.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It also acted to protect customers of another US institution, Lehman Brothers, which declared bankruptcy by curtailing its operations here. It cannot remit funds to third parties without approval.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">These days being a world banking hub is beginning to look like a great idea turned sour for Singapore, particularly its investment in foreign banks, as the citizens are finding out.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The US meltdown is hitting this financial centre like a tonne of bricks at a time when it is already in the midst of an economic slowdown and super-high inflation.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">To be sure, the years of excesses of Wall Street have not been allowed to intrude into the financial district in Shenton Way, which remains tightly-regulated. The impact, however, is touching the lives of many people.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“The trouble is it’s all imported; no Singaporean bank is a casualty,” said an official.</span><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Some Singaporeans are, of course, hit worse than others, but collectively the damage is far more serious here than in other cities in the region.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Ironically, it is due to success in becoming a wealthy financial centre.</span><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The world’s top banks and brokerages have set up their regional offices here. Now their future remains under a cloud.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And when world banking is in turmoil, Singapore’s economy is shaken up.</span><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This sector will go through a general lull, if not decline, which will result in an exodus of foreign executives.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lehman Brothers’ operations in Singapore came to a halt on Monday, a day after it went into bankruptcy. The jobs of its 270 staff members may disappear.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This, and the bailout of AIG and other large US corporations, are sending shock waves throughout the financial industry.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The many professionals in Singapore - foreigners and Singaporeans - are deeply concerned about their jobs.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“It’s quite worrying,” one executive told a TV reporter. “We don’t know who will be the next target.”</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Any exodus of these highly-paid executives will aggravate an already poor property market, especially in office and residential rentals.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It may retard Singapore’s growth as a banking hub, at least until stability returns.</span><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">During the past 10 years, it has made financial services one of its four strategic pillars for growth.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Many of its global investments are in Western and Asian banks, which have set up operations here.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In addition, tens of billions of Temasek Holdings and GIC (Govern­ment Investment Corporation) money have gone into these investments.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">They couldn’t have been worse timed. Their values have been decimated.</span><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For Mr and Mrs Singapore, these are worrying times as the economic downturn begins to bite.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The worst appears to be the stock market, where many Singaporeans are invested. The index shares have fallen by 30% in the past year, but many other shares are down by as much as 50% to 60%.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Some life savings have been wiped out. Tens of thousands are groaning under the weight of large losses.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Other recent headlines, which are dealing fresh blows to Singaporeans, included the following:</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br><br>He is one of a growing number of people here who are hard hit by the current US banking meltdown, which has reached Singapore.<br><br><br><br></span><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">At the same time, hundreds of anxious insurance holders have been flocking to the head-office of AIA branch in Singapore to check on their policies after hearing news that its US parent company, AIG was facing bankruptcy.<br><br><strong>* </strong>Government data confirms that high inflation is eating into wage gains; average real earnings have fallen by 4% between April and June;</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">* Private home sales slumped 81% in August compared to a year ago, dropping from 1,723 to 320 units (partly affected by the Chinese Hungry Ghost Festival);</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">* Retail sales fell for the first time in four months as car sales slumped (by 8%) and consumers bought fewer luxury goods, mobile phones and computers; and</span><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">* Despite the price of oil falling by a third, the government controversially raised buses and train fares by four cents (10 sen), adding to the high inflation.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The US crisis may trigger off a global recession, including Singapore.</span><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">However, the city has a protective shield: its large reserves of US$300bil built up over the years and sound economic fundamentals.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If not for these, Singapore could be overwhelmed.</span><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But the ordinary people are a different story. With their real salaries down, they are vulnerable to any sustained unemployment and the relentless price increases.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">With half an eye on the 2011 election, the government is taking precautions. It will change the laws to allow it to dip into investment returns of the country’s reserves to offset rising costs of public services.</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It’s seen as a positive move, but also one that serves as a warning that life can get worse for the people.</span><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>(This was published in The Star on Sept. 20, 2008)</em><br></span><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="http://littlespeck.com/content/economy/CTrendsEconomy-080920.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://littlespeck.com/content/econo...omy-080920.htm</span></span></a> </p></div>

              <p>But China did not drag down our economy.</p>
              <p>USA political life is controlled by financial and corporate power, at least China has not degenerated into that state.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To get back to sovereignty and the structure of the state, another
                  cause of today's instability is that we now have a society in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">America,
                  Europe and much of the world which is totally dominated by the two
                  elements of sovereignty that are not included in the state structure:
                  control of credit and banking and the corporation.</span></p>
              <p>These are<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> free of
                  political controls and social responsibility, and they have largely
                  monopolized power in Western Civilization and in American society.</span> They
                  are ruthlessly going forward to eliminate land, labour,
                  entrepreneurial-managerial skills, and everything else the economists
                  once told us were the chief elements of production. The only element of
                  production they are concerned with is the one they can control: capital...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The administrative system and elections are dominated today by the
                  private power of money flows and corporation activities</span>. I want to read
                  you a summary from James Willard Hurst, "The Legitimacy of the Business
                  Corporation in the Law of the United States from 1780 to 1970". He
                  points out that there was powerful anti-corporation feeling in the
                  United States in the 1820's. Therefore, it was established by the
                  states that corporations could not exist by prescription: they had to
                  have charters. They had to have a limited term of life and not be
                  immortal. Corporations today are immortal: if they get charters, they
                  can live forever and bury us all. They had to have a limited purpose.
                  Who is giving us this bread made of sawdust? ITT: International
                  Telephone and Telegraph, the same corporation that drove Ivar Kreuger
                  to suicide in Paris in April 1931, when it actually was an
                  international telegraph corporation, controlled by J P. Morgan...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In USA and most other western states, the power of financial and corporate  interests has grown to be so great that they now dominate the political system.</p>
              <p>In China, however, the situation is different as the state still calls the shots and the influence of financial and corporate interests is still checked.</p>
              <p>We must not allow these two forces, financial and corporate power to wield such unchecked power as in the USA.</p>
              <p>This will lead to corruption and disruption activities such as the current financial crisis in USA.</p>

              <p>Financial powers are very arrogant and they have been seeking to control governments for long time already:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In addition to these pragmatic goals, the powers of financial
                  capital­ism had another far-reaching aim, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nothing less than to create a
                  world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the
                  politi­cal system of each country and the economy of the world as a
                  whole.</span></p>
              <p>This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the
                  central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements
                  arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences.</p>
              <p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">apex of
                  the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basle,
                  Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central
                  banks which were themselves private corporations.</span></p>
              <p>Each central bank, in
                  the hands of men like Montagu Norman of the Bank of England, Benjamin
                  Strong of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, Charles Rist of the Bank
                  of France, and Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbank<span style="text-decoration: underline;">, sought to dominate
                  its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate
                  foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the
                  country, and to influence cooperative politicians by sub­sequent
                  economic rewards in the business world...</span></p>
              <p>...It must not be felt that these<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> heads of the world's chief central banks
                  were themselves substantive powers in world finance. They were not. 
                  Rather, they were the technicians and agents of the dominant
                  invest­ment bankers of their own countries, who had raised them up and
                  were perfectly capable of throwing them down.</span></p>
              <p>The substantive
                  finan­cial powers of the world were in the hands of these investment
                  bankers (also called "international" or "merchant" bankers) who
                  remained largely behind the scenes in their own unincorporated private
                  banks. These formed a system of international cooperation and national
                  domi­nance which was more private, more powerful, and more secret than
                  that of their agents in the central banks.</p>
              <p>This dominance of investment
                  bankers was based on their control over the flows of credit and
                  invest­ment funds in their own countries and throughout the world. They
                  could dominate the financial and industrial systems of their own
                  coun­tries by their influence over the flow of current funds through
                  bank loans, the discount rate, and the rediscounting of commercial
                  debts; they could dominate governments by their control over current
                  gov­ernment loans and the play of the international exchanges...</p>
