              <p>I've read a financial forecast in late 2007, before the price of petrol soared to its peak, and the mortage woes in the US was little heard of. True enough, the economic depression will continue to get worse until end of this year perhaps.</p>
              <p>Well, don't put all your eggs in one basket they say. The guy is dumb enough to lose more than he can afford...and 30K isn't that much of a loss anyway. To some, its just the price of a wedding ring. :)</p>
              <p>China economy was still going strong due to being the host of 2008 Olympics. They're already starting to feel the impact of the US market crash. Coupled with the typhoons in our neighbouring countries, the falling trust of China manufactured goods resulting in lower foreign investments, and the poor politicial image portrayed by the Chinese government, I'd not be surprised when they're hit badly soon. Singapore will be affected a lot too, and while our government will say we're fine to encourage more consumer spending, they themselves know the truth after being burnt badly in failed foreign investments.</p>

              <p>Letting off steam is a healthy way to maintain our sanity but of course after letting off we have to cool down and start thinking.</p>
              <p>Actually with all the education we have nowadays we should start to participate in issues that affect our lives. We should let our views and unhappiness with the various issues or policies be known so that the authorities can't take us for granted.</p>

              <h1 class="headline"><a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/23/business/AS-Singapore-Wealth-Fund.php">Singapore GIC: financial turmoil may not be over</a></h1>
              <p>A Singapore sovereign wealth fund that bought large stakes in banks
              UBS AG and Citigroup Inc. warned Tuesday that the worst of the U.S.
              financial crisis may not be over even if Washington implements a US$700
              billion bailout plan.</p>
              <p>The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, or GIC, said the
              current turmoil in the U.S. banking system will likely undermine the
              future earnings of the fund, which manages more than US$100 billion.</p>
              <p>"The proposal put forth by the U.S. Treasury should stabilize the
              markets to some extent," said GIC Deputy Chairman and Executive
              Director Tony Tan at a news conference. "But we should not assume the
              worst is over. Financial markets and the economic situation have
              deteriorated significantly in the last five months."</p>
              <p><strong>GIC</strong> also <strong>regretted the timing of its investment in the two banks —
              US$9.75 billion in UBS in December and US$6.9 billion in Citigroup in
              January — said Chief Investment Officer Ng Kok Song.</strong></p>
              <p>"We would have liked the timing of the investments to be better," Ng said. "But these are long-term investments."</p>
              <p>"We were surprised by the onset and magnitude of the market turmoil
              starting in July 2007," Ng said in a statement. "What seemed like a
              contained problem of delinquencies in U.S. sub-prime mortgages quickly
              spread to other segments of the credit markets."</p>
              <p>GIC, which began investing Singapore's reserves in 1981, said its
              annual profit for the last 20 years averaged 7.8 percent in U.S. dollar
              terms. Tan refused to say what the fund's earnings were last year or
              specify how much it manages.</p>
              <p>"Given the present challenging conditions and the problems in the
              world economy, it is unrealistic to expect that we will achieve such
              high returns going forward as in the past," Tan said.</p>
              <p>Singapore's other sovereign wealth fund, Temasek Holdings, said last
              month that earnings doubled to US$12.8 billion in its fiscal year
              ending March 31, bringing total assets to US$131 billion.</p>
              <p>GIC said it invests 44 percent of its portfolio in public equities,
              26 percent in bonds and 10 percent in real estate. It invests 35
              percent in Europe, 34 percent in the U.S. and 23 percent in Asia.</p>
              <p>Former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew is GIC's chairman and his son, current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, is a deputy chairman.</p>

              <p>Don't give up on the Govt's long term investment just yet. By long term, the govt probably means 30 years and beyond.</p>
              <p>By saying that it's long term,, if the returns were to be negative, they would have been fertilizers already.</p>
              <p>On the positive side, If the returns were to be good, you'll be a granny by then.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
