            <div class='col-md body'>An excerpt of a recent query by Steve Chia during Parliment. Let's see what everyone's view is on this.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>MARRIAGE RESTRICTION POLICY<br><br>11.  Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) under what basis can the appeal of a Singapore citizen who had a relationship with an ex-work permit holder, resulting in the birth of a child, be granted approval for marriage; and (b) in view of our declining population figure, will such relationships resulting in the birth of a child be given easier approval for marriage by the Ministry.<br><br>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi) (for the Minister for Manpower):  Sir, there are presently more than 500,000 foreign work permit holders in Singapore. To maintain our social equilibrium, these large numbers of foreign workers are allowed to work in Singapore only if they agree to our marriage restriction policy. Those who marry without approval will be repatriated and disallowed entry into Singapore. This is made clear to all foreign worker applicants who apply to work in Singapore. This strict enforcement is necessary to maintain this policy. Therefore, all current and ex-work permit holders are reminded to adhere to this pre-condition to which they have agreed upon.<br><br>Appeals will be considered on an individual basis.<br><br>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):  Sir, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary has not answered my question.  How then can the child, who is born out of wedlock from a Singaporean and an ex-work permit worker, where they did not get married, but they have a relationship and a child was conceived in that process, now be able to live in an intact family in Singapore?  Under what basis would the Ministry allow approval for the marriage to pass through?<br><br>Mr Hawazi Daipi:  To start with, they are not allowed to live here and, more so, to have children.  It is precisely because we have to control the population size of Singapore that we have to have this condition agreed upon when a foreign worker applies to work in Singapore.  So he knows that he cannot contravene this marriage restriction policy and if he wants to get married to a potential Singaporean spouse, he has to seek approval.  But if he is not given approval, he may be repatriated.<br><br>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:  Sir, a mistake has been made by the child's parents where they actually entered into a relationship and have a child.  In view of Singapore's declining population, is it not a helpful addition to the population when we have some new children being born for the sake of Singapore?  Basically, my question is:  why is the Ministry so "cruel" as to "punish" the child by not allowing their parents to get married and stay together as an intact family?<br><br>Mr Hawazi Daipi:  Sir, the Ministry is not "cruel".  In fact, we consider applications for marriage between Singaporeans and ex-work permit holders on an individual basis and allow, whenever possible, where they meet the conditions.  However, we have to protect the interests of Singaporeans. As I have said earlier, we have more than 500,000 foreigners working in Singapore and larger numbers of them used to work in Singapore.  So imagine if every other ex-work permit holder were to marry a Singaporean, we would not be able to manage our social services and social system.  So I think Mr Chia must bear this in mind and be fair to Singaporeans in general first.<br><br>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:  The Senior Parliamentary Secretary has not answered my question.  Under what basis would an appeal be approved?  The application for one of the residents was rejected after an appeal.  I am trying to find out what is the basis for approval.<br><br>Mr Hawazi Daipi:  Sir, we would consider on an individual basis the merits of the application. But, generally, all work permit holders know that they have agreed to abide by the marriage policy in Singapore before they are allowed to obtain a work permit and work in Singapore.  That is the condition that all work permit applicants must understand and adhere to. To be fair to potential children of the future, they must ensure that they have to get approval to get married.<br><br>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:  May I please ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary how many such cases have been approved on a case-by-case basis?  And of these cases that have gotten approval, how many have become dependent on our social support services?  In other words, have they been responsible enough to take care of their own families?<br><br>Mr Hawazi Daipi:  Sir, I do not have the figures here.  But in any case, what is more important is to ensure that everyone - Singaporeans and foreign workers working in Singapore - understands that Singapore is a small place and we have limited resources.  Even though we want to increase our population size, we have to ensure that those who want to live and have families in Singapore can look after themselves, their children and their families. That is the basic premise that we all must understand.  I can only go back to the earlier answer that I have given that all foreign workers who want to work in Singapore must understand and agree to abide by this basic principle.<br><br>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:  Sir, if the Singaporean father undertakes to take care and raise up a child with his own resources, is that a good enough undertaking for approval?<br><br>Mr Hawazi Daipi:  A child would need a motherly figure to look after him.  A father alone would not be able to do that, no matter how much the father earns or is able to afford to look after the child.  So it is very important.  If we want to be really fair to the child, we have to understand the marriage restriction policy.  And if they qualify, then they get married.  But wherever possible, ex-work permit holders can be allowed to marry Singaporeans on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):  I would like to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary whether a marriage can take place, under universal law, at any place on earth and does not require the approval of the Singapore Government.  The Singapore Government can only grant permission to get married in Singapore, as a result of which, with our approval, they can gain residential status in Singapore.  Is that a fact?<br><br>Mr Hawazi Daipi:  Can the Member simplify his question?<br><br>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:  My question is whether anyone would need the approval of Government to get married.<br><br>Mr Hawazi Daipi:  No, only for work permit holders and this is a specific group of people.<br><br>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:  Including work permit holders, they can get married anywhere in the world without our approval.<br><br>Mr Hawazi Daipi:  Yes, it is a universal human right. However, Singaporeans do have human rights to be able to look after ourselves and manage our limited resources and to ensure that those legitimate Singaporeans would be well looked after and would not exact too much of our social system.<br><br>Mr Speaker:  Last question, Mr Steve Chia.<br><br>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:  Does it mean that if the ex-work permit holders are to get married overseas, they will be allowed to stay in Singapore as an intact family?<br><br>Mr Hawazi Daipi:  The simple answer is no, Sir.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not sure about the rule. But I believe the child automatic has the right to be a Singapore citizen if he is reported to the authority on birth (believe there is a time limit, but usually enough time to do the report). So, in this case, there is no issue of the child getting Singapore citizenship.<br><br>The issue now is that if the parents are allowed to register their marriage in Singapore. I do not know the benefit of doing this. But if I am right, it may help in the future application of the foriegn spouse concern to eventually get PR or citizenship status. I am unsure as to what other benefit there maybe in getting their marriage registered in Singapore. Perhaps key to this is the PR/Citizenship thing which allows the foriegn spouse to get PR/Citizenship and hence stay in Singapore to take care of the Family.<br><br>What is strange here is this -  If the foriegn spouse has never been on a working permit is Singapore, no problem. The problem only comes up if the foriegn spouse was once a work permit holder.</div>
