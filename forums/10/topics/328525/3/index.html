              <p><strong>Anwar wins big victory in Malaysia by-election</strong></p>
              <p><cite class="auth">Reuters - <span><strong>Wednesday, August 27</strong></span></cite></p>
              <p class="first">By Jalil Hamid</p>
              <p>PERMATANG PAUH, Malaysia - Anwar Ibrahim scored a big victory in a key Malaysian by-election on Tuesday, a leading news portal said, enabling the country's best known opposition politician to challenge for power.</p>
              <p>Anwar, whose campaign to win the seat vacated by his wife has been dogged by new charges of sodomy, has said he will start talks with MPs from the governing Barisan Nasional coalition to initiate a confidence vote to topple the government.</p>
              <p>Influential news portal Malaysiakini reported that Anwar had won by 16,210 votes over his challenger from Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi's United Malays National Organisation .</p>
              <p>Anwar's party had already claimed he was "far ahead".</p>
              <p>Political analysts had said he needed to win by at least the 13,388 vote margin his wife achieved when she contested the seat in March's general election. The official result is due at around 9 p.m. .</p>
              <p>Victory had been widely predicted for the man who was once deputy prime minister and seemed destined to become UMNO leader and prime minister.</p>
              <p>Anwar's meteoric rise to power ended abruptly when he was imprisoned in the late 1990s on what he says were trumped up sodomy and corruption charges.</p>
              <p>Anwar denies the new sodomy charges made by a 23-year old male aide and says if he wins power he will sweep away economic and social privileges for ethnic Malays in education and the civil service, policies he endorsed when in power.</p>
              <p>PATH TO POWER NOT CLEAR</p>
              <p>It is not yet clear whether Anwar can win a confidence vote in parliament, which he has said he will call for in September.</p>
              <p>So far, none of the 30 MPs from the Barisan Nasional coalition that Anwar needs has indicated in public an inclination to join the 82 MPs from Anwar's alliance, which would give him a majority in the 222-member parliament.</p>
              <p>The by-election campaign was punctuated by complaints of ill-treatment, corruption and vote rigging from both sides.</p>
              <p>Anwar supporters called foul in parliament as the government on Tuesday submitted a bill requiring suspects to give DNA samples for a second reading in a nearly empty chamber.</p>
              <p>They fear the law could be used to tamper with evidence so as to incriminate him at his new trial, which starts on September 10.</p>
              <p>Around 4,000 riot police were deployed in the sleepy constituency in northern Malaysia to prevent clashes, although no violence was reported.</p>
              <p>Economic concerns, rather than the sodomy charges against the 61-year old, topped the list of voter worries according to opinion polls.</p>
              <p>Inflation in this Asian nation of 27 million has surged to 27-year highs and the ringgit currency has fallen to 9-month lows against the dollar, while the stock exchange is close to its year lows.</p>

              <p>I agree with you 100%. The context of Popularity, as in my earlier post, refers to the public adoption or the causes that CSJ is/was fighting for.</p>
              <p>His antics are outright pointless and a nuisance to the general good. If the "someone" claimed that CSJ had a strategy behind his actions, please ask the "someone" to read the following Wiki article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chee_Soon_Juan">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chee_Soon_Juan</a> and enlighten us, what was he trying to achieve since 1992?</p>
