            <div class='col-md body'>Health and education ministries reviewing fees for PRs and foreigners<br>By Farah Abdul Rahim, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 03 December 2006 1918 hrs<br><br>Related Videos<br>Health and education ministries reviewing fees for PRs and foreigners<br><br>SINGAPORE: Singapore citizens will always come first, before Permanent Residents and non-citizens, says Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.<br><br>That is why the health and education ministries are now working on changes to reduce fee subsidies for non-citizens, so that foreigners do not enjoy the same benefits as Singaporeans.<br><br>The next offset package for the GST increase will be for Singaporeans only, just like the Progress Package earlier this year, said Prime Minister Lee.<br><br>This is because the Government's responsibility is to Singaporeans first, although Permanent Residents and foreign workers will remain priorities.<br><br>"While we have non-citizens here, citizens always come first. We have to treat them as the best, we have to treat visitors well too but citizens have to be treated better," Mr Lee said.<br><br>"Right now, PRs enjoy the same subsidies as Singaporeans for education and healthcare, and in fact in healthcare, foreign workers also receive subsidised treatment. I think we should make a clear difference Â– PRs should pay more than Singaporeans but less than other foreigners, there is a distinction.<br><br>"If you are not a PR and not a citizen, you should be given good treatment but we will not give you special privileges."<br><br>For education, Mr Lee said there are plans to charge non-citizens more, but not to set fees so high that foreign students will not come.<br><br>While for healthcare, foreign workers will have to bear the full costs of their medical bills.<br><br>Halimah Yacob, Chairman of the GPC for Health, said that employers of foreign workers should do a proper costing to cover their full healthcare need so that Singaporeans would not end up paying for them. She also hopes that employers will not ignore the needs of these foreign workers.<br><br>"We got feedback from many Singaporeans and even from my own constituents that since everything's equal for Singaporeans, foreigners and PRs, what's so special about being Singaporean? To some extent, short of being nationalistic, PM's message of 'citizens first' is well overdue. It'll be much appreciated among Singaporeans who are wondering what's in it for me holding that red passport," said Zaqy Mohamad, MP of Hong Kah GRC.<br><br>More details about the review will be announced by the respective ministries over the next few months. - CNA/so<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: orange;"><strong>So...in past, the foreigners had been getting subsidys from our ''good and generous'' govt.  Now, the govt are adjusting the fees higher for foreigners...what about the locals?<br><br>I can say, we have lost billions of dollars to subsidize foreigners at the expense of the poor peasants or singaporeans.  These show how ''good'' is our govt. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  </strong></span></span><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">If the head of state has to go on air to tell whole world that we have to treat our own people better than outsiders - THEN SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY SERIOUSLY WRONG!
