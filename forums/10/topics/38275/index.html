So, as a security measure, they want more stringent inspections of motorcycles and cars entering the country," Abdullah said</span> after launching the Ninth National Handicapped People's Day celebration at the Putra World Trade Centre.<br><br>Abdullah, who is also Home Minister, was commenting on Singapore's announcement that it was tightening boarder controls with Malaysia and subjecting all cars and motorcycles entering from Johor Baru to more stringent measures.<br><br>Announcing the move in Singapore Parliament was Minister of Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng, who said it was designed to thwart any attack by Islamic radicals as a war against Iraq appeared imminent.<br><br>Wong said Singapore remained a target and that it was concerned that extremists linked to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network might retaliate for Washington's action by hitting Asian targets such as Singapore, which has big expatriate population.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Meanwhile, in Jelebu, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim described Singapore's move as "a direct signal that it is suspicious of Malaysians".</span><br><br>"The move is also a direct signal that they do not want Malaysians to go there anymore. Perhaps, it wants to be on its own ... an island unto itself."<br><br>Rais, who is also Jelebu MP, was speaking to reporters after launching a reunion of students and teachers of Sekolah Menengah Dato' Undang Musa Al-Haj near here.<br><br>The minister said Singapore might have resorted to such move as it did not want to see "extra incoming materials" contravening its laws.<br><br>"The way Singapore handles it, however, is being misspelt across the causeway. Malaysia can do likewise but it has been very practical ...live and let's live.<br><br>"We will not do such things to Singapore vehicles."</span><br></div>

Still nothing more is to be done to improve the economic environment to boost its prospect and give confidence to all sectors of the business and manufacturing communities.<br><br>One can only wonder if our SGP Ministers deserve to be paid their MILLION Dollar Salary, when everything that they do, is dependent on a US$1000 salaried Saddam Hussein, and a George Bush who is paid only US$150,000 per month (or is per year ?).<br><br></div>

These Specialist Advisers are the normal salaried worker, like any salaried worker from the Singapore Citizenry.<br><br>What then does the Government Leaders actually do, to deserve the "Million Dollar" Package, when almost everything in the world that can affect Singapore is beyond their control, and all others that are within their control are performed by ordinary Singaporeans in their employ ?<br><br>The Government Leaders can be compared to the work done of the Director, Manager, Supervisor, Foreman, or even the Section Head. If you have seen the way these guys work in some organisation, then you wonder if they truly deserve the pay package that they are being paid.<br><br>To make matters worse, the Singapore Inc is formed not by the private capital from these "Directors of Singapore", but with the capital coming from the enterprise and contribution of ordinary Singaporeans, who have little say in how much of OUR money should go to pay for the salary of these "Directors of Singapore Inc".<br><br>In Public Listed Companies, the shareholders will be peeved if they see the C.E.O and Directors of the Board paying themselves better than the average shareholder benefits, and will scream when they are continuously paid high remunerations even when the Company is NOT performing at all.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have made very relevant points that shows your perceptive observations of current events.<br><br>At times I wonder if the Government realise that Singapore was a great trading post, made possible by the tremendous enterprise of the migrant communities that formed Singapore - even during the Colonial Days.<br><br>The indomitable and ambitious spirit of entreprenuerships from the PRIVATE Merchants, Tradesmen, Artisans, Laborers and Unskilled Workers have created dreams that led to the foundation of Singapore.<br><br>With or Without the Government, Singapore will be Singapore, as Hong Kong has become Hong Kong even without any interference from Government policies and regulatory inputs.<br><br>The Singapore Government had interfered with the laissez-faire system established since the founding of Singapore, and has brought us one full circle to events in the historical past - and in the process doused the flame of enterprise and entrepreneurship which is currently being lamented.<br><br>Since the 1950's, Singapore was serviced by more then six to eight bus companies that were ALL PRIVATELY owned. The bus fares were strictly regulated to prevent unwarranted price hikes that affect the cost of transportation and enriching the Private Owners.<br><br>Without the price hike reviews, and with tight fare controls, the bus operators were caught between the pressures to upgrade their operations with newer buses, and to keep their costs down.<br><br>By 1970's, the Government of Independent Singapore, decided that it was not efficient to have bus companies owned and operated Privately; and forced the various companies to amalgamate or to be closed.<br><br>Subsequently, the entire bus transport system was basically NATIONALISED, for the simple reason of efficiency and less wastage of resources, that was to result in higher standards with better transport costs controls resulting in affordable fares.<br><br>The full circle has now returned, with more bus companies appearing (supplementary services) to support the three main stream companies (SBS, Translink, CCS).<br><br>Although newer buses have appeared, the bus fares have seen tremendous hikes, when compared to those charged before, and when compared to similar size operation and standards as found in Hong Kong. (It is ironical that the Privately operated Bus Companies were prevented from any fare hikes in the 1950's).<br><br>This is only one part of the full circle experience, as the same reasons were given to remove the many Privately Owned Taxi services; and the full circle now returning with many taxi companies being formed today but all State Owned through GLCs.<br><br>With or without the Singapore Government, the ingenuity of the Singapore business spirit will continue to SILENTLY develop without too much fanfare.<br><br>The fear of most Singapore businessmen is that any good idea that becomes big, will attract the interest of the Government, who will form competitive businesses to take a cut of the market share for their own treasury.<br><br>From the Privately Owned Race Horse Betting, to Supermarkets, to Ship Buildings, to Transportation, to armed Security Service, to Beer and Soft Drinks manufacturing, to processor chip manufacturing, to services such as architectural and engineering consultancy, to Software Development - and too many to be named - the Government has used legislations to thwart private enterprise, or to compete with private enterprise so as to prevent wealth from being accumulated in the hands of the privileged and enterprising.<br><br>A new class of wealthy rich now exist, which come from a new route that is NOT from Private INGENUITY and ENTERPRISE, but through correct political association with the correct Political Party.<br><br>Even before the call to develop a "Second Wing", the private businessmen has already spread far and wide, and with more success than the Government led efforts in Suzhou, and investments in the purchases of over inflated prime properties in several major cities of the developed world.<br><br>Government should remain in the realm of governance, and leave Business to the Business Community.<br><br>This can never be accepted by our Singapore Government, as their superiority complex have given them the belief that they are the talented few - the "creme-de-la-creme" of what little talent can be found in Singapore - and that there is nothing beyond their ability to handle.<br><br>It is not too surprising that there can be contradictions in the opinions between the PM and the DPM, when the full cycle of contradiction in Government Policies can also happen.<br><br></div>
