              <p><br>So you know LHL personally enough to claim that he did not worked for his position?</p>
              <p>What do you think LHL did for each positions that he had worked for? Playing Nintendo Wii? Surfing internet and listening to mp3? Flirting with pretty secretaries? Shopping on Ebay for stuffs to buy for his wife? Making phone calls and smsing Julia Roberts?</p>

              <p>This country will not survive another five years with the PAPist at the helm, LOL. Very soon, even oppositions have to look for "foreign talents" to contest in elections if you look at how many citizens are left in this country. If citizens still got no balls to vote for oppositions, then too bad, we might not even have time like this to post comments on forums. Jobs like service line, some of them are already running 12 hrs six days a week work life.Good luck to every citizen, we will need it very soon. - *facepalm</p>

              <p><br>Yar same I will vote for PAP if Singaporeans are allowed dual citizenship.... I also would like them to abolish the rule that citizens with private property must sell their property then can buy HDB flats.... If possible there should be no waiting time before I'm allowed to sell said properties.... and relax the laws for foreign ownership of Singapore properties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PAP for life! ....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheaper, better and faster.... so when I'm old can afford more maids</p>
