              <p><br>So you are saying it was a wake up call?  Agreed.  I have been advocating fellow Singaporeans to buckle up all these while - read my other topic "If you leave Singapore, where would you go?"</p>
              <p>The impression I gather at that topic is that most of the people who contribute to that forum tend to like whinning and complaint a lot about FT's.  Where the real path to salvation is self-reliance and unending self-improvement.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, for LHL to come out talking now about realizing Singaporeans' ill-preparedness 10 years late is kinda disappointing.  If he was sincere about it, then the government is not worth the money we pay for.</p>
              <p>Think Singapore was caught in the middle of a global competition, and though we were not ready for FT's we needed to go along with the "reinventing Singapore" policy, and we are patching up the holes as we go along.  But this is just my view...  Not easy for our leaders, and let's see how they do it without hurting the real natives too much.</p>

              <p><br>Not to worry, Suharto is not as effective as our PM, Suharto tooks illegal high income to be an effective leader, our PM takes legal high income and therefore he is more effective and smarter than Suharto. You can bring a leader down if what he is doing is legal.</p>

              <p>LHL's comments about Suharto's leadership and how Singapore has benefitted are just political talks people....don't take it seriously.</p>
              <p>Some Suharto's  "Guru's" and trusted people are still trying to tap the nation's wealth for personal gains, <strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">"keeping up the tradition"</span></strong> you know...</p>
              <p>Btw, how are Singaporeans dealing with FT these days, do we owe it up and deal with it head on?  Our way of "keeping up the tradition" is probably - whine, complaint, hope for government to do something, feel happy for a small gesture (that looks like solving the problem but not really), feel indifferent, then happy again....</p>

              <p>LOL!!!Ya,i have also read the news.LHL said that his "idol" was Suharto,i mean what,the leader who watch his countrymen kill other races of fellow countrymen (Chinese who lived in Indonesia) n do nothing about it?...</p>
              <p>Ok guys,i dont want to say this....But actually,my "idol" is Adolf Hitler n Joseph Stalin,i admire Hitler for wiping out Jews although they are also German in Nationality,and Stalin for killing thousands or even millions of his own countrymen n women just to keep in power.</p>
              <p>Now,do i win LHL n get a cookie?</p>

              <p>it's ironical that suharto discriminated against the chinese by restricting them from the public sector and yet the biggest chinese businesses today were set up during his era. 10 in 10 times i travel round indonesia, I will see local indon workers at the shop front and the chinese sitting at his little desk behind counting the money.</p>
