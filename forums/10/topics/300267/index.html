            <div class='col-md body'>Sheik Abu Saqer, a prominent Gaza-based preacher, a founder of the Sword of Islam terror group and a subscriber to the ideology of al-Qaida, explained if Islam controls the U.S., all American women, whether Muslim or not, must cover their hair.<br><br>"This is the demand of our religion. Being and walking naked doesn't mean that you are enjoying more freedom; it means that you are going against Allah's laws and you are serving the enemies of Islam who want to empty our Islamic society from its values. Uncovered heads is a form of nudity."<br><br>Yasser Hamad, a cleric and a Hamas leader in the northern West Bank, explained in "Schmoozing" Islamic law enforcers would at first try to persuade American woman to cover their heads, but eventually females would be forced. Those women who refuse may be stoned.<br><br>Asked by Klein whether stoning was too harsh a punishment, Hamad replied:<br><br>"If you don't respect the local law in America, if you don't pay taxes, if you drive on a red light, aren't there sanctions used against you by your government? Of course there are and it's okay with you. Why is there a problem when it comes to the Islamic state that wants to impose its rules?"<br><br>Hamad and other terror leaders stated all Jews and Christians living in the U.S. once Islam takes over would need to pay the jizya Â– a special protection tax Â– and other special taxes for non-Muslims, including one for the right to cultivate land. Non-Muslims cannot own land themselves.<br><br>Saqer said no new synagogues or churches can be built in the Islamic state. Existing houses of worship may remain, but services cannot be conducted loudly or in any public fashion. The ringing of church bells or blowing of the ceremonial Jewish shofar would be forbidden, the terror leaders said.<br><br>[...]<br><br>In "Schmoozing," the terrorists stress repeatedly their goal is a worldwide Islamic caliphate.<br><br>"We see already in America a nucleus of Islam, a base for Islam. This will become bigger, stronger, more important, until Islam will take control and will seize the power in America and the world," said Faraj.<br><br>Abdel-El affirmed, "America will be overthrown. We are seeing more and more signs that prove that the process had already started."</div>
