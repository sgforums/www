            <div class='col-md body'>When this article first appeared back in 2002, I was quite amused that so many Â“ProfessionalsÂ” were piqued by Philip YeoÂ’s remarks that seem to border on total irreverence for the title that is awarded in recognition of the years of serious and diligent hard work.<br><br>His intention was not to belittle the title and work responsibility of a Professor, but was probably an attempt to educate the tertiary students that Â“real workÂ” begins when one becomes a Professor.<br><br>In the field of bioscience technology, the highly qualified Professor will be totally involved in research in a personal capacity, which can hardly be delegated in its entirety.<br><br>His personal involvement can be likened to a factory level worker tinkering away to complete a basic task, so as to contribute to the final whole.<br><br>Towards this end, a business tycoon such as Li Ka Shing or Wee Cho Yiaw, will probably be totally immersed in the daily activities of their huge conglomerate, poring through reports of the performance of each individual units that make up the larger unit - much like that of an ordinary manager whom they would employ.<br><br>Even Sim Wong Hoo will probably be as much involved in the progress of his many research teams, and putting his own Â“two centsÂ” worth if needed.<br><br>The continued success of Singapore - with some degree of permanance - will have to depend on something more substantial then the past involvement with the manufacturing of basic consumer items to earn foreign exchange.<br><br>If one is to look back at SingaporeÂ’s arrival at the First World Status, one can hardly see the actual substance that propel us to such a status - as one would find in the other First World Countries.<br><br>Do we have the industrial energy and structure as Japan, or even Taiwan?<br><br>Do we have the critical mass of R+D Products that carry the local innovative mark that is acceptable to the world, and from which we can derive our source of wealth?<br><br>Do we have any product of substance that is similar to the Swiss fame in watches, and high precision equipment?<br><br>Unlike the substance of Japan Â– with its SONY, NISSAN, FUJI, HONDA, MITUSBISHI, TOYOTA, CANON, and the other famous marques not listed here; or that from Korea Â– with its SSANGYONG, HYUNDAI, L G, DAEWOO; SingaporeÂ’s success and arrival at First World Status is largely due to the financial dealings that result in a massive accumulation of Foreign Exchange in our Treasury that is beyond the size of any other island state, with a minuscule population compared to other First World Countries.<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s success is liken to a pack of cards, that tremble nervously whenever there is a strong breeze or sneeze, or a gigantic tremor when someone accidentally shake the table; as was seen in the last three economic crisis in 1987, 1997 and 2003.<br><br>To achieve real First World status, we need to have more Singapore researched products that carry world status marques, similar to CREATIVE.<br><br>This need not be in manufacturing, nor in technology, but can also extend into any realms of human endeavor; so long as it generates world acceptance that earn revenue for Singapore, and not creating wealth by internally generated consumption leading to accumulation of locally collected revenue making up the bulk of our Reserves.<br><br></div>
