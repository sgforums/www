But do remember the show is a Taiwanese political show meant for the Taiwanese audience. It was not intended for Singaporean audience anyway. Get this point right before arguing.<br><br>I see no harm in them commenting on Singapore. They are the outsiders and sometimes outsiders can have a clearer picture of the political arena of a nation as they have not being influenced by it in one way or the other.

Taiwanese are generally very concerned about their politics and political development unlike Singaporeans. Hence they have lot of political shows going around.

Maybe I shd use the term ROC. KMT was 'routed' there and the Red Army stopped, thinking that would be sufficient. You didn't know the KMT was routed from Chongqing, Nanjing and other escapes? It was the KMT that declared ROC. Today, many still call that island Taiwan - its original name long before KMT and CPC !<br>Don't pick over small issue lah! See the big picture!</div>

They give better service than the so-called great egoistic Silliporeans who I can't see them doing any good work but has a lot of bad words.</div></blockquote>You say foreigners give better service,then do u know why?Becoz if they earn $1000 sing dollars,when they went back to their own country,it is double or even triple than what they get at their homeland.<br><br>Whereas if a Singaporean earn $1000,he cant double or triple that one-thousand dollars becoz he eat,drink n "live permanently" here,and that one thousand dollars is not much to you if u are a Singaporeans n have no where to run,of coz you will has a lot of bad words!!!<br><br>But do remember one point,that is the so-called good services that foreigners provide wont last long,once they earn enough money,they will say bye bye to this fuk up island country!!!I have met many foreigners who work here,most of them have no intention of staying here forever.They tell me that they still love their own countries n once they earn enough money,they will leave.And if our economy falls,they definitely wont stay behind to help us.Is this what you miss about their "better service"?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
