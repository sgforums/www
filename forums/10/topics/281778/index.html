If they are stating facts and reality of PAP regime, I don't see any thing wrong of them to bring up.   In fact, the more people from other countries dig out the dirt of PAP the better for our local media can't do it, let other foreign media do it.</div></blockquote>Listen here, i am not an anti government person, i feel there is an need to reform the government, but not to the extreme of overthrown the whole government, our local media is f u c ked up, and everyone knows that, but one thing is for sure, we must give credit to PAP have put into this nation,<br><br>time after times, i have been cursing at that LHL policy, if anyone is allow to curse at the government, it should be, the citizen of singapore, not from any other country, do you think, PAP would even give a damn to foreign media, the answer is no, Taiwan is making enemy with singapore, that is the last thing, they should do, after all, we didn't sign the FTA with american, japan, for nothing,<br><br>we are the leading nation among ASEAN, seriously, compare with, what is happening in Myanmar or how malaysia is treating the chinese as second class citizen, i will be damn glad, that i am a singaporean,<br><br>i am not happy with, what PAP has been doing to this country, but look at what opposition is offering, and that is just empty talk, we need, people who is willing to work with the government, not against the government, if the opposition can't realise this, then they are hopeless, i don't mind, voting for an opposition party if they can offer the same stability as what the PAP has offer, the question is, are you willing to take that chance?<br><br>Why should we listen to them, have you seen how they conduct their parliaments hearing or how they debate, they basically fight in their parliament house, throw their house into chaos, they are bunch of irrational people and bunch of monkeys that is asking for attention, i mock at their stupidity, their legislation is weak, they even want to overthrown their president, let me tell you one piece of their history, during 1945, KMT lose to PRC, and they flee to taiwan, and if they settle their act together, instead of fighting each other, the japanese will not be able to invade into china so easily, their history is f u c ked up, and why would i want to listen to a beaten dog, who lose to PRC, and had to flee to taiwan,<br><br>the question now is, taiwan is nothing but a loser during 1945, and they have no history to speak of, KMT is nothing but a rebel in this whole world, they seek independent, but, the world refuse to recongise them as a country, are you seriously wanting to listen to what a rouge country has to say about our country, which is recongise by the UN,<br><br>taiwan, sooner or later, will either be invaded by china, or hold the balls of china,</div>

Oh come on, we all know, they are just reporting the news, for the sake of reporting, when did those ball holders of PAP actually, report what they truly wanted to say, without losing their rice bowl, and frankly speaking, i determine for myself, what sort of news, should i feel is, news worthy</div>
