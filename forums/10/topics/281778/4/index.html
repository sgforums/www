In fact, today's Taiwan is divided as ever before, partly due to corruption/greed, partly the complete lack of governance/accountability in their leadership.<br><br>Their energy is now focused in doing shadow plays, excessive defence expenditure, that ROC is going down a slippery slope.<br><br>Ah Bian will be stepping down soon. Key figures are playing out again with money and mega-phone politics in media, cabinet and streets.<br><br>I dare say the success of today's industrial Taiwan isn't due to democracy but her economic openess during the 80's and early 90s riding on positive global climate and opportunities.<br><br>Today, any Taiwanese industrialist will know where to invest their R&amp;D, factories and $$$ on.

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiya our ancestors are all from china. Why quarrel?<br><br>Anyway, Singapore has a great geographical position and hence, Singapore will prosper. It is because of Lee's good planning, that's why Singapore prosper more rapidly than other states like Shenzhen, Shanghai, shantou, KL?<br><br>In contrast, Taiwan is freakly 120km away from nearest point of China and even further from other countries. Their geographical position is bad. Its already pretty amazing that they are still quite a rich nation. Normally countries which are so isolated from the rest of the world are usually third world countries relying heavily on agriculture. Being not a rich nation, it is also no surprise that there is always a shift in political power because people living there will not be contented.<br><br>I watched the video. Here's the main points they raised.<br><br>1) Lee Dynasty. They said Lee are set to rule generation after generation (sorta)<br>Actually, Singapore did protest against LHL being Prime Minister several times. It is because LHL has undergone many hardships (cancer, first wife died after giving birth to an albino) and LHL has always come back strongly after each setbacks that we believe that  LHL is also a man of capability. LHL has also contested in General election for his constituency several times and won.<br><br>2) Singaporeans dont live happier than Taiwaneses<br>This is just their opinion. If we are not happy with our standard of living, would we have voted for PAP time after time? Fact is about 66% of Singaporeans are contented every election. In the 2002 election, PAP was given a strong mandate of 80%+ to combat 911.<br><br>3) Temasek holdings<br>Ya. Most of us already know about this already. Temasek's holdings is a really rich organisation (top 100 in the world?) and it is mostly owned by Lee...Hahahahahahahaha. I do not know what to say. Corruption? exploitation of power? Within the rules?<br><br>I am not an arts person so this is just my personal rant. Probably lots of errors in my argument.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

LHL has also contested in General election for his constituency several times and won.<br><br>2) Singaporeans dont live happier than Taiwaneses<br>This is just their opinion. If we are not happy with our standard of living, would we have voted for PAP time after time? Fact is about 66% of Singaporeans are contented every election. In the 2002 election, PAP was given a strong mandate of 80%+ to combat 911.<br></div></blockquote>1)LOL,LHL got cancer before n his first wife died after giving birth and then u say he undergone many hardship?Hey,then if anyone here got cancer before n die first wife can replace him as Prime Minister already!!!Do you really know what is "hardship"?Does our LHL ever been poor before?<br><br>Yes,he got cancer before,but he was cured becoz he was rich n well-attended.Do u know how many poor ppl who also got cancer but becoz they have no money to cure the disease n their family members was forced to let them leave this world?This is called "hardship"!!!Does our silver-spooned kid LHL ever have to worry about money since he was born?Does he need to work hard like the majority of Singaporeans to get what he deserve?The answer is :NO!!!With the help of his father,his career is like rocketing to the sky.You called that "hardship"?<br><br>2)The fact is the majority of Singapoeans are not happy with our standard of living.Expenses in here are high,and the government turn deaf ear to our problem.Why PAP still get elected time after time?Becoz they CHEAT!!!Morons!!!</div>

When I go out on weekends, I see more of these people than our own singaporeans, sad.  ya, that gazelle hardly comes here these days.  There is a "goodearth" here, it is just another troll whose motives are the same as OM, Gazelle and so on.   this bad "goodearth" will not be successful in suppressing people from expressing our views and comments about the oppressive PAP.<br><br>I have seen and heard what the taiwanese talk about the PAP in Singapore from other source, so far they are really sharp and alert to know the works and intentions of the despots, PAP.   At least, in Taiwan the govt is democratic to allow political discussion programmes.   In Singapore the PAP regime is so downright kiasu and kiasi to allow such programmes.   They can't stand to lose.  What a shame!</div>
