              <p>Note his attempt to describe military tactics by coming up with a fantasy situtation in which a soldier has to cross 50meters of open ground under heavy fire... in his opinion holding the SAR-21 like a shopping bag not at the ready and unbalanced in one hand is the way to do it.</p>

              <p>(the Hyflux plant subsequently</p>
              <p>sold to Cityspring),50% of water demand came from Malaysia.see A</p>
              <p>Let us see how SG to replace this 50%.</p>
              <p>U wil say hi the demand will be increased.</p>
              <p>I will answer u later.Currently,i estmate <span style="color: #ff0000;">not more than 40% </span>of water</p>
              <p>comes from Malaysia.</p>
              <p><strong><br>Malaysia water,accounting for 50% of demand as at 2001,</strong></p>
              <p><strong>have been replaced and will be replaced by:</strong><br> <br> 30 % of SG demand by 2011:Few NEWater plants completed.30% when Changi <br> .................................WRP completed .15%
                                              currently from NEWater.<br> 10% of SG demand: Hyflux Desalination Plant was completed in 2002.</p>
              <p>7% desalination:Tuas Power 4-in-1 plant by 2011.<br> 10% of SG demand:from increase of catchment area fr half of SG to

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sales of potable water still less than 2002</span></strong></p>
              <p>waste water can be treated to make NEWater and Industrial water.</p>
              <p>Therefore,we just need to concern supply of  raw water for potable water.</p>
              <p>u may heard gavaman mentioned of 300 million gallon per day of water demand.</p>
              <p>This include potable water and Industrial water,before NEWater and desalination</p>
              <p>kicked in.This is equal to 1,320,000 cubic meter or 1.32 million m3.</p>
              <p>In the beginning of this century,gavaman estimated water demand increase</p>
              <p>to 400 mgd in 2011!!They are wrong for good and expected reasons--</p>
              <p>advance in NEWater and desalination technology!!</p>
              <p>Drops in water sales in 2002 to 2004 may be caused by bad economy!!</p>
