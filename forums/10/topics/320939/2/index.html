              <p>But I remember a case where a town in the USA where cancer and deformation among kids were high. A mother does her own research and confirm her suspicions that the water they drank was contaminated.</p>
              <p>If u wish, u can do ur own research, but u need to fork out money of ur own. There are private chem labs that will do analysis for u, but money is needed of course.</p>

              <p>Ms Bligh attacked critics of the plan in parliament as National
                          Health and Medical Research Council water quality advisory committee
                          head Don Bursill cautioned that recycled water posed additional risks
                          to supplies.</p>
              <p>Professor Bursill said the risk would be acceptably low if
                          Queensland followed national recycled water guidelines, as the state
                          had indicated it would, but it was preferable to rely on conventional
                          sources.</p>
              <p>Recycled sewage and industrial waste will constitute between 10per
                          cent and 25per cent of the water supply in southeast Queensland from
                          early next year.</p>
              <p>Ms Bligh and Deputy Premier Paul Lucas ridiculed the Opposition's
                          policy not to proceed with the water plan unless storages in the region
                          fell below 40per cent capacity. They presently average just over 40per
                          cent.</p>

              <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">No poverty in S'pore? Think again.<br><br></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Singapore's poor emerge as delicate political issue</span></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Asian Wall Street Journal</span><br>January 30, 2007<br>SINGAPORE<br><br>By YAROSLAV TROFIMOV<br><br>DURING rush hour in Singapore's ultramodern subway system, wrinkled old ladies squat on the underpass floor with handfuls of small tissue packets that they sell at one Singapore dollar, or 65 US cents, apiece.<br><br>These are the poor of Singapore, left behind by the boom that has transformed this tropical island of 4.5 million people into a regional business, finance and technology hub. Poverty here isn't nearly as desperate as in its Asian neighbors, or even many Western societies. But it has become an increasingly sensitive political issue, prompting new tax and social policies that the government is expected to unveil in the annual budget presentation Feb 15.<br><br>According to official statistics, at least 40% of Singapore's households saw their real incomes decrease from 2000-2005 -- while the overall economy posted some of the world's highest growth rates, surging by 7.7% last year.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"The question is, who is all this growth for?" says Manu Bhaskaran, an adjunct fellow at Singapore's Institute of Policy Studies and a partner at the Centennial Group, an advisory firm. "Shouldn't the government be aiming for lower growth, but better distribution? "</span><br><br>The government's strategy so far is to pursue a balancing act of generating more revenue for helping the poor without scaring off the global investors who have long been attracted by the city-state's low-tax regime. "The dual objective is to ensure that the Singaporean economy continues to remain competitive, and to strengthen the inclusiveness of Singaporean society," says Lim Swee Say, secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress and a government minister.<br><br>Most of Singapore's poor are in their 50s or older, and many are onetime manufacturing workers who lost their jobs to cheaper competitors in China, Vietnam or India. Many lack education and English-language skills that are needed to prosper in expanding sectors such as services and finance.<br><br>It is only in recent months that senior officials began to speak out on the problem of structural poverty, recognizing the potential perils for a multiracial, multireligious society such as Singapore's. "It is essential for us to tilt the balance in favor of lower-income Singaporeans, because globalization is going to strain our social compact," Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a speech last fall.<br><br>Singapore's People's Action Party, founded by Mr Lee's father Lee Kuan Yew -- who is still a senior government member with the title of Minister Mentor -- has controlled the island since independence in 1965, winning nearly every seat in parliamentary elections. The country's mixed population of Chinese, Malays and Indians has accepted decades of the PAP's often authoritarian rule in exchange for phenomenal economic growth that has transformed this former British trading outpost into one of the world's most prosperous states.<br><br>While providing subsidized housing and health care, Singapore's government has long resisted calls for European-style unemployment benefits for the poor, describing welfare as a "dirty word" and rejecting the idea of a minimum wage. Instead, the government has come up with the concept of "workfare" -- a large-scale program to top off the incomes of those Singaporeans who accept low-paid work. Details of the program will likely be given in the budget presentation.<br><br>"We can't stop the income gap from widening because the wages are determined by the global competition for knowledge workers, and by the excessive supply of unskilled workers," says Mr. Lim, the minister and union leader. "But what we're trying to do is to make sure that the widening income gap doesn't necessarily translate into a widening social gap."<br><br>Most developed economies fund such social programs by redistributing wealth through progressive taxation: the top-bracket federal income tax rate is 35% in the US, and at least 40% in most of Western Europe. But Singapore is ideologically opposed to this model: the island-state has been steadily slashing its top income-tax rate, from 55% at independence in 1965 to 28% in 2000, to 20% today. Making up for the shortfall in revenue, Singapore established a general sales tax, currently at 5%.<br><br>It is the sales tax that the government is planning to tap again to pay for the "workfare" initiative. According to Mr Lee, with the new budget the sales tax is likely to rise to 7% -- a measure that, economists calculate, will generate some S$1.5 billion of extra government revenue.<br><br>The plan is far from popular. In the two months since Mr Lee in November first mentioned a likely sales-tax rise, the proposal elicited unusually vocal criticism from Singapore's corporate world and opposition leaders alike. The influential Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry complained the sales-tax increase is "likely to have an immediate and detrimental effect on local spending," undermining Singapore's long-term competitiveness.<br><br>Sylvia Lim, leader of the Singapore Workers' Party and an opposition Parliament member, also pointed out that the poor -- the ostensible beneficiaries of the proposal -- would be hurt the most. "We need to strengthen our safety nets through some redistributive policies," she asserted, adding that consumption taxes, such as the sales tax, "are generally regressive and likely to compound the underclass problem."<br><br>While the government usually ignores the minuscule opposition in this tightly regulated country, the business community's pleas found a receptive audience. Aware that corporate taxes are even lower in rival business centers such as Hong Kong and Ireland, Singapore signaled it would sweeten the pill for businesses: To compensate for the higher sales tax, the corporate tax rate, currently 20%, would be shaved by at least one percentage point.<br><br>"This is a tough and competitive world," Minister Mentor Lee told Singaporean journalists as he explained the planned corporate-tax cut. "People don't come here because they like Singapore -- they come because the returns are better."</div>

              <p>singapore got water poor medical care</p>
              <p>what's the point?</p>

              <p>clean water, but unclean hospitals:</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 24pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Public toilets at NUH in shocking state</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">BETWEEN Feb 3 and 11, I had to go to National University Hospital (NUH) daily because a family member was hospitalised. The medical care was excellent and the nurses professional and kind. However, the standard of hygiene in the public toilets left much to be desired. <span style="color: #ff0000;">To put it bluntly, they were disgusting and, given our reputation for cleanliness and efficiency, quite disgraceful.</span></span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">I had to use the men's toilets on the ground floor and the shared individual cubicles on the sixth floor regularly. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The floors were inevitably sopping with used paper towels strewn about. The toilet seats were broken, unhinged, wet, stained or all of the above. Needless to say, the stench was unbearable.</span></span></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">What I found most distressing was <span style="color: #ff0000;">the sorry state of the shared cubicle outside the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)</span> on the second floor. Metres from what is supposed to be a sterile environment, the tap above the sink in the cubicle was not even working. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There was no sterilised mat at the entrance of the ICU, which meant anyone who had just stepped out of the toilet would carry whatever creepy crawlies their shoes picked up from the wet floor into the ICU.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Excuses of constant human traffic and insufficient cleaning staff cut no ice with me. The standard of hygiene in a hospital is supposed to be - pardon the pun - whiter than white. If NUH cannot rely on toilet users to be civilised, it should increase the number of times the toilets are cleaned every day. "</span></span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">  Of nearly 1000 buildings inspected by the Public Utilities Board over the past month, 49 were found to have sanitary pipes above water tanks. The PUB said the <strong>management corporations of the 49 affected buildings have been asked to redirect the sanitary pipes or relocate the water tanks.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">  <strong>Bukit Timah Plaza's management corporation is facing legal action for gross negligence in allowing sewage to contaminate the building's water supply system.</strong> <strong>The filthy water has made at least 65 people fall ill since last week.</strong> The Public Utilities Board (PUB) and the Ministry of Environment (ENV) said on Thursday 23 Aug 2000 that their investigations showed that the management corporation had "grossly neglected its duty" to maintain the complex's water supply and internal sewage-piping systems.</span></span></p>

              <p>WATER PLUS POWER SAVINGS: Dr Amy Khor tours PowerSeraya's desalination
              plant on Jurong Island. The plant consumes 30 per cent less electricity
              than conventional desalination plants. It is the first in the world to
              use a<span style="color: #ff0000;"> 16-inch diameter </span>membrane for reverse osmosis. -- ST PHOTO: LIM
              WUI LIANG</p>
              <p><em>POWERSERAYA now has its own desalination plant, making it the first combined heat, water and power supplier in South-east Asia. </em></p>
              <p><em> The energy company officially opened the $20 million plant at its Jurong Island facility yesterday. </em></p>
              <p><em> Managing director Neil McGregor said the plant consumes 30 per
                  cent less electricity than conventional desalination plants. </em></p>
              <p><em> When the plant runs at full capacity, about 10,000 cubic m of
                  water, enough to fill four Olympic-size pools, can be produced per day. </em></p>
              <p><em> Ninety per cent of the water will be used to clean floors, flush toilets and the like. The rest is clean enough to drink. </em></p>
              <p><em> The drinking water has not been licensed for sale by
                  regulators, but the firm may get the rights to sell it to water barges.--EOQ</em></p>
