              <p>Before you start to choose the president, do consider carefully what TKL has done.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Before even a commission of inquiry into the supposedly 'mis-selling' had investigate and came out with any result, he led people into a demostration.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. He accused bank and staff of 'mis-selling', even without any proof, or misled others into  'presuming' that such accusations were true, thereby pre-judging and denying <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the bank and its staff, whom are citizens too, of a fair trial.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Singapore is a lawful society, and our biz growth is dependent on the honouring of a signed contract by individuals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To have repudiate such signed agreements, based on emotions, allegations, and prejudical notions is to <strong>render the biz system asunder, that which the larger society us is dependent on. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It would mean nothing is firm or secure - what we sign on the dotted line can be revoked anytime. This is what he meant when he took to the streets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. He claims to represent the 500 or so who had signed on the dotted line, and made accusations. But he certainly did not represent the majority, clients, customers, staff,  shareholders, and even society. Who represented these people, whom are our citizens too?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. He allowed emotions to overcome him, on the plight of the elderly who claim they had no knowledge of the contract, <strong>but had he ever considered that for someone who had amass a wealth of more than $25,000 is not a village idiot, but most certainly a prudent and savvy individual careful with money?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Point is, he denied citizens fair trial, did not allow investigations, allowed emotions to take charge instead of rationality, continually led protests despite govt's efforts to look into the case,etc, etc...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Worse still, is speaking in a demostration a qualification to become Singapore's President? If so, then i am sure many unemployed will be registering to speak in Hong Lim soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is this whom you want to be a president and the gatekeeper of our treasury?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally, I don't care much who gets voted, because i know for sure i will still have to work to earn a living, pay taxes and don't live in a Paradise. Be him a scholar or a roadsweeper. ( although i would be wary of the scholar more - as it is said - the non scholar will only rob a frieghthold, but the scholar will rob the entire railway! -kidding lah! Joke only, dont get upset please!)</p>

              what TKL has done.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Before even a commission of inquiry into the supposedly
              'mis-selling' had investigate and came out with any result, he led
              people into a demostration.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. He accused bank and staff of 'mis-selling', even without any
              proof, or misled others into  'presuming' that such
              accusations were true, thereby pre-judging and denying <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the bank and its staff, whom are
              citizens too, of a fair trial.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Singapore is a lawful society, and our biz growth is
              dependent on the honouring of a signed contract by individuals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To have repudiate such signed agreements, based on emotions,
              allegations, and prejudical notions is to <strong>render the biz
              system asunder, that which the larger society us is dependent
              on.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It would mean nothing is firm or secure - what we sign on the
              dotted line can be revoked anytime. This is what he meant when he
              took to the streets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. He claims to represent the 500 or so who had signed on the
              dotted line, and made accusations. But he certainly did not
              represent the majority, clients, customers, staff, 
              shareholders, and even society. Who represented these people, whom
              are our citizens too?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. He allowed emotions to overcome him, on the plight of the
              elderly who claim they had no knowledge of the contract,
              <strong>but had he ever considered that for someone who had amass a
              wealth of more than $25,000 is not a village idiot, but most
              certainly a prudent and savvy individual careful with
              money?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Point is, he denied citizens fair trial, did not allow
              investigations, allowed emotions to take charge instead of
              rationality, continually led protests despite govt's efforts to
              look into the case,etc, etc...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Worse still, is speaking in a demostration a qualification to
              become Singapore's President? If so, then i am sure many unemployed
              will be registering to speak in Hong Lim soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is this whom you want to be a president and the gatekeeper of
              our treasury?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally, I don't care much who gets voted, because i know for
              sure i will still have to work to earn a living, pay taxes and
              don't live in a Paradise. Be him a scholar or a roadsweeper. (
              although i would be wary of the scholar more - as it is said - the
              non scholar will only rob a frieghthold, but the scholar will rob
              the entire railway! -kidding lah! Joke only, dont get upset
              please!)</p>

              <p>The main problem is if there were no complaints the financial institutions would think that nothing is wrong. Do you think that old uncles and aunties have a huge risk appetite? A 100% potential loss of capital is very high risk! What are the returns? Hello! 5%! Not enough to even offset this year's 6-7% inflation rate.</p>
              <p>If anyone would have known better, the uncles and aunties would not even invest in those "minibonds". Look at the probability of failure, out of 150, if 12 or 15 were to fail, all capital would be wiped out! You are better off gambling on "big" or "small" in the casino in which your odds are 50-50.</p>
              <p>How easy is it for anyone to accumulate $25,000? Save $100 every month for 21 years. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
