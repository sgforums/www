            <div class='col-md body'>Definitely yes.<br><br>There are a large number of MPs who are directors of local companies. Apart from directorships, many MPs also hold down other jobs (many of them are still practising lawyers, for example). Unlike in countries such as the UK, for example, being an MP in Singapore is not a full time job.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nismoS132:</div><div class="quote_body">so how is this different from us, japan or malaysia?</div></blockquote>As I mentioned above, in virtually every other country in the world, being a Member of Parliament or Congressman / Congresswoman or Senator is a full-time job.<br><br>These national-level representatives are not allowed to hold down other jobs or directorships, they are expected to devote themselves full-time to serving the interests of their constitutents.<br><br>Only local-level councillors, e.g. town hall representatives, etc are allowed to work in other jobs while in office. Once a politician moves into national-level representation, he / she is expected to have no other jobs or appointments, because the duties and responsibilities of their political office are supposed to be particularly onerous, and also because any other jobs they hold down may generate conflicts of interest with their political obligations.<br><br>As a previous poster suggested, many companies in Singapore probably try very hard to get an MP to sit on their board of directors. Having an MP on its board of directors would effectively allow a company to extend its influence into Parliament, in an extremely blatant way!<br><br>Can you imagine what would happen if an MP who also sits as a director of say, a telecoms company, were to stand up in Parliament one day and propose a Bill to give all telecoms companies major tax relief? Wouldn't any right thinking person believe that there would be something seriously wrong with that situation?<br><br>Actually, I'm pretty sure that sort of thing already happens in our Parliament, it's just that we're not allowed to hear about it.<br><br>In any other civilised country, this would be considered utterly scandalous, and a gross perversion of the democratic process. Parliamentarians are supposed to represent the interests of the people who elected them, not the interests of corporate masters.</div>

However, I do feel that this is akin to speaking out in public: People are able to put your face to your comments.<br><br>If the proper people see the comments and act on it (especially if the suggestions are perfectly reasonable), then we should be happy, as we have indirectly contributed to the betterment of our country. However, I do notice that certain bureaucrats have a tendency to steal ideas garned from online discussion boards, and pass it off as their own. It is inevitable, given the less than forth-front nature of people on forums about themselves, it is easy for these people to do so.
