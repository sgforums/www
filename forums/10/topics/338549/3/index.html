              <p>Haha...you are entitled to your own opinion.</p>
              <p>I see that most nations were careful with the choice of words
              except the US, Japan and Poland. The US no need to comment. The
              terrorists targetted US citizens. A Japanese was already confirmed
              dead. Any Polish held hostage?</p>
              <p><span>27 NOV - An Indian news channel reported yesterday that
              the terrorists had held the woman at gun point and told her to
              relay to Singapore diplomats this message: Tell the Mumbai
              authorities to refrain from acting against them - <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>or lose her
              life</strong></span>.</span></p>
              <p>I will still say that there's a right time to to use such strong
              words " <span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Singapore
              stands firmly behind the Indian government in its fight against
              terrorism</strong>"</span> in a situation like this, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but</strong></span> not on
              the same day or even earlier when she was still held captive.</p>
              <p>The Singapore used it at an impropriate time. Perhaps the govt
              had no intention to negotiate the safe release of the hostage, thus
              her fate was sealed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Israeli FM Tzipi Livni was careful  with her statement
              because she knew Jewish lives were at stake. This is simple and
              basic PR strategy.</p>

              <p>why is it funny for the people of Singapore to mourn for the late Miss Ho, one of our own fellow Singaporean killed by terrorists who intended to kill the british and the americans? she was not terrorised when she was back in Singapore, and she is not one of the perpetrators of the regime. May be we should not feel sorry for the British and the american who were killed in Mumbai. You should ask why those people wanted to single out the american and the british, what have the american and the british done to force young people to take up arms and give up their lives?</p>
              <p>judge our government anyway you like, we the people of Singapore don't need sympathies from you. We are not living in paradize but we are not running for our life. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>why is it funny for the people of Singapore to mourn for the late Miss Ho, one of our own fellow Singaporean killed by terrorists who intended to kill the british and the americans? she was not terrorised when she was back in Singapore, and she is not one of the perpetrators of the regime. May be we should not feel sorry for the British and the american who were killed in Mumbai. You should ask why those people wanted to single out the american and the british, what have the american and the british done to force young people to take up arms and give up their lives?</p>
