              <p>your message seems to suggest tat her death is because singapore shot 3 parkistanis plane hijackers in singapore before. I thought the resuce is brillant work in killing the terrorist without harming any hostages</p>
              <p>So wat do u suggest we do to the plane hijackers ? Agree to their demands so singaporean can be safe? Do u really think tat could save the girl or more singaporeans become the targets for terrorism ? Is tat wat your ideal democratic gov should do ?</p>

              <p>Can you think at all at any point of time even if you can begin to comprehend any message in the statement of fact ?</p>
              <p>Was any suggestion made that the three hijackers of SQ117 should not be shot ?</p>
              <p>Or was there not a job on hand when hostages were also held to ransom in the SIA plane ?</p>
              <p>The fact that they were shot will always be etched in the memories of those evil doers to make a pay back some time in the future.</p>
              <p>When the hijackers were shot in Singapore in 1991, could anyone foresee that a Singaporean lady will be held hostage in 2008 ?</p>
              <p>The death of the three hijackers was the opening of an account, similar to the tit-for-tat battles between the Hezbullahs and Hamas towards the Israelis; and the number of times that the USA had supported Israel instead of the Palestinian cause that justify the horrendous works of Osama and his Jihadis towards the USA.</p>
              <p>It is the mentality of these die hard fundamentalists never to forget what they perceived to be acts of transgression to their cause - something close to the stupid-is-smart approach in interpreting their situation vis-a-vis the way the World treat them.</p>
              <p>In any case, is there any relevance in your brilliance with your "stupidissmart effort" at linking this event to what an ideal democratic government should do ?</p>

              <p><br>Most of them were said to be about between 25 to 28 years old.</p>
              <p>They must have been through some intensive military type training, and probably high on drugs - as seen from some photos of wide-eyed smiling youths with heavy back-pack as they all carried AK-47s.</p>
              <p>These youths must have been psychologically prepared for this 1-Way Mission of no return, and given orders to inflict as much damage and casualties as possible; and also to hold out in as many days as their ammo and their energy can last them.</p>
              <p>Besides, explosives, grenades, and huge stock of bullets - it was reported that they were well prepared with a large stock of almonds for energy replenishment, GPS and satellite phones.</p>
              <p>It will be interesting to find out who is funding these youths, and where they are from.</p>
              <p>Finding the money trail and communication traffic over the last few days will reveal more information as to the originating points of these terrorists.</p>

              <p>Was any suggestion made that the three hijackers of SQ117 should not be shot ?</p>
              <p>Or was there not a job on hand when hostages were also held to ransom in the SIA plane ?</p>
              <p>The fact that they were shot will always be etched in the memories of those evil doers to make a pay back some time in the future.</p>
              <p>When the hijackers were shot in Singapore in 1991, could anyone foresee that a Singaporean lady will be held hostage in 2008 ?</p>
              <p>The death of the three hijackers was the opening of an account, similar to the tit-for-tat battles between the Hezbullahs and Hamas towards the Israelis; and the number of times that the USA had supported Israel instead of the Palestinian cause that justify the horrendous works of Osama and his Jihadis towards the USA.</p>
              <p>It is the mentality of these die hard fundamentalists never to forget what they perceived to be acts of transgression to their cause - something close to the stupid-is-smart approach in interpreting their situation vis-a-vis the way the World treat them.</p>

              <p>Lets focus on the below statement u made</p>
              <p><em>When the hijackers were shot in Singapore in 1991, could anyone foresee that a Singaporean lady will be held hostage in 2008 ?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lets say u r the gov and u foresee tat in 2008 there will be a singaporean girl held hostage. In 2009 lets imagine there r 1000 singaporean held by these terrorist. Now there r 3 terrorists on the plane. So wat r u gonna with these 3 terrorists ?</p>
              <p>If u talk about linking, it just seems strange tat u r basically blaming the special task force from charging in and kill the terrorists. It is something which I believed is right.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, I wonder how do u know the mentality of these terrorist tat they wanted tit for tat action when witnesses had clearly said tat they just sprayed their machine gun indiscriminately.</p>

              <p>In memory of Ms Lo, our fallen citizen whose life was lost in the hands of rabid beasts in human form.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ms Lo was only a young adult and do not deserve to have her life ended. A whole life ahead of her, the fun and exhuberances of youth, the friends, camaraderie, travels, journeys, so much to see and yet to see, to experience, to explore, - a human's lot,  but in the hand of beasts, of a fate of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, her life ended gruesomely on the 17th floor of a foriegn hotel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would have gladly traded places with her, not because i have a death wish, but because terrorism is something that could happen to anyone, anytime and anywhere. They even kill those of religion whom they profess to defend. There is nowhere to hide for the beasts live amongst us in human form.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Better me than her or anyone else, a girl so young with a full life ahead of her. She must had suffered tremendously upon capture, shocked and stunned by the scenes of carnage her eyes saw as the beasts mowed down everyone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She must have shooked terribly as her captors pointed a gun at her young head and demanded she make that call to our Ministry or thru her husband to stop any military action from the authorities while these beasts continued on their rampage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She must have pleaded and cried when the beasts began again shooting the other hostages when security forces had to stop the beasts continued killings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But when the gun finally pointed at her head, she, being an intelligent woman, would have finally made peace and accepted her fate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In her subconcious mind, she would have requested the animals make death quick, and her last wish would have been that our nation and citizens would capture these animals or eliminate them and their kind, so that no more may die from further hideous terrorists acts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For decades, our govt and religious leaders had failed humanity in getting rid of this evil scorge. The time for talking is no more. It is with utter disbelief that with our present technology and intelligence, we humanity cannot destroy this despicable minority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Real time Satellite imageries, cell phone detection, etc, etc, we all have, and yet, known terrorists bases are allowed to operate. Deviant religious leaders leave interogation centres unharmed and smiling.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While President Bush had been made a lameduck leader, at least he did one thing right in his final days - to destroy known terrorists and their camps hidden under the cover of sovereign lands whom terrorists mistakenly believed they would find shelter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>His executive orders allowed american troops to destroy known and suspected leaders, leaders whom would have if not eliminated, would have destroyed more innocent human lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There must be no mercy for terrorists anymore. No more talking. The bullet is the only thing they respect. Our young and able must volunteer for anti- terrorism agencies, our intelligentsia to join research organisations to find better ways to elimate terrorism and our leaders to cooperate with other nations to wipe out terrorism once and for all, if not for us, at least for the next generations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It can happen to anyone. As our citizen Ms Lo had sadly found out, and we must carry out her  last wish. Not to live in fear or cower in fright, but to live as we humans were meant to be - free. Should we perish, we must know there will be other humans who will avenge and protect others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rest in peace, my fellow citizen Ms Lo</p>

              <p>It basically look like the whole world condemns the attack. no way i will believe that the terrorist did something special because of this. and this is newspaper? i doubt the terrorist will be reading the newspaper, but more likely watching the news on TV, which will unlikely feature this Singapore exclusively, but more like "alot of countries condemn attack"</p>

Following are the reaction of major world leaders: <br><br><br><br><strong>Bring perpetrators to justice: UN Security Council</strong> <br><br>The UN Security Council has condemned the terrorist attacks in Mumbai and urged the international community to cooperate with India to bring perpetrators to justice. The Security Council issued a statement late on Thursday night after day-long consultations over telephone among the 15-members of the most powerful body of the United Nations. <br><br>"The members of the Security Council underlined the need to bring perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism to justice and urged all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with the Indian authorities in this regard," said the statement issued after the day-long consultations. <br><br><strong>Poland condemns Mumbai terrorist attacks</strong> <br><br>Poland's President Lech Kaczynski has expressed his condolences to Indian President Pratibha Patil over the terrorist attacks in Mumbai. Kaczynski condemned the "acts of barbarity and expressed solidarity with the victims". <br><br>"The Mumbai terrorist attacks show that the fight with terrorism is necessary," Polish news agency PAP quoted Kaczynski as saying Thursday. <br><br>"These acts of terrorism shows that the problem exists and it can't be easily solved. The fight with it (Terrorism) is justified, even if some mistakes have been made," the President said. <br><br><strong>Switzerland condemns terror attacks in Mumbai</strong> <br><br>The Swiss government on Thursday condemned the series of terrorist attacks in India's commercial capital Mumbai, the foreign ministry said in a statement.<br><br>"Switzerland condemns these terrorist acts as absolutely unjustifiable. The people and authorities of Switzerland extend their condolences to the Indian authorities and their deep sympathies to the families of the victims," it said. <br><br><strong>US, Obama condemn attack</strong> <br><br>US president-elect Barack Obama joined the American government in strongly condemning Wednesday's series of "horrific attacks" in Mumbai and asked Washington to work with India to root out and destroy terrorist networks worldwide. <br><br>Condemning the series of attacks in the Indian financial capital, the State Department said the US stands ready to support the Indian authorities in dealing with the situation, while the White House said it was seeking more information. <br><br>"We are monitoring the situation very closely and stand ready to support the Indian authorities as they deal with this horrific series of attacks," the State Department said in a statement. <br><br>Obama, who takes office Jan 20, quickly weighed in. "President-elect Obama strongly condemns today's terrorist attacks in Mumbai," Brooke Anderson, his spokesperson on national security, said in statement. <br><br>"These coordinated attacks on innocent civilians demonstrate the grave and urgent threat of terrorism," she said. <br><br>"The United States must continue to strengthen our partnerships with India and nations around the world to root out and destroy terrorist networks. <br><br>"We stand with the people of India." <br><br>The White House also denounced the attacks. "We condemn these attacks and the loss of innocent life. We continue to seek more information," said Ben Chang, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council. <br><br>President George W Bush, who left earlier to spend this week's Thanksgiving holiday at the presidential retreat at Camp David, was briefed on developments in Mumbai, the White House said. <br><br>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was closely monitoring the situation, a State Department official was quoted as saying by the US media. <br><br>"The secretary will be reaching out to officials at the US embassy in New Delhi and at the consulate in Mumbai. She will be reaching out to Indian government officials as well. The situation on the ground is extremely fluid," the official said. <br><br>The State Department has created a call centre for Americans seeking any information on relatives or friends affected by the attacks. The number is 1-888-407-4747. <br><br>At this point, it was not aware of any American casualties in the attacks, in which scores of people were killed and hundreds wounded. <br><br><strong>UN Chief calls violence unacceptable</strong> <br><br>At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon voicing his solidarity with India's government and its people said, "Such violence is totally unacceptable." <br><br>"The secretary-general reiterates his conviction that no cause or grievance can justify indiscriminate attacks against civilians," a statement by his spokesperson said Wednesday. He also called for the perpetrators of the attacks to be brought to justice. <br><br><strong>Pakistan denounces terror strike</strong> <br><br>Pakistan too condemned last night’s multiple terror strikes in Mumbai. Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani condemned the gun and grenade attacks. In a message he said: “We condemn these attacks,” reporteda newspaper. <br><br><strong>"Outrageous": Says Britain</strong> <br><br>British Prime Minister Gordon Brown condemned the incident calling it ‘outrageous’ and expressed solidarity with India. <br><br>British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the attacks “remind us, yet again, of the threat we face from violent extremists”. <br><br>The European Union also condemned the hostage taking at two luxury hotels in India’s financial capital. <br><br><strong>Australia calls it cowardice</strong> <br><br>Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd described the attackers across southern Mumbai as "cowards, absolute cowards and murderers", and warned that the number of Australian casualties from terrorist attacks in India might rise above the two people reported injured so far. <br><br>According to a newspaper, Rudd told Parliament that he had spoken to Australian High Commissioner to India John McCarthy to get an idea of the situation on ground in Mumbai. <br><br><strong>Mindless act: Bangladesh</strong><br><br>Bangladesh today condemned the string of attacks in Mumbai calling it a "mindless act" as shocked citizens remained glued to television channels throughout the day to track the situation, which is gradually unfolding. <br><br>"Bangladesh stands firm with her friends in India at this hour of grief," President Iajuddin Ahmed said in a statement. <br><br><strong>Pope Benedict XVI is "deeply concerned"</strong> <br><br>Pope Benedict XVI says he is "deeply concerned" about the attacks. The pope asks that the archbishop "kindly to convey his heartfelt condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives in these brutal attacks, and to assure the public authorities, citizens and all those affected of his spiritual closeness. The Holy Father prays for the repose of the souls of the victims and implores God's gift of strength and comfort for those who are injured and in mourning." <br><br><strong>NATO condemns mindless terror</strong> <br><br>In a statement NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer has said: "I condemn in the strongest possible terms the mindless and indiscriminate terrorist attacks in Mumbai. Attacking innocent people, tourists and patients in hospitals is despicable and cowardly. On behalf of the Alliance, I am relaying the sincerest words of solidarity and sympathy to the Indian authorities, to Indian people and especially families of the victims." <br><br><strong>Afghan President Karzai stands by India</strong> <br><br>Afghan President Hamid Karzai said, "The government and people of Afghanistan stand by India in the aftermath of this horrific and inhuman act of terror.

                      "horrific attacks" in Mumbai. Following are the reaction of major
                      world leaders: <br> <br> <br> <br> <strong>Bring perpetrators to justice: UN Security
                      Council</strong> <br> <br> The UN Security Council has condemned the terrorist attacks in
                      Mumbai and urged the international community to cooperate with
                      India to bring perpetrators to justice. The Security Council issued
                      a statement late on Thursday night after day-long consultations
                      over telephone among the 15-members of the most powerful body of
                      the United Nations. <br> <br> "The members of the Security Council underlined the need to bring
                      perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these
                      reprehensible acts of terrorism to justice and urged all States, in
                      accordance with their obligations under international law and
                      relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with
                      the Indian authorities in this regard," said the statement issued
                      after the day-long consultations. <br> <br> <strong>Poland condemns Mumbai terrorist
                      attacks</strong> <br> <br> Poland's President Lech Kaczynski has expressed his condolences to
                      Indian President Pratibha Patil over the terrorist attacks in
                      Mumbai. Kaczynski condemned the "acts of barbarity and expressed
                      solidarity with the victims". <br> <br> "The Mumbai terrorist attacks show that the fight with terrorism is
                      necessary," Polish news agency PAP quoted Kaczynski as saying
                      Thursday. <br> <br> "These acts of terrorism shows that the problem exists and it can't
                      be easily solved. The fight with it (Terrorism) is justified, even
                      if some mistakes have been made," the President said. <br> <br> <strong>Switzerland condemns terror attacks in
                      Mumbai</strong> <br> <br> The Swiss government on Thursday condemned the series of terrorist
                      attacks in India's commercial capital Mumbai, the foreign ministry
                      said in a statement.<br> <br> "Switzerland condemns these terrorist acts as absolutely
                      unjustifiable. The people and authorities of Switzerland extend
                      their condolences to the Indian authorities and their deep
                      sympathies to the families of the victims," it said. <br> <br> <strong>US, Obama condemn attack</strong> <br> <br> US president-elect Barack Obama joined the American government in
                      strongly condemning Wednesday's series of "horrific attacks" in
                      Mumbai and asked Washington to work with India to root out and
                      destroy terrorist networks worldwide. <br> <br> Condemning the series of attacks in the Indian financial capital,
                      the State Department said the US stands ready to support the Indian
                      authorities in dealing with the situation, while the White House
                      said it was seeking more information. <br> <br> "We are monitoring the situation very closely and stand ready to
                      support the Indian authorities as they deal with this horrific
                      series of attacks," the State Department said in a
                      statement. <br> <br> Obama, who takes office Jan 20, quickly weighed in.
                      "President-elect Obama strongly condemns today's terrorist attacks
                      in Mumbai," Brooke Anderson, his spokesperson on national security,
                      said in statement. <br> <br> "These coordinated attacks on innocent civilians demonstrate the
                      grave and urgent threat of terrorism," she said. <br> <br> "The United States must continue to strengthen our partnerships
                      with India and nations around the world to root out and destroy
                      terrorist networks. <br> <br> "We stand with the people of India." <br> <br> The White House also denounced the attacks. "We condemn these
                      attacks and the loss of innocent life. We continue to seek more
                      information," said Ben Chang, a spokesman for the White House
                      National Security Council. <br> <br> President George W Bush, who left earlier to spend this week's
                      Thanksgiving holiday at the presidential retreat at Camp David, was
                      briefed on developments in Mumbai, the White House
                      said. <br> <br> Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was closely monitoring the
                      situation, a State Department official was quoted as saying by the
                      US media. <br> <br> "The secretary will be reaching out to officials at the US embassy
                      in New Delhi and at the consulate in Mumbai. She will be reaching
                      out to Indian government officials as well. The situation on the
                      ground is extremely fluid," the official said. <br> <br> The State Department has created a call centre for Americans
                      seeking any information on relatives or friends affected by the
                      attacks. The number is 1-888-407-4747. <br> <br> At this point, it was not aware of any American casualties in the
                      attacks, in which scores of people were killed and hundreds
                      wounded. <br> <br> <strong>UN Chief calls violence unacceptable</strong> <br> <br> At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon voicing his
                      solidarity with India's government and its people said, "Such
                      violence is totally unacceptable." <br> <br> "The secretary-general reiterates his conviction that no cause or
                      grievance can justify indiscriminate attacks against civilians," a
                      statement by his spokesperson said Wednesday. He also called for
                      the perpetrators of the attacks to be brought to
                      justice. <br> <br> <strong>Pakistan denounces terror strike</strong> <br> <br> Pakistan too condemned last night’s multiple terror strikes in
                      Mumbai. Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani condemned the
                      gun and grenade attacks. In a message he said: “We condemn these
                      attacks,” reporteda newspaper. <br> <br> <strong>"Outrageous": Says Britain</strong> <br> <br> British Prime Minister Gordon Brown condemned the incident calling
                      it ‘outrageous’ and expressed solidarity with India. <br> <br> British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the attacks “remind
                      us, yet again, of the threat we face from violent
                      extremists”. <br> <br> The European Union also condemned the hostage taking at two luxury
                      hotels in India’s financial capital. <br> <br> <strong>Australia calls it cowardice</strong> <br> <br> Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd described the attackers across
                      southern Mumbai as "cowards, absolute cowards and murderers", and
                      warned that the number of Australian casualties from terrorist
                      attacks in India might rise above the two people reported injured
                      so far. <br> <br> According to a newspaper, Rudd told Parliament that he had spoken
                      to Australian High Commissioner to India John McCarthy to get an
                      idea of the situation on ground in Mumbai. <br> <br> <strong>Mindless act: Bangladesh</strong><br> <br> Bangladesh today condemned the string of attacks in Mumbai calling
                      it a "mindless act" as shocked citizens remained glued to
                      television channels throughout the day to track the situation,
                      which is gradually unfolding. <br> <br> "Bangladesh stands firm with her friends in India at this hour of
                      grief," President Iajuddin Ahmed said in a statement. <br> <br> <strong>Pope Benedict XVI is "deeply
                      concerned"</strong> <br> <br> Pope Benedict XVI says he is "deeply concerned" about the attacks.
                      The pope asks that the archbishop "kindly to convey his heartfelt
                      condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives in
                      these brutal attacks, and to assure the public authorities,
                      citizens and all those affected of his spiritual closeness. The
                      Holy Father prays for the repose of the souls of the victims and
                      implores God's gift of strength and comfort for those who are
                      injured and in mourning." <br> <br> <strong>NATO condemns mindless terror</strong> <br> <br> In a statement NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer has
                      said: "I condemn in the strongest possible terms the mindless and
                      indiscriminate terrorist attacks in Mumbai. Attacking innocent
                      people, tourists and patients in hospitals is despicable and
                      cowardly. On behalf of the Alliance, I am relaying the sincerest
                      words of solidarity and sympathy to the Indian authorities, to
                      Indian people and especially families of the victims." <br> <br> <strong>Afghan President Karzai stands by
                      India</strong> <br> <br> Afghan President Hamid Karzai said, "The government and people of
                      Afghanistan stand by India in the aftermath of this horrific and
                      inhuman act of terror. Nothing is more heinous and deplorable than
                      taking the lives of innocent people in such a cowardly attack on
                      public places. ... Terrorism is a threat to us all, affecting
                      India, Afghanistan and the region. Responding to this threat
                      requires nothing less than a joint strategy to defeat this
                      menace." <br> <br> <strong>Japan disapproves acts of terror</strong> <br> <br> Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura said, "The Japanese
                      government disapproves of any act of terrorism, and we emphasize
                      that there is no justification for any act of terrorism. We wish
                      that the people of India will quickly be able to overcome such
                      suffering. Japan and India will continue to work closely to fight
                      against terrorism." <br> <br> <strong>Chinese PM strongly condemns attacks</strong> <br> <br> Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao sent a message of condolences to Indian
                      Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. He said the Chinese government
                      "strongly condemned" the attacks and that China is "firmly opposed
                      to terrorism of any form." <br> <br> <strong>EU offers condolences</strong> <br> <br> In a statement European Union Foreign Policy Chief Javier Solana
                      said, "I condemn in the strongest possible terms the heinous
                      terrorist attacks throughout the city of Mumbai. I convey my most

                      to the Indian authorities. To those who were injured, I wish a
                      speedy recovery. These acts show once again the need for the
                      international community to stand united against terrorism and fight
                      it with determination." <br> <br> <strong>Sri Lanka vehemently condemns attacks</strong> <br> <br> Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa said, "My government and I

                      of the deceased and wish a speedy recovery to those injured and the

                      hospitals, hotels and other public places aimed at killing peaceful
                      civilians, taking and murdering hostages are crimes directed
                      against the very basis of civilized society. Those guilty of them
                      should be severely punished." <br> <br> <strong>Germany offers sympathies and help</strong> <br> <br> German Chancellor Angela Merkel sent a letter to the Indian Prime

                      who've been taken hostage. The Federal Republic strongly condemns
                      these criminal acts. I would like to express my deepest sympathy to

                      dead and wounded while others have been taken hostage." <br> <br> <strong>Singapore shows solidarity</strong> <br> <br> The Singaporean government said, "Singapore strongly condemns the
                      attacks. We would like to convey our deepest condolences to the
                      victims, their families, the government of India and its people.
                      The Mumbai attacks underscore the common terrorist threat that we
                      continue to face today. Singapore stands firmly behind the Indian
                      government in its fight against terrorism." <br></span></p>

              <p><br>yeah right. As if the terrorists were reading every newspapers or listening to to a specific news channel as they went about their hideous tasks. If these animals had wanted to negotiate at all, or would even listen,  they wouldn't have kill anyone since Wed night. But you saw how the body count piled up high from that night. Even as they were claiming to want to talk, people kept dying from their indiscriminate firing.</p>

              <p>Go on and blame everyone else except the terrorists. Osama may hire you as a legal counsel if he gets captured alive!</p>
