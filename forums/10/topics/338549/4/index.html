              <p>you remember your original topic? "singapore government is terrorist goverment"</p>
              <p>now what is your topic? that my logic is flawed. for the sake of argument, let's say my logic is flawed. that still doesn't mean you won the argument. that's more like trying to distract people from an argument you can't win.</p>
              <p>you like to complicate stuff, i won't let you. you have not answered my question, i won't answer yours.</p>

              <p>Win an argument? Can you even string a decent sentence in decipherable English with sound logic? Instead of blatantly "distracting" others from your faux pas of not knowing which side of the fence you'd rather be on, why don't you address a silly argument of yours for a start?</p>
              <p>Don't bother about addressing my arguments - winning this "argument" is way beyond your intellectual capacity. Just do yourself a favour and stop shooting yourself in the foot.</p>
              <p>Just to correct a bogus interpretation of your horrendously incompetent grasp of the language, I did not actually say "Singapore government is terrorist government". Rather, I said "terrorists comes in all forms, governments notwithstanding" and went on to list a host of regimes with notable records of terrorising its populace. Now, is there any difference between those two statements? (Hint: If I said "skythewood" is unintelligent, it's not quite the same as saying "skythewood" is an idiot, is it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">)</p>
              <p>Or are you simply stupid beyond reason you don't actually realise your interpretation of my statement (and I made no statement to the effect of the one you alleged to begin with) deviates in meaning from my original statement? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
