Not that I want to support PAP.<br><br>High taxes(GST) - about the lowest among the developed countries. 5% is nothing compare to the norm of 10+++% out there. Also, most european countries got 30-60% tax rate on top of the GST.<br><br>Using reserve - easy to spend $$, but can you make $$? I admire those who can make $$ more than those who can spend $$. Especially, in this case, the $$ did not come from me.  Too poor to be taxed significantly.<br><br>Education pressure - not totally government fault. Society also must share part of the blame too. My parents always told me that as long as I do my best they happy liao. I was never stressed in school. Of course,government can try to help. But, problem not totally created by government. Society at fault too.<br><br>No comments on other points. Partially/fully agree on some other points you made.<br><br></div>

But rather, to see what is possible. Given that the other countries needs to tax alot more than Singapore, this means that this government has been prudent with it's spending compared to other countries.<br><br>As for your arguement on GST Versus Income tax, I completely agree with your points raised (except with the note that only business above $1M annual turnover needs to pay GST - i.e. your neighbourhood shops do not need to pay GST). It is indeed one of the effects of GST. However, I believe the rational of GST is to tax based on spending rather than earning. As to whether that logic will bring in economy benefits, I do not know. So yes, without knowing the actual benefit of a GST based taxation structure, I do not know if it will actually benefit Singapore as a whole. This is one subject I would be interested to study more. Until then, I can neither agrue for or against GST. One thing I do know now is that I am one of those who has actually benefit from GST due to my extremely low expenditure. So, maybe I am already biased.<br></div>
