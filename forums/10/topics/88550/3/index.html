This passion (or rather the lack of) has allowed the ruling PAP to drive the country to its present state today.<br><br>Now look here, i am not discounting what the PAP has done before in the leadership of the nation till early 1980s. However, the continued hegemony over parliament by the PAP is in my opinion going to drive the country to ruin.<br><br>The nation building PAP members did well. BUT most of them are gone.<br>DID they make lives difficult for people? No.<br>Did they achieve for Singapore? YES<br>What about the present PAP members and the Swollen cabinet of theirs?<br>What have they achieved for Singapore?<br>What can they promise for Singapore's future?<br><br>They claim that we are no good and we need foreign talent, we must welcome competition with foreign talent and compete with the world players and in the world market. We must move out of our comfort zone.<br><br>But they claim to be the brightest and the world's best and nobody can compete with them that is why they deserve the world's highest salaries amongst political leaders. They dislike and are intolerant of compeition, everyone knows i need not say more.<br><br>Are they leading by example? Our so called mighty leaders?<br><br>They brought the country to a crossroads then they claim to open up and try to remake Singapore yet they have the cheek to ask us for ideas to undo the wrangle they made.<br>How many ideas actually get implemented?<br>If they are the ones having the salary and the power and they dont have ideas, what are they there for?<br><br>When they attempted to remake Singapore, they claimed that no stone will be left unturned.<br>After 1200 man years spent by the Remaking Singapore committee, our PM then DPM said: Its not that no stones were left unturned, its that we carefully put the stones back in place.<br><br>In my humble opinoin, if life does not seem to be getting better for most people, it is time to check the PAP government seriously.<br>The high costs and pressure cooker society is taking a toll on the people and their livelihood their sense of civic mindeness and their future. everyone for himself, talk about nationhood and nation beilding?<br><br>I wholly agree with RobertTeh for his remark that for the Govt to be loved it must first love the people. It must realise that It was elected (however remote in history when that happened) to SERVE THE PEOPLE.<br>BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE.<br><br>Does the present PAP government love the people? or do they love themselves?

            <div class='col-md body'>The GRCs institutionalise a multi racial parliament. The surveys and trends tabulated by the government indicated that if the previous SMCs electoral system is not changed,minority candidates will gradually have little chance to win any seats because of the ppl's tendency to vote along ethnic lines.<br><br>However a GRC system can also be a double edge sword.While presently they work to the advantage of the PAP and appear to be the opposition's grave yard in the short term, in the longer run they may actually enable the opposition to win more seats faster than was possible when they have to fight it out, one-to-one in SMCs.<br><br>Eg in a 6 member super GRC an opposition team can anchor it with two charismatic leaders one of whom is an ethnic minority + 4 other team members one of which could preferably be a women.<br><br>With a underlying 20% discontended voters, the opposition need to capture another 15% minority votes + 15% of the middle ground + 1% luck to succed.<br>GRCs are not as invincible as they seem. All the opposition need are credible candidates of high calibre.</div>

That we all already know because many unpopular and unjust constitutions have been approved with great ease.<br><br>Yet, inspite of that, give Singaporeans a few free money,  like NSS and CPF top ups, and many  will continue to fall over each  other to vote for the ruling party.<br><br>Dont they realise in doing that, they are destroying democracy and the voice of the common people?<br><br>Isnt it better to have more opposition in parliament in order that our voices be heard?<br><br>Of course we shouldnt support opposition politicians who  get into parliament to seek personal revenge, like JBJ for eg.<br><br>Let's give good opposition parties a chance to get into parliament and make  life better for citizens - and difficult for PAP to do as they like.<br><br>The People's views must be  respected - not ignored!</div>
