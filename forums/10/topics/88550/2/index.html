My comment about reserve remains the same.<br><br>For tax rate, just pick a random european commonwealth country, like say Norway or UK. Or even canada if you want to. And you can check the tax rate for yourself on the net. I am conparing tax rate, not reserve here.<br><br>As for the timing, I agree that it is really bad timing on their part.

That means that the poorer section of the country is taxed along with the rest for buying something which they need to survive on. Contrast this to the Income Tax scheme, where only the richer cross section of the country pays taxes. By reducing the Income Tax rate, and increasing the GST, we are in effect reducing the cash burden on the rich (who can now afford more luxuries), and adding more burden onto the poorer section of the country (who are now taxed to buy even neccesities).</div></blockquote>this is because not everything is increasing by the 5%<br>i've seen places where they just round up the price and that makes it more than 5%</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Qitai:<strong><br>The purpose of my comparison is not to justify the GST. But rather, to see what is possible. Given that the other countries needs to tax alot more than Singapore, this means that this government has been prudent with it's spending compared to other countries.<br><br>As for your arguement on GST Versus Income tax, I completely agree with your points raised (except with the note that only business above $1M annual turnover needs to pay GST - i.e. your neighbourhood shops do not need to pay GST). It is indeed one of the effects of GST. However, I believe the rational of GST is to tax based on spending rather than earning. As to whether that logic will bring in economy benefits, I do not know. So yes, without knowing the actual benefit of a GST based taxation structure, I do not know if it will actually benefit Singapore as a whole. This is one subject I would be interested to study more. Until then, I can neither agrue for or against GST. One thing I do know now is that I am one of those who has actually benefit from GST due to my extremely low expenditure. So, maybe I am already biased.</strong></blockquote>The objective of implementing the GST in Singapore is to ensure that tax is paid by every Singapore Citizen.<br><br>In the Income Tax system, the tax net is dependent on the 'honest' reporting of one's income, which can result in leakages in the system, and taxes not paid accordingly.<br><br>With GST, tax will be paid by every Singaporean based on his consumption - whether it is an individual Person or a Company, each transaction will result in GST being collected.<br><br>Even when a Business has turnover below $1 Million, the Business will still be PAYING the GST on the goods and services PURCHASED by the Business.<br><br>However, this SMALL Business (below $1 Million turnover) will not be required to COLLECT GST, by charging their customers for the goods or services sold to them - (the Small Businesses can OPT to collect GST, and pass on the cost of GST paid to their Customers).<br><br>The GST is a multiplier of revenue for the Government, as when an Item is IMPORTED into Singapore, the first GST will be paid by the IMPORTER.<br><br>When the same Item is sold to a Middleman, the transaction will result in another GST being paid on Cost PLUS Profit.<br><br>When the Middleman resell the Item to another Buyer, GST will again be imposed on this Item - at a new higher value.<br><br>For each subsequent transaction on the same Item, GST will be imposed and collected.<br><br>Everyone living in Singapore will have to pay GST on every item consumed.<br><br>As to which system is better for the Citizen, one has to look at the net effect of reducing Income Tax to implement GST, which may not necessarily reduce Revenue to the Government - due to the multiplier effect the GST is repeated on each and every transaction of the same goods.<br><br>The net loss reported by the Singapore Government is due to the subsidies that they claimed have been paid to Singaporeans, to help them to adjust to the GST being implemented.<br><br>Now that the GST has been introduced and operating for the last five years, and the subsidy is no longer available, Government Revenue should be increasing in geometrical bounds.<br><br>At the end of the first year when GST was implemented, and despite the subsidy being paid-out, the Government had reported an embarrassingly higher revenue, which resulted in the Singapore Shares being paid out- as a refund of tax collected.<br><br>With the knowledge of the profitable effects of each percentage increase to GST, and with a bumper collection in the First Year of GST, there is no reason for the GST to have been increased from 3 Percent to the current 5 Percent.<br><br></div>
