            <div class='col-md body'>Extracted from <a href="http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/7/15/nation/14848896&amp;sec=nation&amp;focus=1" rel="nofollow"><strong>The Star</strong></a><br>15 July 2006 - Saturday<br><blockquote><br><br><img src="http://www.thestar.com.my/archives/2006/7/15/nation/01bridge2.jpg"><br><br><span class="small">BRIDGE PLANS: An artist impression of the scenic bridge that was supposed to have replaced the Malaysian half of the Causeway.</span><br><br>THE Government has declassified several relevant confidential documents and extracts thereof to allow Malaysians to understand why it has reached the decision to abort the bridge project to replace the Johor Causeway. And in doing so, it has put the record straight on a string of allegations raised by former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, namely that:<br><br>THE Singapore government accepted MalaysiaÂ’s proposal to build a crooked bridge;<br><br>* THE bridge was not part of the package of outstanding bilateral issues;<br><br>* MALAYSIA is a Â“half-past-six country with no gutsÂ” by not going ahead with the crooked bridge project; and<br><br>* MALAYSIA put the issues of selling sand and allowing Singapore's air force to use its airspace on the negotiating table.<br><br>This is only the second time in recent history that information protected by the Official Secrets Act has been declassified and approved for public consumption Â– an indication of the GovernmentÂ’s seriousness in wanting the people who voted it into power to have the full facts, so that they can appreciate why the Government decided to abort the bridge project.<br><br>In the package of documents released are correspondences between Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad and two of SingaporeÂ’s former prime ministers, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong.<br><br>Also made public are extracts of the record of the meeting between Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Goh in Kuala Lumpur in March last year.<br><br>The contents of these documents contain three key facts:<br><br>1. Discussions with Singapore on the airspace issue are not new and were not mooted by the current Government under Abdullah. Dr Mahathir himself included this issue as a trade-off and as part of the package of issues to be resolved with Singapore during negotiations from 1998 to 2002. This is evident from Dr Mahathir's letter to Lee on March 4, 2002. This same issue was raised by Goh during a meeting with Abdullah on March 1 last year. This nullifies the suggestion by Dr Mahathir that it was the present administration that offered Singaporean Air Force jets use of Malaysian airspace.<br><br>2. The sale of sand to Singapore was raised by the republic during a meeting between Abdullah and Goh on March 1 last year. This nullifies argument that the Government put the issue on sand on the negotiating table.<br><br>3. Comprehensive advice by the Attorney-GeneralÂ’s Chambers showed that Malaysia should not proceed to build a bridge unilaterally without complying with our legal obligations. In particular, Malaysia had obligations under the Johor-Singapore Water Agreements 1961 and 1962, the Wayleave Agreements and the Separation Agreement 1965.<br><br>The main obstacle was that the construction of the crooked bridge would involve the demolition of the Malaysian side of the Johor Causeway. The said demolition would directly affect the water pipeline located inside the Johor Causeway and water pipelines straddling the Johor Causeway in which the ownership thereof vests with the Public Utilities Board (PUB) of Singapore.<br><br>The Attorney-GeneralÂ’s Chambers also stated that under the 1961 and 1962 Johor-Singapore Water Agreements, Â“Malaysia is required to obtain approval of PUB in relation to the alteration of water pipelines as a result of the construction of a full straight bridge or a scenic halfbridge.Â”<br><br><img src="http://www.thestar.com.my/archives/2006/7/15/nation/10chart.jpg"><br><br>The Johor-Singapore Water Agreements are guaranteed under the 1965 Separation Agreement.<br><br>The water pipelines located inside the Johor Causeway are governed by the 1961 Johor Singapore Water Agreement.<br><br>Therefore, the provisions of the Wayleave Agreements, which are applicable to the water pipelines straddling along the Johor Causeway, are not applicable to the water pipeline located inside the Johor Causeway.<br><br>These facts nullify the allegation that the water pipeline located inside the Johor Causeway could be relocated unilaterally after giving six months' notice to Singapore.<br><br>Taking into consideration these facts, the present Government had to make a firm decision to reject SingaporeÂ’s quid pro quo proposal on sand and airspace as it would have compromised MalaysiaÂ’s national sovereignty.<br><br>It had to make the political decision to abort the bridge project as this was consistent with the sentiment of Malaysians and the interest of Malaysia.<br><br>In conclusion, the issue boils down to one simple fact: Malaysia wanted the bridge, and Singapore did not want it.<br><br>The full straight bridge that was proposed by Malaysia would have been a symbol of friendship and would have benefited both countries.<br><br>Nevertheless, the responsibility for achieving this aim does not lie with Malaysia only.<br></blockquote></div>

Allegation: That the Singapore Government accepted MalaysiaÂ’s proposal to build a crooked bridge to replace the Malaysian side of the Johor Causeway.<br><br>Facts: On March 4, 2002, Dr Mahathir wrote a letter to Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew regarding MalaysiaÂ’s proposal on the package of outstanding bilateral issues. Among other things, he proposed building a new bridge on the Malaysian side at Kuala Lumpur's cost while Singapore would build the bridge on the Singapore side at its own cost.<br><br>Once the bridge was completed, the Johor Causeway would be demolished. Dr Mahathir further proposed that if Singapore did not build a bridge on its side, Malaysia intended to build a bridge on its side. Once this bridge was completed, the Johor Causeway on the Malaysian side would be demolished.<br><br>On April 11, 2002, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong replied and agreed, although his preference was for a full bridge. However, that proposal was made in the context of the package approach for the outstanding bilateral issues which would be further discussed at ministerial and senior officialsÂ’ level.<br><br>On Oct 7, 2002, Dr Mahathir informed Goh that Malaysia had decided to discontinue discussions on the outstanding bilateral issues as a package and to give the highest priority to resolving the long delayed water issue, particularly the price review of raw water supplied to Singapore. This move came because there appeared to be no agreement in resolving the issues as a package.<br><br>On Oct 14, 2002, Goh agreed to discontinue discussions on the outstanding bilateral issues as a package. Singapore withdrew its agreement on the crooked-bridge in the context of the package and stated that its earlier agreement to the bridge project was no longer valid.<br><br>Goh wrote: Â“? I had been prepared to make concessions in varying the Points of Agreement (POA) with extra pieces of land, allowing early withdrawal of Central Provident Fund (CPF) deposits and building our part of the bridge to replace the Causeway at our expense, as trade-offs, so that you give us airspace and future water at a fair price? Since you now want to deal with the water issue separately and discontinue the package approach, these trade-offs are no longer possible.Â”<br><br>In effect, this letter signalled a return to a status quo position. GohÂ’s statement was not challenged by Dr Mahathir.<br><br>In fact, there was no reply to GohÂ’s letter by Dr Mahathir.<br><br>Singapore reiterated its position in a diplomatic note on Nov 29, 2004 while the Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) Complex in Bukit Chagar was being built.<br><br>It said: Â“ ? These negotiations on a package basis were unilaterally terminated by the then Prime Minister of Malaysia Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad on Oct 7, 2002.Â” With the termination of the negotiations on the package of issues, SingaporeÂ’s agreement for the construction of the crooked bridge was no longer valid.<br><br>Conclusion: It is incorrect to say that Singapore accepted Malaysia's proposal to build a crooked bridge within its own territory. SingaporeÂ’s acceptance for Malaysia to build a crooked bridge was at most a reluctant acceptance based on the package approach.<br><br>2. Allegation: That the letter from Goh on April 11, 2002 was the final commitment by the republic on the bridge proposal by Malaysia.<br><br>Facts: During negotiations between the two countries, there was an understanding that any proposal would not become final unless it was concluded in an agreement signed by leaders of Malaysia and Singapore.<br><br>This was explained in a letter by Lee to the then Minister of Special Functions &amp; Minister of Finance, Tun Daim Zainuddin on Aug 24, 2000.<br><br>The letter read: Â“To make it easier for us to write to each other, to test various options, all notes or letters I send to you or Dr Mahathir, or vice-versa, will be treated as Without Prejudice: that there is no agreement until all points are agreed and signed by the two PMs.Â”<br><br>Conclusion: It is incorrect to say that Goh had given a commitment on the bridge in his letter on April 11, 2002. There was no signed agreement between the PMs of Malaysia and Singapore towards building the bridge.<br><br>3. Allegation: That the bridge was not part of the package of bilateral issues.<br><br>Facts: At first, the outstanding package of issues only covered four areas Â– water, Central Provident Fund, airspace and the relocation of KTMÂ’s CIQ complex in Singapore.<br><br>This was agreed to by both countries in Hanoi on Dec 27, 1998.<br><br>But later, the bridge project was inserted into the package of issues. Dr Mahathir did so in a letter to Lee on March 4, 2002 and the bridge issue became one of five issues in the package titled Â“MALAYSIA-SINGAPORE PACKAGE OF FIVE ISSUES Â– MALAYSIAÂ’S PROPOSALSÂ”<br><br>Conclusion:The bridge became part of the package of unresolved bilateral issues as a result of Dr MahathirÂ’s letter.<br><br>4. Allegation:That the GovernmentÂ’s decision to abort the bridge project would cause billions of ringgit in losses.<br><br>Facts: The total cost of building the CIQ, the crooked bridge and the new KTM line across the Johor Straits was RM2.379bil.<br><br>At this moment, the Government is still working out compensation payment to Gerbang Perdana Sdn Bhd. But the fact is that the decision to abort the bridge was not an economic decision. Once it became clear that Malaysia could not build the bridge unilaterally or accede to SingaporeÂ’s requests, calling off the plan to build the bridge was the most financially responsible decision to make.<br><br>Conclusion:: It would not have been advisable to spend RM1.13bil on a structure and be stuck in limbo over its use.<br><br>continued below<br><br></blockquote></div>

Allegation:That Malaysia is a Â“half-past six country with no gutsÂ” for calling off the bridge project.<br><br>Facts: Simply put, the Government had to make the right decision, taking into account the interest of Malaysians. It revisited the unilateral proposal by Dr Mahathir to build the crooked bridge but came to a finding that this was not an ideal solution.<br><br>A crooked bridge is not a legacy to leave for future Malaysians.<br><br>In coming to its decision to abort the bridge project, the Government studied not only the Wayleave Agreements but also the Johor-Singapore Water Agreements 1961 and 1962, the Separation Agreement 1965 and took into consideration advice from the Attorney-GeneralÂ’s Chambers.<br><br>This is what the Attorney-GeneralÂ’s Chambers said: Â“ ? the construction of the scenic half bridge to replace the Malaysian side of the Johor Causeway must be studied in a holistic manner in view of the fact that the scenic half bridge would have international legal implications in particular environmental impact to Singapore in and around the Straits of Johor.<br><br>Â“Apart from the above, the construction of the scenic half bridge will involve the demolition of the Malaysian side of the Johor Causeway. The said demolition would directly affect the water pipeline located inside the Johor Causeway and water pipelines straddling the Johor Causeway. In this regard, legal implications thereof would have to be studied based on the 1961 and 1962, Johor-Singapore Water Agreements, Wayleave Agreements and Separation Agreement 1965.<br><br>Â“Malaysia as a sovereign and independent state has complete power and authority over its territory and in exercising the said power and authority, no other state may interfere with its affairs. Nevertheless, Malaysia cannot take unilateral action without taking into consideration international law principles and requirements, amongst others, taking into account the rights and interests of its neighbouring states.Â”<br><br>Conclusion: With so much uncertainly, it made sense for the Government to take a step back and do the right thing. Running the government is not about scoring points or engaging in brinkmanship. It is about weighing the pros and cons and reaching a decision that is good for Malaysia.<br><br>6. Allegation:That Malaysia offered its airspace and sand to Singapore.<br><br>Facts: The issue of allowing use of Malaysian airspace had been on the negotiating table between 1998 and 2002. Dr Mahathir himself inserted this issue in a letter to Lee on March 4, 2002.<br><br>He offered it as a trade-off during negotiations on the package of unresolved issues. With the de-packaging of the bilateral issues, the proposal made by Dr Mahathir was no longer relevant.<br><br>Singapore used to enjoy five flight privileges until 1998.<br><br>It sought all those rights to be re-inserted but the Government of the day was only prepared to offer Search and Rescue and the Northern Transit Corridor rights on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon.<br><br>The rights of Search and Rescue was offered on the basis of reciprocity and is consistent with international practice.<br><br>As for Northern Transit Corridor, it only allows RSAF jets to transit over the South China Sea.<br><br>The jets will not be allowed to roam in Malaysian airspace.<br><br>Conclusion: The use of Malaysian airspace was raised by Goh during a meeting with Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi on March 1, last year in Putrajaya. Singapore said that this issue was of importance to them and said that it would make selling the bridge idea to Singapore more palatable.<br><br>As far as the Republic was concerned, it did not see the need for a bridge to replace the Causeway.<br><br>It wanted something in return for agreeing to the bridge deal and requested for sand and the use of airspace.<br><br>But once it became clear that the Malaysian public was strongly opposed to selling any sand or allowing RSAF jets to use its airspace, the Government moved firmly and made the only acceptable decision Â– it aborted the plan to build the bridge.<br><br>Going ahead to satisfy the two conditions the city-state had put forward would have meant going against the wishes of many Malaysians.<br><br>The Government has always stated that its decision was a political decision, based on the sentiments, sovereignty and integrity of the people of Malaysia.<br><br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is laughable piece of news<br><br><strong>Mahathir vows to continue attacks on Malaysian PM Abdullah</strong><br><br>Former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad vowed to continue his campaign against his successor Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, saying that Malaysia was losing its self-respect.<br><br><strong>"This is a free country. Anyone can say anything. What is that you (the government) want to hide?"</strong> Mahathir, 81, told a crowd of some 600 noisy supporters after returning home from a two-week holiday in London and Turkey.<br><br>"This is a transparent government. Anyone can say anything. If I want to speak, I will speak," he said after landing in a private jet at a military airport in Kuala Lumpur.<br><br>The supporters, many of them members of the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), carried banners reading "Mahathir Save Malaysia," and "Wipe out the traitors of religion, race and the country".<br><br>Abdullah is the president of UMNO, the largest and most powerful political party in Malaysia with some 3.0 million members.<br><br>Mahathir has levelled a number of criticisms at Abdullah in recent weeks, including suggesting that Abdullah's advisors and his son-in-law Khairy Jamaluddin are controlling the administration.<br><br>Mahathir said his attacks on Abdullah's administration were in the interests of the country he led for more than two decades.<br><br>"Already the country is not doing well. Already we have lost our self-respect. I am not looking for people to pat my back," he said.<br><br>As the crowd shouted "Long Live Mahathir," the ex-premier lamented what he said were attempts to silence him, saying that he had been prevented from speaking to UMNO members.<br><br>Mahathir, who is responsible for turning Malaysia from an agriculture-based economy to one of Asia's most industrialised countries, expressed concerns about the health of the economy.<br><br>"Already, the country is not doing well. Already we have lost respect among the developing countries," he said.<br><br>Abdullah, who replaced Mahathir in 2003, had said he was hurt by the criticisms from Mahathir and upset about the "mean things" people were saying about him.<br><br>Zakhir Mohamad, a 38-year-old UMNO member who attended the protest, said he backed Mahathir for speaking out.<br><br>"Mahathir is not anti-UMNO. His concerns are shared by many grassroot UMNO members. Many are not happy with the government's policies like the sharp fuel hike," he said, referring to the government's moves to roll back subsidies.</div>
