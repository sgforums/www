              <p>Fri, Apr 16, 2010<br>The Straits Times</p>
              <p>Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hisen Loong was interviewd by Emmy award-winning journalist Charlie Rose.</p>
              <p>Charlie Rose previously interviewed Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and made many references to that interview throughout his conversation with PM Lee.</p>
              <p>In the hour-long interview, PM Lee voiced his views on a number of issues ranging from the Nuclear Security Summit, US President Obama's global leadership and the US relationship with Asia and Singapore.</p>
              <p>
              
              </p>
              <p>He also analysed Singapore's sensitivity towards the issue of nepotism.</p>
              <p>Here are excerpts from the interview:</p>
              <p><strong>- On nepotism</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Charlie Rose:</strong> All right, well, you seem to be sensitive -- you were -- to the issue of what's called nepotism.</p>
              <p><strong>PM Lee:</strong> We are very sensitive.</p>
              <p><strong>Charlie Rose:</strong> Tell me about the sensitivity.</p>
              <p><strong>PM</strong> <strong>LeeÂ </strong>The whole of our system is founded on a basic concept of meritocracy. You are where you are because you are the best man for the job and not because of your connections or your parents or your relatives.</p>
              <p>And if anybody doubts that I as prime minister is here not because I am the best man for the job but because my father fixed it or my wife runs Temasek because I put her there and not because she's the best woman for the job, then my entire credibility and moral authority is destroyed. I'm not fit to be where I am.</p>
              <p>And it's a fundamental issue of fitness to govern. First you must have the moral right, then you can make the right decisions. It's a basic Confusion precept.</p>
              <p><strong>Charlie Rose:</strong> Only when you have to moral right can you make --</p>
              <p><strong>PM Lee:</strong> Then can you govern and make the country right.</p>
              <p>And in Singapore people expect that. So if there's any doubt that this is so, and people believe that I'm there because my father fixed it or the whole system is just make-believe, then the system will come down. It's not tenable.</p>
              <p>If it's true, it better be proven and I better be kicked out. If it's not true, it better also be proven to be not true and the matter put to rest.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>-----------------------------</p>
              <p>Excerpts from the interview: <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"># Your father is enormously respected around the world. You are his son. Your <span style="color: red;">wife </span>is important in Singapore as a business person, correct?</span> <br>I'm not sure you'll call her a business person. <span style="color: red;">She's an employee</span>, but you can call her what you want. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"># You seem to be sensitive to the issue of what's called nepotism.</span> <br><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;">We are very sensitive</span>. <br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br># Tell me about this sensitivity.</span> <br>The whole of our system is founded on a basic concept of <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;">meritocracy</span></span>. You are where you are <span style="color: red;">because you are the best man for the job, </span>and not because of your connections or your parents or your relatives. <br><br>And if anybody doubts that I as Prime Minister am here not because I'm the best man for the job but because my father fixed it, or that my wife runs Temasek because I put her there and not because she's the best woman for the job, then <span style="color: red;">my entire credibility and moral authority is destroyed because <span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;">I'm not fit to be where I am</span>.</span> <br><br>And it is a fundamental issue of fitness to govern. <br><br>First, you must have the moral right, then you can make the right decisions. It's a basic Confucian precept. <br><br>Only when you have the moral right then can you govern and make the country right. In Singapore, people expect that. And if there's any doubt that this is so, and people believe that I'm there because my father fixed it, or the whole system is just make-believe, then the system would come down. <br><br>It's not tenable. If it's true, it'd better be proven and it better be kicked out. If it's not true, it'd better also be proven to be not true and the matter put to rest. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"># So if some journalist writes about nepotism and you think it's not true...</span> <br>Well, then <span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal;">we sue him</span>, as we did recently. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"># Why?</span> <br>Well, we raised the matter with the International Herald Tribune, and they paid damages and apologised and didn't go to court. They could have gone to court. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"># But you thought what was written in the IHT would somehow attack the moral fibre of your trust with the people you govern.</span> <br>Yes of course. They compare... They put us in the same list as Kim Jong Il. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"># Because he inherited his power from his father.</span> <br>Yes indeed. And in a similar way. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"># And you say we won't stand for that because it goes to the essence of our moral authority to govern.</span> <br>Yes, and in this case, in fact, the same journalist and the same newspaper had made the same allegations and apologised and paid damages, and promised never to do it again. And they did it again. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"># Are you also anxious to send a signal that 'You don't dare write about nepotism in Singapore because the <span style="color: red;">Singaporeans would sue you'?</span></span> <br>No. The signal we want to send is that if you want to make an allegation, make sure it is true, and be prepared to prove it. <br><br>We were prepared, when we sued them, to go to court, give evidence, enter the witness box and be cross-examined under oath. <br><br>And they can bring their lawyers and demolish us and prove that what they said is true. What more can you ask? <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"># What's the legacy of your dad?</span> <br>He made a state where there was none, a country which would become a nation, which nobody believed could succeed. And he made a system which can run without him and will endure beyond him. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"># What's the most important lesson he's taught you? <br></span><br>Never say die, however desperate the situation. If you think hard enough, you will find the resource and you will find a way out of it. And don't forget where you came from. It could all be very different.</p>

              <p>Last month, the Singapore High Court fined International Herald Tribune (IHT) an astonishing $160,000 for defaming three Singapore leaders â Lee Hsien Loong, Goh Chok Tong and Lee Kuan Yew in an article published a month ago.</p>
              <p>The libellous article contained only one sentence about Singapore stating the fact that PM Lee is the son of MM Lee:</p>
              <p><em>âThe list of Asian countries with governments headed by the offspring or spouses of former leaders is striking: Pakistan has Prime Minister Asif Ali Zardari, widower of Benazir Bhutto, herself the daughter of the executed former leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Bangladesh has Sheikh Hasina, daughter of the murdered first prime minister, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman . In Malaysia, Prime Minister Najib Razak is the son of the second prime minister, Abdul Razak. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singaporeâs Lee Hsien Loong is Lee Kuan Yewâs son.</span></strong> In Kim Il-sungâs son Kim Jong-il commands party, army and country and waiting in the wings is his son Kim Jong-un.â</em></p>
              <p><em>- Temasek Review April 16 2010</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>Is this one of the reference Charlie Rose made???</em></p>

              <p>I don't know about You guys but personnally I find hisÂ  replied......Â Petty and emotionallyÂ Immature....he shouldÂ take a leaf from Thatcher......</p>
              <p>If only he is matured enough, he should know that he does not need to prove to the world that He needs the moral authority to govern ......The legitimacy isn;t from outside of Sington.....The legitimacy comes from Internal Singtonian Citizens it isn't what is written but the unspoken MIND of every citizen. That is the nature of demoractics system if reflect on the citizen.</p>
              <p>If only he is matured and ManÂ enough he should just admittedÂ and said yeahÂ he was treated above and beyond;Â BUT........ Stand upÂ and showed some leadership to theÂ Singtonian.......instead of hiding during crisis.....Â </p>
              <p>If only he is a Man of his own he would not be repeating about merito-Crapcy....but demonstrate some realÂ "TALENT"......isn't why we paid him....</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Here is my thought:</p>
              <p>He has been in power for all these years and till today he is still trying to fence his "moral authority" to govern.....it only reflect that he is more concern with his own legitimacy rather thanÂ to beÂ an effective leader.Â  How can one be an effective leader if he has to constantly look over the shoulder to see if someone is going to cane his chair....</p>

In Lee Kuan Yew's biography, the young Lee had learned Jawi script since he was five, and has always been interested in the affairs of Singapore, often following his father to the rally grounds since 1963.<br><br>Lee studied at Nanyang Primary School, received his secondary education at Catholic High School and subsequently "studied" at National Junior College, where he learned the clarinet under the tutelage of Adjunct Associate Professor Ho Hwee Long. He studied mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1974 with First Class Honours in Mathematics and the Diploma in Computer Science (with distinction). He subsequently obtained a Master of Public Administration (MPA) from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in 1980. Wow, we bet that application was really tough to fill out.<br><br>Lee joined the Nazi-like Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) in 1971 and rose quickly through the ranks becoming the youngest Brigadier General in Singapore's history. That, we're sure, was a really difficult promotion to obtain, what with his father playing the role of Singapore's Hitler at the time.<br><br>In 1978, this P.O.S. attended the US Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth. He retired from the military in 1984 to enter politics and was elected as a Member of Parliament that year. Lee's first wife, Malaysian-born doctor Wong Ming Yang, died on 28 October 1982 of a heart attack. three weeks after giving birth to Lee's first son Lee Yi Peng, a mildly autistic albino. There were rumours that Wong died of suicide.[2] In 1985, Lee married Ho Ching, a fast-rising civil servant. They have one daughter and three sons (the oldest son of Ho Ching, Li Hongyi was the winner of the Lee Kuan Yew Award for Math &amp; Science in 2006, the same year he was commissioned as an officer in the Singapore Armed forces at the SAFTI Military Institute) , including one daughter and son from Lee's first wife.<br><br>In 1992, Lee was diagnosed with lymphoma. He underwent a three-month period of chemotherapy and has since recovered, the the great mourning of freedom-loving people everywhere<br><br>Early political career<br>Lee entered politics at the age of 32 in 1984. He was appointed Minister of State in the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Defence in December 1984 by his father, Lee Kuan Yew, and was subsequently promoted to Acting Minister for Trade and Industry in 1986, and the Second Minister for Defence.<br><br>In February 1987, issues on ethnic relationships in Singapore surfaced when Malaysian leaders asked the Members of Parliament why there were so few Malays holding key positions in the SAF. Lee Hsien Loong, then Second Minister for Defence, stated that the SAF did not want its soldiers to be in a position where the loyalty of the soldiers might clash with racial and religious factors.<br><br><br>Deputy Prime Minister<br>When Goh Chok Tong became the Prime Minister of Singapore on November 28, 1990, Lee became the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore. He focused on economic and civil service matters and concurrently served as Minister for Trade and Industry until 1992.<br><br>Lee was appointed Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore in 1998, and Minister for Finance in 2001. During Lee's thirteen and a half years as Deputy Prime Minister, he exerted significant influence on Singapore's governance, especially in economic and social affairs.<br><br>To ease the growing budget deficit due to falling tax revenues from cuts in corporate and personal income taxes and other factors such as the Iraq War and Sars outbreak, Lee proposed on August 29, 2003 to raise the GST from three percent to five percent, a change that took place in January 2004.<br><br>Lee also initiated several relaxations of the requirements for Singapore citizenship, especially in for foreign husbands of Singaporean women and foreign-born children of Singaporeans. The changes were made after repeated pleas from MPs and the Remaking Singapore Committee.<br><br><br>Lee Hsien Loong has been Prime Minister of Singapore since 2004.On August 12, 2004, Lee Hsien Loong succeeded Goh Chok Tong as Prime Minister, relinquishing his Chairmanship of the Monetary Authority of Singapore to Goh Chok Tong. Lee was sworn in by former Chief Justice Yong Pung How at the Istana, office of the President of Singapore.<br><br>Lee made his maiden National Day Rally on August 12, 2004. In his speech, Lee initiated the policy of the "Five-day work week", a plan that would remove a half-working day on Saturday. The plan took effect on 1 January 2005.<br><br>Lee also proposed two-month paid maternity leaves for new-born's mothers and financial incentives to mothers who give birth to a fourth child. These policies were initiated in response to the declining birth rate that Singapore has experienced in recent years.<br><br>In November 2004, Lee sparked a national debate when he revealed a proposal to build two Integrated Resorts (IRs) which are holiday resorts with casinos. In April 2005, despite substantial oppositions expressed by the public, Lee announced the decision to approve the proposal. The two IRs are to be built in Marina Bay and Sentosa. To limit the negative social impact of casino gambling, Lee suggested that safeguards be implemented, such as prohibiting minors from entering the casinos and charging a SGD$100 entrance fee for Singaporeans and permanent residents or SGD$2000 for a year long entrance fee.<br><br>2006<br>In February 2006, Lee announced in parliament a S$2.6 billion bonus called the Progress Package [1]. The plan was to distribute budget surpluses accumulated from the past few years to adult Singaporeans in the form of cash to everyone, top-ups to the state pension savings for elders, rental and utilities rebates for those living in public housing, educational funds for school children from low-income families, and cash bonuses for low-wage workers above 40 and for those men who have completed National Service. The cash bonuses was distributed in early May 2006. Critics, especially members of the opposition, have slammed the Progress Package as a "vote-buying exercise" for the Singapore parliamentary election held on 6 May 2006. In that election, Lee led the People's Action Party to win 82 of the 84 seats, including 37 walkovers. Lee and his 6-member team won the Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency with 96,591 (60.42%) votes out of the total 159,872 votes cast. Most of the opposition WP's team of 6 were their 20s and the constituency was contested for the first time in 15 years. Its decision to contest Ang Mo Kio came as a surprise, as the opposition was expected to stay away from GRCs helmed by heavyweight ministers; but the party said that giving Ang Mo Kio residents a chance to vote was a prime reason for contesting the GRC. Given the inexperience of the WP team and Lee Hsien Loong's position as the Prime Minister, they won a surprisingly strong 49,468 votes (30.94%). There were also an extremely high percentage of void votes, 13,813 (8.64%).<br><br><br>Relations with China have improved under Lee's administration. Smooth progress has been made in areas of trade, tourism and investment, which is not merely in accordance with the interest of the two countries, but promises to be further beneficial to the common development of the region. The China-Singapore Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC) is responsible for promoting Sino-Singaporean co-operations.<br><br>During his meeting with vice-premier Wu Yi in September 2005, Lee proposed the establishment of a China-ASEAN Free Trade Zone, which would achieve the goal of realizing US$50 billion in trade volume before 2010. In doing so, both agreed that relations between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should be elevated.<br><br>During his seven-day visit to China in late October 2005, the Prime Minister stressed the need of improving bilateral diplomatic relationships between ASEAN and China. Lee also urged leaders to focus on the next wave of growth in north-eastern China.<br><br>"It is a long-term commitment. There is no place in the world that you can go in and your money just grows on trees. Not in China."<br><br>Relations with United StatesÂ <br><br>Lee visits the United States in July 2005.Singapore has generally had a favourable relationship with the United States. The growth of bilateral trade improved commercial and diplomatic ties between the two countries after the implementation of the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement and the growth in bilateral trade has been evident, since the Free Trade Agreement became effective on January 1, 2004.<br><br>Lee made his inaugural visit to the United States, as Prime Minister of Singapore, between 6th July and 16 July, 2005. Several other ministers, notably the defence minister Teo Chee Hean and foreign minister George Yeo, accompanied Lee.<br><br>On July 12, 2005, President George W. Bush and Lee signed the "Strategic Framework Agreement between the United States of America and the Republic of Singapore for a Closer Cooperation Partnership in Defence and Security". The agreement was a natural step in the expansion of bilateral ties. President Bush and the then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong had first announced their intention to conclude this agreement in October 2003.<br><br>The intention of the agreement is to address common threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of Weapons of mass destruction (WMD), which called for even closer cooperation between the United States and Singapore.<br><br>The agreement recognizes Singapore's role as a Major Security Cooperation Partner and will expand the scope of current cooperation in areas such as counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation, joint military exercises and training, policy dialogues, and defence technology. The Agreement will further enhance regional stability by supporting the continued security presence of the United States in Southeast Asia.<br><br>Both Lee and Bush agree that US presence in Southeast Asia has promoted peace and stability, which are crucial for regional cooperation and economic development.<br><br>During their meeting, both Bush and Lee acknowledged the progress in the war on terror. Lee commended Bush's 'resolute and steadfast stance in the war on terror' and expressed Singaporeâs continued support in this endeavour. In exchange, Bush commended the professionalism of the Singapore Armed Forces personnel, who have been deployed in support of Iraq operations over the past two years and of the Singapore Police Force, which has provided critically important training. Both Bush and Lee also pledged to sustain the close cooperation between the United States and Singapore in key regional and global multilateral institutions.<br><br><br>Controversy<br>As the eldest son of Singapore's first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Lee's career has been shadowed by allegations of nepotism. At the age of 32 he became the youngest Brigadier General in Singapore's history, and from a young age was widely tipped to be Lee Kuan Yew's successor as Prime Minister. When Lee Kuan Yew stepped down as Prime Minister to make way for his successor, Goh Chok Tong, several critics had seen Goh as a seat-warmer, but Lee Kuan Yew said he had disproved that. In his memoirs, Lee Kuan Yew stressed that he could not have his son directly succeed him.<br><br>"It was better that someone else succeed me as Prime Minister. Then were Loong to make the grade later, it would be clear that he made it on his own merit."<br><br>However, such allegations by critics held on for six to seven years until Goh managed to prove his worth by regaining seats and pushing up the PAP's vote share in the 1997 elections.<br><br>Perhaps understandably, the appointment of Lee's wife Ho Ching as the director of state investment agency Temasek has also raised some eyebrows. The Lees reacted strongly against such allegations by taking legal action, often winning large out-of-court settlements for defamation from, among others, the International Herald Tribune (1994), Bloomberg (2002), The Economist (2004) and the Financial Times (2007).<br><br>Lee's career has also been dogged by a reputation for being arrogant and autocratic. According to one particularly persistent rumour, at a pre-Cabinet meeting in 1990 an enraged Lee first insulted the then Minister for Finance Richard Hu and then physically slapped the then Minister for National Development S. Dhanabalan when he sided with Hu and demanded an apology [2]. While those directly involved have never publicly mentioned the alleged incident, in 2003, then prime minister Goh Chok Tong dismissed the incident when discussing the leadership transition to his successor.<br><br>On July 10, 2004, Lee visited Taiwan, causing displeasure in the People's Republic of China. On August 28, 2004 in his maiden National Day Rally speech, he criticized the Taiwanese leadership and populace of overestimating the support they would receive if they were to declare Taiwan independence. At the same time, he also clarified during the rally that his visit to Taiwan in July was to ensure he gather enough intelligence to make right decisions when he took over the baton as Prime Minister. He reiterated his support for the One-China policy. Later that year in September, Foreign Minister George Yeo cautioned the United Nations General Assembly about the dangers of letting the cross-strait relationship deteriorate. In response, an enraged Taiwan Foreign Minister, Mark Chen, called Singapore a "Pi-Sai Country", translated literally from Hokkien (Minnan), it means a "country no bigger than a snot". The Taiwanese Foreign Minister later made a formal apology.<br><br>In 2005, Lee made a remark regarding Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visit to Yasukuni Shrine, stating that from the point of view of many countries in the region who have experienced Japanese occupation, it raises many unhappy memories.[3] His remark drew public demonstrations outside Singapore embassy in Japan on May 24, 2005 with protestors criticising Lee for "meddling" with Japanese issues.<br><br>In November 2005, Singapore had a diplomatic row with Australia over the imminent execution of Australian drug trafficker Nguyen Tuong Van. In one incident, then Australian Prime Minister John Howard and his government were upset when Lee failed to inform Howard the scheduled date of the execution during their meeting at the APEC summit even though Nguyen's mother was already informed of the date. Appeals for clemency by Australian government and Nguyen's lawyer were turned down. Singapore did however grant an exception to allow Nguyen's mother to hold his hands (but not hug him) following a personal appeal by Howard. Nguyen was later executed on December 2, 2005.<br><br><br>Salary<br>Lee Hsien Loong currently earns an annual salary of S$3,870,000 (US$ 2,856,930 ) [4], an increase of 25% from S$3,091,200 (US$2,037,168)[5], making him the highest paid head of government in the world. For comparison purposes, the President of the United States earns a salary of US$400,000[6]. The new salary of SG$3.8 million took effect in January 2008. There has been a lot of controversy on this issue and the prime minister has responded by lending a portion of his salary to charity. Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew claimed (without proof) in parliament that the reason why the Singapore head of state, along with his ministers, deserve such a high income is due to the fact that Singapore is a small country and lacks a large pool of talented people. Many in Singapore laughed it off as symptoms of senilitis.</div>

              <p>who decide the best men in the job? walk over or GRC?</p>
              <p>what diff btw sg and PRC in politics...nothing except we can vote and they cannot.</p>
              <p>What diff if we can vote but no need to cast it? If we continue to use the scarce tactics, PAP can succeed now but we are the biggest loser as a country. Maybe one day, I will return to sg like the ppl who live in Penang for the laksa. Hopefully, we can return to be with our love one in the country we are born and that we can continue to live there as citizen. Until now, we can onlyÂ continue to live in PRC.</p>

              <p>IHT is not stupid, by commenting on it, the editor had predicted it will earn millions from such remarks, and they did, this is what news is all about, they are waiting for sueing, Â so what is $160,000 for an out of courtÂ settlement compare to that piece of comment earning millions out of it.</p>
              <p>Angel</p>
              <p>How do you know they made millions of dollars by making such a comment?</p>
              <p>Please support it with facts????? (Smart don't try to be smarter, then nobody knows you are stupid)</p>
              <p>Funny how, how come Malaysia Najib and many other leader like ahÂ Kim jong II or bangala PM are not making comment and sueing IHT, only singapore govt is threatening to sue them???</p>
              <p>SingaporeÂ gain a bad reputation internationally for sueing journalist, it is the worse kept secret. Not every country want to follow us to be "Hero" because Hero always die 1st.</p>
              <p>Well, there is a chinese saying..."If you dun do bad things, you will not be afraid if someone knock at your door at 3am in the morning" Guess the other leaders are more clean and worry less about silly comment from IHT</p>
              <p>Well, there is another saying..."the thief (Satan) will come in early morning, and rob you while you are sleeping" The Holy Bible. Â </p>
              <p>Guess other leaders are streetwise, Singapore want to Old Hero, let him charge 1st, die then let him die 1st, others countries adopt a wait and see attitude.</p>
              <p>note: Angel, when someone show up early in the morning 3am 100% next to your bed, he is a thief and 100% he will rape you and rob you or maybe kill you. Your outdate saying is complete trash</p>

              <p><br>good articles....ultimately the "loss" is Singapore because it deter free flow of opinion on Singapore and its govt.</p>
              <p>We end up shutting ourselves from the world because nobody wants to get hurts financially and it is not worth the money forÂ a pool of small population.</p>
