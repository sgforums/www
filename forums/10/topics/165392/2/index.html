            <div class='col-md body'>to me, all politician must function as a politician as a leader and a candidate.  The ruling party must create ways to marginise opposition.  The GRC is one way.  From the topic on high salary and citizens carrying the burden,  it think ruling will reduce single wards and hammer oppositions to the ground.  The two issues is an eyesore and hits logically with most ordinary low class citizens who benefit nothing except more hardships into their lives.  Afterall, their lives is already so hard, choosing oppositions tells their frustrations, and it makes no difference to their sufferings hopefully to add one more oppostion voice.  Swing votes.<br><br>So far there is no so called the clause of competancy of a persons mind to vote being implemented yet.  i hope it will never be implemented.</div>
