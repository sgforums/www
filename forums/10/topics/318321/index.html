              <p>FT - foreign talent, FW - foreign workers, Fs - employable foreigners</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Very often, the recurring theme here amongst many is to blame FT/FW for job losses. Are we pin pointing the fault correctly? If not, then how are we going to remedy it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My point is that, it is not FT/FW's fault. They go where they can find a job that pays well and housed with benefits. Similar reasons, so do our Singaporeans citizens find work overseas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, if Fs come to Spore to work, it is because they are attracted to the pay by employers, as well as secondary benefits our country can offer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The issue is, why are employers prepared to pay more for FT and pay lowest for FWs? The answer is money$$$.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FT will bring higher value add due to their competence, of which our citizens may not have such experiences ..yet. FWs will bring lower costs to the employers to compete in the market place. With more Fs, companies will be profitable to expand their operations within Singapore, bring more jobs not only to Fs, but to locals as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A perfect solution. But problems lies only in its implementation. Are employers prepared to EXPAND? Will they just continue using Fs or use solely more Fs thru 'ghost' employees to generate enough profits to maintain that condo at east coast?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I used to think Fs steals our jobs, but after reading up on the subject and talking with several others, i realized my personal selfishness on the subject. It was meant as a greater good for our society as a whole.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The onus now lies with the Employers. Is money$$ their main concern or the lives of our citizens with better salaries, whose forefathers help created modern Singapore with opportunity for them to become bosses,  are more critical.</p>

              <p>The employers are obviously more interested in making money. They don't really care whether you are a Singaporean or a foreigner, as long as you have the capabilities, they will hire you. Put yourself in the shoes of the employers, competitions are strong now, their main concern is how to cut cost and increase profits. If foreigners can promise them that, they will definitely hire foreigners.</p>
              <p>With globalization, every job is up for grabs globally. I feel that what Singaporeans can do on their own is to enhance their skills and make themselves more employable. I never believed in putting my future into the hands of others (the government or the employers).</p>
