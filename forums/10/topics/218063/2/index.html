I think anonymous coward gave a good discription of them - Metrosexual are those who men who go for facial treatments, spa (the clean type) etc. They wear fancy clothes, are particular about how they carry themselves and is sensitive to a woman's need. - . These people also tend to be more feminine in their overall appearance, and tend to shy away from becoming like those masculine men.<br><br>Sissys are basically, sissys. Alot of them are weak, cowardly, and many of them are spineless too. An example would be a kid who gets bullied by the other kids, and all he does is cry.<br><br>The 4th group would be those who have hormonal problems. Alot of them are usually much shorter, haven't broke their voice, and look either 'cute' or 'girly', and often look much younger than they really are as they haven't hit puberty yet. These people however arn't really labelled as 'gays' by the mainstream, as although they look like it, they don't act like it.<br><br>The last group are basically transsexuals in their early stages, where they still had to live as the opposite sex. It's hard to identify them honestly. They can have anything from 1 trait to all 4 traits of the above 4 groups. However this group of people will find it extremly offensive to be called 'gay (we're talking about male to female transsexuals here), as basically they don't identify themselves as men.<br><br>Anyway these days, society tends to label those feminine guys as gays. They don't care whether they're homosexual or not, most of them just lump anyone who is less than that of a male, as a gay. Majority of the people labelled are likely to come from group 2 &amp; 3.</div>

Somehow the word 'gay' eventually got linked to 'effeminate', and now it is used among gamers as a word for 'rigged' or 'imbalanced'. After some time it is used so much, that people just use it even when it's not the correct meaning.<br><br>Why do people label them as gays? I believe it's because it's similar to bullying. People start to feel insecure about themselves, and pick on feminine guys as they're an easy target, as well as to show the rest of their peers that they're 'cool'.<br><br>Whether similar things happen with adults, I'm not quite so sure. I'm speaking based on personal experience, which would be Singaporean and secondary school context.</div>
