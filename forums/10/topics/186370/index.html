            <div class='col-md body'>I have read the article and clearly the author of the article has negative feelings towards Singapore and hence, whatever his words hold little or no weight because they are bias to a certain extent. Observe the way he wrote his words, he has strong anti-singapore sentiments and it's little wonder he use threats such as annexation of Singapore to "encourage" Singaporeans to help support Taiwan's cause. However, I am disappointed by the way he uses accusations on Singapore, and even more so by his threatening remarks to achieve what he want, without any basis or facts to imply on the issue of the annexation of Singapore. I don't respect this guy.</div>
