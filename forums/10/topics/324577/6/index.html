              all these problems arised due to the over reliance on foreign MNCs...
              
              During the early days, foreign MNCs were needed but the biggest mistake LKY did was to neglect nurturing and growing his own local talents.
              
              If we had local MNCs which were of international quality now, we wouldn't be in this situation.

              <p>U want me to elaborate ? Sure, no problem. Wat is the proportion of elderly folks in the country ? Lets put is as 10-20% of the population. How much should be given to ensure they can survive ? Lets say $300-400. So if we folloo your advise to give money to the needy elderly, we have to use a lot of money. Money does not drop from trees, they come from tax. And since there r people who r poor and not old, such as the handicapped, they have to pay the tax to support all the old folks. And all the old folks include the very rich people like the ex-boss of CK Tang etc. So aren't u taxing the poor to give to the rich ?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>U wanna play with law ? Fine. Lets look at the Employment Act Chapter 91 Section 2 on interpretation</p>
              <p>"employee" means a person who has entered into or works under a contract of service with an employer and includes a workman and any officer or employee of the Government <strong>included in a category, class or description of such officers or employees declared by the President to be employees</strong> for the purposes of this Act or any Part or section thereof; but does not include any seaman, domestic worker, or any person employed in a managerial, executive or confidential position or any person belonging to any other class of persons whom the Minister may, from time to time by notification in the <em>Gazette</em>, declare not to be employees for the purposes of this Act;</p>
              <p>So your plan had committed an offense since it is obvious your job is not considered as "employee" and therefore cannot be use to play with the quota. Unless u think the president is gonna declare people who do nothing as an "employee"</p>

              <p>Refer to the above. Your job is not considered to be in the category of "employee" and giving money to such a person is the same as giving money to a contractor for doing nothing</p>

              <p>Most companies do offer their pay according to the type of degree u have. It is not just a gov policy</p>

                  Lets say $300-400. So if we folloo your advise to give money to the
                  needy elderly, we have to use a lot of money. Money does not drop
                  from trees, they come from tax. And since there r people who r poor
                  and not old, such as the handicapped, they have to pay the tax to
                  support all the old folks. And all the old folks include the very

              <p>U wanna play with law ? Fine. Lets look at the Employment Act
                  Chapter 91 Section 2 on interpretation</p>
              <p>"employee" means a person who has entered into or works under a
                  contract of service with an employer and includes a workman and any
                  officer or employee of the Government <strong>included in a
                  category, class or description of such officers or employees
                  declared by the President to be employees</strong> for the purposes
                  of this Act or any Part or section thereof; but does not include
                  any seaman, domestic worker, or any person employed in a
                  managerial, executive or confidential position or any person
                  belonging to any other class of persons whom the Minister may, from
                  time to time by notification in the <em>Gazette</em>, declare not
                  to be employees for the purposes of this Act;</p>
              <p>So your plan had committed an offense since it is obvious your
                  job is not considered as "employee" and therefore cannot be use to
                  play with the quota. Unless u think the president is gonna declare
                  people who do nothing as an "employee"</p>
              <p>Refer to the above. Your job is not considered to be in the
                  category of "employee" and giving money to such a person is the
                  same as giving money to a contractor for doing nothing</p>
              <p>Most companies do offer their pay according to the type
                  of degree u have. It is not just a gov policy</p>
              <p>A friend is not consider as the general population. Why don't u

              <p><em>Wat is the proportion of elderly folks in the country ? Lets
                      put is as 10-20% of the population. How much should be given to
                      ensure they can survive ? Lets say $300-400. So if we folloo your
                      advise to give money to the needy elderly, we have to use a lot of
                      money. Money does not drop from trees, they come from tax. And
                      since there r people who r poor and not old, such as the
                      handicapped, they have to pay the tax to support all the old folks.
                      And all the old folks include the very rich people like the ex-boss
                      of CK Tang etc. So aren't u taxing the poor to give to the rich

              <p>So how much do you think have been spent employing pple to maintain and create the means testing? A team of 10 engineers at $2.5k a month? Or more? Doesn't this come from tax as well? There's HR costs as well, not to mention that you are depriving other sectors from the services of these engineers and other personels. And I know that even though it is IT age, there's are extra costs
                      incurred to maintain , backup and ensure the database is not gone.</p>

              <p>Well, no one says the person is being employed to cheat on foreign levy; it is never stated on the book. The intention is by the employer, but tell me, is it illegal to employ someone to do nothing? Till now, you have not shown me exactly which law in which you can pinpoint the employer and declare him guilty. And if you can't prove that it is illegal to employ someone to do nothing, then there's no tax cheat at all.</p>
              <p>All you can tell me is that the intention is illegal (although the law never states that such an intention can be illegal).

              <p>There are many other ways to reduce tax paid by a company than to pay a measly amount to an employee to do nothing.</p>

              <p>Why don't u hear yourself say it. "There is not creative accounting involved in employing someone to do nothing". It is not even classified as employee. Tis is already cheating the states tax money by making out fictitious workers. There r a million and one ways to cheat tax from the states and the law cannot list out all the possibilities. The clause tat "wilful intent" to edit account to "evade tax" is already grounds to charge the person for tax evasion. U think if u tell a judge "I employ tis guy to do nothing and give him all the profit of the company" and then he is found to transfer all the money back to u thus avoiding business tax is okay, then I challenge u to do write an email to IRAS about your scheme and see if they will give u the green light to conduct such a scheme. U claim it is not illegal and so confident of it, then prove it. If tat is legal, the no one has to give business tax.</p>

                      account to "evade tax" is already grounds to charge the person for
                      tax evasion. U think if u tell a judge "I employ tis guy to do

              </blockquote>
              <p>All you are saying is the wilful intention to evade tax, when there's no such intention. The main intention, as said earlier, is to maintain a favourable foreign worker to local worker ratio. There is no false statement involved.</p>
              <p>Both your previous examples have been proven to be totally unrelated to what we are disccusing. Those are due to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>discrepancies in accounts</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>What I have described to you is the combination of 2 legal acts together, none of which you could prove illegal at all.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Real money ? Real money is not just giving to CPF but to his
                                              salary as well. If u did not give, u again have cheated tax.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So in your logic, an employee who is totally unrelated in blood giving back money to the employer is illegal? You might as well tell me if someone gave money to you, it is an illegal act.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I hope u realise tat in order to justify a person working for

              </blockquote>
              <p>I have answered according to your quote that contract of service can include "doing nothing". It is still a service to the company because the name is used for the ratio. Seems like you are the one who has constantly not been able to tell me why the act of doing nothing cannot be a contract of service to the company.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>1) Do u know the definition of employee</p>
              <p>2) If the full salary is given out, then why don't u employ a

              </blockquote>
              <p>The novelty is that the salary you paid out to employ a local in name is lower than the salary you would pay out if you had employed a local worker to do jobs like merely opening the door of your office every morning. In addition to that, you get a more favourable ratio, such that you can employ even more foreign workers.</p>

              <p>I believe you still could not understand that going overseas to work means he will not be counted in the local labour force, of which the unemployment rate is derived from. The PR will be counted in the labour force of the host country he is working in.</p>

              <p>U r being ridiculous here. I agree the old folks contribute to society. However the old folks get their due salary and reward as well when they r working. If we give money to all old folks, tax is gonna increase a lot. And u r giving to old folks who can be incredibly rich. Again I have eleborated repeatedly tat tis is taxing the poor to give to the rich, and tis is an extraordinary burden to the working class. However u refuse to coment on it and want to give so much money out for not apparent benefit or reason.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>All you are saying is the wilful intention to evade tax, when there's no such intention. The main intention, as said earlier, is to maintain a favourable foreign worker to local worker ratio. There is no false statement involved.</p>

              <p>U employ someone to do nothing, u give him salary for doing nothing and tis salary is deducted from the company profit and result in a lower tax to the states.

              <p>Giving money here and there is ok. But giving money tat result in a reduction of tax to the states is wrong. I can also come out with many other creative accounting as well. If going by wat u say, giving contractor money to renovate nothing is perfectly fine too. It is my money, I like the contractor to renovate nothing and it is my right ? Tat is your line of argument isn't it ? I can also give money to training firm to teach nothing. It is my money, there is no law tat states I cannot give money to training center to teach nothing and therefore it is perfectly fine.</p>
              <p>Wrong. The above 2 companies had thought of more sophisticated means to cheat tax and got caught and charged to jail. U think u will be fine with your "salary to someone to do nothing" ? Tis is an obvious intent to evade tax.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The novelty is that the salary you paid out to employ a local in name is lower than the salary you would pay out if you had employed a local worker to do jobs like merely opening the door of your office every morning. In addition to that, you get a more favourable ratio, such that you can employ even more foreign workers.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Too bad your idea cannot work because the person doing nothing is not considered as an employee according to the employee's act</p>

              <p>Again, I have to remind you that what your 2 companies did is illegal because of the discrepancies in the records.

              <p>Creative accounting a not, what I have described is legal, not to mention (as said a few lines back) that your warped idea of tax evasion totally defeats the purpose of hiring the local to maintain a favourable ratio.</p>

              <p>You still haven't not pointed out at all how doing nothing is not a contract of service. Or if I'm the employer, I can even put it down as having employed someone to sit at home to wait for important calls, which you won't rerout over at all.</p>
              <p>It's the company's business on what work (if any) they want to give their employees.</p>

              <p>Let's come to a conclusion on this too. Like I have mentioned, this is a legal loophole. It is officially legal, but it is unethical.</p>

              <p>I didn't complain about the unemployment rate. -.-<br>I'm saying when unemployment rate is rising, why are FWs still as freely available as before, and in fact, being employed more readily that Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>And again, which you have also agreed, FTs and FWs do have a role in Singapore, but it is the way in which the incumbent has handled it that does not appeal to us. More QC is needed.</p>
