              <p>Dear Mr Chan<br><br>We refer to your email dated 23 July 2008.<br><br>We sincerely apologise for the delay in responding to you and appreciate your kind understanding.<br><br>The CPF contribution for every local worker is compared with the worker's declared income via inter-government agency arrangements <br>to determine whether a worker is considered a full-time or a part-time employee. The Dependency Ceiling of a company is computed <br>based on the aggregate number of qualifying local full-time workforce. However, there is no specific acceptable CPF contribution <br>rate or amount for an employee to be considered a full-timer as the CPF contribution rate depends on a host of factors, including <br>the employee's age.<br><br>For more information, you may visit MOM's website at www.mom.gov.sg.<br><br><br>Should you have further enquiries or clarifications, you may write to us via our e-feedback at <br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/publish/momportal/en/header/feedback.html?action=reply&amp;value=FB0807003714_2447826_2_A84CFD58"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #810081;">http://www.mom.gov.sg/publish/momportal/en/header/feedback.html?action=reply&amp;value=FB0807003714_2447826_2_A84CFD58</span></span></a><br><br>Alternatively, you may use our new online FAQ at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/publish/momportal/en/help/faq.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #810081;">http://www.mom.gov.sg/publish/momportal/en/help/faq.html</span></span></a><br><br>Please do not reply to this account as this is an automated mailbox. <br>Thank you.<br><br>Yours sincerely<br><br>Normawati Kamsani (Ms)<br>Customer Service Associate Executive</p>

              <p>On the employment rate of singapore, didn't I already say tat the problem of foreigners is not tis year but in previous years as well. Sure, tis year seems to be a bad year for unemployment however 2.3% is still considered low.</p>

              <p>Surely you see these lines:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Analysts see this shift as signalling a possible slowdown in jobs, with employers now more cautious about hiring.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>And talking about NBS or SMU students:</p>

              <p>Anecdotally, I hear that fresh grads may find it hard to get jobs in the financial sector,' he said.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>And finally</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Further underlining the sober outlook is the rise in unemployment, for the second quarter in a row.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Previous years, the economy was booming. Furthermore, FTs and FWs were not as prevalent in the last major recession in 97's. I have no complaints about very highly educated FTs or FWs doing jobs that Singaporeans do not want to do. But there are now jobs that Singaporeans want to do, but taken by foreigners, such that even my friends who recently graduated cannot find jobs.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Employers are still hungry for workers, he said, pointing out that the labour market is still 'tight'.</p>

              <p>Employers are still hungry for workers, but how many being employed are Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>My bottomline: What is going to happen to our fellow Singaporean graduates when they have a SGD24k debt (bank 4.75% interest or CPF 2.6% interest) and have no jobs?</p>

              <p>Previous years, the economy was booming. Furthermore, FTs and FWs were not as prevalent in the last major recession in 97's. I have no complaints about very highly educated FTs or FWs doing jobs that Singaporeans do not want to do. But there are now jobs that Singaporeans want to do, but taken by foreigners, such that even my friends who recently graduated cannot find jobs.</p>

              <p>Well, what I see and what my friends experienced is different. As a new hire, I see many other new hires at the induction program of the company, and most, I can say, are not Singaporeans (fresh from overseas, with some foreign scholars fresh from NUS/NTU). It's those fresh from overseas that I'm talking about. At the very least, I believe there is no change in the local to foreign ratio at the moment.</p>
              <p>When the economy is good, there's perfect reason for them to come. I supported it in this forum quite a few months back. But now, when the economy isn't looking that great???</p>
              <p><br>What benefits does the gov get? They still get income tax from the foreigners. The companies earn more (than if they employ Singaporeans), and pay higher income tax. Money wise, the government will lose nothing be it locals working or foreigners working.

              <p>Really? We see the popular vote for the incumbent being eroded every year. It only raised a bit when GCT announced it would be his last election before he stepped down as PM, other than that, it has been constantly on the decline.</p>
              <p>I can also tell you frankly now that they have lost my support since the last election too. What's worse than taxes increasing here and there without having an almost comparable raise in salary, and the extremely precise time of increasing the GST just before the quite expected economic downturn?</p>

              <p><br>Actually they lost alot of ground the past election, if they hadn't given out money to entice voters, kept secret the announcement about GST increases, they would have lost alot more seats.</p>

              <p>There is no statistic studies which I can refer to therefore I cannot claim anything. I can only say i got wind of information tat they r recruiting less foreign scholars tis year due to the poor economic prospect and tat is why I extrapolate to the job market. As said, it is reduced the number of foreigners, not stop altogether so if u see some foreigners coming in, it cannot determined anything</p>

              <p>Ss said before, life is gonna get harder due to the competition with the region. The increase in prices is due to oil and food etc so it is nothing much anyone can do. I just feel tat the gov is not bad for example teaching people how to save money by using lesser electricity and eating frozen meat or finding other food sources.</p>
              <p>Anyway the bottomline is still the gov has nothing to gain from finding excessive foreigners</p>
              <p>If u think they do not deserve your vote... well it is your choice</p>

              <p>If they are really recruiting less foreign scholars this year due to poor economic prospect, all the worse it shows for the planners in the government. These scholars will only come out to the job market a few years later, and not at the current moment.</p>
              <p>And I'm not talking about scholars that studied under the Singapore education system. I'm talking about fresh grads from UM or other countries being employed over Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>And ya... I have no idea why you think you 'getting wind of information' could be a more reliable info than what was being observed.</p>

              <p>You have totally missed the point. It is not about life getting harder due to competition, or increases in prices, etc. It is about the precise timing of raising taxes just before the economic downturn. I'm saying that this economic downturn was sort of expected. That's the main reason which prompted me to search for a job years before I graduate.</p>
              <p>Well, if the government has nothing to gain from finding excessive foreigners, then maybe you could attempt to explain my observations that I have told you about.</p>
