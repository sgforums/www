For example, my friend was offered $1,600 for to start as nurse in sg, however UAE offered him US$4,000 , excluding allowance (take note that the package include accomdation as well as transport). A simple will show the huge difference , The annual income for working in sg will be estimated about $35,000 whilst, working in UAE is US$60,000 per annual...  so which one will you choose?</p></div>

              <p>Everyone knows that economies go in cycles, a major one almost every 10 years (some say 5). Look back the years. I believed there were also major recessions around 1968, 1978, 1988, 1998. From the period of 1997/1998 economic crisis, be it 5 or 10 years cycle, both point to the year 2008.

Now you are telling me that it is not representative of the whole society. I have no idea why you would like to persist in what you believe than accept or attempt to explain away what was observed. It's not like you have concrete and updated statistics to state your points.</p>
              <p>Now, you do not even bother to explain the observations to convince, but rather, brush away it as not representative. This is similar behaviour to you brushing away what I said about some foreigner being rude.

Just face it, no one realy know wat is gonna happened to the stock and share a year later. Even if u ask experts, they can come out with completely different prediction.

              <p>Before tis, I also told u tat the employment history of singapore has to be taken into account because foreign talent is not a 2008 phenomenon. Showing statistic on last year is a good evidence of the need for FT to grow the economy. Now the market is slowing, but realistically speaking it is still acceptable at 2.3%. If u look at other countries in the region, it is about 50% higher than singapore</p>

              <p>The foreigner is rude because u think she give u a "look". Lets put it tis way. "Look" is very mild. When people complain of rudeness, it is about the things they said, or the gesture they perform then it is really taken seriously. Even if u r in the service line, a customer complaining of u giving them the "look" is taken mildly. When people give u a look, u just look them back and tat is it.</p>
              <p>When M13 specifically called me stupid, thought processes having problem, report writing is complete rubbish and many others, u find it not rude. Don't u find yourself having double standards ? If a salesgirl, your girlfriend, your supervisor or even your supervisor say tat to u, it is rude. And then u go around trying to defend people calling people stupid and writing as rubbish etc . Now tat is really going past the limit</p>
              <p>If a teacher says tat the above to u, he can be sacked. If a policeman say tat to u, your complaint can make him suspend his duty and work on behind the scene for some time. If u complaint a policeman or a teacher giving u the "look", they just tell u to be more tolerable and perhaps tell the teacher/policeman to be more careful next time.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I am never rude to your M13 friend prior to tis</p>

                                      good year for asia where straits index breaks record high.
                                      Just face it, no one realy know wat is gonna happened to the stock
                                      and share a year later. Even if u ask experts, they can come out
                                      with completely different prediction. Can u predict wat is the
                                      stock market like at 2009 ? Wat will the market be like in US at

              <p>Do you really need me to scan out my economics notes for you to show you that economy goes in cycles, a sinusoidal curve that goes on an upward path? This is not guesswork; it is stated in economic textbooks, etc.</p>
              <p>Again, it is not about the price of fuel or the stock market or etc. It is about an economic downturn that can be predicted. If you ask me, there was at least one person who predicted an economic downturn in 2008/2009 in the year 2007, and it was published in the straits times.</p>
              <p>I believe I mentioned about a year ago that I expected an economic downturn in 2008 somewhere in this forum.</p>

              <p>No, I got it in 2005. And at the start of the first semester in year 4, semester 1 (that's June 2007), I went around telling my friends and my sis to find a job asap as there might likely be an economic downturn when we graduate. I gave them the same reason as I gave you. Quite a number do not believe me at that time.</p>
              <p>I told them, we will either be just at the end of the good job market, or just missed it and be at the start of the recession.</p>

              <p>5) You have defended someone for so many posts a rude action which you have not even witness at all; there's a limit to word descriptions of rude actions.

              <p>you know i woudn't say 66.6% (i'm not sure about the figure) was happy with the reigning party, but i'm quite certain out of their votes, a certain percentage belonged to an unconcerned group. a group who doesn't care about politics and voted for the incumbent because it had been 'the way' all along. and may i highlight, that there are even more reasons (than simply out of support) that voters went with the current gahmen, some beliefs like 'don't want trouble coz they will know' , housing values etc. so even though they may not support the incumbent, they will still vote for them due to other reasons. It is not easy for the opp to secure a win.. at least not without knowing there's still a huge percentage of the unconcerns out there. and i think they had done an excellent job on giving us 'a choice' last GE, because 'the concerns'  were finally able to show their displeasures from the results of falling support rates across the island.</p>

              <p>I really wonder why Fireice is so protective over Eagle. Maybe it is in Fireice interest to ensure that forummers here dont expose the horny desperate DARKSIDE of Eagle.</p>
              <p>Since they are both in some sort of scam cum tuition business, I am sure parents will be worried if their tuitor is know to be someone who is always thinking of asking sexual favour from opposite sex.</p>

              <p><br>So JOJO, I guess I am right to say that you have been lying about your property investment in USA and thats the reason why you are avoiding the other thread which i was asking</p>
              <p><em>Am I right to say that, you (JOJO BEACH) is claiming that in Singapore all property price will sink together and in USA the property market will not?</em></p>
              <p>I am sure those forummers here who believed in you. will be very disappointed to know that I am right about you. You are simply a big liar blowing your own trumpet abot your property investment because until today, you are unable to demostrate to us that you have any BASIC knowlegde about property investment.</p>
              <p>beyond by imagination? Yes indeed, I never imagine you could go as far as calling yourself multi-property investor when you are NONE..</p>
