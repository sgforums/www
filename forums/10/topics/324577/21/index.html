              <p>Do you really need me to scan out my economics notes for you to show you that economy goes in cycles, a sinusoidal curve that goes on an upward path? This is not guesswork; it is stated in economic textbooks, etc.</p>
              <p>Again, it is not about the price of fuel or the stock market or etc. It is about an economic downturn that can be predicted. If you ask me, there was at least one person who predicted an economic downturn in 2008/2009 in the year 2007, and it was published in the straits times.</p>
              <p>I believe I mentioned about a year ago that I expected an economic downturn in 2008 somewhere in this forum.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Wat u said r simply prediction which can be wrong. People predict oct last year the stocks r gonna crash but instead it rises. And the moment before the stock start to decline is the moment where the highest rise can be seen. There r also people suggesting the economy will downturn from last year but it rises again. So when will the economic downturn ? Nobody knows exactly when. Even the writers for your textbok do not know WHEN it is gonna fall. It can very well reach 2009 then it start to decline and a year is wasted. Tis "when" is the most crucial word. In fact nobody can say the rise is not gonna last till 2010 or 2011 as well.</p>
              <p> Now if there is a high demand of labour now (when we r in 2007), r u not gonna satisfy it and force the companies to relocate ? Should the gov refuse to let the economy grow by restricting on the workers here based on a prediction which can deviates from the truth ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>No, I got it in 2005. And at the start of the first semester in year 4, semester 1 (that's June 2007), I went around telling my friends and my sis to find a job asap as there might likely be an economic downturn when we graduate. I gave them the same reason as I gave you. Quite a number do not believe me at that time.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Tat is good for u but u r also implying your company to be so stupid they employ u without knowing the economy is gonna fall in 2008.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Fortunately our government is not as short-sighted as you. Are you seriously thinking that it will stop at 2.3%???? Somehow you like to constantly look at past events and pacify yourself that everything is well.</p>
              <p>And I'm not one that compares much with other countries. If we have problems within our society, we look at in within, not compare with other countries and console ourselves that it is acceptable. Please don't be a 2nd lionnoisy</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I do not know. Maybe it will become worse or become better. My point is we should plan and act according to the information we have so far. Now the best thing to do is to reduce the number of foreigners into the country.</p>
              <p>Talking about comparing between different countries, I felt it is important because it reflects the thing tat the gov can do and things tat the gov cannot do. Inflation is rising. If we just look at our country, it is quick to point the finger at the gov and blame them for the high inflation. However if we look globally, we realise tat few countries can stop tis problem. In short, no matter who act as gov, be it autocrats or democrats, good gov vs bad gov, opposition vs PAP, we r gonna see the same result. Tat is why there is a need to compare with other countries over certain issues to see if it can be helped or cannot be helped.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>1) I was never rude to the service person before this, and you are not there to witness what happened.</p>
              <p>2) I'm here to witness what M13 said, and I believe we have discussed, and you have agreed, that calling you stupid is not rude because it is your nickname.</p>
              <p>3) If your Christian name is stupid, there's nothing wrong for the teacher or policeman to call you "stupid".</p>
              <p>4) Are you blaming others for telling you off for your poor English letter writing standards? Let me tell you there's no double standards here.</p>
              <p>5) You have defended someone for so many posts a rude action which you have not even witness at all; there's a limit to word descriptions of rude actions. You merely brushed it away, yet when I defended M13 for his logical choice of words, you are telling me off?  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Aren't you being a hypocrite? Seems like you are the one who is practicing double standards here.</strong></span></p>
              <p>6) I have already mentioned. If you would like me to repost</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Com'on la... anyone can see tat he is being wilfully rude to me. And u defending his actions is something tat cannot be tolerated.</p>
              <p>1) I have also stated tat he never called out other person log in name on other reply but purposely put it for tis, and cut it short to reflect a derogative meaning. Tis highlight an intention to insult</p>
              <p>2) I never agree tat u can cut the log in name short to anything u wanna it to be. If a person show respect, he should quote out the full name and not anyway he like it to be, particularly if it is insulting. He should consult my permission for him to call me in another way tat is not my name if u talk about being respectful and courteous.</p>
              <p>3) My christian name is not "stupid". My log in name is "stupidissmart". U think a policeman can call a complainant "Hey Dick" and not "Mr Dickson"  when his name is Dickson ?</p>
              <p>4) I wrote the letter, it gets through and the result is achieved. He is not my supervisor or anyone tat has the right to comment on the way how I write a letter. Furthermore the way he mention the letter is insulting and his intention is malicious. Can a teacher insult a student's work maliciously even if the student is writing poorly ?</p>
              <p>5) I defended the person action based on the words u have given. I have already told u my justification previously why a "look" is not severe enough to be considered as being rude. From the way u mention the incident, it is also clear tat u r condsidering her to be rude simply because u think she is from another country based on the strong emphasis u have on it. Wat is wrong with standing up against bigotry ?</p>
              <p>6) M13 is not my supervisor or anything. I do not have to answer to him. I wrote a letter to IRAS, do I have to consult everybody here ? He is not even inside the discussion in the first place. I am not his slave or get his pay. Why do I need to take his malicious criticism when it is not asked ?</p>
              <p>7) Tis is a virtual world but the insults r there. Whether it is virtual or not, people get angry if someone insult u. Tat is why it should not be supported</p>
              <p>I have already stated tat a person with a nick starting in "e" in a certain forum has no parents tat teach him manners and support people for being rude. Either tat or his parents r probably dead or r either thieves and prostitutes or just plain stupid. Since tis is a virtual world, then surely tis "e" guy shouldn't be angry and smile over it, right ? Otherwise he is immature</p>

              <p>Then you have to ask yourself when you stuctured those questions to IRAS, were you writing from a tax avoidance point of view or IRAS.</p>
              <p>When I work for IRAS, obviously I work to the benefit of my employer.</p>
              <p>When I work for taxpayers, obviously is to minimize tax; when I work for IRAS, it's obviously to maximize tax.</p>

              <p> I already mentioned the important point is the underlying law on it. U can classify it as someone who bring in business by literaly doing nothing and claim all sort of things, but then if the case is taken the task is to convince the judge the case u wanted to state. If just claiming and trying to justify your action is already sufficient, then there is really no law tat can stop u from doing all the illegal things.</p>
              <p>U can state u recruit someone who do nothing, claim to bring in business and then get all the company profit and strangely remit them back to u eventually. U claim it is not wrong to recruit someone who do nothing.</p>
              <p>Then I can also state I have the right to walk around with a knife pointing outward and tis particular person who had grieviences with me just bumps into me and die in my hand. Is it wrong for me to carry a knife ?</p>
              <p>I can also claim i love to run around with hand outstretch and then touch all the women private part because I cannot control my running. Is it wrong to run with hands outstretched ?</p>
              <p>The way u ask is already more on whether can the case be found out, and not on whether is the whole deal illegal. Tat is why there is a need for a judge or a jury to cross off claims which is deemed to be excessive or illogical. Otherwise why do u think we need a judge ? Just claiming doesn't means it is right. It has to convince the judge in the end. The important thing about the enquiry is to know the baseline, tat is the part on whether is it legal or not. The ways to cover up etc is just redundant in the enquiry.</p>
              <p>Tat is why for the 2 scenario I have stated, the baseline question asked should be "is it illegal to kill someone" and "is it illegal to molest someone" and not "is it illegal to carry a knife, pointing it outward then tis guy bumps into me and die" or "is it illegal to run around with hand outstretched and then bumping into girls private part "</p>

              <p>Wat u said r simply prediction which can be wrong. People
                      predict oct last year the stocks r gonna crash but instead it
                      rises. And the moment before the stock start to decline is the
                      moment where the highest rise can be seen. There r also people
                      suggesting the economy will downturn from last year but it rises
                      again. So when will the economic downturn ? Nobody knows exactly
                      when. Even the writers for your textbok do not know WHEN it is
                      gonna fall. It can very well reach 2009 then it start to decline
                      and a year is wasted. Tis "when" is the most crucial word. In fact
                      nobody can say the rise is not gonna last till 2010 or
                      2011 as well.</p>
              <p> Now if there is a high demand of labour now (when we r in
                      2007), r u not gonna satisfy it and force the companies to
                      relocate ? Should the gov refuse to let the economy grow by
                      restricting on the workers here based on a prediction which can
                      deviates from the truth ?</p>
              <p>Tat is good for u but u r also implying your company to be so
                      stupid they employ u without knowing the economy is gonna fall
                      in 2008.</p>
              <p>I do not know. Maybe it will become worse or become better. My
                      point is we should plan and act according to the information we
                      have so far. Now the best thing to do is to reduce the number
                      of foreigners into the country.</p>
              <p>Talking about comparing between different countries, I felt it
                      is important because it reflects the thing tat the gov can do
                      and things tat the gov cannot do. Inflation is rising. If we just
                      look at our country, it is quick to point the finger at the gov and
                      blame them for the high inflation. However if we look globally, we
                      realise tat few countries can stop tis problem. In short, no matter
                      who act as gov, be it autocrats or democrats, good gov vs bad gov,
                      opposition vs PAP, we r gonna see the same result. Tat is why there
                      is a need to compare with other countries over certain issues to
                      see if it can be helped or cannot be helped.</p>
              <p>Com'on la... anyone can see tat he is being wilfully rude to me.
                      And u defending his actions is something tat cannot be
                      tolerated.</p>
              <p>1) I have also stated tat he never called out other person log
                      in name on other reply but purposely put it for tis, and cut it
                      short to reflect a derogative meaning. Tis highlight an intention
                      to insult</p>
              <p>2) I never agree tat u can cut the log in name short to anything
                      u wanna it to be. If a person show respect, he should quote out the
                      full name and not anyway he like it to be, particularly if it is
                      insulting. He should consult my permission for him to call me in
                      another way tat is not my name if u talk about being respectful and
                      courteous.</p>
              <p>3) My christian name is not "stupid". My log in name is
                      "stupidissmart". U think a policeman can call a complainant "Hey
                      Dick" and not "Mr Dickson"  when his name is Dickson ?</p>
              <p>4) I wrote the letter, it gets through and the result is
                      achieved. He is not my supervisor or anyone tat has the right to
                      comment on the way how I write a letter. Furthermore the way he
                      mention the letter is insulting and his intention is malicious. Can
                      a teacher insult a student's work maliciously even if the student
                      is writing poorly ?</p>
              <p>5) I defended the person action based on the words u have given.
                      I have already told u my justification previously why a "look" is
                      not severe enough to be considered as being rude. From the way u
                      mention the incident, it is also clear tat u r condsidering her to
                      be rude simply because u think she is from another country based on
                      the strong emphasis u have on it. Wat is wrong with standing up
                      against bigotry ?</p>
              <p>6) M13 is not my supervisor or anything. I do not have to answer
                      to him. I wrote a letter to IRAS, do I have to consult everybody
                      here ? He is not even inside the discussion in the first place. I
                      am not his slave or get his pay. Why do I need to take his
                      malicious criticism when it is not asked ?</p>
              <p>7) Tis is a virtual world but the insults r there. Whether it is
                      virtual or not, people get angry if someone insult u. Tat is why it
                      should not be supported</p>
              <p>I have already stated tat a person with a nick starting in "e"
                      in a certain forum has no parents tat teach him manners and support
                      people for being rude. Either tat or his parents r probably dead or
                      r either thieves and prostitutes or just plain stupid. Since tis is
                      a virtual world, then surely tis "e" guy shouldn't be angry and
                      smile over it, right ? Otherwise he is immature</p>

                                              another way tat is not my name if u talk about being respectful and
                                              courteous.</p>
              <p>3) My christian name is not "stupid". My log in name is
                                              "stupidissmart". U think a policeman can call a complainant "Hey
                                              Dick" and not "Mr Dickson"  when his name is Dickson ?</p>
              <p>4) I wrote the letter, it gets through and the result is
                                              achieved. He is not my supervisor or anyone tat has the right to
                                              comment on the way how I write a letter. Furthermore the way he
                                              mention the letter is insulting and his intention is malicious. Can
                                              a teacher insult a student's work maliciously even if the student
                                              is writing poorly ?</p>
              <p>5) I defended the person action based on the words u have given.
                                              I have already told u my justification previously why a "look" is
                                              not severe enough to be considered as being rude. From the way u
                                              mention the incident, it is also clear tat u r condsidering her to
                                              be rude simply because u think she is from another country based on
                                              the strong emphasis u have on it. Wat is wrong with standing up
                                              against bigotry ?</p>
              <p>6) M13 is not my supervisor or anything. I do not have to answer
                                              to him. I wrote a letter to IRAS, do I have to consult everybody
                                              here ? He is not even inside the discussion in the first place. I
                                              am not his slave or get his pay. Why do I need to take his
                                              malicious criticism when it is not asked ?</p>
              <p>7) Tis is a virtual world but the insults r there. Whether it is
                                              virtual or not, people get angry if someone insult u. Tat is why it
                                              should not be supported</p>
              <p>I have already stated tat a person with a nick starting in "e"
                                              in a certain forum has no parents tat teach him manners and support
                                              people for being rude. Either tat or his parents r probably dead or
                                              r either thieves and prostitutes or just plain stupid. Since tis is
                                              a virtual world, then surely tis "e" guy shouldn't be angry and
                                              smile over it, right ? Otherwise he is immature</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Who else thinks he's wilfully rude? By saying "anyone can see", you have effectively put words into everyone else's mouth.</p>
              <p>1) I thought you have already agreed calling you "stupid" because the first 6 letters of your chosen nick is "stupid" is not rude? How come bring this up again.</p>
              <p>2) Too bad, if you want to continue to use the nick stupidissmart, especially when the nick is already contradicting itself.</p>
              <p>3) In your logic for (6), M13 is not a policeman. Thus, your statement does not hold here.</p>
              <p>4) Are you sure the results is achieved? I believe both M13 and I have already told you it does not accurately reflect what was being said at all.</p>
              <p>Come on, don't shoot yourself in the foot. First, you told me that the reply from MOM to you don't seem right. Clearly, the desired result wasn't "achieved". Now you tell me that the result is achieved?</p>
              <p>5) You "defended the person action based on the words u have given". How valid do you think your reasoning is when you have not seen and witnessed what has happened?</p>
              <p>I have already told you that even if a Singaporean did this, it is still rude. No idea why you would still think it is discriminatory because she is from another country. Get your facts right.</p>
              <p>6) So in your logic, since I was in the discussion, you are telling me you are rude for not having consulted me in the first place when you want to bring a 3rd party in?</p>
              <p>7) As I have said before, if you get that angry if you get insulted in the virtual world, you should really mature more.</p>
              <p>I have already told you I wouldn't get angry if you throw insults at me in the forum. You are all the more welcomed to do so. And yes, I'm still smiling at your childishness of feeling angry over being called "stupid", especially when your nickname consists of the word "stupid" in the first 6 letters.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p> I already mentioned the important point is the underlying

                                          literaly doing nothing and claim all sort of things, but then if

                                          wanted to state. If just claiming and trying to justify your action
                                          is already sufficient, then there is really no law tat can stop u

              <p>I hope you realised that your "underlying law", which you have not proven to me which one, tells that the government is interfering with the way that companies can hire people.</p>
              <p>If the law is really as what you have described, I doubt companies will even bother to set up base here; as a CEO, do you want/like to have restrictions on who you can employ?</p>

              <p>Then no choice lor. Your mother and father must be pretty thick skinned to bring out a bastard such as u.

From the look of things, I am wondering if your future decendents r probably end up as prostitues and thieves as well. Your mum is so old and have so much STD, she is serving all the banglas to earn a few dollars to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>But obviously not anyone can be as thick skinned as u since it is obvious people do get angry over remarks made in the forums. As said before, being rude is something we all should restrain no matter wat situation we r in. However u really prove to me tat there r some guys who love people to insult their parents, such as u, and wouldn't mind people to humiliate them publicly. If u really think u r winning tis, let me tell u it is a thrill and a kick to insult and demean your parents as such and u can smile back and simply say I am childish. Ya lor... I am childish and your father in prison probably think tis way too.</p>
              <p>I will do something different. If someone insult my parents, I will certainly try to fight back their honor no matter wat it is about. However u refuse to defend your father and mother honor just because u wanna prove your point tat being rude is the way to go in the forum. Being in "virtual world" means anyone can be as rude as they want. We can see wat a fillial son u r in sacrificing their reputation for yourself in tis discussion. I really feel pity for them for taking care of u so long and u refusing to even defend their honor for some mario guy. Please reply hor.. then I can give more insults to them again</p>

                                      said before, being rude is something we all should restrain no
                                      matter wat situation we r in. However u really prove to me tat
                                      there r some guys who love people to insult their parents, such as
                                      u, and wouldn't mind people to humiliate them publicly. If u really
                                      think u r winning tis, let me tell u it is a thrill and a
                                      kick to insult and demean your parents as such and u can smile
                                      back and simply say I am childish. Ya lor... I am childish and your
                                      father in prison probably think tis way too.</p>
              <p>I will do something different. If someone insult my parents, I
                                      will certainly try to fight back their honor no matter wat it is
                                      about. However u refuse to defend your father and mother
                                      honor just because u wanna prove your point tat being rude is
                                      the way to go in the forum. Being in "virtual world" means anyone
                                      can be as rude as they want. We can see wat a fillial son u r in
                                      sacrificing their reputation for yourself in tis discussion. Please
                                      reply hor.. then I can give more insults to them again</p>
