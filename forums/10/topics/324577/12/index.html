              <p>There is a big difference when you say that property will generally appreciate over time, however what you and Eagle are trying to tell the forummers here is that in time of inflation property price will appreciate, and it will appreciate at the same pace as inflation..</p>
              <p>Hope you see the difference.What is US inflation now vs their housing price?</p>
              <p>What is UK inflation now vs their housing price?</p>
              <p>What is Singapore inflation now vs our housing price? </p>

              <p>Property price in Singapore is a good hedge against inflation because of many factors such as economic growth, stablity of the country and the lack of land supply in this country. Hence if you say that Singapore property price a good hedge against inflation <span style="text-decoration: underline;">over time</span>. I would say yes, however I will not go as far as telling people that this is a economic principle which can be applied to any property in the world because of the reasons which I have mentioned in my earlier post.</p>
              <p>And definitely I have not heard of any fool who dare to make the following statement except you and Eagle.</p>
              <p><em>The second element is inflation, the property you bought for $1,400,000 with an inflation of 6.7% a year, would have been priced at $1,493,800 at the end of 1 year</em></p>
              <p><em>Inflation  = 6.7% </em><em>so property price will appreciate by (6.7% x 1,400,000) </em></p>

              <p>Property price in Singapore is a good hedge against inflation because of many factors such as economic growth, stablity of the country and the lack of land supply in this country. Hence if you say that Singapore property price a good hedge against inflation <span style="text-decoration: underline;">over time</span>. I would say yes, however I will not go as far as telling people that this is a economic principle which can be applied to any property in the world because of the reasons which I have mentioned in my earlier post.</p>
              <p>And definitely I have not heard of any fool who dare to make the following statement except you and Eagle.</p>
              <p><em>The second element is inflation, the property you bought for $1,400,000 with an inflation of 6.7% a year, would have been priced at $1,493,800 at the end of 1 year</em></p>
              <p><em>Inflation  = 6.7%</em> <em>so property price will appreciate by (6.7% x 1,400,000)</em></p>
