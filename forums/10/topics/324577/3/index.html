              <p>time and again, you display a mind of a simpleton bordering on arrogance.</p>
              <p>the issue is no longer if you have a choice of jobs, it is rather you are price out, all other things being equal. unless the employer is an equal opportunity one, the uniquely singapore situation is always where the son of singapore got marginalized in his own land. perhaps not so much in the white collar space, but definitely in the blue collar space. i am a white collar worker, and i am been fortunate to have never been retrenched, but i have seen friends and close colleagues reduced to next to nothing after being retrenched overnight. when an opening recurs, he competes with all candidates on almost unequal terms, because he is most likely price out of the market because he would like to retain his lifestyle. there is nothing wrong in that. nobody likes to regress in his career path, including you, if you are working already.</p>
              <p>even for a sweeper, must the salary pave on a slippery slope when cost of living is rising? we are not even talking about keeping up with the inflation. on the same token, these so called elite continues to raise their own salaries to stratrosphere level, regardless of performance. if things need to be competitive, why can't they be the first and lead by example and take a pay cut? why the needy and the less-have needs to take the first cut?</p>
              <p>"not happy? be a taxi driver lah". " buay song ah, sweep the floor lah." this line of thinking reinforced your uncaring singaporean (if you are one) atttitude  with little or no compassion.</p>

              <p>I understand wat is happening but it is like the rise of fuel and commodities price. I also hear a lot of stories about how people find it difficult to feed themselves and make ends meet. But tis is a world wide phenomenon and wat can be done ?</p>
              <p>As said, if u stop FT from coming in, do u think it is good for the general population of singapore ? If u talk about being outpriced, singapore is already being out priced by other countries. It is sad people r retrenched but companies r already moving out singapore and if we r not careful, the employment rate may increase. Then tat is the real problem since more retrenchment and more lower wage can be seen. So wat do u propose we should do ?</p>
              <p>As said, the only thing to do is simply... choose the best course of action for the general good of the citizen. Think of the big picture. There r people retrenched and people who downgrade their lifestyles, but otherwise it may be the case of massive retrenchment and massive unemployment resulting in a worse problem.</p>
              <p>It is covenient to put the finger on FT, but think of it tis way. The company is already sensitive about wages and tat is why they r recuiting FT instead. If tis option is unavailable, they can just find it easier to relocate to their country instead.</p>
              <p>About the pay of minister, one phenomenon seen is tat the top job of CEO or Vice president etc is rising while the bottom rung of the population see their salary reduced. Do we really have to peg their pay to sweepers ? The sweepers pay reduce while the CEO increase, then we reduce minister's pay ? Then if opposite happens where CEO reduce and sweeper increase, do we also reduce their pay ? If we reduced the pay, there will be an obvious effect tat some will leave and lesser choice for the replacement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, i am not an uncaring person... and I am not rich, surviving only on less than 3000 a month. But then when i see things, i see them through logic and rationality and often think "If I am in their shoes, wat will i do" before I complain.</p>

              <p>I thought upgrading is a change in profession. If u upgrade from a lorry driver to become, lets say, a clerk.</p>
              <p>Then your pay is gonna increase as well as your life</p>

              <p>i am glad i can help you broaden your horizon here. upgrading doesn't mean just a change of profession. it can also mean moving up the food chain on the type of job you are currently on.</p>

              <p>I mentioned this before too to the other forumers. But then, from your reply, it seems that you are one easily resigned by fate and circumstances. Either that or you must be easily satisfied, preferring to work till age 70, then go around collect metal can drinks during your twilight years for survival.</p>

              <p>Actually u r pretty right on me being resigned by fate and circumstances <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>My motto is to do things using the "best course of action" approach...</p>
              <p>As said long time ago. Life is just gonna get harder and harder... The problems of the other develop economies is high unemployment rate and stagnant pay as well...</p>
              <p>I don't know.. maybe I just see the problem too analytically and not emotionally</p>

              <p>Well, that amount offered wouldn't even make them bat an eyelid, and I dare to say that they wouldn't even bother going to apply for and collect it. Even then, I would say they deserve the money too, because they have made gigantic contributions to Singapore. So yes, the old boss of CK Tang and banks do deserve the welfare money.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The amount is enough for some to survive solely on it. And tis money should be given to the needy and not to the rich. Giving to the rich is giving less to the poor</p>

              <p>We had seen high demand for jobs matched by high (and easy) supply of FTs. That wouldn't equate to an increase in pay leh</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Believe it or not, the number of FT r not free flow. There is a quota for number of local to number of foreigner in a company</p>

              <p>So it is still good isn't it ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On FT, I must say I do not know all the things because of the obvious fact I am not from the gov service. I can only offer is my point of view. As said before, a lot of developed countries have problem with immigration as well and it is a source of complaints and a reason to swging votes for their country.</p>
              <p>IMO, however one thing tat is always mixed up is tat people feel tat because of FT their lives has become worse. To me, it is actually the life had become worse and tat is why FT has to come in.</p>
