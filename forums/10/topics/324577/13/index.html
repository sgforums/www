              <p>It still doesn't answer whether it is tax evasion to do so</p>
              <p>I have already told you that on paper, I can employ someone to just merely answer phone calls, but in actual fact, give her no phone calls =&gt; do nothing. To that effect, I will be able to employ more FTs to do the job cheaper, which results in an increase in company income; it produces more income. This was mentioned to you a 2nd time in page 7, which you have till now no comments, but continuously tell me it is illegal since it will reduce company profits and reduce tax paid.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>As I have mentioned to you, if the main aim was such that the
                                                              employer can employ more foreign workers at a cheaper rate, the
                                                              profit of the company will be increased, not reduced. Thus, (3) and
                                                              (4) does not hold.</p>
              <p>I know your point. You are still thinking about the evading of
                                                              tax, which wasn't even the main aim here. The main aim was to
                                                              increase company profit by being able to hire workers at an overall
                                                              cheaper average rate to do the same things, and we are discussing
                                                              based on the point that foreign workers are cheaper to the employer
                                                              than local workers.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> We can see from the letter that it is tax deductible if the salary is used in the production of income, from what was earlier told you three times, there will be an increase in company income.</p>
              <p>And again, this was what you have said.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>If I am not wrong, after giving business tax, u still have to
                                                              give income tax since it is something u earn. If I am wrong,
                                                              the tax rate for business and personal income is still different,
                                                              especially when personal income have a lot of deductables. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So do u
                                                              think tat if I give all the business profit as salary to an
                                                              individual, it is not considered as tax evasion ?</strong></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> And for your statement in bold, no where was it stated that the salary you give to an employee have to comensurate the amount of contribution to the company; you can even give one million dollars to a receptionist just to answer phone calls on the handphone or at home, even though there might be no phone calls sent at all.</p>
              <p>Do you still not understand what is meant by legal loopholes? It is a lot about the playing of words to make things legal, on paper and/or on accounts, be it unethical or dishonest a not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I expect your letter to MOM to be a question on whether it is legal to employ someone in your company, but give that person nothing to do =&gt; employing someone to do nothing.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I was shocked by your comprehension ability or disability, perhaps that is the reason why most disagreement occurs with you. You obviously don't understand the meaning of "tax evasion". Not being tax deductible does not mean it is not tax evasion, if it's not tax deductible and you file in your income tax returns as deductible, you would have committed tax evasion. Be it tax avoidance or tax evasion is a matter of the ability of your accountant.</p>
              <p>The way you phrased your letter was equivalent to a lawyer on the defence of an accused submitting his plea as such, "My client stabbed the victim 20 times, there were 10 witnesses to the crime. My client is guilty as charged, what is the punishment?" As opposed to, "My client at the time of the offence was under the influence of psychotropic drugs which was used to control his schizophrenic tendencies. During the commission of the offence, my client was not of sound mind and therefore not in control of himself." One plea will land you on the gallows, while the other might land you in jail.</p>
              <p>I don't need to assure myself that I am correct if you were to send that query in. I used to work as an auditor, there is no doubt in my mind that even if my employees performed no physical labour, but if their services are incurred wholly and exclusively for my business, I can get tax deductions.</p>

              <p>I used to argue like the above, stating tat giving salary to people doing nothing is tax evasion.</p>
              <p>The reply I got from IRAS is tat the profit from the company is still register as the one before u give the salary to the people. Tis is because they r not considered to be directly involved in the production and business and therefore it is not tax dedeuctable. Tat means u still have to pay the same business tax. If u pay lesser, then if they find out from the accounts and find evidence u did the above, then u have committed tax evasion</p>
              <p>However if u r willing to pay the business tax, and wanted to employ imaginary people to offset the local to foreigner ratio, then it is not illegal from IRAS.</p>
              <p>Of course, u can lie or claim tat the people u employed r all actually working for the company by just registering their name or something. If u wanna be dishonest, there r a million and one things u can do to reduce tax. U can claim the person is on long term MC, or claim he works and pull in business, or claim he is there to listen to imaginary phone calls, or claim many many incredible stuffs. If the gov found out, they can prosecute.

              <p>I used to argue like the above, stating tat giving salary to people doing nothing is tax evasion.</p>
              <p>The reply I got from IRAS is tat the profit from the company is still register as the one before u give the salary to the people. Tis is because they r not considered to be directly involved in the production and business and therefore it is not tax dedeuctable. Tat means u still have to pay the same business tax. If u pay lesser, then if they find out from the accounts and find evidence u did the above, then u have committed tax evasion</p>
              <p>However if u r willing to pay the business tax, and wanted to employ imaginary people to offset the local to foreigner ratio, then it is not illegal from IRAS.</p>
              <p>Of course, u can lie or claim tat the people u employed r all actually working for the company by just registering their name or something. If u wanna be dishonest, there r a million and one things u can do to reduce tax. U can claim the person is on long term MC, or claim he works and pull in business, or claim he is there to listen to imaginary phone calls, or claim many many incredible stuffs. If the gov found out, they can prosecute.

              <p>Please don't insult me by associating me with you.</p>
              <p>First of all, you went through all the mumbo jumbo and didn't even answer my simple question. Or you don't know the answer?</p>
              <p>If a businessman wants to avoid paying tax, surely he won't be STUPID like you and tell IRAS what you just did in the query. Whether it's legal or legal rest with the ability of the tax accountant. If he employs staff to do nothing, surely he won't be stupid to tell the IRAS that they are doing nothing. If all the paper work is proper, there should be no questions about it's legality.</p>
              <p>If the government finds out they can prosecute? You mean if I decide to pay my secretary $10,000 a month to make one cup of coffee during that one month, it is wrong. It's up to me to decide the job scope of my employees, if I so decide to pay $10,000 for my secretary to make me 1 cup of coffee, or sit around the office to do nothing for 1 minute, it's entirely my choice. IRAS can't dispute the salary I pay her. Funny how you claim that IRAS can claim it's illegal for me to pay what I choose to pay to my employees.</p>
              <p>The way you phrased your query is to admit full guilt, it's not from the perspective of a businessman with tax avoidance on his agenda. Afterall, your point of contention is from the perspective of a businessman wanting to avoid tax, not from a halfwit claiming full responsibility of a crime when the verdict of guilt is straddled atop the fence.</p>
              <p>Why not send it the letter of query written by me, see if it's legal.</p>

              <p>If a businessman wants to avoid paying tax, surely he won't be STUPID like you and tell IRAS what you just did in the query. Whether it's legal or legal rest with the ability of the tax accountant. If he employs staff to do nothing, surely he won't be stupid to tell the IRAS that they are doing nothing. If all the paper work is proper, there should be no questions about it's legality.</p>

              <p>U r implying there is a dishonest element in the whole deal. Sure, u can bluff your way employing a guy who basically do nothing and claim he did a lot of thing, then have tis guy remit the money back to your bank. If u claim he did basically nothing, then tat is found not to be directly relevant to the whole deal and it is not tax deductable. However if the gov found out tat such a practise occurs, he can very well sue u. It is not about <em>whether it can be discovered or not</em>. It is about whether is the whole deal is <em>illegal or not</em>. I have already answered previously. However the concept is just too difficult for u to grasp</p>

              <p>If the government finds out they can prosecute? You mean if I decide to pay my secretary $10,000 a month to make one cup of coffee during that one month, it is wrong. It's up to me to decide the job scope of my employees, if I so decide to pay $10,000 for my secretary to make me 1 cup of coffee, or sit around the office to do nothing for 1 minute, it's entirely my choice. IRAS can't dispute the salary I pay her. Funny how you claim that IRAS can claim it's illegal for me to pay what I choose to pay to my employees.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>For the whole scheme to work, the secretary have to pay the money back to u. If she is found to be your close relative, then the whole deal is also dubious. U can free to give any pay to your secretary for doin nothing but it is not tax deductable. Tat is the bottomline</p>
