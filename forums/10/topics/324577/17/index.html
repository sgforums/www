              <p>Singapore?<br>What can I say?<br>Love/Hate relationship, though I can say confidently that the <em>hate </em>part grows more and more everyday.</p>
              <p>More like resentment, actually.</p>
              <p>To come from an upper middle class family and down to a lower-middle class family as the family fortune fell into ruin. Of course, I accept my lot in life, but the experiences as an impressionable child of how Singaporeans are just brainwashed to treat you like a walking bank account screen.</p>
              <p>$2,000,000 balance on screen. (of course, balance not in real-life lah. Wait long long. This is an example)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>*ka-ching*</p>
              <p>Everyone treats you like God incarnate.  Your lifestyle is unparalleled. The ignorance I was steeped in being well-to-do is staggering. I had never been to an HDB flat before, not even a void deck. Blissful. What I didn't know was the suffering of the middle-class to poorer Singaporeans who had to get through day after day and try not to *think* about it.</p>
              <p>Then, bang. This is where my life changed, my eyes opened. I thank God for making this happen,because without it I would never be who I am today -  a compassionate, thinking individual - a human being.</p>
              <p>We are brainwashed into selfish, self-serving idiots, divided by the system so that we can't unite and cry foul against the very system which imprisonates us and forces us to work for barely a pittance.</p>
              <p>For someone who has been to hell and back; I've been rich, I've been poor, to the point where we did not have money to eat on some days and we had no running water and electricity for a year. We had to get the compassionate help from a neighbour - who, not surprisingly - is not Singaporean. She is British.</p>
              <p>I was 14. Climbed over her fence daily to get water in buckets which we would squat and bathe ourselves over in the mornings before going to school. It was freezing cold. Gosh, did we appreciate warm running water, truly, at that moment. A year ago from that date, we had a driver to chauffuer us around. What did we learn? Everything.</p>
              <p>When you are poor, people tell you to <strong>suck it up</strong> and shut the f--k up because we don't want to hear your complaints, you're lucky enough to be alive.</p>
              <p>When you're poor, you're expected to get rations from help groups, half-eaten, and when you bring it up they scold you for being 'ungrateful'.</p>
              <p>Excuse me, but even a poor person has dignity. You don't give half-eaten food to them. You give it to your pets. And if they're spoiled (like mine, and I would imagine, most of those of you who love their pets), they would even turn their nose up at it.</p>
              <p>This is the state of welfare in the country. I know because I've been there. Life as a poor SG dweller is the pits.</p>
              <p>Now of course, I'm a happy camper. Normal, well-adjusted middle-class gal with a positive outlook on life and a desire to help my fellow man.</p>
              <p>At least, when I'm overseas, I'm not even their citizen but they can offer me welfare. Wow. They offer me rights. Gee. <br>They treat me like a human being.</p>
              <p>I find that I learnt how to be compassionate and stand up for myself overseas. Strange. Isn't it? Don't your parents teach you that? No, not in Singapore, because they themselves have never been taught that, or were trained to just stick it to the very end of their priorities because it doesn't matter. Not next to money, status, material.</p>
              <p>This is what Singapore lacks. The human spirit. Instead of being encouraged to be compassionate, kind, thoughtful and an intelligent thinking being, we are encouraged to shut the effing hell up, and just work for the rich, dammit.</p>
              <p>Pay too low? Go lor, I employ Bangladeshi.</p>
              <p>The prevailing attitude is not the want and desire to help your fellow Singaporeans but to screw them for your own benefit.</p>
              <p>That's why so many Singaporeans are leaving in droves. Because they are tired of being invisible workhorses of society and not afforded a voice nor rights, the most basic premise of a democracy.</p>
              <p>I'm not asking for a U.S style "kill em' all or screw em'" democracy. I'm not asking for Cuban communism. I'm not asking for some Stalin Socialist state. I'm asking for a democracy where Singaporeans are equal, afforded rights and a voice.</p>
              <p>Not some media circus facade and empty plot of land where I can already picture ISD clowns laying in wait to drag me off to 'indefinite detention' just because I asked a simple question which made people think.</p>
