              <p>I was told by a Danish guy that with S$200k, in Denmark they can buy the land and build a house.   In Singapore you pay the same amount it is just only a HDB flat with owners having to obey the "law" from the government.  </p>

              <p>Yah.</p>
              <p>First $80k should be $4,300, my fault, I just took the first figure I saw on my mater tax guide.</p>
              <p>Thanks for pointing it out.</p>
              <p>So it should be the initial $4,300 reduced to $1,800 for both husband and wife.</p>

              <p>Indonesian maids worked here for 2 years, after paying back all debts, usually take home S$2000. With that, go back home can buy land, build house for the whole family and got married. But it is their kind of lifestyle.</p>
              <p>In Canada, you can buy houses with the price of HDB here, you can buy bungalow facing the seas in Vancouver for the price of a miserable terrace house in Singapore. but you have to drive at least 45 mins to reach the city. Cars are also cheap but you need at least two cars in every household unless you live alone. Not likely that their Skytrain will reach where you live. Have to eat in and have to work at your garden comes every Summer. Unless you are very very rich, you can't afford a maid or gardener. Suburb lifestyle is different and may be difficult for city dweller.</p>
              <p>In Indonesia, I understand if you convert all your money into Rupiah by selling off you HDB flat. and put in the local banks, you can live a good lifestyle for the rest of your life. The risk is Rupiah devaluation, and you will need extra for medical attention in Singapore.</p>
