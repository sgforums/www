              <p>I have mentioned einstein intelligence. However the emphasis is also placed on gov officials. I mention einstein is the most intelligent person in the world however tat is not concluding he is always right.

              <p>Well I stated the gov officials in too. U might as well make me eat more words by claiming I said tat "civil servants r always right".

              <p>For M13, I had already given him a reply repeatedly which he never answer to it.</p>
              <p>For u, the only thing u complain about is "do not do anything". I have also told u it is a correct interpretation of MY enquiry which u never answer to it as well. So ? Wat r the specific problem u r seeing ?</p>

              <p><span class="postbody">On the subject of helping to CREATE jobs, this is what actually happens:
              <br> <br> There is a quota system for employer to hire foreign worker (SP &amp;
              WP). The employer must have a number of local headcounts (C + PR) and
              based on this is then allocated foreign worker quota. For example in
              the services sector, it will need to "employ" 5 local workers to get a
              quota of 5 WP of which only 1 can be from PRC.
              <br> <br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Many SMEs and small restaurants and shops will not have so many
              local employees. So in order to get the quota, what these companies did
              was to simply contribute CPF for some housewives, their uncles and
              aunties who are not working. </span><br> <br>Ha ha, now we suddenly got an improvement in labor employment and
              most amazingly, many senior citizens or older workers are back in the
              workforce again. I remember our dear Dr. Ng EH was so proud of his
              ministries, but they either do not know the real reasons or pretended
              not to know.
              <br> <br>So we got PHANTOM JOBS being created for the local workforce and
              got VIRTUAL improvements in unemployment figures! -- everything is
              virutal that sounds like computer games more than reality.</span></p>

              <p>anyone can notice the parallellism here? Thats really strange
                  that 1000 ppl every year migrate.</p>
              <p>last i know that this scenario is for 3rd world countries like
                  Sri Lanka, Africa where they come to Australia to escape their
                  hopeless fate in their homelands. These people could not go back
                  due to various reasons like civil war, poverty ect. and they stay
                  in australia to get an education and a job.</p>
              <p>But Singapore, a first world country?! . 1st world country, 3rd
                  world situation. Uniquely Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are the new "refugees", abeit a higher
                  class one, educated and skilled in other countries.</p>
              <p>There are other parallellesims as well which such as the Death
                  Penalty and Caning which resembles 3rd world countries.</p>

              <p>Yes, correct lah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Visa and immigration policies are reciprocal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore has very good connections with many countries. That is why Singapore passport holders no need visa to visit many countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>China/India another other 3rd worlds have many illegals immigrant in USA. </p>

              <p>Have you ever heard of Singaporean Illegal Immigrant in USA ? Nope.</p>

              </p><p>the figure stated 1000 successfully left. But not the figures for those <strong>who want to leave. I am sure, as u stated 17 , 000 are wanting to leave.</strong></p>
              <p>BUT FINACIAL REASON DUE TO LOW PAY, LACK OF ANY REAL ASSET is the reason why many are still stuck. A recent survey conducted shows that 50 % of singapore's youth wanting to leave.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But in AUS, many citizens have the real skills and expereince to leave for their destination countries as life here is not controlled and repressed in terms of education, training, work force ect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know many Aus youths 21 years old in age are already stire or retail managers, comparing to our sg youth who at 21 still in Poly or serving NS.</p>
              <p>It is all these cumulative reasons as to why many are still stuck here. You may be right, its not simple, but complicated.</p>

              <p>One factor that affects the eligibility of citizens for migration is educational level. A developed country assesses the suitability of candidates based on educational level, the higher the educational level, the more likely you would be granted citizenship. Another factor could be the amount of wealth that you can bring into their country.</p>
              <p>There could also be other social factors that precludes Asians from migrating to more westernised societies.</p>
              <p>Australia's above Bachelor Degree graduates was 22.7% for 2006, while Singapore's was 13.5% for 2005. There is no question that Australia has more qualified candidates for immigration. Not many people in Singapore qualify for immigration to developed countries.</p>
              <p>There is little doubt that "lionnoisy" could ever satisfy the criteria for immigration status in Australia, hence the vindictiveness of his attitude towards Australia. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>One thing's for sure, I am just glad I don't live next door to "lionnoisy", for if I were to better him in any aspects, he would start criticising me and my family in front of our neighbours. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
