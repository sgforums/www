              <p>Believe me, there's a way to circumvent that quota (more of a ratio) easily. I have mentioned it before somewhere else in this forum. One method: employ someone else (maybe a housewife) by name, and pay that person CPF, but no salary. Then you can employ even more foreigners already, because on paper, you have employed another Singaporean. The amount paid to the CPF is much less than what a boss could have paid if he had really employed one more Singaporean.</p>

              <p>On FT, I must say I do not know all the things because of the obvious fact I am not from the gov service. I can only offer is my point of view. As said before, a lot of developed countries have problem with immigration as well and it is a source of complaints and a reason to swging votes for their country.</p>
              <p>IMO, however one thing tat is always mixed up is tat people feel tat because of FT their lives has become worse. To me, it is actually the life had become worse and tat is why FT has to come in.</p>

              <p>I do not agree with tis point of view. Most senior citizens r not needy and if we just give, we r reducing the amount of money the needy can get. Lets say only 20% r needy and instead of channeling money to tis group of people, we r giving to the insanely rich people as well. Tat is not right</p>

              <p>Well, the problem here is that FTs take over your jobs even though they might not be as good in their studies.</p>
              <p>That said, I have already demonstrated my capabilities in my results and achievements, and I have to say that it is not as easy as you have made it out ("with the if you are good in your studies"). I know I will be able to land a job in most places because my achievements are definitely within the top 1%, but it is my many other friends whose results are not as good who are finding it extremely hard to land a job now.</p>
              <p>And again, I do have many FTs as my friends. But then, it will really make you think twice about the govt policies when you do have an encounter that I had today. I spoke to a PRC cashier in English, and she replied in Mandarin. If that's all, it's still ok, but she gave a look like "why can't you just speak Mandarin if you know how to". And this is not unique to the cashier I encountered, I'm pretty sure there are many others.</p>
              <p>The most polite and nice foreign workers I've met so far are actually the Bangla construction workers.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>When the economy is bad, the FT comes in lesser number. U can't just drive them out like cattles</p>
