              <p>hey stupid,</p>
              <p>i wish you would stop giving an either or choice where one is a glorified good life you portrayed and the other gloom and doom without PAP (as you infer). no one wants to live in a latter choice as you put it if one can help it, but PAP is not the only party who can provide a good life to its people. nor an alternative party will flush sungapore down the sewage system.</p>
              <p>your constant referral to this in multiple posts is a pain to read as it shows your shallow inadequacy in thinking beyond the PAP line that you have been brainwashed to.</p>

              <p>speaking in absolutes again...who is advocating liberal democracy?</p>
              <p>what is required of the ruling party, amongst many things, is a little more compassion to its own people in these day and time where a little sheltering would be good. instead, we are seeing a greater divide now.</p>

              <p>Tis is a very complicated problem which a lot of countries faces. However one thing for sure in singapore is, if u r a normal person job is not tat difficult to find. The unemployment rate of singapore is low. The problem is, all the people wanna do good job and not do lousy work. If u r an engineer, there r always jobs waiting for u at the ship yard. But few singaporean go because they find it too far, too hard and too little pay. If u r a poly, u can try to be a nurse. Hospital r also finding it difficult to find nurses. But again few singaporean apply. If u r o level and below, u can be a bus driver. Sad to say, tat FT r the one tat can keep up with demand. There r other jobs which no singaporean r even thinking. Maids, machinist, construction workers etc. So wat to do ? FT. If they r not here, some singaporean will be forced to be a construction worker. Do u like to be a construction worker ? FT has a purpose.</p>
              <p>If u talk about old people, then I am wondering how can they be employed ? They do not have strength, can not learn new things, not a clear mind and do not know english. Then wat jobs r left for them ?</p>

              <p>just reading your reply , i can only say that your grasp of what's needed to be done here to make life a little more bearable for the those(singaporeans) who need help, is wanting. </p>
              <p>no one is denying that there are pockets of jobs that perhaps these so-called FTs (which is a misnomer, btw) has a use for/in singapore. you have a fundamental problem if you have a free wage market where the locals cannot adequately compete on a level playing field because the loaded cost of living is already fixed at a certain level living in singapore. in developed, english speaking markets like the USA and australia, do you have similar situation where migrants have a field day getting in and out of the country (with ease) and competing on wages on a wide scale of industry and work level with the locals? or for the matter, UK. do you see a situation where anyone can enter freely and compete for jobs at all levels of the basis of wages?</p>
              <p>granted there will be some jobs where singaporean will not get their hands dirty on; but if these can be compensated by a competitive wage where they felt that it is worth their while to work to support their family, i am certain that no one will be such a block head as to prefer to remain jobless than to do something.</p>
              <p>your generalization of singaporean as unaccomodating is uncalled for.</p>
              <p>finally, you contradicted yourself when you said  "...all the people wanna do good job and not do lousy work." this free market thingy the government is so fond of using as a guise for keeping blue collar wages low is what will be the unravelling factor to singapore's competitiveness in the long run. as people are willing to work for less now, you will find less qualified people holding the same job and less pride is put onto the work. not to mention the negative social impact that is yet to hit singapore.</p>
              <p>what good is a singapore that is top this, top that, hub this, hub that when its soul is no longer in the right place?  </p>

              <p>Not a complicated problem at all.</p>
              <p>One simple reason why it is so...</p>
              <p>Singaporean are too cheapskate.</p>
              <p>Everything we want .. cheap.</p>
              <p>And because the world is not equal.</p>
              <p>We bring in cheap labor from cheaper countries.</p>
              <p>So yes... we should be glad countries like Indonesia.. Philipines..Thailand.. Vietnam stays impoverized... simply because we want cheap labor.</p>
              <p>Without this inequality... Singaporeans will all suffer.</p>
              <p>So better to have people from another country suffer, so we can take advantage.</p>

              <blockquote>no one is denying that there are pockets of jobs that perhaps these so-called FTs (which is a misnomer, btw) has a use for/in singapore. you have a fundamental problem if you have a free wage market where the locals cannot adequately compete on a level playing field because the loaded cost of living is already fixed at a certain level living in singapore. in developed, english speaking markets like the USA and australia, do you have similar situation where migrants have a field day getting in and out of the country (with ease) and competing on wages on a wide scale of industry and work level with the locals? or for the matter, UK. do you see a situation where anyone can enter freely and compete for jobs at all levels of the basis of wages?</blockquote>
              <p>To be frank, tis is link with their immigration problem and US british etc find more and more immigrants coming in to work. In Europe, after the integration of the euro group, people r indeed more mobile and the immigrants come in the form of poorer europe countries. In US, they also find themselves having to deal with the chinese and india who stay after they get their degree. Tat is why during election, immigration issue is something big for them. If u go to US or french, u can find there r a lot of chinese, african and india. If u go to italy, u will find a lot of people r from africa. If u r in germany, u will find more people from eastern europe. If u go to australia, there is also quite a high number of chinese. Even if u wanna go to japan, u can find more south americans there</p>
              <p>If u compare with singapore, one thing for sure is tat the unemployment rate is low. Tis is unlike US or Europe or Australia where their unemployment is generally much higher. Furthermore, it is not tat easy for foreigner to come in anytime they want and leave anytime they want.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>granted there will be some jobs where singaporean will not get their hands dirty on; but if these can be compensated by a competitive wage where they felt that it is worth their while to work to support their family, i am certain that no one will be such a block head as to prefer to remain jobless than to do something.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The problem is, there r enough jobs for people out there. Who is really out of job ? The real complaint is they find the job being paid too low. A person prefer to work in a job with a better condition than a job with a worse condition. And if u pay much higher than the other normal industries, then they will shift to another cheaper place outside singapore. Otherwise they just pass the cost to u. Lets name an example. If we r forced to give $1200 for a local construction worker than $400 for a foreigner, then r u willing to accept a house tat is 2 times more expensive ? Do u mind paying 30% more for staying in hospital if we employ local nurses ?</p>
              <p>Let me ask u a difficult moral dilemma. Do u want a company tat employ all foreginers as their workers yet pay the land, tax, bill and spend in singapore or u prefer the company to move out of singapore ?</p>
              <p>One of the main problem of singapore is high labour cost. If a company employs all foreign workers, tis labour cost is offset and operating cost is lower, inducing them to come to singapore to invest or stay. However the employment of local will be damn low and tat is bad for citizen</p>
              <p>If we force them not to employ any foreigner, then the labour cost is very high and tis eats into the operating cost, inducing companies not to invest in singapore or move out of singapore. Then companies will moved out, jobs become scarce and pay still reduced since supply is more than demand</p>
              <p>So wat is the best model ? Ensure the companies r still attracted to singapore by the reduced stress on labour through FT, but still make sure local people r still employed by having tax on foreign workers or a quota of local to foreign workers. The most important thing is to make sure unemployment rate is low and it is tuned by adjusting the amount of foreigners coming over to work</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>finally, you contradicted yourself when you said  "...all the people wanna do good job and not do lousy work." this free market thingy the government is so fond of using as a guise for keeping blue collar wages low is what will be the unravelling factor to singapore's competitiveness in the long run. as people are willing to work for less now, you will find less qualified people holding the same job and less pride is put onto the work. not to mention the negative social impact that is yet to hit singapore.</p>
              <p>what good is a singapore that is top this, top that, hub this, hub that when its soul is no longer in the right place?  </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I thought I state man's nature. All people want to do good job and not do lousy job. Who in the right frame of mind prefer to do a lousy job when they can do a good one ? If u talk about putting less pride into the work, then frankly speaking from donkey years ago, blue collar workers always think they r paid too little. Because people compare themselves with other type of work and they will feel they r paid lower than white collar workers. Tat is why tat is a supervisor around since the start of industralisation. They have to find motivation for the worker through a carrot and stick approach. Do u think the pride level changes significantly over the years ? In history, nobody in any country feel they r paid too much as a blue collar worker.</p>

              <p>In and out is very common.In fact,gross migration leaving SG</p>
              <p>shall be more than 1000.Many came to SG,at least planned for short term.</p>
              <p>Many become long term and settle here.</p>
              <p>But our net gain is very high,if u trust CIA report.</p>

              <p>is a police state?</p>

              <p><br>The 66.6% voters are to be blamed for allowing us all this shit from the evil despots.    LKY contributed in the past.   Now he is so sick to keep basing on the past to keep boasting.    Thank goodness, not all Singaporeans are blind like some lackeys here to believe and support what he says.    Just that day, I went to 7 Eleven to pay the bill when mentioned about living costs continuously getting high and government is partially responsible for it.   The cashier aunty was so fast to defend the ruling party, she said does not blame the PAP for they are good we have no war in Singapore.   Later when I left, I found out she did not return my ATM card.   Scary, because of PAP she refused to return me my ATM card.    just kidding lah.    Some people just enjoy living within the fence PAP has set up.     Silly.  </p>
