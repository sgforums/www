              <p>GST is a way to tax. Why u suddenly mention about tis ? If we follow your plan, we have to increase to 10%. U think it is good ?</p>
              <p>Cos effectiveness wise, u have failed to say why will it be expensive to find how who r more needy. Just dumping money to everyone is the worst cost efficiency idea if your aim is to help needy elderly</p>

              <p>The cheating is the same, is just tat u feel the amount here is too much. However the whole mechanism is the same</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Which is? There must be contract of service. Now tell me, which part said exactly that</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>If u want to be an employer, if u wanna give a contract of employment, u must follow the employment act. Tat is the law. And wat is constitute an "employee", it is defined in section 2 of the act</p>
              <dl>
              <p> </p>
              "employee" means a person who has entered into or works under a contract of service with an employer and includes a workman and any officer or employee of the Government <strong>included in a category, class or description of such officers or employees declared by the President to be employees for the purposes of this Act</strong> or any Part or section thereof; but does not include any seaman, domestic worker, or any person employed in a managerial, executive or confidential position or any person belonging to any other class of persons whom the Minister may, from time to time by notification in the <em>Gazette</em>, declare not to be employees for the purposes of this Act;</dl>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Again, I have to remind you that what your 2 companies did is illegal because of the discrepancies in the records.

              <p>If hiring a construction firm to renovate nothing is a defense, u think they will not use it ? If going for training to train nothing is a defense, u think she will go to jail ? There is no desprepancy. Durai say he employ the person to renovate. It can mean renovate nothing. The girl says she can give money for training. And it can mean training for nothing.</p>
              <p> I challenge u already. If u think your system work and u claim it work, then send a email to ministry of manpower or IRAS and ask them if it is legal or not. Your idea is so absurb tat it makes worse sense than the two examples above</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>You still haven't not pointed out at all how doing nothing is not a contract of service. Or if I'm the employer, I can even put it down as having employed someone to sit at home to wait for important calls, which you won't rerout over at all.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Is the person really sitting at home waiting for important call ? IF she is, then she cannot move anywhere during the hours and she need higher pay than doing nothing, which make it senseless for u to employ her.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Let's come to a conclusion on this too. Like I have mentioned, this is a legal loophole. It is officially legal, but it is unethical.</p>

              <p>Tis is obviously cheating. U not only cheat the tax agency u also cheat the ministry of manpower. Up till now u only make claim but show to back up with Chapter 91 Section 2 on the employment act</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I'm saying when unemployment rate is rising, why are FWs still as freely available as before, and in fact, being employed more readily that Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>And again, which you have also agreed, FTs and FWs do have a role in Singapore, but it is the way in which the incumbent has handled it that does not appeal to us. More QC is needed.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>U know in classic economic, too low an unemployment is not an optimised economy. How to increase the employment rate ? Before, I was told by u and reddust tat states very serious employment problems in singapore. Now I feel the problem is controlled..</p>

              <p>Next, it is already wrong to use the phrase dummy worker (which actually means you are employing a non-existent worker, no name, no identification number, etc). An employee has been physically  employed. There has been no evasion of tax, and by being able to employ more FTs for a higher profit, you pay more tax instead.</p>

              <p>Even if it is done out there it doesn't means it is right. They probably declare the person as a clerk and give her pay but she never come. Although it is hard to find out, legally it is dishonest. Tat is why people r doing it. However u r not giving the person a portfolio. Tat person cannot be considered as an employee because of the employment act. All contract tat is sign on employment have to follow the rules set by the employment act to prevent minor being abuse or boss exploiting worker and also employers cheating the system (in your case). It is not illegal, but the person with no portfolio is not considered an employee and canno be counted as a local</p>
              <p>Talking about tax evasion, I know wat u r trying to say. However I hope u see my point as well. Because there can be an almost infinite way to cheat tax, the law is set tat any method tat help u evade tax when u should be paying more is tax cheating. Lets answer the following question</p>
              <p>1) u give salary to the person who do nothing</p>
              <p>2) the salary can be more or less. It can be in the case, all the profit of the company or the less, a few hundred dollars</p>
              <p>3) The profit of the company subsequently reduced. His fictitious wages is subtracted from the profit of the company</p>
              <p>4) the tax to the gov reduce</p>
              <p>isn't tat tax evasion ? U can say u r not giving a high salary to the person. However the methodology is the same in a way it reduce the tax collected by the country. Lets say in point number 2, the salary is the whole profit of the company. Do u think tat will be legal ? Tat is creative accounting.</p>

              <p>I know your point. You are still thinking about the evading of tax, which wasn't even the main aim here. The main aim was to increase company profit by being able to hire workers at an overall cheaper average rate to do the same things, and we are discussing based on the point that foreign workers are cheaper to the employer than local workers.</p>

              <p>If the company is able to employ more foreign workers instead of local workers, the overall salary paid out is actually reduced than if a local worker with full pay doing the same job as the foreign workers is employed. The amount of tax paid would be higher.</p>

              <p>Believe me, there's a way to circumvent that quota (more of a ratio) easily. I have mentioned it before somewhere else in this forum. One method: employ someone else (maybe a housewife) by name, and pay that person CPF, but no salary. Then you can employ even more foreigners already, because on paper, you have employed another Singaporean. The amount paid to the CPF is much less than what a boss could have paid if he had really employed one more Singaporean.</p>

              <p>NPBT = $1,000,000</p>
              <p>Tax = ($200,000) - assuming at 20%</p>
              <p>Nett Profit = $800,000</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Company EAGLE, who employ 10 housewife to do nothing at $150,000 per head also make $1,000,000 profit before tax. However because of the 10 housewife he employed, he manage to inflat the cost of business by $1.4m (see below</p>
              <p>CPF contribution = 13% x 4500 x 12 months x 10 housewife = $70,020</p>
              <p>Inflated Cost = 150,000 x 10 - 70,020 = $1,429,980</p>
              <p>Actual NPBT = $1,000,000 </p>
              <p>Fake NPBT = $1,000,000 - $1,429,980 = - ($429,980)</p>
              <p>Tax = ZERO</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tax evasion = $200,000</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Net return to Eagle = $200,000 - 70020 = <span style="text-decoration: underline;">$129,980</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Yes, no one calls it tax invasion like you do. You are right.<br>You must have a special accounting method because you utilise tax invasion.</p>
              <p>Sorry, we don't. We talk about tax evasion, not tax invasion.</p>
              <p>Since your accounting methods are totally different from the rest of us, go back to your planet to talk and discuss among your peers the concept of tax invasion.</p>
              <p>So yup, you are right. I have ZERO knowledge in your accounting methods of tax invasion.</p>

I have sent 2 anonymous email enquiries to the two department and state your hypothesis to them. So lets see if they will response and we shall treat their answer as final. If u felt I will ask unfair questions, u r free to write letter to the respective department and wait for their reply as well.</p></div>
