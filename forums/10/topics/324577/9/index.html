              <p>So u r here just to hurl insults ? Wat is your comment on
                  the tax evasion case then ?</p>
              <p>Frankly speaking, wat is the difference between the word
                  "avoidance" and "evasion"</p>
              <p>avoidance: the act of avoiding or keeping away from</p>
              <p>evasion: an act or instance of escaping, avoiding, or shirking
                  something</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and eagle, wat is the difference in the meaning "do not do
                  anything" and "do nothing" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So since u think there is a big difference between the words,
                  please elaborate</p>

              <p>The difference is the standard of English used</p>

              <p>Eagle, sorry to burn your bridge and expose your nonsense in this forums.</p>
              <p>in this thread, you claim</p>
              <p>1) It is more cost effective for government to give out <span style="text-decoration: underline;">money</span> to people using age class instead of income class.  </p>
              <p>2) You claim that company can benefit from employing housewife to do nothing.</p>
              <p>3) You claim that company can pay employee only CPF contribution and not salary</p>
              <p>4) You claim that it is not illegal to evade tax by employing dummy employee to that does nothing.</p>
              <p>This is a public forum, so please dont tell me that this is a private discussion. If you dont want others to talk in your thread, please use PM instead.</p>
              <p><br>I have never seen a scholar who is as dumb as you. Did you left your commonsense in germany?</p>

              <p>You have got to understand that when you want to engage in a discussion with Eagle, you really have no choice but to use exact same words he used in the thread, or else due to his lack of substance, he will start diverting his attention to focus on the meaning of words use in the discussion.</p>
              <p>Jojo I believe due to your eagerness to show support to other same minded forumers here (as usual), you have forgotten that the quote "paying housewife CPF and no salary", actually comes from Eagle and not me...Hahaha...</p>

              <p>Believe me, there's a way to circumvent that quota (more of a ratio) easily. I have mentioned it before somewhere else in this forum. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">One method: employ someone else (maybe a housewife) by name, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pay that person CPF, but no salary</span></span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> Then you can employ even more foreigners already, because on paper, you have employed another Singaporean. The amount paid to the CPF is much less than what a boss could have paid if he had really employed one more Singaporean.</p>
