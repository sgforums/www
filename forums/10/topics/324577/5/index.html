              <p>In which my argument is that it is more cost effective to give every old folk, including the rich old folks who have had significant contributions to Singapore. You are the one who keep telling me it is already in place when I am telling you they shouldn't have it.</p>
              <p>This is a 100% assured safety net for the old folks, not some dubious means testing which also rewards rich old folks who likes to stay in 4rm HDBs.</p>

              <p>You are comparing to giving a large amount of money to parents whom you should already give, vs employing someone to do nothing. You have yet to raise any law to tell me it is illegal to employ someone to do nothing, and whom can "return" the salary to the boss.</p>

              <p>When I came into my engineering company (MNC), including me, there were 5 newcomers. 3 were Singaporeans, and 2 foreigners. The 3 Singaporeans were offered employments at least 1 to 2 years ago, and not the foreigner. In addition, it has been said that they are not hiring any newcomers (to NUS/NTU) at that time.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>But as a foreigner, and especially if you are working there, were you rude to them? Not to mention that they have their fair share of PRCs, and that they cannot distinguish between you and them. I admit there are nice people from PRC, but not 100% are. Next, PRCs are still considered a minority here, vs you being the minority there in Europe.</p>
              <p>It must have costed you a big bomb if you have been around Europe, having claimed you earned &lt;3k a month.</p>

              differentiated between whether u r the minority or not. Indian r
              the minority in singapore too. So chinese can be rude and indian

You are now telling me you support spending the extra money to sieve out the needy from the rich old folks instead of distributing this money to the old folks.

              <p>Eagle, there is a difference between being cost effective and simple minded. Unfortunately, your suggestion is both simple minded and NOT cost effective. It is a complete waste of tax payer money.</p>

              <p>As said, the money should be given to people who really need it, not all old folks. If u want to give to all citizens and ensure they can live by tis amount of money, then u have to expect all working to citizen to give a much larger tax. And I believe tis is geenrally not popular. Although old folks do contribute, they also get their own profit especially the rich one. Why should the poor citizen now get taxed more to support the rich folks ? The gov can use means testing for ALL citizen probably by using a computer program. U think it is difficult to find out the means for only old folks ?</p>

              <p>1) The definition of worker is to "work". He does not work. Isn't tat already bogus</p>
              <p>2) There is such a thing as minimum wages. And it I employ 100 bogus workers, I can claim my company make no profit and do not pay tax. Do u think the Gov (which opposition say tat squeeze everyody dry) will allow such a thing to happen ?</p>
              <p>Furthermore your method of cheating the gov is indeed a dishonest means to employ more foreign labourer.</p>
              <p>3) The NKF example shows tat giving money to people who do nothing is not an excuse. Do u think Durai can say "I give the contractor money to do nothing" and he will be declare "innocent". For your case, employing people who do nothing is also not an excuse. When u get caught, do u think saying "I employ people to do nothing" stands ?</p>

              <p>U mean the one getting no honors can get better job than the first class honours ? Then why people study hard to get first class ? Just face it, if u go to public sector, they already categorized the pay u get depending on the degree u received. Mindset can only help tat much. Only if u r a super pessimistic person then can a change of mindset help. Otherwise no matter how much u think u r the best and get lousy result, u cannot land a good job</p>

              <p>No, but giving a look is "vague" and shouldn't be classified as a good example of being rude. However u claimed earlier tat majority of the people in the country can be rude (like the french) and they can be rude to tourist which u reply earlier. Why do u think tis is acceptable</p>
