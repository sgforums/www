              <p>The data presented 1 year ago is teling the situation one year ago. The data for the last 30 years ? Where is it ? As said before, no one can really predict when will the business cycle comes and goes. It is even stated in the definition of the word. U felt the end will come at 2011 plus minus 6 months ?

              <p>And u r telling me it is bad english ?</p>
              <p>I don't think u have the right to comment since it is used by a lot of politicians and even senior officers in England and America. Why don't u write a letter and ridicule them of using bad english</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>So you telling me, if we call FireIce as fifi, and call Maurizio13 as M13, it's rude?</p>
              <p>They didn't give any consent at all.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Fifi and M13 is not derogative. If I say FireIce as Fierce or Maurizio13 as Mario, then it is rude</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Well, if a cashier, who is totally not close to me at all, is rude to me, and you can tell me she's isn't rude because it's just a look, then tell me now it's because of what I have described, then you are not making sense here.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>U r just trying to make the sentence structure look strange here. A cashier gives u a "look". It is not really the kind of rudeness people cannot tolerate or worth mentioning</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I believe I have already settled with you the French pple part. Also, I have already pointed out to you that this behaviour is not accepted too even if the cashier is Singaporean. Are you being as autistic as Gazelle to bring up answered questions and posts again?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It is not settled. U just don't reply to it. I keep asking why the strong emphasis on the question "if u r from a foreign country and working here, will I be rude" which u never answer. Since u never give me a satisfactory answer, why can't I bring it out again ? I thought the "look" from the cashier is already "stopped". How come u become autistic and bring up questions and posts again like Gazelle ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Just because I toned down my description of the act that has happened and you think that she's not rude?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Then perhaps something is wrong with your english and tat is why people think she is not rude. Maybe u will like to describe exactly how the "look" is like honestly</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Do you understand what is meant by 3rd party in our discussion?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>3rd party can mean anything here such as writing the letter to the MOM. Maybe u should reconsider phrasing the question properly and specifically mention wat 3rd party r u talking about.</p>

              <p>An article </p>
              <p><strong>People who do not do anything</strong> can be bad or good natured but do not really show it.  </p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">And as <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> cautioned, “The world is a dangerous place to live. Not because of the people who are evil, but because of those <strong>people who do not do anything</strong> about it.”</span></p>

              <p>Words from outgoing nigerian ambassador</p>
              <p>What I really dislike is the reaction of outside countries that are trying to get moral capital out of it. Twenty-five thousand Africans are dying every day from Aids. Thirty million Africans are infected with Aids. <strong>People who do not do anything</strong> about this - people who do not even help African students who can't pay their school fees - come and demonstrate to the embassy sending a million signatures to us and all that. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Even Albert Einstein had use the phrase "people who do not do anything". Wat rights do u have to comment on it ? U can use the phrase "people who do not do anything" on google and u can find tons of people using it. Even the outgoing ambassador to nigerian also uses tis phrase. Who r u to comment on their english ?</p>

              <p>They r made by the most intelligent person in the world and also by a senior officer in America. They r already a good gauge that there is nothing wrong with using the phrase "people who do not do anything".</p>
              <p>The problem is u felt a better substitute is "do nothing" which is actually replacing "who do not do anything". Your full statement is "people who did nothing". The "people who" is still repeated in your ideal statement. If u look at "do not do anything", even a report by United States Department of Agriculture has explicitly written tis in its report.</p>

              <p>I already answered u before. I am asking from a law point of perspective. The question has always been whether is it legal or illegal, and not whether can it be found out or not. Why don't u read back tis passage and comment on it first</p>
              <p><em>I already mentioned the important point is the underlying law on it. U can classify it as someone who bring in business by literaly doing nothing and claim all sort of things, but then if the case is taken the task is to convince the judge the case u wanted to state. If just claiming and trying to justify your action is already sufficient, then there is really no law tat can stop u from doing all the illegal things.</em></p>
              <p><em>U can state u recruit someone who do nothing, claim to bring in business and then get all the company profit and strangely remit them back to u eventually. U claim it is not wrong to recruit someone who do nothing.</em></p>
              <p><em>Then I can also state I have the right to walk around with a knife pointing outward and tis particular person who had grieviences with me just bumps into me and die in my hand. Is it wrong for me to carry a knife ?</em></p>
              <p><em>I can also claim i love to run around with hand outstretch and then touch all the women private part because I cannot control my running. Is it wrong to run with hands outstretched ?</em></p>
              <p><em>The way u ask is already more on whether can the case be found out, and not on whether is the whole deal illegal. Tat is why there is a need for a judge or a jury to cross off claims which is deemed to be excessive or illogical. Otherwise why do u think we need a judge ? Just claiming doesn't means it is right. It has to convince the judge in the end. The important thing about the enquiry is to know the baseline, tat is the part on whether is it legal or not. The ways to cover up etc is just redundant in the enquiry.</em></p>
              <p><em>Tat is why for the 2 scenario I have stated, the baseline question asked should be "is it illegal to kill someone" and "is it illegal to molest someone" and not "is it illegal to carry a knife, pointing it outward then tis guy bumps into me and die" or "is it illegal to run around with hand outstretched and then bumping into girls private part "</em></p>

              <p>Well u can always compare with Einstein since he is the one tat
                      stated the above statement which u claim is out of context.</p>
              <p>U wanna show me your "Dean's list" and first class honor
                      cert ? Dean list ? Big f$ck ya ? I am sorry man just because u
                      r in dean's list doesn't means u must be right.</p>

              <p>Well, you are the one who has implied to me when you question me "who I am to comment on Einstein's english" that because Einstein said so, it must be correct.</p>
              <p>Why are you consistently stepping on your own toes?</p>
              <p>If you can't take out any certs to prove anything, I will conclude, in your logic, that you did not properly portrayed in your letters what is being discussed here.</p>

              <p>You justified that your language must be correct because "They r made by the most intelligent person in the world". You took their intelligence level to compare with me, which I did not deny that he's indeed more intelligent.</p>
              <p>Yes, you include gov officials too, because they said it too.</p>
              <p>Now we are discussing whether you have properly portrayed the discussion to IRAS; only you and I are discussing. No gov officials are around to see the discussion. What they know is from what you have emailed them. Hence your word in bold doesn't hold.</p>

              <p>Then ? Wat is wrong with wat I had said ? It is true isn't it ? Did I say since he is the most intelligent fellow, he must always be right ?</p>

              <p>And wat is your problem with it ? Only on the phrase "do not do anything" to "do nothing" and tat make u able to conclude it does not protray the discussion ? The gov officials use the phrase "do nto do anything" and tat is the crux of the discussion. Why suddenly u talk in another tangent and say they r not around to see it ?</p>

              <p>Wat logic ? U r putting words into my mouth which i never claim. If u think qualification is everything, then LKY is always right since his qualification is almost unbeatable in his times.</p>
