Evidently, going out of the way through the relaxation of immigration legislation to woo foreigners doesn't make "perfect sense"...<br><br>If what you said made perfect sense, there shouldn't be any locals working as waiters, factory workers and other low-paying menial jobs in the developed world.</div>

Perhaps the disadvantages of economic protectionism (being e forced to stick with an inefficient and ineffective system, not opening oneself up to real competition and having no real motivation to improve) somehow do not transpose onto our political arena?<br><br>And also, one needs to wonder where exactly does the line cross from the moral obligation to provide the people who voted you in a decent and fair shot at staying in the fight to protectionism? Or can everything that even remotely resembles extending a proper helping hand to those who have no alternative be sacrificed on the altar of anti-protectionism?<br><br>Also are what many of the people suggesting here a call for protectionism? Or for the system to play fair for once and not keep thinking of the bottom line that seems oddly enough, to benefit only those at the top of the social ladder more then the masses at the bottom.<br><br>Indeed, what would happen if we decided to Â“globaliseÂ” our political system and daringly benchmark it against systems from all over the world. Would some people who keep using the buzzwords of Â“globalisationÂ” suddenly resort to a new buzzword called Â“extraordinaryÂ” and say that you canÂ’t compare?<br><br>Why just stop at economic globalisation?<br></div>
