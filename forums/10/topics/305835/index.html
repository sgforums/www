              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Expect to pay up to S$10.50 on a weekend to watch
              blockbusters such as Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince or The
              Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian.
              <br> <br>Prices for tickets at all Cathay cineplexes will go up on Thursday,
              adding to the rash of recent price increases including taxi fares,
              electronic road pricing and cooking gas.
              <br> <br>At a media conference on Tuesday, the cinema operator and film
              distributor said it was raising ticket prices for films by 50 cents or
              about 6 per cent due to "escalating prices in goods, services, labour,
              film rentals and the Goods and Services Tax".
              <br> <br> What's more, an additional 50 cents will be tagged on for blockbusters such as Harry Potter and Iron Man.
              <br> <br>"The rising costs we have seen over the recent years is something
              we cannot ignore," said Mr Suhaimi Rafdi, the chief executive of Cathay
              Organisation Holdings, which has four cineplexes here. <br> <br> The company had been "struggling to make ends meet" and had to jack up prices to "remain profitable".
              <br> <br> Without disclosing details, Mr Rafdi said that the company had made a
              loss in 2006 and was expecting a "small profit" for last year.
              <br> <br>Mr Rafdi said that Cathay would categorise a movie as a blockbuster
              only if it has an "A-list cast and/or director, a big production budget
              of more than US$100 million (S$142 million), is a part of a successful
              franchise (like Spider-Man, Batman and Shrek)" and open on the same day
              in Singapore as in the United States.
              <br> <br> Only around 20 out of the hundreds of films released here would qualify as a blockbuster this year, he said. 
              <br> <br> So, with Cathay raising its ticket prices, will other cinemas follow suit?
              <br> <br>"It's yet to be seen. They would probably want to see if there are
              any repercussions because this is a bold move on our part," said Mr
              Rafdi.
              <br> <br>When contacted by TODAY, Shaw Organisation, which operates seven
              cineplexes here, said it would not be following Cathay's lead. "There
              has been some increase in our cinema operation costs. However, Shaw has
              no plan to raise its movie ticket prices at this point," Shaw's
              executive vice-president Mark Shaw told TODAY.
              <br> <br>The other major operator, Golden Village, did not respond to
              TODAY's queries by press time. Moviegoers TODAY spoke to were mixed on
              the ticket price hike.
              <br> <br>"It wouldn't affect the number of movies I watch. Fifty cents is
              not that much to me," said editor Audrey Wong, 32, who goes to the
              cinema at least four times a month. "It's still relatively cheaper than
              going to cinema in Europe or the US."
              <br> <br>Marketing manager Irwin Tham, 28, said the hike would not deter him
              from watching new releases. "watching a movie at the cinema is
              different from watching it on DVD."
              <br> <br>But film student Annette Heitmann, 21, said current ticket prices
              were already expensive and student movie rates did not soften the blow.
              <br> <br> "It's useless because the rates apply during the day, when students have classes.
              <br> <br>The price hike will affect students' decisions to visit the cinema
              as we have other alternatives", such as watching the latest movies on
              the Internet. - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a><span>/il </span></p>
