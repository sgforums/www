              <p>Just read in the paper that the CK Tang boss has just hopped in and out of jail for trying to buy a kidney ...</p>
              <p>personally, i think both the sellers and this buyer were victims of their circumstances ...</p>
              <p>one side was trying to make better lives for themselves, to dig their way out of poverty ... the other was just fighting to live ......</p>
              <p>so if organ trading is a crime, and the middle man who brought the two sides together has been punished too, what about the doctor in question ? ....</p>
              <p>I find his defense of being just the unknowing party a bit weak ... from the straits times feature a little while back, it appears that it's not the first time he's performed such an operation ? ... does he have a duty and responsibility to find out if the ops he's performing contravenes the law or not ? ....</p>
              <p>or the medical establishment protects their own ? ...</p>

              <p>I guess doctors still is a noble job. They still do save lives. I guess they dun feel good seeing people die under their hands too. But there are some who get indifferent and they take it as a job. As for me, it is hard for me to criticise doctors. I have a very good doctor now taking care of my diabetic condition but I guess it will take a long time for me to be able to step into that hospital again or even consider to go for any major surgery.</p>

              <p>I do find that it is wrong to purchase an organ from the black market where you do not have any idea where it came from but if you are actually purchasing from the person him or herself... why would it consitute as a criminal offence in logical sense?</p>

              <p>it's the middlemen, the doctors, who skimmed off both sides, and the ethics committee that did nothing all this while ... that are the diabolical ones ... can the doctors hide behind the statutory declarations that appeared to be so blatantly false, and absolves themselves of all responsibilities  that way ? ....

              <p>if you know how to read at all ... i did mention that transplants requires approval from an ethics committee .... so the ethics commitee would simply take the declarations of a chinese tycoon in singapore and an indonesian peasant farmer that they are relatives by blood or marriage and just rubber stamp things ? ... a doctor is not a vehicle mechanic, they are professionals who are required to uphold a higher set of ethics and standards .... in any case, the mechanic example is quite frankly, stupid, for you to compare buying a car, taking it to the mechanics, and to try and blame the mechanics after finding out it's stolen is like blaming the doctor who delivers your wife's baby after finding out that you're not the child's father .... a child would know to go and blame the fellow whom you've brought it from, no ? ..... but then again ....since it came from you, a fellow who blames the goverment for falling tree trunks and pricey ipods ... no wonder  you'd go barking up the wrong tree ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
