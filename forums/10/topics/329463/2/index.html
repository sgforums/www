              <p>if you know how to read at all ... i did mention that transplants requires approval from an ethics committee .... so the ethics commitee would simply take the declarations of a chinese tycoon in singapore and an indonesian peasant farmer that they are relatives by blood or marriage and just rubber stamp things ? ... a doctor is not a vehicle mechanic, they are professionals who are required to uphold a higher set of ethics and standards .... in any case, the mechanic example is quite frankly, stupid, for you to compare buying a car, taking it to the mechanics, and to try and blame the mechanics after finding out it's stolen is like blaming the doctor who delivers your wife's baby after finding out that you're not the child's father .... a child would know to go and blame the fellow whom you've brought it from, no ? ..... but then again ....since it came from you, a fellow who blames the goverment for falling tree trunks and pricey ipods ... no wonder  you'd go barking up the wrong tree ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><strong>else you end up looking like CSJ
              yelling at GCK. .... </strong><strong> </strong></p>
              <p>wow ... do I see a tiger changing his stripes ? .... from someone who blames the goverment for all sorts of nonsensical things before ? ... who's been precisely doing the same thing over falling tree trunks and what not ? ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>okie ... this is very simple, really .... listen carefully now ...</p>
              <p>like I said previously, the only thing that saved the asses of the doc, and the ethics committee ... are the declarations made by the buyer and the seller ...</p>
              <p>but, as we have seen, organ trading DID take place, that's why all these court cases, no ? ....</p>
              <p>now, we have someone found guilty of organ trading, and we have seen that there appears to be a veritable organ trading industry centered around singapore doctors in our neighbouring country .... obviously, the ethics committee has failed to catch all of these, regardless of whether the committee or the doctor was hoodwinked, or not ... and THAT, is what we should be looking into ....</p>
              <p>a doctor is no mere technician, a doctor deals in human lives, by your logic, or rather, in your little universe, a doctor need not care who he's removing the organs from, so long as his ass is covered by that little piece of legal print and signatures that covers his ass from legal reprecussions, in this case, the donor was paid ... but  HOTA and  the ban on  organ transplant was designed precisely to prevent  exploitation of  the poor and underprivileged,  you read of those cases in india and bangladesh were people are kidnapped and drugged and wake up with a "U" shaped scar down one side of their torsos ? ... what if the donor was being blackmailed into donating his kidney, what if the donor was forced to donate under duress ? ... what if he was tricked ? .... but of course, in marizio's world, it doesn't matter ... the doctor's got his ass covered with the declaration, the ethics committee got his ass covered with the declaration, so fark the donors, who cares, they can't be blamed ....</p>
              <p>in that case, I think the docs, and the people on the ethics committee, have not only failed in their profession, they have also failed as human beings in my books.</p>

              <p> </p>

              <p>Maybe the doctor was wrong in not employing a private investigator to check on his patients.</p>
              <p>Maybe the patient told the surgeon that he was illegally buying organs from a third world country. But if no such evidence exist, I don't see why anybody should based his accusation on hypotheticals, then persist in concluding that the doctor is just as guilty.</p>
              <p>Like I said, if you bought a car from a thief, bring it for servicing by a mechanic. If it was later found out the car was stolen. How can the mechanic be guilty of the crime? The mechanic was not privy to the illegal contract made between you and the thief, he was merely doing his job in servicing the car.</p>
              <p>You are delusional to think that the ethics committee if they persist in questioning the doctor, they will miraculously find evidence to incriminate him. The doctor will self incriminate himself.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>"back to the same advice for you boy ... don't blame your surroundings for your circumstances, including the goverment, you try to blame them for expensive ipods today, you'd blame them for rain tomorrow, or you not being able to find a girlfriend a few years down the line ? ... trying to prove the link won't make you any more cleverer, not with google and wiki around, but it does reflects a lot on your attitude towards life ....</p>
              <p>you want something, a better life for yourself, you work for it, don't ack too much about how the grass is greener on the other side and how your path could have been paved better for you ...."</p>

              <p>that's what i meant by barking up the wrong tree ....</p>
              <p>it's not the same as you, illegally buying an organ, and asking a doc to transplant it for you ... it's a bit subtle for you maybe ... but if you think hard, and slowly ... maybe you may even understand it .. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>i enjoy seeing your shooting yourself in the foot ...</p>
              <p>go on ... slap yourself somemore ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>So the final question here is still.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do you have evidence that the doctor knows the organ was illegally obtained?</span></strong></p>
              <p>It he doesn't know it is still the same situation as the car mechanic servicing a car brought in by customer. If the mechanic knows it was a stolen car, it could be criminal conspiracy or abetment.</p>
              <p>Using illegitimate child as an example is poor understanding of issues. An illegitimate child is not a criminal offence punishable under Singapore laws, stealing a car is a criminal offence. So, don't mix up the two issues in your puny head.</p>

              <p>Maybe you should be on the chair of the transplant ethics
              committee. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please quote.</p>
              <p>What is it that I said that made me immoral and unethical?</p>
              <p>You building all your case on conjectures?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe the doctor was wrong in not employing a private
              investigator to check on his patients.</p>
              <p>Maybe the patient told the surgeon that he was illegally buying
              organs from a third world country. But if no such evidence exist, I
              don't see why anybody should based his accusation on hypotheticals,
              then persist in concluding that the doctor is just as guilty.</p>
              <p>Like I said, if you bought a car from a thief, bring it for
              servicing by a mechanic. If it was later found out the car was
              stolen. How can the mechanic be guilty of the crime? The mechanic
              was not privy to the illegal contract made between you and the
              thief, he was merely doing his job in servicing the car.</p>
              <p>You are delusional to think that the ethics committee if they
              persist in questioning the doctor, they will miraculously find
              evidence to incriminate him. The doctor will self incriminate
              himself.</p>
