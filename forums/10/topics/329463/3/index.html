              <p><br> Babe,</p>
              <p>I asked you so many a times already. I am getting tired
                  repeating myself over and over again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Do you have evidence to
                  proof that the doctor has knowledge that it was

              <p>Or you suggesting that we hang all criminals based on
                  circumstantial evidence and guesses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>as I have repeated so many times .... if there is evidence ... the doctors would be driving cabs by now .....</p>
              <p>you still don't get it do you ? ... or you prefer not to read the more troubling parts for you  .... perhaps your skull's rather thick .. so route learning's the way to go for you ...</p>
              <p>here you go ... chew on it, slowly ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">the basis of law is the moral and ethical values of a society
                                          ... it is designed to preserve and protect these values in a
                                          society ... in this case, organ trading is banned to prevent
                                          exploitation of the poor, and the underprivileged for their organs
                                          (perhaps it's something you, a self-professed wealthy boy, would
                                          have trouble understanding ? ) ....</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">like the scenario I listed out to you ... what if the "donor"
                                          was forced to donate under duress ? ... what if he was blackmailed
                                          to donate ? ... what if he's selling his organs for a pittance
                                          while the doc and the middlemen reaps the big bucks from the buyer
                                          ? ... the ethics committee was set up to make sure that this organ
                                          trading ban was not flouted ..... and, as we have seen, it has been
                                          repeatedly flouted till these recent cases blew everything out into
                                          the open ....</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">so what has the ethics committee been doing  ? ...
                                          obviously, they have been failing in their jobs, no ? ...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">now the doctor next ... I cannot help if you cannot see the
                                          stupidity of your mechanic analogy ... so I shall reproduce
                                          wholesale what I've written previously ... hopefully, you do better
                                          with route learning</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">your analogy fails, but you still
                                          haven't come round to understanding it yet ...</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">you illegally buys an organ, asks
                                          a doc to transplant it for you, that makes the doc breech medical
                                          ethics ....</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">you stupidly buys a stolen car,
                                          take it to the mechanic for servicing afterwards, found out about
                                          it afterwards, you don't farking blame the mechanic, you blame the
                                          person who sold it to you, savvy ? ....</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">i shall use the same doctor
                                          example again ... if you get a doctor to deliver your wife's baby,
                                          and then afterwards discover that the baby is not yours, you don't
                                          blame the doctor, you blame the man who slept with your wifey
                                          behind your back, yah ....</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">that's what i meant by barking up
                                          the wrong tree ....</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">I feel sad for you if you can't see the difference ... <span style="color: #ff0000;">but
                                          anyhow ... to paraphrase gasband ... sure, the doc's got a piece of
                                          legal black and white declaring that the "donor" and the "buyer"
                                          are related, even if one man's a yellow skinned rich singaporean
                                          chinese and the other's a brown skinned indonesian peasant with a
                                          name like sulaiman .... his ass is covered .....</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">of course, you're right in that the doctor need not go out of
                                          the way to make sure everything is ship shaped .... but look at the
                                          description above ... can the doctor plead innocence in such
                                          circumstances ? ....</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">touch your head and tell me, if it's wilfully turning a blind
                                          eye to a blatant breech of the law or not ? ...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">of course ... legally, the doc's done nothing wrong ....</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">and you're not wrong, per se, to say that the doc's, and the
                                          ethics committee, have done nothing illegal .... </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">but, here's where i question your values and ethics .... for it
                                          appears to me, that the only standard of proof, to you, is that
                                          little piece of legal black and white signed by the buyer and
                                          seller that they are related, nothing else is required
                                          .... </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">do you not care that some poor, wretched third world peasant may
                                          be exploited by the middle men, with the connivance of certain
                                          doctors, and the medical ethics committee that's supposed to catch
                                          all of this has been failing all this while till these recent cases
                                          blew wide open ? ....</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">so to you, nothing is wrong, nothing needs fixing ... because
                                          everything is "alright", "legally" .... aren't you not twisting the
                                          words of the law and hiding behind it for your convenience then ?
                                          ....</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">perhaps it's not a troubling thought to you, and it does not
                                          offend your personal sense of right and wrong, morals, propriety
                                          ... because, like you said before ... you are well off enough not
                                          to work for several life times ? ....</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">I find it amazing that you can think nothing needs to be done,
                                          nothing needs to be looked into, and that a legal document would
                                          absolve any parties of any connivance against the law ... either
                                          you're trying to argue B just because I said A, or your
                                          personal  set of values need some serious examining ...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"> <span style="color: #000000;">you are hiding behind the words of the law because your personal set of morals and ethics have failed .... </span></span></p>
              <p>I shall say it yet again ... i find it amazing that you think then only burden of proof the doctor and the ethcis committee need is a signed piece of declaration saying that the two parties are related ... and that all this while, the committee has allowed such cases to go through till this case blew open ....</p>
              <p>so yet again ... <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>do you not think that anything needs fixing, despite the fact that organ trading has been tacitly going on all these while, and that the ethics committee has failed in it's job ? .... </strong></span></p>
              <p>hiding behind the words of the law doesn't not absolve you of the responsibility of thinking for yourself, and applying ethcs and right and wrong ....</p>
              <p>to me, I think you fail at both ...</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Ask yourself, its a damn fair trade. The rich giving the poor money to extend his lifespan on earth. And the poor can use the money to solve his problems. The doctor is just a human butcher who accepted the money.</p>

              <p>the basis of law is the moral and ethical values of a society ... it is designed to preserve and protect these values in a society ... in this case, organ trading is banned to prevent exploitation of the poor, and the underprivileged for their organs (perhaps it's something you, a self-professed wealthy boy, would have trouble understanding ? ) ....</p>
              <p>like the scenario I listed out to you ... what if the "donor" was forced to donate under duress ? ... what if he was blackmailed to donate ? ... what if he's selling his organs for a pittance while the doc and the middlemen reaps the big bucks from the buyer ? ... the ethics committee was set up to make sure that this organ trading ban was not flouted ..... and, as we have seen, it has been repeatedly flouted till these recent cases blew everything out into the open ....</p>
              <p>so what has the ethics committee been doing  ? ... obviously, they have been failing in their jobs, no ? ...</p>
              <p>now the doctor next ... I cannot help if you cannot see the stupidity of your mechanic analogy ... so I shall reproduce wholesale what I've written previously ... hopefully, you do better with route learning</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">your analogy fails, but you still haven't come round to understanding it yet ...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">you illegally buys an organ, asks a doc to transplant it for you, that makes the doc breech medical ethics ....</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">you stupidly buys a stolen car, take it to the mechanic for servicing afterwards, found out about it afterwards, you don't farking blame the mechanic, you blame the person who sold it to you, savvy ? ....</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">i shall use the same doctor example again ... if you get a doctor to deliver your wife's baby, and then afterwards discover that the baby is not yours, you don't blame the doctor, you blame the man who slept with your wifey behind your back, yah ....</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">that's what i meant by barking up the wrong tree ....</span></p>
              <p>I feel sad for you if you can't see the difference ... but anyhow ... to paraphrase gasband ... sure, the doc's got a piece of legal black and white declaring that the "donor" and the "buyer" are related, even if one man's a yellow skinned rich singaporean chinese and the other's a brown skinned indonesian peasant with a name like sulaiman .... his ass is covered .....</p>
              <p>of course, you're right in that the doctor need not go out of the way to make sure everything is ship shaped .... but look at the description above ... can the doctor plead innocence in such circumstances ? ....</p>
              <p>touch your head and tell me, if it's wilfully turning a blind eye to a blatant breech of the law or not ? ...</p>
              <p>of course ... legally, the doc's done nothing wrong ....</p>
              <p>and you're not wrong, per se, to say that the doc's, and the ethics committee, have done anything illegal .... </p>
              <p>but, here's where i question your values and ethics .... for it appears to me, that the only standard of proof, to you, is that little piece of legal black and white signed by the buyer and seller that they are related, nothing else is required .... </p>
              <p>do you not care that some poor, wretched third world peasant may be exploited by the middle men, with the connivance of certain doctors, and the medical ethics committee that's supposed to catch all of this has been failing all this while till these recent cases blew wide open ? ....</p>
              <p>so to you, nothing is wrong, nothing needs fixing ... because everything is "alright", "legally" .... aren't you not twisting the words of the law and hiding behind it for your convenience then ? ....</p>
              <p>perhaps it's not a troubling thought to you, and it does not offend your personal sense of right and wrong, morals, propriety ... because, like you said before ... you are well off enough not to work for several life times ? ....</p>
              <p>I find it amazing that you can think nothing needs to be done, nothing needs to be looked into, and that a legal document would absolve any parties of any connivance against the law ... either you're trying to argue B just because I said A, or your personal  set of values need some serious examining ...</p>

              <p>So.....right now you are indirectly blaming the government for the failure in the transplant ethics committee. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>I thought there were laws against blackmail and criminal intimidation already. What ifs.....what ifs......If there was then they probably be prosecuted under those sections of the law.</p>
              <p>If the transplant ethics committee fails in their job, then who is to <strong>blame</strong>?</p>
              <p>With your replies about the doctor, you are "assuming" that the doctor has privilege information regarding the illegal act. Like I said before, do you have concrete proof? Or do we have to hang everybody that's accused of witchcraft?</p>
              <p>Like you said, the mechanic is not guilty because he has no knowlege and not privy to the contract between thief and buyer.</p>
              <p>Like I told you before, illegitimate child is not a criminal offence, you cannot prosecute your child's illegitimate father. Hence, where is HOTA and this illicit affair equivalent. A wrong choice of examples by you.</p>
              <p>You mean to say it's not possible that they are remote relatives? There is still a possibility that his great grand father could have migrated to Indonesia, married a native, have children, the offsprings married natives again and so on. In the past few decades, most Indonesian Chinese adopt Indonesian sounding names, because of the government stance against anything Chinese.</p>
              <p>Wake up and smell the roses, the world isn't perfect like you make it out to be. It's an imperfect world governed by imperfect beings with errors aplenty. Haven't the ruling elite done the same by enshroud themselves under legal auspices?</p>
              <p>Be it exploit or willing donor, this was transacted by willing parties. One willing to part with money, the other willing to sacrifice a kidney. Who are we to talk about morality when we employ Gurkhas who sell their lives to their master for paltry sums?</p>

              <p>What I see here is a poor man willing to part with his kidney, without which he could still live a fruitful and productive life. Another rich person giving up money so that he could make his life less of an incumbrance and maybe prolong it.</p>
              <p>Without the money from the rich person, the poor man's family could ill afford food and other luxuries. Which could also mean the death of his family members due to malnutrition.</p>
              <p>Without the transplant, the rich person could live a less productive life and maybe even a shortened one.</p>
              <p>Two person benefitted from this immoral transaction, as opposed to the eventuality that the rich person dies from kidney related issues or the poor person family's death from inability to provide basic necessities due to financial hardship, had this transaction not taken place. So on your moral high ground. Is it better to leave this two person on a sinking boat; or give them another boat so that two may survive?</p>

              <p>Oooo .... that was a stunning turn around ! ... suddenly you became a humanist ? ... nice googling btw ... you like to do it so often in your posts I think you're becoming pretty good at it ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>for someone who's been trying to hide behind the words of the law and legal nuances, now he's suddenly turned around and become a champion morals and the ethics of human life ?! ...</p>
              <p>you still don't see why I pointed out the failure of your analogies do you ? ...</p>
              <p>let's try it again</p>
              <p>you illegally purchase an organ from someone else, and ask the doc to transplant it for you, that makes the doc breech medical ethics, and makes him guilty of conniving in this offense, if he can be shown that he knows it before hand ....</p>
              <p>you stupidly buy a stolen car, take it to the mechanic for servicing afterwards, and found out it was stolen, you cannot blame the mechanic .... but you can only blame the person who sold it to you ... these two are not the same ...</p>
              <p>in a similar vein to your silly mechanic example, if you get a doctor to deliver your wife's baby, and then afterwards discover that you're not the baby's father, you don't blame the doctor, but you blame the man who slept with your wifey behind your back ...</p>
              <p>the stolen car example, and the delivery doctor example, are different from the situation of a doctor transplanting an illegally purchased organ .... so where did that illegitamate sons and what not come from ? ... people talk about chicken, there you are talking about dogs .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>of course, l know the world is not perfect ... it's the same thing I said to you when you insisted on blaming the goverment for falling tree trunks and expensive ipods .... but how far would an intelligent man, like a doctor, accept such a story at face value, before it triggers an alarm bell in his head ? .....</p>
              <p>true, some ancestors might have migrated generations ago and married a native blah blah blah .... I suppose if we go back up the ancestor tree far enough that makes every person on the planet related, no ? ... after all, we either came from the same group of apes or adam and eve, depending on your inclinations, no ? ....</p>
              <p>so what thoughts would be going through the minds of the ethics committee when a rich chinese tycoon comes along with a poor indonesian native peasant, declare that they are related by that tenous stretch of a story you described above ? ... what constitutes reasonable doubt ? ... obviously, the standards they applied were not stringent enough, for many cases have slipped through until this case blew everything out into the open, no ? ...</p>
              <p>so really, the issue is really about how this could have been allowed to happen for so long, you may attempt to steer this towards the ethical and moral stand that you have been trying so hard to shy away from all this while .... but it still won't help your case.</p>
              <p>Organ trading is banned, because there is no way to ensure that the poor and the underprivileged are not exploited, to the detriment of their health and wealth .... if a society wants to legalize organ trading, fine, then we'd have to think of a fair and equitable system to ensure that the seller gets what he deserves, not scammed off by middle men and unscruplous doctors .... and that he's accorded the same level of medical care as the receipient ... none of that is in place, that's why organ trading is banned.</p>
              <p>I shall not even go too deeply into the even more sticky moral and ethical debate of how fair a system that so blatantly benefits the rich be .... I do have egalitarian inclinations, and at first glance, such a system offends my sensibilities ...</p>
              <p>I dunno about you though, the self-professed rich kid ... but, allow me to quote you again ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong> æœ‰é’±èƒ½ä½¿é¬¼æŽ¨å¢¨</strong></span></p>
              <p>perhaps this statement from you, illuminates something about your values ? ...  and perhaps why  you'd  be so willing to think that there's nothing wrong with what has happened ? ...</p>
              <p>so now that we have established why organ trading is currently banned ... back to the orignal point of this whole thing ... has something gone wrong ? ... obviously, doctors has performed transplants on patients who were really organ sellers, not donors, obviously, the medical ethics committee has failed in it's job for all this while by not picking this up ....</p>
              <p>for someone who was strenously trying to hide behind the law just now ... you are still avoiding the question ... do you not think that something has gone wrong ? ... or are you  just going to go back and try to hide behind your old defense that everything is "legal" and "above board" ... because of the black and white ? ...</p>

              <p>Oooo .... that was a stunning turn around ! ... suddenly you became a humanist ? ... nice googling btw ... you like to do it so often in your posts I think you're becoming pretty good at it ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>for someone who's been trying to hide behind the words of the law and legal nuances, now he's suddenly turned around and become a champion morals and the ethics of human life ?! ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I thought you were the one brandishing the immorality of transplant?</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>
              <p>you still don't see why I pointed out the failure of your analogies do you ? ...</p>
              <p>let's try it again</p>
              <p>you illegally purchase an organ from someone else, and ask the doc to transplant it for you, that makes the doc breech medical ethics, and makes him guilty of conniving in this offense, if he can be shown that he knows it before hand ....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Like I said before again and again and again, which you still fail to understand with your limited comprehension ability. Does the doctor konw that it was an illegal transaction? You made assumptions that the doctor knew, then crucified him.</span></p>
              <p>you stupidly buy a stolen car, take it to the mechanic for servicing afterwards, and found out it was stolen, you cannot blame the mechanic .... but you can only blame the person who sold it to you ... these two are not the same ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How is it different? Both are criminal acts in the eyes of the law.</span></p>
              <p>in a similar vein to your silly mechanic example, if you get a doctor to deliver your wife's baby, and then afterwards discover that you're not the baby's father, you don't blame the doctor, but you blame the man who slept with your wifey behind your back ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So a stolen car is not a criminal act like the illegal organ transplant? But your wife sleeping with her ex-lover conceiving a bastard for you is a crime? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Under which Act of Singapore law is this section found in?</span></p>
              <p>the stolen car example, and the delivery doctor example, are different from the situation of a doctor transplanting an illegally purchased organ .... so where did that illegitamate sons and what not come from ? ... people talk about chicken, there you are talking about dogs .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I think you really have problems comprehending, despite my copious explanation. Doctor transplanting illegal organs is governed under Human Organ Transplant Act. Theft of car is governed under Penal Code. So where does your bastard child come in?</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>
              <p>of course, l know the world is not perfect ... it's the same thing I said to you when you insisted on blaming the goverment for falling tree trunks and expensive ipods .... but how far would an intelligent man, like a doctor, accept such a story at face value, before it triggers an alarm bell in his head ? .....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>"Trees falling on trees" and now "falling tree trunks"!! </strong>Good one!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> You do understand the meaning of tree trunks, don't you. So falling tree branches is not related to NParks and cost of ipods not related to exchange rate differential which cause Apple to price their products differently. So why are you blaming the transplant ethics committee? </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>true, some ancestors might have migrated generations ago and married a native blah blah blah .... I suppose if we go back up the ancestor tree far enough that makes every person on the planet related, no ? ... after all, we either came from the same group of apes or adam and eve, depending on your inclinations, no ? ....</p>
              <p>so what thoughts would be going through the minds of the ethics committee when a rich chinese tycoon comes along with a poor indonesian native peasant, declare that they are related by that tenous stretch of a story you described above ? ... what constitutes reasonable doubt ? ... obviously, the standards they applied were not stringent enough, for many cases have slipped through until this case blew everything out into the open, no ? ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I don't know what are the processes involved with the ethics committee, so I can't comment on their procedures. If you are moral like you said you are, perhaps you could offer your services on the board. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></span></p>
              <p>so really, the issue is really about how this could have been allowed to happen for so long, you may attempt to steer this towards the ethical and moral stand that you have been trying so hard to shy away from all this while .... but it still won't help your case.</p>
              <p>Organ trading is banned, because there is no way to ensure that the poor and the underprivileged are not exploited, to the detriment of their health and wealth .... if a society wants to legalize organ trading, fine, then we'd have to think of a fair and equitable system to ensure that the seller gets what he deserves, not scammed off by middle men and unscruplous doctors .... and that he's accorded the same level of medical care as the receipient ... none of that is in place, that's why organ trading is banned.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is your definition of exploited? Rich man pays money to the poor who can't afford basic necessities for his kidney. Does this constitute exploitation?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You have not provided me a reply for the analogy I provided.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Be it exploit or willing donor, this was transacted by willing parties. One willing to part with money, the other willing to sacrifice a kidney. Who are we to talk about morality when we employ Gurkhas who sell their lives to their master for paltry sums?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What I see here is a poor man willing to part with his kidney, without which he could still live a fruitful and productive life. Another rich person giving up money so that he could make his life less of an incumbrance and maybe prolong it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Without the money from the rich person, the poor man's family could ill afford food and other luxuries. Which could also mean the death of his family members due to malnutrition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Without the transplant, the rich person could live a less productive life and maybe even a shortened one.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Two person benefitted from this immoral transaction, as opposed to the eventuality that the rich person dies from kidney related issues or the poor person family's death from inability to provide basic necessities due to financial hardship, had this transaction not taken place. So on your moral high ground. Is it better to leave this two person on a sinking boat; or give them another boat so that two may survive?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Reflecting on the above quote, I'd rather be immoral that two persons survive, than be moral so that two persons die.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Other than your comprehension problems, you seem to have problems understanding the meaning of question marks also.</span></strong></p>
              <p>I shall not even go too deeply into the even more sticky moral and ethical debate of how fair a system that so blatantly benefits the rich be .... I do have egalitarian inclinations, and at first glance, such a system offends my sensibilities ...</p>
              <p>I dunno about you though, the self-professed rich kid ... but, allow me to quote you again ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Maybe I am just better at handling my finances than you.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Interesting comprehension issues with you, also regarding this sentence. Chunseah said "Wow, now i see the real power of money. Money dont just make to world go round...it even do more...", so I merely replied "<span style="color: #0000ff;">æœ‰é’±èƒ½ä½¿é¬¼æŽ¨å¢¨". Your comprehension issues seemed to have mistaken that statement as a stamp of approval from me. Did I in anyway state my stance on it from those quotes? It's a common quote babe. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></span></span>
              </p><p>perhaps this statement from you, illuminates something about your values ? ...  and perhaps why  you'd  be so willing to think that there's nothing wrong with what has happened ? ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Two lives were made better from this immoral transaction. One being able to afford necessities for his family, the other granted an extension of his life. It's a positive sum game between two willing parties.</span></p>
              <p>so now that we have established why organ trading is currently banned ... back to the orignal point of this whole thing ... has something gone wrong ? ... obviously, doctors has performed transplants on patients who were really organ sellers, not donors, obviously, the medical ethics committee has failed in it's job for all this while by not picking this up ....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you implying the government's at fault again? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> What an irony!!!!</span></p>
              <p>for someone who was strenously trying to hide behind the law just now ... you are still avoiding the question ... do you not think that something has gone wrong ? ... or are you  just going to go back and try to hide behind your old defense that everything is "legal" and "above board" ... because of the black and white ? ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Didn't I already enunciated to you, but you failed to comprehend as usual. It is illegal if the doctor is privy to the illegal transaction. Didn't I also tell you that one has to based his accusations on solid evidence and not conjectures. So like I asked you a many times. Do you have proof that the doctor has knowledge of this illegality? If he has, then he is guilty of criminal conspiracy. If he has no knowledge, then it's equivalent to the mechanic reparing a stolen car thinking that it belongs to the person who brought it in.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Seriously, something is screwed when you can convict somebody based on conjectures. Perhaps a main ingredient in your perfect Utopian society.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Try not to squirm your way out of this by avoiding my replies. Paragraph by paragraph reply would do fine. Thank you. </span></p>

              <p>You have to ask why alarm bells did not ring in the commitee members' heads when they saw these 2 unrelated patients presented before them (and they're not even dating unlike Ms De Cruz's case several years ago), unless they weren't given enough information to prevent this in the first place. Otherwise it should look suspect to them.</p>
              <p>As for organ trading in general, it might mutually benefit the 2 parties involved, but look at the bigger picture...why should the poor be disadvantaged by his financial status if they need an organ, when we all have the right to life?</p>

              often in your posts I think you're becoming pretty good at it ...
              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>for someone who's been trying to hide behind the words of the
              law and legal nuances, now he's suddenly turned around and become a
              champion morals and the ethics of human life ?! ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I
              thought you were the one brandishing the immorality of
              transplant?</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>
              <p>you still don't see why I pointed out the failure of your
              analogies do you ? ...</p>
              <p>let's try it again</p>
              <p>you illegally purchase an organ from someone else, and ask the
              doc to transplant it for you, that makes the doc breech medical
              ethics, and makes him guilty of conniving in this offense, if he
              can be shown that he knows it before hand ....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Like I said before again and again
              and again, which you still fail to understand with your limited
              comprehension ability. Does the doctor konw that it
              was an illegal transaction? You made assumptions
              that the doctor knew, then crucified him.</span></p>
              <p>you stupidly buy a stolen car, take it to the mechanic for
              servicing afterwards, and found out it was stolen, you cannot blame
              the mechanic .... but you can only blame the person who sold it to
              you ... these two are not the same ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How is it different? Both are
              criminal acts in the eyes of the law.</span></p>
              <p>in a similar vein to your silly mechanic example, if you get a
              doctor to deliver your wife's baby, and then afterwards discover
              that you're not the baby's father, you don't blame the doctor, but
              you blame the man who slept with your wifey behind your back
              ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So a stolen car is not a criminal
              act like the illegal organ transplant? But your wife sleeping with
              her ex-lover conceiving a bastard for you is a crime? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Under which Act of Singapore law is this
              section found in?</span></p>
              <p>the stolen car example, and the delivery doctor example, are
              different from the situation of a doctor transplanting an illegally
              purchased organ .... so where did that illegitamate sons and what
              not come from ? ... people talk about chicken, there you are
              talking about dogs .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I
              think you really have problems comprehending, despite my copious
              explanation. Doctor transplanting illegal organs is governed under
              Human Organ Transplant Act. Theft of car is governed under Penal
              Code. So where does your bastard child come in?</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>
              <p>of course, l know the world is not perfect ... it's the same
              thing I said to you when you insisted on blaming the goverment for
              falling tree trunks and expensive ipods .... but how far would an
              intelligent man, like a doctor, accept such a story at face value,
              before it triggers an alarm bell in his head ? .....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>"Trees falling on trees"
              and now "falling tree trunks"!! </strong>Good one!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> You do understand the meaning of tree
              trunks, don't you. So falling tree branches is not related to
              NParks and cost of ipods not related to exchange rate differential
              which cause Apple to price their products differently. So why are
              you blaming the transplant ethics committee?</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>true, some ancestors might have migrated generations ago and
              married a native blah blah blah .... I suppose if we go back up the
              ancestor tree far enough that makes every person on the planet
              related, no ? ... after all, we either came from the same group of
              apes or adam and eve, depending on your inclinations, no ? ....</p>
              <p>so what thoughts would be going through the minds of the ethics
              committee when a rich chinese tycoon comes along with a poor
              indonesian native peasant, declare that they are related by that
              tenous stretch of a story you described above ? ... what
              constitutes reasonable doubt ? ... obviously, the standards they
              applied were not stringent enough, for many cases have slipped
              through until this case blew everything out into the open, no ?
              ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I don't know what are the
              processes involved with the ethics committee, so I can't comment on
              their procedures. If you are moral like you said you are, perhaps
              you could offer your services on the board. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></span></p>
              <p>so really, the issue is really about how this could have been
              allowed to happen for so long, you may attempt to steer this
              towards the ethical and moral stand that you have been trying so
              hard to shy away from all this while .... but it still won't help
              your case.</p>
              <p>Organ trading is banned, because there is no way to ensure that
              the poor and the underprivileged are not exploited, to the
              detriment of their health and wealth .... if a society wants to
              legalize organ trading, fine, then we'd have to think of a fair and
              equitable system to ensure that the seller gets what he deserves,
              not scammed off by middle men and unscruplous doctors .... and that
              he's accorded the same level of medical care as the receipient ...
              none of that is in place, that's why organ trading is banned.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is your definition of
              exploited? Rich man pays money to the poor who can't afford basic
              necessities for his kidney. Does this constitute
              exploitation?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You have not provided me a reply
              for the analogy I provided.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Be it exploit or willing donor,
              this was transacted by willing parties. One willing to part with
              money, the other willing to sacrifice a kidney. Who are we to talk
              about morality when we employ Gurkhas who sell their lives to their
              master for paltry sums?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What I see here is a poor man
              willing to part with his kidney, without which he could still live
              a fruitful and productive life. Another rich person giving up money
              so that he could make his life less of an incumbrance and maybe
              prolong it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Without the money from the rich
              person, the poor man's family could ill afford food and other
              luxuries. Which could also mean the death of his family members due
              to malnutrition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Without the transplant, the rich
              person could live a less productive life and maybe even a shortened
              one.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Two person benefitted from this
              immoral transaction, as opposed to the eventuality that the rich
              person dies from kidney related issues or the poor person family's
              death from inability to provide basic necessities due to financial
              hardship, had this transaction not taken place. So on your moral
              high ground. Is it better to leave this two person on a sinking
              boat; or give them another boat so that two may survive?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Reflecting on the above quote, I'd
              rather be immoral that two persons survive, than be moral so that
              two persons die.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Other than your
              comprehension problems, you seem to have problems
              understanding the meaning of question marks
              also.</span></strong></p>
              <p>I shall not even go too deeply into the even more sticky moral
              and ethical debate of how fair a system that so blatantly benefits
              the rich be .... I do have egalitarian inclinations, and at first
              glance, such a system offends my sensibilities ...</p>
              <p>I dunno about you though, the self-professed rich kid ... but,
              allow me to quote you again ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Maybe I am just better at handling
              my finances than you.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Interesting comprehension issues
              with you, also regarding this sentence. Chunseah said "Wow, now i
              see the real power of money. Money dont just make to world go
              round...it even do more...", so I merely replied "<span style="color: #0000ff;">æœ‰é’±èƒ½ä½¿é¬¼æŽ¨å¢¨". Your comprehension issues seemed to
              have mistaken that statement as a stamp of approval from me.
              Did I in anyway state my stance on it from those quotes? It's a
              common quote babe. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></span></span></p>
              <p>perhaps this statement from you, illuminates something about
              your values ? ...  and perhaps why  you'd  be so
              willing to think that there's nothing wrong with what has happened
              ? ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Two lives were made better from
              this immoral transaction. One being able to afford necessities for
              his family, the other granted an extension of his life. It's a
              positive sum game between two willing parties.</span></p>
              <p>so now that we have established why organ trading is currently
              banned ... back to the orignal point of this whole thing ... has
              something gone wrong ? ... obviously, doctors has performed
              transplants on patients who were really organ sellers, not donors,
              obviously, the medical ethics committee has failed in it's job for
              all this while by not picking this up ....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you implying the government's
              at fault again? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> What an irony!!!!</span></p>
              <p>for someone who was strenously trying to hide behind the law
              just now ... you are still avoiding the question ... do you not
              think that something has gone wrong ? ... or are you  just
              going to go back and try to hide behind your old defense that
              everything is "legal" and "above board" ... because of the black
              and white ? ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Didn't I already enunciated to
              you, but you failed to comprehend as usual. It is illegal if the
              doctor is privy to the illegal transaction. Didn't I also tell you
              that one has to based his accusations on solid evidence and not
              conjectures. So like I asked you a many times. Do you have proof
              that the doctor has knowledge of this illegality? If he has, then
              he is guilty of criminal conspiracy. If he has no knowledge, then
              it's equivalent to the mechanic reparing a stolen car thinking that
              it belongs to the person who brought it in.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Seriously, something is screwed
              when you can convict somebody based on conjectures. Perhaps a
              main ingredient in your perfect Utopian society.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Try not to squirm your way out of
              this by avoiding my replies. Paragraph by paragraph reply would do
              fine. Thank you.</span></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The middleman involved in Singapore's first illegal kidney transplant case will be sentenced on September 5. <br><br>Even before the case is wrapped up, there are renewed calls for authorities here to do more to increase the number of living donors. <br><br>While it may be a closed chapter for Mr Tang Wee Sung, who was jailed and fined on Wednesday in Singapore's first kidney-for-sale case, it is still an open book when it comes to the debate on organ trading in Singapore. <br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Ministry of Health (MOH) has said that it will not rule out legalising organ trading. <br></span></strong><br>In the case of renal failure, some 600 people are on a waiting list with an average waiting time of nine years before they get a transplant. <br><br>It seems that the way forward is to encourage more living donors, but there are costs involved. <br><br>Ameerali Abdeali, president, Singapore Muslim Kidney Action Association, said: "You really need an altruistic person to say I want to donate my kidney to save a life. For this person, there is a cost to them. Even to do a test for compatibility, there is already a cost." <br><br>Ideas that authorities here may look at include having philanthropic, charitable or religious bodies funding the compensation for donors. But compensation does not have to involve money changing hands between donor and recipient. <br><br>Mr Ameerali said: "I think that Singapore’s society is not ready for organ trading and certainly not developing Singapore as an organ trading hub. That.. (is) not acceptable. But there can be certain scenarios where it can be comfortable. <br><br>"Take for example, one person is affluent and suffering from kidney failure and there's another man who can give him that kidney, but his mother is critically ill in hospital and needs expensive surgery. <br><br>"So on this basis on quid pro quo, where no money actually exchange hands, this person pays for the medical bills and surgery bills for his donor's mother. Personally, I'm comfortable with that and I don't think that amounts to organ trading." <br><br>Mr Ameerali added that with trading, there is usually a profit component. He said: "Where there are actual organ sales and the money is used by the donor (for reasons such as) starting a business, that kind of scenario is really clear-cut trading." <br><br>Responding to Channel NewsAsia, MOH said moving forward, its focus is to prevent end-stage kidney failure. <br><br>It added that the key is in prevention, maximising organ yield from cadaveric kidney transplants, promoting living-related transplants and public education on the Human Organ Transplant Act. <br><br>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan is expected to visit a village in the Philippines on the sidelines of a World Health Organisation meeting later this month. He plans to meet donors to find out what drove them to sell their organs and perhaps look at the compensation they received to understand their situation. - CNA/vm </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>It's a win-win situation for both donor and patient.</span></p>

              <p><br> I was typing out my reply, only managed to see your post
              thereafter.</p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Reverence for life
              affords me my fundamental principle of morality, namely that good
              consists in maintaining, assisting, and enhancing life, and that to
              destroy, to harm, or to hinder life is evil</em></span> <em>--</em> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Albert
              Schweitzer</em></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #000000;">What I see here is a poor
              man willing to part with his kidney, without which he could still
              live a fruitful and productive life. Another rich person giving up
              money so that he could make his life less of an incumbrance and
              maybe prolong it.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Without the money from the rich
              person, the poor man's family could ill afford food and other
              luxuries. Which could also mean the death of his family members due
              to malnutrition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Without the transplant, the rich
              person could live a less productive life and maybe even a shortened
              one.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Two person benefitted from this
              immoral transaction, as opposed to the eventuality that the rich
              person dies from kidney related issues or the poor person family's
              death from inability to provide basic necessities due to financial
              hardship, had this transaction not taken place. So on your moral
              high ground. Is it better to leave this two person on a sinking
              boat; or give them another boat so that two may survive?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Reflecting on the above quote, I'd
              rather be immoral that two persons survive, than be moral so that
              two persons die.</span></p>

              <p>it may be a bit difficult for your cognitive engine to grasp this ... but the issue of whether the doctor in question has contravened medical ethics, and whether the ethics committee has failed or not, are different issues from whether organ trading is right, or wrong ....</p>
              <p>I shall offer you another analogy, a really simple one for you ... read it slowly ...</p>
              <p>if a person is caught, or is suspected of drug trafficking, the question of the person's guilt is a different issue from whether trafficking drugs is an offense or not, from whether trafficking drugs is moral or amoral, or whether a capital sentence for drugs trafficking is appropriate ....</p>
              <p>telling the judge that just because there's a debate on whether drug mules should be sentence to death, and that the death penalty may potentially be repealed in the future, doesn't fly .... as shown by this very case, tang wee sung's lawyer cavender bull tried this very argument, that organ trading may be legalized in the future, and the judge disregarded it, rightly so .... </p>
              <p>if the school rules say no talking in class, and the teacher catches you at it, you don't come along and argue about whether talking in class is right or wrong, savvy ? ...</p>
              <p>unless you're marizio perhaps ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>in any case ... the roles and action of the ethics committee are now being questioned by the authorities, Khaw himself has said before that the ethics committee would be investigated a long time back, early last month .... only marizio perhaps, still thinks that no smoking gun exists ...</p>
