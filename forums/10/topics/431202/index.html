              <p>Really? Well....we've got to give WP some time to get the hang of things. We knew that when we voted them in.</p>
              <p>Btw....when you go to the one room flats, maybe even the three room flats in AMK GRC, one can almost always smell urine or some foul stench in the lifts. So the all the residents there must be real cheesed off that they gave PM a mandate. Hope they are not regretting it though.</p>

              <p>I want to point out DownTown Line at Bukit Panjang too. PAP said they line cannot curve so drastically from Cashew station to the middle of BP, so they must build it at the edge of town. Residents lan lan stuck with LRT.</p>
              <p>Yet Circle Line made a tighter loop from Bras Basah, Esplanade and Promenade even with many buildings in the way.</p>
              <p>I think they are more afraid nobody will take LRT and the system will grow cobwebs. Therefore must force in typical PAP style.</p>

              <p><br>This idiot is a papayan puppy. WP only take over the town council today. Anyway LTK already mention that current contractor with town council can  be renewed or change. Then I think he changes the lift maintenance contractor. I never regret and not going to regret for the next 5 years as I belong to 40% that vote against the papayan.</p>
              <p>I started to repent for my in laws and my grandparents when they voted for these kind of rubbish in parliment which is worse than a lift breakdown.</p>
              <p>"If the annual salary of the Minister of Information, Communication and Arts is only $500,000, it may pose some problems when he discuss policies with media CEOs who earn millions of dollars because they need not listen to the minister's ideas and proposals. Hence, a reasonable payout will help to maintain a bit of dignity," Dr Lim told <em>LianHe ZaoBao</em> in Chinese.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Land+Transport+Authority&amp;#38;fr=fp-today&amp;#38;cs=bz"><span style="color: #005790;">Land Transport Authority</span></a> (LTA) is looking for new ways to implement the electronic road pricing (ERP) system without the physical infrastructure marked by the existing iconic -- and controversial -- blue-and-white gantries dotting Singapore, but a proposed approach is raising concern among motorists.</p>

              <p>however, this is a dangerous game as people will find out in due time that all politicians are douchebags and should be treated with utmost contempt.. what more can i say about those who would try deceitful things to raise their political deities</p>

              <p>WP don't take over Aljunied on 7 May2011, but when they take over. They will take over only when everything is in order. The accounts and the inventories.</p>
              <p>The PAP has the responsibility to manage things until the hand over is completed.</p>
              <p>The lifts continously breakdown for the last three days means the PAP has relinqished their responsibility and chaboted early, leaving Aljunied without government during the interim.</p>
