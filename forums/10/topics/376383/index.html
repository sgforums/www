              <p>F1 Renault team Kelong to win in Singapore Race, should Singapore Pools Refund us the bets or change the result of its winner?</p>

              <p>The fallout from that incident hit Monday, when Formula One spared his former team severe punishment but indefinitely banned the disgraced official who called for the crash.</p>
              <p>Renault received a suspended ban; the team would be permanently disqualified from the sport if it breaks the FIA's rules within the next two years. Flavio Briatore, who quit as team principal last week, was banned indefinitely from F1 activities by the World Motor Sport Council. Engineering executive director Pat Symonds, who also left Renault last week, was banned for five years after expressing his "eternal regret and shame" that he participated in the conspiracy.</p>
              <p>"We gave them a suspended sentence because Renault demonstrated that the team had no responsibility and the company even less," FIA president Max Mosley said.</p>
              <p>Piquet, who received immunity from FIA, was ordered to crash at last year's Singapore Grand Prix to help teammate Fernando Alonso win.</p>
              <p>"I bitterly regret my actions to follow the orders I was given," Piquet said in a statement. "I wish every day that I had not done it. I don't know how far my explanation will go to making people understand because for many being a racing driver is an amazing privilege, as it was for me."</p>
              <p>The introduction of the safety car on the 13th lap after Piquet's crash helped Alonso win the race, as he had just made an early pit stop and could move up the field when the other cars had to refuel.</p>
              <p>Alonso, who attended the hearing in Paris, was cleared of any wrongdoing.</p>

              <p>I won't really call this a match or race fixing (even though that's what they called it in the news) since the crash was meant to give Alonso an advantage, but does not guarantee the result. What I can agree on is that conditions are specifically set such that Renault's team, which is likely not to win under normal circumstances are now given much greater advantage - whilst many other drivers who are probably more talented will lose much of their chances at winning because of the unfair practices of the winning team.</p>
              <p>The weird thing is, us Singaporeans, along with the rest of the world
              are so quick to cry foul when we find out about it, yet so many of us
              are still happily living our lives when our electoral committee does pretty much the same thing each election. Anti-protest laws, public order laws, re-drawing electoral boundaries causing massive walkover by making it difficult for people to even qualify (our version of the safety vehicle?)</p>
              <p>Some of you wondered why this is match fixing thing can be considered "political"... see the resemblance yet?</p>
