              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">"If I have to shoot 200,000 students to save China from another 100 years of disorder, so be it." - Lee Kuan Yew endorsing the Tiananmen massacre, Straits Times, 17 August 2004<br><br>"If you are a troublemaker... it's our job to politically destroy you. Put it this way. As long as <strong><a href="http://mindbloggingstuff.blogspot.com/2006/12/chronology-of-authoritarian-rule-in.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">JB Jeyaratnam</span></span></a></strong> for what he stands for - a thoroughly destructive force - we will knock him. Everybody knows that in my bag I have a hatchet, and a very sharp one. You take me on, I take my hatchet, we meet in the cul-de-sac." - Lee Kuan Yew, <em>The Man And His Ideas</em>, 1997<br><br>"<span style="color: #ff6600;">I am often accused of interfering in the private lives of citizens. Yes, if I did not, had I not done that, we wouldn't be here today. And I say without the slightest remorse, that we wouldn't be here, we would not have made economic progress, if we had not intervened on very personal matters - who your neighbour is, how you live, the noise you make, how you spit, or what language you use. We decide what is right. Never mind what the people think</span>." - <strong><a href="http://mindbloggingstuff.blogspot.com/2004/07/lee-kuan-yew-that-very-few.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Lee Kuan Yew</span></span></a></strong>, Straits Times, 20 April 1987<br><br>"I make no apologies that the <strong><a href="http://mindbloggingstuff.blogspot.com/2006/11/kangaroo-court-in-singapore.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">PAP is the Government and the Government is the PAP</span></span></a></strong>." - Lee Kuan Yew, 1982, Petir<br><br>"If I were in authority in Singapore indefinitely without having to ask those who are governed whether they like what is being done, then I would not have the slightest doubt that I could govern much more effectively in their interests." - Lee Kuan Yew, 1962<br><br><span style="color: #008000;">"Repression, Sir is a habit that grows. I am told it is like making love - it is always easier the second time! The first time there may be pangs of conscience, a sense of guilt. But once embarked on this course with constant repetition you get more and more brazen in the attack. All you have to do is to dissolve organizations and societies and banish and detain the key political workers in these societies. Then miraculously everything is tranquil on the surface. Then an intimidated press and the government-controlled radio together can regularly sing your praises, and slowly and steadily the people are made to forget the evil things that have already been done, or if these things are referred to again they're conveniently distorted and distorted with impunity, because there will be no opposition to contradict."</span> - Lee Kuan Yew as an opposition PAP member speaking to David Marshall, Singapore Legislative Assembly, Debates, 4 October 1956<br><br>"I pointed to an article with bold headlines reporting that the police had refused to allow the PAP to hold a rally at Empress Place, and then to the last paragraph where in small type it added the meeting would take place where we were now. I compared this with a prominent report about an SPA rally.

              <p>Up to today he hasnt said anything 'mind boggling' to me. Maybe some quotes about women, and wealthy men having more than 1 wife. That is quite mind-boggling to someone like me, a younger person. That is the only thing which ever made me think his mind is a little weird....or maybe not weird, how to say....old-fashioned, I mean I understand maybe during his days, that is considered common....those comments are the only occasions I disagree with him and dont follow his logic.......</p>
              <p>Other than that, all political quotes by him, are just very normal, run-of-the-mill stuff. You can see him and his personality instantly. Some people say he is autocratic, some say ruthless, some say strong-willed. Quick mind, no-nonsense, take-no-prisoner kinda person. That type of person.</p>
              <p>So everything he says so far hasnt surprised me. You can follow his logic and the workings of his characteristic mind.</p>
              <p>Except for the women and wealthy men taking more than 1 wife.</p>
              <p>Other than that, very typical.</p>

              <p>This was said in 1955, a period in LKY's memoirs which he claimed were turbulent times, with riots, buses burning, racism rearing its ugly head - yet he believe in the same political space that CSJ is crying out now - 50 years on in the 21st Century.</p>
              <p>Again, the same was said in the Federal Pariament of Malaysia, when Singapore was part of the Federation in 1963.</p>

              <p>This speech by LKY was made on 18 December 1964, when laws were passed to clamp down on political activities after the May 13, 1964 racial riots.</p>
              <p>If LKY can still cry out for freedom even during the period after the racial riots in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore - why is he clamping down on political space in an independent Singapore that is supposed to have seen racial tension eased, and a larger portion of the population being educated, and with the minority ethnic groups largely well looked after and their poitical interests protected ?</p>
              <p>It is ironical that he ended his speech by stating that ''whatever the faults of the colonial systems - and there are many - they generated the open mind, the inquiring mind".</p>
              <p>With a closed society that is tightly controlled in all political, economic, social, cultural, spheres - why should LKY lament the lack of talent in Singapore - which depends on an open society that generate the open mind - the inquiring mind of the talented ?</p>
              <p> Singaporeans should be more political concious and hold LKY responsible for the monolithic state of affairs that is intolerant and resistant towards alternative ways, which has even led a retired Senior Civil Servant to become publicly vocal in voicing his concern for Singapore's future.</p>
