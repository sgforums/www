              <p>All these were quoted thru his lifetime at a different position, scenarios and state of the country. But i find him speaking with consistency, that constant behavorial and objectives he seeks has never to change and that is where i admired my MM.</p>

                      <p>"Mine is a very matter-of-fact approach to the problem. If you can select a population and they're educated and they're properly brought up, then you don't have to use too much of the stick because they would already have been trained. It's like with dogs. You train it in a proper way from small. It will know that it's got to leave, go outside to pee and to defecate. No, we are not that kind of society. We had to train adult dogs who even today deliberately urinate in the lifts." - Lee Kuan Yew on Singapore society, The Man &amp; His Ideas, 1997</p>

                      You know, this was just one of the things he said which infuriated me, on top of everything else. Apparently Singaporeans were (are?) too stupid for his arrogant little nose to take, so he took it upon himself to make policies to govern (LITERALLY, GOVERN) every aspect of our lives.
                      
                      He thinks he's some... GOD (God forbid!) or something. He thinks he's some ruler of all mankind that if he was not there, we wouldn't be able to function and that we are a nation of stupid people who can't think for ourselves.
                      
                      He is such a funny man... so disrespectful of human beings, yet people can still blindly support such a person.

              <p>Hi guys, me neither, until I accidentally googled for him and came across that page. Call it fate, God's divine revelation (LOL) or luck- out of my 20 years on this Earth, I finally saw the kind of person he is. Of course, 10 years ago I was still busy in primary school, so I had no inkling of what happened, but I grew up with the knowledge that there were a lot of dissidents slamming his book- or, memoirs, as he so fondly calls it.                  Hai. At least Hitler killed those he doesn't like. This guy makes everyone worship him and then gets away with such words. Damn pro lah...</p>
              <p>@lion: hehehe. It's just a matter of time. One thing is good, though. His son doesn't seem to be in the same vein as him. well, at least not in full. If baby Lee has any semblance of respect and gratitude left for the Singaporean, he would perhaps, make some changes and listen to the people.          Alas... his father is still up there with his chain and whip (lol so kinky xD) so he can't do much.          Oh well, only time can tell, but I know for sure, a lot of people are praying to their respective God(s) to curse the whole famiLee.          Kinda sad.          Power corrupts the individual. That's why we must always have a lot of individuals to share the burden!</p>

              <p>Talking about freedom of speech, here's a joke:</p>
              <div style="font-style: italic;">During a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, the Secretary-General asks the delegates a question."What is your opinion on the current food shortage in the Third World?"<br><br>The delegate from Haiti replies, "Sir, what is food?"<br>The delegate from Sweden replies, "Sir, what is a shortage?"<br>The delegate from the United States replies, "Sir, what is the Third World?"<br>And the delegate from Singapore earnestly replies, "Sir, what is an opinion?"</div>
