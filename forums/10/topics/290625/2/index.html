            <div class='col-md body'>INFANTICIDE, abandoned babies, vanishing mothers. What on earth is going on in decent, safe, law-abiding Singapore?<br><br>Over the last three weeks, there's been at least one reported case of infanticide or abandoned baby a week. In one case a newborn baby was found dead outside a Jurong flat. In another case, a woman gave birth in an alley and fled leaving her newborn behind. In yet another case, a young girl was accosted by a woman who handed her a baby to mind for a while and vanished.<br><br>.........................<br><br>Even more urgently, the authorities should re-visit the idea of "baby repositories" at strategic and convenient places throughout the island to prevent babies being left in rubbish dumps and other unsafe places. Last year, the Government rejected the idea on the basis that it would indirectly encourage or sanction child abandonment. This may have been a good enough justification at that time, perhaps, but in light of the recent revelations, it merits another think.<br><br>The concept has worked well in countries - Germany, Italy, Hungary, Austria, South Africa - that have adopted it. One of the main reasons is because the mother's anonymity is maintained. In Germany, for example, mothers can drop their babies through a chute at a specially designated place. The baby drops onto a soft heated bed, triggering off an alarm at a nearby hospital.<br><br>.................................<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw03/030217la.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw03/030217la.htm</a><br><br>In Australia, we have crazy people who abuses the child and left her to unattended.<br><br>In Singapore, we have sane people throwing newborns into the rubbish chute.<br><br>Which do you think is worse?<br><br>Crimes against children commited by the sane or the insane.</div>

If you want to leave you leave. I have many friends who left Singapore. But don't come back to run down Singapore just to show you were right to emigrate, and we should all follow you, beware that the Singaporeans here are not down and out, stupid and naive.  </div></blockquote>Whether fymk's representation of Australian aborigines is twisted is subjected to individual interpretation, maybe because of your political alliance with P4P, you choose to distinguish Australia in a negative light, so as to elevate P4P to a higher ground.<br><br>What transpired between hloc and me in Military Nuts, is personal, I just wanted to piss him off.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Why did I choose to get personal? Because he got personal by calling me names first, I only returned the courtesy many times over.<br><br>Anyway, there is no distinction between Speaker's Corner and Military Nuts or any other different forums, because it is SGFORUMS. If a topic subsist, the administrators will block out the topic and ask that forumers continue in the existing thread. Thereby, there is no distinction between the different forums, it is only ONE forum with many different interest.<br><br>Are you sure that there are 4 million Singaporeans? By the term Singaporeans, I suppose you mean CITIZENS. FYI, <a href="http://www.singstat.gov.sg/stats/keyind.html#keyind" rel="nofollow"> our current TOTAL population stands at 4.68 million. </a> Or are you like the government which chose to mar the line between residents and citizens? Get your facts and figures correct and stop making a fool of yourself.<br><br>Resident is defined as:<br><br>Residential Status<br>Singapore citizens and permanent residents are classified as Singapore residents or the resident population. Singapore permanent residents refer to non-citizens who have been granted permanent residence in Singapore. Non-resident population are those who are non-citizens and non-permanent residents of Singapore, such as employment pass holders, work permit holders, student pass holders, dependent pass holders and long-term social visit pass holders.<br><br>Out of the total 4.68 million TOTAL population, 3.675 million are RESIDENTS. Out of this 3.675 million RESIDENTS, it is further broken down into PERMANENT RESIDENTS and CITIZENS. The Department of Statistics chooses to censor information regarding the population of CITIZENS these days, probably for fear that it will enrage the CITIZENS due to the mass influx of cheap 3rd world RESIDENTS.<br><br><strong>We could only have an estimation of what the current CITIZENS population is. In 2000, they did a census, results of the census was RESIDENT population was 3.26 million (CITIZENS = 2.97 million &amp; PERMANENT RESIDENT = 290,000). By the way, our growth rate has been on the decline, due to migrations and fewer births.</strong> Early in the year, the government talks about increasing the population size to 6 million, which can only be achieved by artificial means such as getting made in 3rd world countries and stamping them with made in Singapore rubber stamp.<br><br>The widespread effect of these 3rd world immigrants can be seen all over. Even Macdonalds these days employ native Indonesians, Filippinos and mainlanders. Frankly, I have nothing against these people of other countries, because it's the fault of our government for not controlling their immigration en masse.<br><br>Like I said in a previous post, Australia is much much bigger than Singapore. Therefore you have to stop using small city mentality on a big country. It's harder to regulate a big country than a puny dot. Have you ever been to the country side in Australia? There are vast expanses of land, if you live in those areas, there could very well be very little passersby.<br><br>If you think our Singapore is such a caring nation, maybe you can explain why so many Singaporeans stood by watching a lady being stabbed in broad daylight, while all they can do is video taped the situation and post it on their blog.<br><br>If Singapore ruled Australia, I can assure you the same issues such as Shellay will occur and reccur. I am afraid this application of small city in a big country environment is endemic in the no so brilliant population, it even subsist in our NTUC Comfort. Some years back, NTUC launch a taxi service in China, they get taxi drivers to rent their taxis in China. The taxi drivers leased the taxis, paid a deposit and the taxis when driven out NTUC was never heard of again. NTUC employed the same small city mentality in a big country, which resulted in a heavy loss. Though they have satelite tracking on the taxis, the taxis was never recovered because it's driven to another province, spray painted and satelite tracking removed.<br><br>I would think that the majority of friends you have that emigrated from Singapore are much smarter than you. Or maybe they are less patriotic, they chose to leave a country which has failed their aspirations, whereas, you have chose to fight for a lost cause, albeit a little foolish. Most that chose to remain in Singapore, might be for family reasons or like Gazelle (who was rejected by the Australian government for immigration status, that's why he is biased against white people), a large majority of the population might not qualify for immigrations to other countries due to educational status or money.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

I don't point to such sickness because you are out of Singapore, because there are also such person like Maurizio 13 who is in Singapore.
