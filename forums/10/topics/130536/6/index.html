To me, my sons' academic is a poor second in priority to personal development. In all times I have attended the meeting the teacher's session. The ONE question I've asked is how are they relating to the environmental. I'd rather my sons be well-adjusted and dynamic individuals than be high performing nerd. They have never topped their class in anything but they are up there among the top. Not just that.... they are extremely popular among their peers.<br>So at least from one parent, marks are secondary. That is Intelligent Quotient. Then there are the other two quotients - emotional and resilience.<br>In a way you are right, too many parents focus on the IQ and neglect the EQ and RQ. That's what happen to kids who breaks down or rebel.<br></div>

You know, I just realised that your above paragraph (the first one) is ONE complete sentence. How's your English in school?<br>Well, my boys also get $10 per week. They are told to save whatever they did not spend, use their own money to buy birthday presents for their classmates' birthday. Not only that, they have NEVER had a birthday party in their whole life.<br>Probably the one difference between you life and their life is having a father that cared. We do things together. Play board games, network games, and even build scale models.... One that they are not getting - overpampering.<br>Instead of b-itching about life, about how poor thing you are. You should channel this energy to make your own life better FOR YOURSELF.</div>
