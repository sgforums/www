If your comments are poorly written, this, in itself is a barrier for people to understand what you are saying. Surely you know this.<br>As you'd said bombastic languages will result in people not being able to understand you, but doesn't a poorly written script do the same thing too?<br><br>Didn't you know that in a piece of writing, because of the lack of any visual cue that one might have in a face-to-face encounter, a reader only has one platform of reference in trying to understand what is being written. Surely you know that too?<br><br>On the Barney story... not great, not bad either... but totally irrelevant. But it only goes to show that the caps lock button on your keyboard works - make sure that it is not turned on! Shift key does the job better.<br><br>On the issue of the relationship between you and your dad, too bad.... If you cannot change him, can you change yourself? Not everyone is as unfortunately as you, likewise, not everyone is as fortunate as you.... it all depends on what you are comparing against, but no one's preventing you from being bitter the rest of your life.<br><br>I did not have a great childhood either, my dad did not play with me nor buy me lots of stuff. We were not well off. We did not have a TV set or a phone till much later in my teenage life. My dad is now 80+, tends to repeat his inane stories, but I love him nonetheless, never blamed him for the perceived inadequacies that he may have. Learned from his positive characteristics as well as his negatives ones so that I will not repeat them. Blame him? NEVER!</div>

Hope you take them.<br><br>Seriously, Money and Things are not the most important stuff. I always feel that kids who have all the material stuff do not equate to them being happy and kids without all the material stuff do not equate to them being unhappy.<br><br>I personally feel that you and your dad need to communicate your thoughts and you may learn about your dad's love for you.<br><br>I have gone thru ups and downs of life too especially during childhood. ....but my siblings and i have never hate or disliked our childhood and life. We don't even hate our dad for what we had gone thru, thanks to my mum of course, who shower us with love and care, who make us understand material things are very trivial.<br><br>So look don't go comparing with others. There will always be a down-side in everyone's life story. All you see of them are only what you can see. There are many others you can't see.<br><br>Its only how you look at it. The difference in perception is just cross of a line.<br><br>If you choose to only look at the negative, nothing will be good to you, be it now or in the future because you will have endless things to brood over. If you choose to look on the positive side you will always find happiness.<br><br>Its your own choice. And i hope you choose the positive side.<br><br>Remember : Don't measure success or failure by material wealth. But by how you Feel, Our feelings determine the richness of our Lives!<br><br>Feel Rich today, look on the positive side and find happiness.<br><br>All the Best!<br><br></div>

He was far from perfect. He indulges in a hobby (a good clean one) to a point of obsessiveness and neglected his wife and children. Only grudging did he attend my BMT parents' visit and my passing out parade. He'd rather be somewhere else. If things were left to him, we probably not have TV or telephone.<br>However I have learned not to repeat his mistakes. I am close to my sons, am interested in their development and make an effort to do things together. As a matter of fact, my younger son made a date with me to go frisbee throwing tomorrow morning.<br>It is not likely you can change him. His life and habits are already moded. You on the other hand is coming to the prime of your life. At this point, you can choose to go his way, or go your own way. No point b-itching about how poor thing you are or shift all the blame to him.  Decide now, what you want to do for the rest of your life. Where parents are concern, sometimes you can fight, sometimes you have to give in. Sometimes a little gentleness goes a long way.<br><br>"I once complain that I have no shoes, until I saw a man who has no legs..."</div>

There are too many whiners (actually not necessary only men) and not enough doers.<br>My personal view? If we can't make a difference where we are, then we should just shut up and go away. I have always been vocal in my workplace, not contended with just "pantry-talk", I have raised many issues during various departmental meetings and feedback with HR. Glad to say that there are changes because of my challenges, though not always. Still, not many are willing to put the money where the mouth is.<br>One time, I told off the committee in my congregation: If you cannot be part of the solution, don't be part of the problem.

            <div class='col-md body'>ok this was wat i heard yesterday, and it gives me some more answer to parents' kiasuism :<br><br>60% of their exams are outside books.<br><br>many of the stuff especially for chinese exams are outside wat books or teachers have for the students. (hear that the whole class of students in one popular school failed their chinese exams)<br><br>My thoughts :<br><br>So in order to 'help' kids to cope with exams, parents need to give the children more 'work' to do.  Many of us don't have training on how to care and mind our kids. We use wat we think right. All of us learn through On The Job Training. Many get carried away in their stride to excel the kids. Many of us don't know where to put the 'full-stop', we must have lost that along the line.<br><br>But we would think if the studies in school are not so 'tough' we won't have to put so much 'effort' on our kids....<br><br>then again....we being parents should know better what is good for our kids??
