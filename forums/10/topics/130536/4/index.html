Did you also notice that for street interviews on the news programmes, just about everyone being interviewed is unable to speak consistently in one language? You have people attempting to speak mandarin with a lot of help from english words and phrases and vice versa. Some don't even speak in complete sentences.</div>

I travel substantially but I do not see how the English standard in Shanghai has improved, not even talking about the Singapore standard. As a matter of fact, I cannot understand the Mandarin in Beijing either. Probably there is a small percentage of people in mainland China that is effectively bilingual, but the general population is still light years behind us. Of course they will catch up if we don't buck up.....<br><br>Asterix was originally a French cartoon, but was translated into many languages, English included. Two movies were also made over, the second one was shown last year, I think.<br><br>Probably the same era as Tin Tin. Still, pick a book that the child likes, let him use that as a platform to pick up words, encourage him to ask you about any words he does not understand. Check the dictionary together. This way, you learn, he learns, use of dictionary taught..... everybody wins.<br><br>I am not a graduate, but I try to speak and write using proper English.

On the flip side, there are also those that speak and write like English professors or linguists but cannot produce concrete results at the end of the day!</div>

But that is in china, I dont need to worry if i don't go there. But what worries me is that a chinese from mainland come here and in 6 months they are effectively bilingual in both language.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I think English is a much easier language to learn compared to Mandarin. You can't just pronouce the word in Mandarin and write it!!! Nor can you try to read out the word if you don't reconize it.</div>
