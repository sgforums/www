So Singaporeans have to be willing to take the risk and either vote for alternatives or spoil their votes. I say voting for the opposition sends a stronger message. And when Singaporeans show themselves willing to vote opposition politicians into parliament, the opposition parties will also find it easier to recruit highly qualified members, which will benenfit us. Either the ruling party gets its head out of the sand and takes measures to improve our lot, or they get voted out eventually and another party takes over the reins. Nobody ever said change is easy and painless.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My take is that teachers here simply have no heart for students. They treat the students more as result getting mechanisms <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">. If they don't treat students like human beings, how can they feel like one?

As you'd said, <span style="font-style: italic;">"their parents see no future in doing so"</span>. When I was growing up as a student, I never had help from my parents on HOW to study. It was always "learning by hard" or "spot the questions". Athletes who do not deliver academically? You got to watch "Coach Carter". This movie deals with this question quite adequately. Also look at the number of good soccer players who did not do well as students. Do the rules in our sports school seem harsh? Sure they are, and there is a good reason for them to be.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by TehJarVu:</div><div class="quote_body">the key in your case here is that they are among the top 15%.<br>the climate is still like this,<br>to want to be at the top,<br>so u are lucky, or in your case 'blessed'?<br><br>what i would like to see,<br>is for people to be less competitive in the society,<br>and to have a more friendly environment generally,<br>where there are more (equal) oppotunities for all.</div></blockquote>I need to admit that perhaps I a little more bless, however, I also need to emphasize that there is a LARGE AMOUNT OF MANAGEMENT involved. Having a slightlysmarter child does not mean that everything will be a-ok from now on. It means having to nurture the child and occasionally nudging the child to the right direction. It means motivating the child to motivate himself.<br>There are things that one cannot manage eg, intellect or those born as prodigies(which neither of my sons exhibit), and there are things one can manage eg, motivate, encourage, befriend, love, instill discipline etc.<br>In managing a child's life, there is a constant balance between when to discipline and when to let loose.<br>Competition will continue to exist, the trick is to teach the child that it is not a bloodsport. Competition will bring you to the next level when you succeed, it should not drop you down to the dungeon when you fail.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ORIGAMIST:</div><div class="quote_body">This part I don't agree although what you say is quite valid.

I think at the upper levels, most schools have lost the mission to educate. It had evolved to a ranking issue. Note, too, that MOE is probably aware of it and had taken steps to rectify the situation. Whether successful or not, I don't know. It's like the 5-day week thing. CCA is now on Fridays. Has it now become more stressful on Friday? Will parents now see Saturdays as a free day for more tuitions? Other than the exams period, weekends in my household is meant for fun and recreation.<br>I am not defending the system per se, I think that MOE is NOT really doing a good job, but I think they are trying. With parents and sometimes the kids being so vocal, sometimes teachers are stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea. If the syllabus is too simple, they will be accused of slacking in their work, if it is too tough, then they will be accused of being elitist. If they conduct extra lessons, parents will complain that it is too much, don't conduct, parents will say that they do not care.<br>Glad I am not a school teacher.<br><br>I wish for all to note that I am NOT pro-government or any it's representatives. I am just stating that there are other forces at place - the largest one being the parent and the family unit. I am an advocate of good parent/child relationship. To me it is the first line of defense for the child's growing up process. Any parent reading this should ask themselves some questions:<br>1. Did I communicate enough? <span style="font-style: italic;">Note that communication is NOT nagging or scolding - it is just chit-chatting and trivial stuff.</span><br>2. Did I encourage the child to communicate enough? <span style="font-style: italic;">This is not reporting to you what homework he has, it is how has his day been? What games did he play during PE? What funny stories he heard today?</span><br>3. Was there a high level of blaming and finger-pointing when things go wrong?<br>4. Did you encourage care and concern within the family unit?<br>5. Are you realistic to your child's performance?<br>6. Did you take time to pursue <strong>with</strong> your child things that interest him?<br><br>I can go on... but don't fully blame the system. Look inwards, under your roof... there are things that will interest you....</div>
