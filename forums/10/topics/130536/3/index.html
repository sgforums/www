If she's been achieve over her previous 3 years, let her understand that there WILL be a drop in marks as she need to adjust to the higher level of learning. Tell her the purpose of schooling is: not, not to make mistakes, but it is to make all the mistakes and learn along the way. Tell her not to be demoralised by the number of corrections she need to do because everyone's doing correction now.<br>P1 boy...? let him dream a while. Get into his mind and see what's he thinking inside. Find out what challenge him. Use these as a leverage to encourage him more. Never, ever compare him negatively against his sister. You may praise his strong points over his sister's to boost his confidence a little. Assign small amount of work to him and see if he reacts responsibly by doing them. Reward him once in a while. And when he gets a little more mature, explain the purpose of schooling to him.<br>Your younger child has a typical 2nd child syndrome. One with a slightly more lackadasical attitude (otherwise called boh chap). So the challenge is to slowly nudge him to do a little more, taking baby steps along the way.<br>I know these for a fact 'cos my two sons are the same - older boy, totally motivated and focused, young boy, relak attitude. I can still managed to get them to work hard in school.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[<br>Good Morning Chin Eng!<br><br>Thanks for your advice. I did let him dream thru P1, he is in P2 this yr.<br><br>When he was in P1, he 'dreamt' so much, the teacher was on his back  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Cos he always kept away his homework and some never to be found, he always needed to meddle with things when teachers were teaching, (he still does, i wrote to the P2 teacher to let him be) etc etc  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  His classmates told us he was always badly scolded by the teacher. Poor him ne.....how to gain confident like that??<br><br>Once, he was punished consecutively (made him stand etc), i had to write to tell her the worksheet was LOST, LOST means cannot be found liao.....would she be continuing to punish till him can 'magic' one for her??? Yo, ended up my boy was further 'punished' for my mistakes ( i mistaken he stood on the chair while infact he was only standing on the floor which i was no bothered about). i apologised and she still go target him, get the whole class to be her witness of wat she did and wat his mummy said.....<br><br>I learnt the hard way (at his expense, i felt bad) that i can't do the same for him (make him be responsible for his own stuff) like his sister.<br><br>He is definitely a bright and creative boy. He is more of a divergent thinker unlike his sister a convergent thinker.....most education systems and school environment are not condusive for divergent thinker..<br><br>anyway thru hard and soft approach ( i had read up some books to learn some soft skills, the hard approach is my natural reaction  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ), he has shown great improvements this year, thanks to his P2 teacher's patience (no more scolding liao) and the student care's teacher's patience and understanding.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  i try my best not to kill his creativity and divergent thinking......<br><br>I will tell my girl wat you mentioned here. Thanks!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Its a GREAT CHALLENGE to be 'good' parents....esp in such era of heavy study load..........<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My niece &amp; nephew left for Perth a few yrs back cos they cannot cope with Chinese. Only this yr.  there will be a reduction  in syllabus but it is too late. They are very happy there &amp; don't intend to come back.<br><br>Also the JC Project work-  My daughter was assigned an Art teacher who was going to quit the next yr. He was hopeless, everytime the students seek his help to clarify something, he told them to read the handbook. It was very stressful.  Some of her classmates have insomnia &amp; broke down &amp; cried.<br>As a result, the whole class got very low grading compared to weaker class that even some teachers were surprised.<br>There were so many unnecessary paper work. Some students have 3 large files! Only this yr. as a result of many complaints, there will be changes to PW.<br><br>I'm told that this yr. JC students doing Sc. has to take a compulsory humanities subj. &amp; visa versa- this is another instant change.<br><br>Kiasu parents &amp; numerous changes to edn. system are the causes for stress.<br><br>My hubby said that economy is so bad that U grads may end up with low paying job. What's the point of studying so hard. Might as well go casino &amp; work as coupier- can get a lot of tips from gamblers</div>

Yo, ended up my boy was further 'punished' for my mistakes ( i mistaken he stood on the chair while infact he was only standing on the floor which i was no bothered about). i apologised and she still go target him, get the whole class to be her witness of wat she did and wat his mummy said.....<br><br>I learnt the hard way (at his expense, i felt bad) that i can't do the same for him (make him be responsible for his own stuff) like his sister.<br><br>He is definitely a bright and creative boy.

My second child is also a dreamer. Everytime when he has a new form teacher, my wife sure kena called to school and hear the same remark, "your son day dream a lot." Don't know when he will wake up automatically.<br><br>One thing to get him out of his dream world is when the whole family is together, whether having meals or watching tv together. In our busy work schedule and travelling, such quality time with family is much more useful than many of us realise.<br><br>[/b][/quote]</div>

In fact I think my standard of English has dropped lots since Secondary School mainly because I've been speaking so much Mandarin peppered with Hokkien (Hokkien's improving) due to the nature of my work.<br><br>Anyway, I like to talk to people of all ages, especially so on the internet as it's so much easier to break the ice. I have spoken and made firm friends with secondary school kids and it is really appalling to find out that some don't even understand words like "bombastic" or idioms like "Pot calling the kettle black", which should really be primary school standard English?<br><br>I honestly wonder how things will be like in the future because I don't think Singapore can use English as a selling point in the future.<br></div>

Otherwise see the head of student welfare in the school.<br><br>I strongly believe in caning, up to a point. Anyone else who also believe in hard punishment please note that there is another skill to master - that of being at peace with oneself. In English, it means, when caning, don't get angry. Very tough thing to do. Because you need to convince yourself the purpose of the caning is a punishment for an offence and NOT to vent anger.<br><br>I cannot emphasize enough that as parents (especially fathers) we need to spend enough quality time with our children.
