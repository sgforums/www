There is an Asian-run cafe near my university that I've visited a few times. I have overheard the owner telling his young sons about getting ready for Kumon lessons. AFAIK, Kumon is a Japanese method of learning, and I don't trust the Japs when it comes to education. Kids in Tokyo are able to commit gruesome murders, meaning something is very wrong with the Japanese system.<br><br>A side note, here's a hypothetical situation. Imagine you have migrated to Australia (any city). Would you send your kids to learn how to play soccer if they have a talent for the sport? After all, they are learning to play for recreational purposes, not to turn pro later in life.</div>

I think life is a vicious cycle. The government in its' attempt to upgrade may have a part in it, but it is not the only factor. Another factor, (I hope this does not sound to racist) is the mental state of most ethnic yellow-skinned folks (including Koreans and Japanese). If you are to look at any society that has a section the thrives very strongly, it is likely to be yellow-skinned folks. The need to excel is very very strong in us.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Actually true that parents also has a role to play in the current stressful life of our kids. My girl's classmates whose result is only one mark or two diff from my girl....their parents send them for tutions after the girls result drop by less than five marks (their results were in band1 and upper band2 kind). ..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  they make me wonder and wory initially.....but i weigh the pros and cons, (other than money no enugh).....and my decision was no full fledge tuition (but enrichments at cc is fine).....i have learnt to live without being influence. I am glad... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></strong></blockquote>Enrichment classes are good. Not only is the environment more play-like, it helps to inculcate a liking for the subject matter. My sons has a Chinese teaching coming in each week to do an enrichment programme. Nothing on the school syllabus is taught, on the contrary, they discuss on proverbs, culture and history.<br>I think it is wrong to push the children for the banding. Tuition to me is not a good solution. My sons and I had an agreement when they started their schooling: As long as they listen to their class lessons attentive and continue to deliver a reasonable result, they will have no need for tuition. The term reasonable is defined by an upper band 2 marks, if occasionally the score drops to lower band 2, it is also acceptable. Most parents need to know the ROOT cause of low marks, if this is not discover, tuition is only a poorly taught-of solution.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I am not one for the cane.....and hence i fall in love with books like :<br>How to talk so kids will listen and listen so kids will talk etc etc.....<br><br>i am still learning......and thank goodness my kids are helping me by teaching me the way.......when they retort or shows anger/frustration....i tell my hubby they are 'teaching us' how to care for them.....take their clues...<br></strong></blockquote>As long as the child is properly managed, caning is NOT necessary. As I'd said, I believe in caning, my sons know I believe in caning, so nowadays they never ever get into the situation that needed this punishment. Rules in my house include:<br>1. Parents are never always correct, if the child disagree with the parents, the child may voice their disagreement, but should do it with respect. Freedom of speech with love.<br>2. If I am proven wrong, I will apologise. I expect the same from them.<br>3. Respect each other's space and property. Ask permission when entering each others private zone eg cupboards and drawers. I ask permission when opening my sons' drawers and school bags.<br>4. Objective and realistic goals are set. When in doubt, please clarify. This is important when we look at our children and decide what they can do. Many times, such goals are unrealistics (eg getting band 1 ALL the time).<br><br>a_splash.... all this while, I am not aware that you are a mother.

So i had no choice but to go back to it. but true  . . . as you continue to use it in your daily life, you start to adore the language. Anyway, language is never fun in a classroom enviroment with test and such. But when allowed to be used freely, it is a different thing altogether. On the other hand, it is really difficult to learn a language without somebody there to guide you. So ultimately, it must be taught in a classroom kinda style.</div>
