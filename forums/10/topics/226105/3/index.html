I am argueing this in the context of our current situation, of which, I might not be exactly the biggest fan of. However, reality precedes idealism and I hope we can have an objective discussion on this topic. To those who have taken offence to what I've written, I apologise. </div></blockquote>I am curious, what is Western Welfarism?<br>I am not against the rise of GST but I would hope the "very good" brains which the country are paying would try to find another mathematical solutions that will benefit both the poor and the mid class in short term and will able to benefit the "elite class" in the long run. I am not a high paid "brian" therefore I am not sure if there's any possibility of it happening.<br><br>ps: just hope the very good brains of the garment will not be lazy</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are many critics to the govt tactics.  And there is really no clear right or wrong.  It is quite clear that promoting elitism in the country is not something socially acceptable here.  On the other hand, the govt realises that we only have people as our precious resources so we need to harness the best to boost the country economically.  This leads each and every person to think that they don't owe anybody a living since they are performing and earning their own keep.<br><br>The unfortunate by-product of elitism and the rest has to be addressed separately in the social fabric.  Currently, we don't see a lot of high-profile plans and steps in place possibly because the govt (community devt ministry) either have not thought about it yet in detail or is still at the planning stage.  But we don't have to wait for the govt to do something.  The Wee case is something that was done by the ordinary citizenry without any govt facilitating, right?<br><br>In the long term we may be seeing a lot of cases of young pple behaving similiarly as the PAP MP daughter.  Not very sure how the older folks may look at this.  In actual fact, S'pore may not be a very good place to retire when u grown old.  The way the taxes, medical schemes and the policies are in place, unless you have spent at least 2 terms in parliament, it is not very encouraging for an elderly person to spend the golden years here.</div>
