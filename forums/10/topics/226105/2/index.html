            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by reyes:<br><strong>[b]I am not sure which country have pension policy. But I know Japan practice that, and the reason that I see why their Garment did that is because the employer and employed status will be a long lasting one.<br><br>1 Japanese man, in his life will only work for 1 company.<br>1 Singapore man, average will work for at least 3 company. The mindset of people are different.<br><br>Japanese basically do everything within their limits for their company, as they know that if their company contiune to run after he / she retire, they will get their pension. They care for the company like its part of their own family business despite their salary and status in the company. Do YOU.</strong><br><br>i working in a jap company thus i would like to correct some of wrong perception you have on a Jap or jap culture.<br>most Jap no longer work in just a company in their entire life. at least not in my company or my client company.<br><br>Japan pension scheme as i know of has nothing much to do with a lasting employee or employer relationship. everyone every employed person has to contributed to a pension fund(similar to CPF). but they face big problems now because ageing population, younsgter prefer to be freester than work in a 9 to 5 job thus not contributing to the fund.<br><br>first and forecast we need to increase our employer CPF contribution back to 16 % [/b]</blockquote>Hmmm, as I am not 100% clear on these, I shalt not comment on your views.<br><br>Anyway, I am working in a very Traditional Japanese company and currently in Japan. (tomorrow flight back, going to sleep .. last post) From what I have known from the Japanese in my company and those I have encounted, it is by the LAW of the Japanese Goverment that the company shall provide for the employee after retirement. Yes, despite his / her year in the company, the company in which they retire will be required to pay his / her pension. So basis on this point, I strongly believe their point of 1 company 1 life.<br><br>Oh yea, I know also on your point that a part of the salary will be hold by the company instead of the Goverment like the CPF, but I am not sure if this amount will be used as their pension. But certianly, if the company closes down they lose everything.<br><br>And also loan will be granted with the company being the G. of the employer, should the employer unable to payback his / her loan, the company will bear the loan. (this is happening in Japan.) so again, this is a point for 1 job 1 life for the japs. <br><br>Anyway good nite. 12.56am.. 10am flight tml. cu again in Singapore</div>

For low income earners, the increase of a few percentage points will not make such a big difference to the employee and may encourage employers to hire cheap low-skilled foreigners instead.
