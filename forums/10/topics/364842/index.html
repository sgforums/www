              <p>Last incident of USA seizing DPRK ship:</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <h1>Scud missiles seized aboard North Korean ship</h1>
                  <p class="articledetails">By Thomas Ricks and Peter Slevin in Washington<br> December 12 2002</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>United States explosives experts are working to stabilise 12
                  Scud missiles found on a North Korean ship boarded by Spanish and US
                  military forces in the Arabian Sea.</p>
                  <p>The So San, which had ignored warning shots from two Spanish warships, was believed to have been heading for Yemen.</p>
                  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It had been tracked by US spy satellites and navy ships since it
                  left North Korea in the middle of last month, Washington officials said.</strong></span></p>
                  <p>With tensions growing in the region because of possible US action
                  against Iraq, the seizure raises important questions about how and when
                  the US will enforce its promise to intercept weapons of mass
                  destruction - particularly items such as missiles, whose sales are not
                  banned under international law.</p>
                  <p>A US intelligence official speculated that Yemen had bought the
                  missiles to upgrade the handful of ageing Scuds that it already
                  possesses.<br>

                  <p>However, military analysts said the missiles could have destined

                  <p>Iraq used Scuds against Israel and Saudi Arabia in the 1991 Gulf

                  <p>US intelligence officials said there was no link between the North Korean ship and al-Qaeda or other terrorist groups.</p>
                  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> The So San was boarded early on Monday about 960 kilometres south-east of Yemen. </strong></span></p>
                  <p>Finding the missiles, hidden under sacks of cement, can only deepen
                  the strain in the already tense relationship between Washington and
                  Pyongyang.</p>
                  <p>It may also chill US relations with Yemen, which backed Iraq in the
                  Gulf War, and was the site of an attack on a US destroyer, the Cole,
                  that killed 17 American sailors in October 2000.</p>
                  <p>The US Deputy Secretary of State, Richard Armitage - who arrived in
                  China yesterday on an Asian tour to drum up support for a likely
                  Washington-led war against Iraq - said the interception of the So San
                  was further evidence that North Korea was an important proliferator of
                  weapons.</p>
                  <p>But the discovery was unlikely to affect US policy on North Korea.</p>
                  <p>"I don't think there's any change. This is not exactly a development that is new," he said.</p>
                  <p>Two Spanish warships, the Navarra and the Patino, signalled the
                  freighter to stop around dawn on Monday. The Spanish ships were part of
                  a seaborne operation initially established to halt al-Qaeda supporters
                  who might be fleeing the war in Afghanistan.</p>
                  <p>When the So San tried to evade capture, the Spanish ships fired
                  warning shots across its bow. When it continued on, Spanish special
                  forces troops used helicopters to board the boat.</p>
                  <p>The crew of about 20 was then put under guard and the ship
                  searched. It quickly became apparent that there were problems with the
                  legal status of the ship, officials said, noting that its original name
                  had been painted over to conceal its North Korean origin, and its
                  registry papers were not in order.</p>
                  <p>A search uncovered discrepancies between the ship's manifest, which
                  listed a cargo of cement, and the actual load. The Spanish soldiers
                  opened large containers partially hidden by the cement and found
                  missile parts. They then called in US military experts in handling
                  explosives.</p>
                  <p>USS Nassau, which usually carries Marines, helicopters and Harrier
                  jump-jets, was standing by the freighter, which remained off the Yemeni
                  coast, an official said. Additional searches still were under way.</p>

              <p>Last incident of USA seizing DPRK ship:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>Scud missiles seized aboard North Korean ship</h1>
              <p>By Thomas Ricks and Peter Slevin in
              Washington<br> December 12 2002</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>United States explosives experts are working to stabilise 12
              Scud missiles found on a North Korean ship boarded by Spanish and
              US military forces in the Arabian Sea.</p>
              <p>The So San, which had ignored warning shots from two Spanish
              warships, was believed to have been heading for Yemen.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It had been
              tracked by US spy satellites and navy ships since it left North
              Korea in the middle of last month, Washington officials
              said.</strong></span></p>
              <p>With tensions growing in the region because of possible US
              action against Iraq, the seizure raises important questions about
              how and when the US will enforce its promise to intercept weapons
              of mass destruction - particularly items such as missiles, whose
              sales are not banned under international law.</p>
              <p>A US intelligence official speculated that Yemen had bought the
              missiles to upgrade the handful of ageing Scuds that it already
              possesses.</p>
              <p>However, military analysts said the missiles could have destined
              for one of North Korea's other arms clients, which include
              Pakistan, Iran, Egypt, Libya and Syria.</p>
              <p>Iraq used Scuds against Israel and Saudi Arabia in the 1991 Gulf
