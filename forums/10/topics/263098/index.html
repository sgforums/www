            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br><br>TAIPEI - TAIWAN hit back at Singapore for criticising its plan to go ahead with a referendum on joining the United Nations, calling it 'unacceptable'.<br><br>'The foreign ministry deeply regrets... Singapore's comment on our referendum plan as 'provocative and irresponsible.' We find it utterly unacceptable,' it said in a statement on Saturday.<br><br>'Taiwan is a sovereign democratic country and a referendum is the basic right of the people. Other countries have no rights to intervene.... We hope the international community will support our bid to join the UN,' it said.<br><br>The comment came after Singapore on Friday cautioned that such a move would raise tensions between Taiwan and China.<br><br>'The proposal to put Taiwan's UN membership bid under the title 'Taiwan' to a referendum is provocative and irresponsible,' Singapore's foreign ministry said in a statement.<br><br>'It can only give false hope to the Taiwanese people, raise cross-straits tensions and reduce Taiwan's international space,' it said.<br><br>Taiwan, under its official name, the Republic of China, lost its UN seat to China in 1971. The two sides split in 1949 after a civil war.<br><br>Its efforts to rejoin the world body have been repeatedly blocked by Beijing, which regards Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting reunification.<br><br>On Monday, President Chen Shui-bian told a visiting US delegation that he will push for a referendum next year on the issue, alongside the March 2008 presidential vote.<br><br>Officials here have vowed to go ahead with the referendum despite a warning from key ally Washington not to proceed. -- AFP </blockquote>What the fish is Singapore's government thinking? Can't it stfu? Is it necessary to make such comment to "hold" balls for China?</div>
