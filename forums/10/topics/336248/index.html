              <p>Well spending isn't the problem ... i reckon its the buying power that is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cars and accommodation is expensive in Singapore. With those 2 tickets you probably have little left after paying the bank.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And with long queues for every job in the classified ads plus the retirement age in Sg ..... what does that instill in the working class.....omg i better save now before im given the golden handshake....omg so many people are fighting fer my job.... am i overpaid?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The wage difference between the lower caste and higher caste I feel is wider in Sg than say Aus. And that i feel is the main problem. The higher caste are not contributing/spending enuf $ to boost the economy cos they are like 1%(i made this up) where as the working class are like 60-70%. There needs to be a better distribution of wealth between the masses.... ie more tax for the high income and less on the low income.... voila.... more spending on retail</p>

              <p>According to economic theory:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...The way in which the relative decline of investment in
                  respect to savings results in economic crisis is not difficult to see.</p>
              <p>In the modern economic community, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the sum total of goods and services
                  appearing in the market is at one and the same time the income of the
                  community and the aggregate cost of producing the goods and services in
                  question.</span></p>
              <p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sums expended by the entrepreneur on wages, rents,
                  salaries, raw materials, interest, lawyers' fees, and so on, represent
                  costs to him and income to those who receive them.</span></p>
              <p>His own profits also
                  enter the picture, since they are his income and the cost of persuading
                  him to produce the wealth in question. The goods are offered for sale
                  at a price which is equal to the sum of all costs (including profits).
                  In the community as a whole, aggregate costs, aggregate incomes, and
                  aggregate prices are the same, since they are merely opposite sides of
                  the identical expenditures.</p>
              <p>          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The purchasing power available in the community is
                  equal to income minus savings.</span> If there are any savings,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the available
                  purchasing power will be less</span> than the aggregate prices being asked for
                  the products for sale and by the amount of the savings.</p>
              <p>Thus,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> all the
                  goods and services produced cannot be sold as long as savings are held
                  back.</span> In order for all the goods to be sold, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is necessary for the
                  savings to reappear in the market as purchasing power.</span></p>
              <p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">usual way in
                  which this is done is by investment.</span> When savings are invested, they
                  are expended into the community and appear as purchasing power. Since
                  the capital good made by the process of investment is not offered for
                  sale to the community, the expenditures made by its creation appear
                  completely as purchasing power.</p>
              <p>Thus, the disequilibrium between
                  purchasing power and prices in which was created by the act of saving
                  is restored completely by the act of investment, and all the goods can
                  be sold at the prices asked.</p>
              <p>But whenever investment is less than
                  savings, the available supply of purchasing power is inadequate by the
                  same amount to buy the goods being offered.</p>
              <p>This margin by which
                  purchasing power is inadequate because of an excess of savings over
                  investment may be called the "deflationary gap." <strong>This
                  '"deflationary gap" is the key to the twentieth century economic crisis
                  and one of the three central cores of the whole tragedy of the century.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> The deflationary gap arising from a failure of
                  investment to reach the level of savings can he closed either by
                  lowering the supply of goods to the level of the available purchasing
                  power or by raising the supply of purchasing power to a level able to
                  absorb the existing supply of goods, or by a combination of both.</p>
              <p>The
                  first solution will give a stabilized economy on a low level of
                  economic activity; the second will give a stabilized economy on a high
                  level of economic activity. Left to itself, the economic system under
                  modern conditions would adopt the former procedure.</p>
              <p>This would work
                  roughly as follows: The existence of the deflationary gap (that is,
                  available purchasing power less than aggregate prices of available
                  goods and services) will result in falling prices, declining economic
                  activity, and rising unemployment.</p>
              <p>All this will result in a fall in
                  national income, and this in turn will result in an even more rapid
                  decline in the volume of savings. This decline continues until the
                  volume of savings reaches the level of investment, at which point the
                  fall is arrested and the economy becomes stabilized at a low level...</p>
