              <p><strong>Scenario 1</strong></p>
              <p><br>Ah Beng works as a supervisor in a computer parts factory in Tuas. He draws a salary of $1800/mth and has a store clerk wife with 2 daughters.</p>
              <p><br>Each weekend, he will treat his family to a hawker stall dinner costing around $60 - lemon chicken, steam pomfret, crabs, prawns, etc, deliciously cooked.</p>
              <p><br>But now, with this current financial crisis, he stops such meals, and save his money instead, eating at home, worrying daily if he will get retrenched.</p>
              <p><br>Ah Seng owns that hawker stall. NOw, with his regular patron and many more others like him gone, he has a problem paying his rent, workers and overheads. He still has savings, and tries to stay afloat, swatting flies, hoping for a better day.</p>
              <p><br>His son, John, an intelligent and hardworking teen, had been saving up to buy a high end computer to spice up and multi task his school projects for a better grade. But now, his father reduced his daily allowance, giving only for transport and had to take his meals either packed or eat at home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>2 mths later</strong></p>
              <p><br>The comp factory Ah Beng works in had to close down, because of poor sales. Ah Beng had to join 3000 others applying for only 500 supervisor jobs left in Spore.</p>
              <p><br>Ah Seng's savings dried up, and due to his low education and old age, became an unemployed statistic.<br>John gave up his savings to help out his familly. That too was wiped out, and had to quit school and worked as a packer....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Scenario 2</strong><br>Ah Beng, decides to cut down on his spending to save on a rainy day, but he does not intend to stop giving his family treats. He spends instead $35 on dinner treats and save the balance.</p>
              <p><br>Ah Seng, realizing the economy is not so good, decides to cut prices and not increase charges, rationalize his expenditure to offer still good food to survive. He manages to retain his regular patrons. He did not make good profits, but he manages to keep his stall afloat till sanity returns to the market.</p>
              <p><br>John got to buy a comp, not the high end one, but one equally good,<br>Ah Beng's factory did not have to close down, as there were still orders for computer parts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is only a fictional scenario, but a reality many can relate to and comprehend. Our society, thru its representatives the govt, had spoken. Save but spend what you can, and we will will get thru this difficult times together as one.</p>
              <p><br>Who will save Singapore is - YOU, when you spend rationally, just as your forefathers did in our past difficult national history facing huge odds to survive as a nation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's the simple things  that simple folks can do that can solve the problem. No need to get bankrupt over.<br>Heros are onlyl ordinary people who perform extraordinarily in difficult times. You are the hero, just as your forefather had been in our national history, for what we have today.</p>
