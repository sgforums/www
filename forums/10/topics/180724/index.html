            <div class='col-md body'>I think the government should just disclose the salary structure of the ministers, in the name of transparency and accountability.

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe in europe and america, citizens have the right to know how much their leaders are being paid annually. In England under the Freedom of Information Act, the British population has the right to even view the records of the people Tony Blair entertained at No. 10 Downing Street in the last 6 months. Government minister salaries are totally transparent in England. I don't see any reason why it should not be the same in Singapore.  Singaporeans vote in their leaders, they thus have the right to know how much the leaders are paid as it is the tax payers money we are dealing with. Nothing to be secretive about.</div>
