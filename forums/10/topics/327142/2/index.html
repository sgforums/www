              <p>Singapore – More than 400 foreigners were caught last year for lying to Singapore’s Manpower Ministry in their work pass applications, a fourfold increase from 97 cases in 2005, a media report said on Friday. The majority were said to have used fake or forged qualifications in applying for employment passes, necessary for highly qualified people, or S-Passes, for semi-skilled workers, The Straits Times said.</p>
              <p>A rising trend of workers using qualifications from bogus universities that sell degrees for little or no studies was also detected.</p>
              <p>Making false statements in the applications for work or immigration passes carries stiff penalties, including fines and jail. Foreigners caught are also likely to be repatriated.</p>
              <p>IntegraScreen, which does screening work for immigration authorities in several countries in Asia and the Middle East, said about 5 per cent of the resumes are found to be faked.</p>
              <p>“The use of diploma mills is exploding as the internet makes buying bogus degrees easier than ever before,” managing director John Baxter was quoted as saying.</p>
              <p>“More workers are buying these degrees because they are looking for an edge in the competitive job market,” he noted.</p>
              <p>Most degree mills charge between 50 US dollars and 5,000 US dollars for degrees at all levels. Some provide an after-sale service, with phone operators verifying graduations and sending transcripts to prospective employers.</p>
              <p>David Leong, head of PeopleWorldwide Consulting, told the newspaper that those who purchase their degrees are not victims, but intend to hoodwink employers or business clients.</p>
