Opportunity cost is opportunity cost, no matter who the land belongs to. You obviously saw the very obvious flaw in your argument and tried to head it off. Not working buddy. It could belong to the king of brunei and the land would still incur opportunity cost when you use it to build something.<br><br>2) Never happen? Really? Perhaps I should remind you of the last recession not so long ago. Do you think it was a fluke that Singapore was so mildly affected?<br><br>And yes, a company will always hold cash for emergencies, not distribute everything back to investors. That is perhaps the dumbest thing a company can do. And they aren't charging their shareholders for services. It just happens the shareholders are customers too.

Then would we just build factories, casinos, theme parks, shopping centers without any provision for housing. Opportunity cost is the possible alternative uses for the land, that's all.<br><br>But in my example of each Singaporean being a shareholder, they pay an exhorbitant price for the land in their HDB, the profits in the sale is kept in reserves and not redistributed as dividends to shareholders.<br><br>Makes sense to you?<br><br>2) I suppose the other countries not affected also has the same fat reserves as Singapore?

              <p>1) Huh? You are really something. <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"> I implied
                  this I implied that. May I know which statement cause you to think
                  what I implied whatever I supposedly implied? Who said anything
                  about only the poor receiving dividends? Maybe you can explain to
                  me instead of casting nonsensical questions all over the place.
                  Since when did I mention anything about "real value equates to
                  opportunity cost" or true value? Maybe you can quote me on
                  that?<br> <br> 2) Ermm....I really don't know what to think of you. Sharks and
                  c0ckroaches are living in two different environments. Unlike China,
                  India, Taiwan and Vietnam, they all belong to the Asian continent.
                  It did help when the government had some spare cash, but I do no
                  agree with holding excessive cash at the expense of citizens.<br> <br> So......have you seen the youtube video. Your original statement of
                  "no poor in Singapore". Does it still hold? Was it an error due to
                  lack of sufficient knowledge?</p>
              <p>3) Ermm...I cited Hong Kong because despite it being in
                  communist control, it provided good healthcare to it's citizens,
                  it's not a better system than Australia or New Zealand. But if you
                  wanted an overall comparison, then maybe you want to use Australia
                  or New Zealand. If you want to persist with Hong Kong, please
                  proceed.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1)Well if it's quotes you want, quotes you'll get.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"<strong> There is opportunity cost, but what if one day (just an example),
                                          land prices were to soar till it's not affordable by the poor? Then
                                          would we just build factories, casinos, theme parks, shopping
                                          centers without any provision for housing. Opportunity cost is the
                                          possible alternative uses for the land, that's all."</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's what you said, right?</p>
              <p>And in case your english is not as good as I presumed, I should remind you that it was I who said real value equates opportunity cost. You on the other hand seem to think opportunity cost is just a phrase, with no correlation to value.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here's another one:</p>
              <p>"<strong> But in my example of each Singaporean being a shareholder, they pay
                                          an exhorbitant price for the land in their HDB, the profits in the
                                          sale is kept in reserves and not redistributed as dividends to
                                          shareholders."</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>they pay an exhorbitant price? Like i said, knowing it is exhorbitant IMPLIES you know the true value of the land. How else can you know it is "exhorbitant"? Unless you KNOW the price of the land like you IMPLY, how can you be so sure no discount was actually made? Just because the price of property is high does not mean it is overpriced. Simple economics really.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Ok, so sharks and cockroaches live in different conditions. My point was the fallacy of correlations. But let's run with this approach you have chosen. Apart from being in the same region as Singapore, the countries you have listed have practically nothing in common with it. And while we're on the subject of proximity being important in comparisons, do you not realise that countries closer to Singapore than the ones you listed were hit hard as well? If you want to make an argument based on region, you will have to include them too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) It appears you still have not chosen the country you desire, so let's give you a little push. I just came back from hong kong. I am now capable 100% of saying that hong kong is not better off than Singapore. Streets are dirty, transport is crowded, and living standards nowhere close to the quality here. Would you like to choose another country for 1 on 1 comparison? As always, I'm happy to comply.</p>

              <p>Well, I can but try to enlighten you. Simply put, those figures mean pretty much nothing. But I suspect you already know that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take a Universtiy classroom for instance. Would you rather attend a college that had an average of 100 students to a teacher, or 40 to a teacher? Does it mean the lecturer that takes on 100 students is more effecient? Or that the University is better, having enough resources to invest in it's classrooms?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You will also indulge me, of course, when I point out the readily obvious economies of scale. A country of population 100,000 will probably still need a core of at least 20 ministers. Does that make the ministers ineffecient, or simply a victim of fixed costs?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The astute reader no doubt has already realised that the countries listed there all have a greater population than Singapore. It's not about effeciency. It's the fact that a governance requires a minimum skeleton crew, and smaller countries obviously will have a bigger governance size to population ratio. It shocks me that you don't realise that. Or perhaps you already did, and was hoping I didn't.</p>
              <p>Let's take a look at small countries, shall we?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to Wikipedia, there are a few countries that have the similar population sizes as Singapore. Let's just take 3:</p>
