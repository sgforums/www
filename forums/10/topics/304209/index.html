(See report, above.)<br><br>CONVENIENT<br><br>Mr Liu is not alone. Other taxi commuters also told The New Paper on Sunday that they have bought or plan to buy cars after the recent taxi fare hike.<br><br>He said: 'I have been thinking of buying a car for a long time, and the taxi fare hikes just confirmed my decision.'<br><br>Mr Liu, who has to take cabs very often for work, said that before the fare hike, his monthly transport costs came to about $300.<br><br>He said: 'After the hike, I would spend about $500 on taxi fares.<br><br>'If I add up the amount my girlfriend and I spend on transport, I'll have enough to not only pay for my monthly instalment, I can even cover some of my petrol costs.'<br><br>Mr Liu pays $500 in monthly instalments for his Honda Fit which he bought in December for $59,000.<br><br>He agrees that taxis may still be cheaper because of the additional money he has to cough up for petrol, parking and maintaining his car.<br><br>But he says the added comfort and convenience makes it worthwhile.<br><br>Mr Liu said: 'With a car, it's easier for me and my family to get around, and I can even drop my girlfriend off, so she can also save on the cab fare.'<br><br>Another commuter, who wanted to be known only as Mrs Ng, said she had 'no choice' but to buy a car.<br><br>Mrs Ng, 36, a financial controller who works in Changi, said: 'With the peak hour charges and the morning jam on the TPE, my fare will come close to $30.'<br><br>Mrs Ng, who also bought a Honda Fit in December, said: 'For me, driving a car is cheaper than taking taxis.<br><br>'Previously, I always had to call for a cab, because I live in Sengkang and taxi drivers do not like to come here.<br><br>'Now, with a car of my own, I can go anywhere.'<br><br>Some car dealers also said the fare hike has pushed customers to them.<br><br>Mr Sam Lim, 34, Mr Liu's car dealer, said: 'Out of 10 customers, at least two tell me that they are buying a car because of the taxi fare hikes.'<br><br>Mr Paul Ng, general manager of Vertex Automobile, the authorised dealer for the Chery QQ, said this was because it is 'cheaper to own a car now than to take a taxi, especially since the monthly instalments can be as low as $300'.<br><br>And though there has been no across-the-board increase in demand for cars since the taxi fares went up, some dealers said sales had gone up.<br><br>A sales executive who wanted to be known only as Mr Chua said: 'Just over the last two months, I have sold 22 cars.<br><br>'Together with my colleagues, we have sold more than 60 cars, which is twice the usual number we sell at this time of the year. I believe this is because of the taxi fare hike.'<br><br>His company sold 30 to 40 cars over December and January in previous years.<br><br>Another assistant sales manager, who declined to be named, said two of his customers decided to buy a car because of the taxi fare hike.<br><br>He said: 'They make long journeys, so it's better for them to buy cars instead of taking taxis. Smaller cars are popular with them because of the low fuel consumption.'<br><br>Sales manager Clifford Ng, 29, agreed. He said: 'Transportation costs are getting so high, it just makes more sense to buy a car, which can cost only $30,000 to $40,000.<br><br>'If a person takes a taxi every day, his transport can work out to $900 a month. Compared with this, the $450 monthly instalment for a car like the Hyundai Getz is worthwhile.'<br><br>However, not all car dealers are seeing a switch to cars from taxis.<br><br>Mr George Lee, 36, sales manager at Alpine Motors, an authorised dealer for Chevrolet cars in Singapore, feels this may be because a large majority of those who take cabs do not have driving licences.<br><br>Other dealers also felt that most people would exercise more caution when it comes to buying cars.<br><br>Mr Sam Lim, 33, director of Carz Junction said: 'Although the monthly instalment is only about $500, it's burden you have to shoulder for 10years,' he said.<br><br>'Furthermore, petrol costs are so high now. If your job is not stable, I think you should not buy a car.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Taxi<br>Average cost per trip from Yishun to Orchard Road after fare hike: $20<br>Number of trips a day: 2<br>Number of working days a month: 20<br>Monthly transport cost: $800<br><br>Chevrolet Spark<br>Cost: $43,000<br>Fuel consumption: 17.8 km/litre<br>Monthly instalment: $429<br>Monthly petrol: $210<br>Insurance and road tax (per month): $140<br>Monthly transport cost: $779<br><br>Honda Fit<br>Cost: $60,000<br>Fuel consumption: 14 km/l<br>Monthly instalment: $625<br>Monthly petrol: $270<br>Insurance and road tax (per month): $140<br>Monthly transport cost: $1,035<br><br>Chery QQ<br>Cost: $32,000<br>Fuel consumption: 14 km/l<br>Monthly instalment (using 10 year loan): $313<br>Monthly petrol: $270<br>Insurance and road tax (per month): $140<br>Monthly transport cost: $723<br><br></div>

Beat driving ard hunting for customer. Hope the booking fees is as low as up to 50 cents only. and user can do it via a few click on a free downloadable software on any phone.<br><br>But think comfort is gona kill us if we release it out here.</div>
