And you guys complain about the local propaganda.</div></blockquote>If you think it's nonsense, you can choose to ignore it, nobody will complain that you are dumb. Whether it's logical or illogical, I don't think you as an opponent has any unbias judgement, because all the time you are trying very hard to discredit me. Don't worry, I won't discredit you by claiming you sprout nonsense without any proof. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>If you haven't figured out already, the "they" was meant to be the executive decision making body like our PM. Responsibilities of both leaders differ? I suppose our PM has more duties than the President of USA (who not only deals with local US issues, he also has to deal with international issues like Middle East, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Russia, China).<br><br>Sony and GE? What you quote are profit making organisations, the sole motive is to make lots of money for their shareholders. Are the responsibilities of the government to syphon money from it's citizen so as to maintain high surpluses? Or is it to ensure that all of her citizens maintain a decent moral standard of living?<br><br>Balance of trade has no significance here. Why you may ask? There is no point accumulating all those huge surpluses when all those surpluses will never ever be distributed to the citizens. Has the trade surpluse benifited the local Singaporeans? If they had used the interest from the surplus to supplement our medical services or public housing. Do you think that our housing and medical cost would be so high. Take a look at the cost of public hospital charges in Hong Kong (prices are based in Hong Kong Dollars, so you have to divide by 5.43 [SGD 1 = HKD 5.43]) How come Hong Kong can afford cheaper healthcare to her citizens? SGD 18 for A&amp;E consultation in Hong Kong, Inpatient (general accute beds) SGD 20. How much is the A&amp;E consultation in any Singapore hospitals?<br><br><img src="http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb312/maurizio13/HospitalAuthority4.png"><br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.ha.org.hk/hesd/nsapi/?MIval=ha_visitor_index&amp;intro=ha%5fview%5ftemplate%26group%3dOSR%26Area%3dHNI&amp;lang=E" rel="nofollow">http://www.ha.org.hk/hesd/nsapi/?MIval=ha_visitor_index&amp;intro=ha%5fview%5ftemplate%26group%3dOSR%26Area%3dHNI&amp;lang=E</a><br><br>It's like being a shareholder in a corporation, the CEO of the corporation keeps building up surpluses with no intention of distributing those surpluses as dividends back to her shareholders. The shareholders can't cash out by selling their shares because the company is not a publicly listed company on the stock exchange. I should make you invest in my company as a major shareholder, I make lots of profits but don't pay you any dividends, I will just give you the excuse that we need to keep reserves in case of economic crisis. I will just keep building on the reserves and don't pay you dividends.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Most publicly listed corporation will retain the profits, if they have reinvestment opportunities that will earn a rate of return higher than the cost of capital for the shareholders. But most of our returns are below market rates, the only companies with good returns are those who have oligopolistic and monopolistic power structure. Why do you think that there are accusations of anti-competitive practices in their investments overseas (e.g. Indonesia &amp; Thailand)?<br><br>You mean throughout the whole world (e.g. Norway, Sweden, Finland, Japan, USA, Ireland, Germany), our ministers all work 5-6 times as hard as those equivalent ministers there? Maybe you can tell me what our ministers do that is so different from other politicians in other countries?<br><br>Half truths? Please tell me what half truths did I make so I can clarify with you.</div>

A classic example would be a millionaire going to a billionaire's party, he looks around, everybody drives a Ferrari, Lamborghini, Mclaren and Porsche. So he concludes that everybody in the country is as rich as those billionaires. Then your same millionaire would go to a posh shopping area, he notices that alot of people are buying up ostentatious goods. The millionaire therefore concludes that the citizens in this country are all billionaires.<br><br>Is your experience a clear and honest representation of the whole population? Or is it only based on certain segments of the population, the segment which you are a part of. Remember, whatever you feel comfortable with, does not necessarily mean everybody feels comfortable with it, else there won't me so many disgruntled people in here.

            <div class='col-md body'>3) EVERYONE FLY IN FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD? FYI, 3rd world countries in Asia does not qualify as "ALL OVER THE WORLD". I can't deny that RICH citizens in other countries such as, Burma, Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia comes over to Singapore fore treatment. But that would hardly justify your reasoning of "ALL OVER THE WORLD". In terms of quality of healthcare, Singapore is leaps and bounds ahead of these 3rd world countries. What makes you certain that Hong Kong is lacking in it's healthcare industry, it was just reported in the news that Hong Kong's maternity wards are overbooked due to Chinese mainlanders opting for birth in Hong Kong.<br><br>Another issue about medical resources used in medical tourism (used to treat foreigners), it drives up the cost of healthcare. If supply is limited and demand is high, this will drive up the cost of healthcare. More demand for medical services from foreigners and quota intake in NUS / NUH.<br><br>If you compare the amount of subsidies the citizens from Hong Kong receives with Singapore. You would know how deprive we are.<br><br><img src="http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb312/maurizio13/HongKongHealthSystempresentation3.png"><br><br>Source: <a href="http://healthpolicy.stanford.edu/GHP/New%20Folder/Hong%20Kong%20Health%20System%20presentation.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://healthpolicy.stanford.edu/GHP/New%20Folder/Hong%20Kong%20Health%20System%20presentation.pdf</a><br><br>If you choose to bring up all those other points for comparison. Please do so, as I have other points to bring up too. Public housing is comparable to Singapore, because their definition of public housing is different from Singapore's. Public housing should be subsidized for those who cannot afford private housing, but Singapore's definition is way different. Above 80% of Singaporeans live in public housing, so does it mean that these 80% are below average income? Public housing should be subsidized to help the poor unlike HDB policy of insisting a profit for their services.<br><br>You can claim that the land that the HDB uses to build it's PUBLIC HOUSING has alternative uses, like leasing to multinationals to build their factories to provide jobs, so on and so forth.<br><br>But a question that all Singaporeans and yourself have to ask yourself is. Who are the true and ultimate owners of Singapore? To whom does Singapore belong to?<br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><br>If Singapore belongs to her citizens, then ask yourself this.<br><br>In a company where the owners are the shareholders, where each hold a single and equivalent share in the company. The company has the interest of the shareholder at heart and all profits derived from the company will be paid out to the shareholders.<br><br>Does it make sense to charge an exhorbitant profit for a service they provide to shareholders and keeping all those profits without distributing these profits back to shareholders? All in the name of building reserves for future doomsday cataclysmic business cycle, which will never happen.<br><br>Maybe Singapore belongs to the government only.<br></span><br><br>I used USA to provide some stark comparisons between the GDP and the salary received by the leaders, I am not comparing all the issues surrounding the country. If you want to use countries to do a thorough comparison. Why not choose Finland, Denmark, Swiss (which our eminent leader once aspired to reach), Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, Sweden, Belgium, Austria and Ireland. Like I said before, you cannot strive for improvement if you keep comparing yourself to monkeys, choose someone higher up the scale for comparison.<br><br>continue next page</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>4) Then you failed to understand what is interest and dividends. An interest is what is paid for the use of the money for a certain period. A dividend is paid from the profits a business makes. Other countries don't need to provide services such as tree pruning, road maintenance and garbage emptying? Having cash is important, nobody can disagree with that. But is having an enormous sum of cash at the expense of the shareholders good.<br><br>5) A business has to be profitable in order to survive, if a business makes too many investments which deviates from the budget, it will not survive.

A classic example would be a millionaire going to a billionaire's party, he looks around, everybody drives a Ferrari, Lamborghini, Mclaren and Porsche. So he concludes that everybody in the country is as rich as those billionaires. Then your same millionaire would go to a posh shopping area, he notices that alot of people are buying up ostentatious goods. The millionaire therefore concludes that the citizens in this country are all billionaires.<br><br>Is your experience a clear and honest representation of the whole population? Or is it only based on certain segments of the population, the segment which you are a part of. Remember, whatever you feel comfortable with, does not necessarily mean everybody feels comfortable with it, else there won't me so many disgruntled people in here.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by maurizio13:</div><div class="quote_body">3) EVERYONE FLY IN FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD? FYI, 3rd world countries in Asia does not qualify as "ALL OVER THE WORLD". I can't deny that RICH citizens in other countries such as, Burma, Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia comes over to Singapore fore treatment. But that would hardly justify your reasoning of "ALL OVER THE WORLD". In terms of quality of healthcare, Singapore is leaps and bounds ahead of these 3rd world countries. What makes you certain that Hong Kong is lacking in it's healthcare industry, it was just reported in the news that Hong Kong's maternity wards are overbooked due to Chinese mainlanders opting for birth in Hong Kong.<br><br>Another issue about medical resources used in medical tourism (used to treat foreigners), it drives up the cost of healthcare. If supply is limited and demand is high, this will drive up the cost of healthcare. More demand for medical services from foreigners and quota intake in NUS / NUH.[/quote]<br><br>You seem to have settled on hong kong. Fine.I have already conceded medical care quality difference is marginal. You're just stalling here, trying to gain value from a case I've already conceded. Are you that desperate?<br><br><blockquote>If you compare the amount of subsidies the citizens from Hong Kong receives with Singapore. You would know how deprive we are.<br><br>If you choose to bring up all those other points for comparison. Please do so, as I have other points to bring up too. Public housing is comparable to Singapore, because their definition of public housing is different from Singapore's. Public housing should be subsidized for those who cannot afford private housing, but Singapore's definition is way different. Above 80% of Singaporeans live in public housing, so does it mean that these 80% are below average income? Public housing should be subsidized to help the poor unlike HDB policy of insisting a profit for their services.<br><br>You can claim that the land that the HDB uses to build it's PUBLIC HOUSING has alternative uses, like leasing to multinationals to build their factories to provide jobs, so on and so forth.<br><br>But a question that all Singaporeans and yourself have to ask yourself is. Who are the true and ultimate owners of Singapore? To whom does Singapore belong to?</blockquote>I find it wierd that you first complain Singapore does not take care of it's people's needs...then turn around and complain that practically everyone gets a subsidy on a HDB. So you would rather HDB save it's resources for the really poor and give a huge subsidy, nevermind the rest of the population?<br><br>Stop setting up strawman arguments. Opportunity cost is opportunity cost, no matter who the land belongs to. You obviously saw the very obvious flaw in your argument and tried to head it off. Not working buddy. It could belong to the king of brunei and the land would still incur opportunity cost when you use it to build something.<br><br><blockquote><span style="color: darkred;"><br>If Singapore belongs to her citizens, then ask yourself this.<br><br>In a company where the owners are the shareholders, where each hold a single and equivalent share in the company. The company has the interest of the shareholder at heart and all profits derived from the company will be paid out to the shareholders.<br><br>Does it make sense to charge an exhorbitant profit for a service they provide to shareholders and keeping all those profits without distributing these profits back to shareholders? All in the name of building reserves for future doomsday cataclysmic business cycle, which will never happen.</span></blockquote>Never happen? Really? Perhaps I should remind you of the last recession not so long ago. Do you think it was a fluke that Singapore was so mildly affected?<br><br>And yes, a company will always hold cash for emergencies, not distribute everything back to investors. That is perhaps the dumbest thing a company can do. And they aren't charging their shareholders for services. It just happens the shareholders are customers too. Much like you don't begrudge paying for coffee at starbucks, even when you own a few lots of it.<br><br>[quote]Maybe Singapore belongs to the government only.<br><br><br>I used USA to provide some stark comparisons between the GDP and the salary received by the leaders, I am not comparing all the issues surrounding the country. If you want to use countries to do a thorough comparison. Why not choose Finland, Denmark, Swiss (which our eminent leader once aspired to reach), Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, Sweden, Belgium, Austria and Ireland. Like I said before, you cannot strive for improvement if you keep comparing yourself to monkeys, choose someone higher up the scale for comparison.<br><br>continue next page</div></blockquote>I thought you settled on Hong Kong. My mistake. Please choose again.</div>

Maybe you can show me a small cap company CEO earning more than a large cap company CEO? Please list them. I doubt you are able to, you are just shooting blanks. Also your use of hedge fund is illogical, because hedge funds aren't listed in the stock exchange, their CEO isn't nominated by the shareholders. Hedge funds are nothing more than punting houses.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund" rel="nofollow"><br>A hedge fund is a private investment fund that charges a performance fee and is typically open to only a limited range of qualified investors. Hedge fund activity in the public securities markets has grown substantially as it constitutes approximately 30% of all U.S. fixed-income security transactions, 55% of U.S. activity in derivatives with investment-grade ratings, 55% of the trading volume for emerging-market bonds, as well as 30% of equity trades. Hedge Funds dominate certain specialty markets such as trading in derivatives with high-yield ratings, and distressed debt.[1]<br></a><br><br>If you choose to use hedge funds to make a comparison, then perhaps you should use Bermuda as a comparison. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda" rel="nofollow">Bermuda's GDP per capita is US$76,403, [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore]many times over Singapore's US$30,723.</a> How much is the Minister in Bermuda paid as compared to Ministers in Singapore?<br><br>2) Please.....you don't understand what is an analogy? I doubt you can be a millionaire much less a billionaire with you kind of understanding, you can only be a follower. What I meant was, you observation is not a true representation of the population of Singapore. You conclude that just because you went to travel agency to book tickets for trips, you couldn't get tickets, it means that all Singaporeans are rich and flying overseas for holiday. That observation is only a selection of everybody travelling overseas. What if one goes to Bugis / Sungei area and sees lots of beggars and old folks picking up drinks cans from garbage? Does it mean that everybody in Singapore are beggars and can salvager? Moreover the flights in and out of Singapore is not only restricted to Singaporeans. There are lots of foreign students and foreign professionals residing in Singapore, perhaps another reason why flights are fully booked. I am not saying that there are no Singaporeans going overseas for holidays during the SCHOOL holiday period, but your analysis is not a clear representation of the population of Singaporeans.<br><br>Where are the beggars? Go over goddess of mercy temple near middle road / bugis area. I just went over Sim Lim to get DVD writer 2 days ago, while walking to Sim Lim, I saw two different old folks salvaging used drink cans from the rubbish bin. You really need to go out more, not only going out to those high class areas, but the lower class areas too. Then perhaps you will get a better picture of the ground, no point for you to sit in your ivory tower claiming that no poverty and crime exist in Singapore.<br><br>A youtube video of the poor and homeless: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-guxHFyz2A" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-guxHFyz2A</a><br><br>I think you would dispute the video as being fake, since it suits your argument and logic.<br><br>You remind me of this old chinese proverb about a cow with a bell, the cow covered it's ear thinking that if she can't hear the sound of the bells nobody else could hear it.</div>
