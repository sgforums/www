Hardly.<br><br>And it's always typical of people to use the contemptous snipe that if you can't get into parliament, don't waste time complaining here.<br><br>So are you suggesting that <span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>only MPs have the right to raise issues</strong></span></span>? Or that <span style="color: indigo;"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">only MPs are raising the issues that MATTER</span></strong></span>? Or worst: <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>politics are only for MPs</strong></span></span>? [/b]</blockquote>Would appreciate if you don't get too emotional about this.<br><br>Firstly, just wanted to highlight that it is inappropriate to compare the installation of full ministership with electing people as Member of Parliaments. While there can be Acting Ministers, you cannot possibly have Acting MPs.<br><br>Secondly, I am not suggesting anything about only MPs having the righ tto raise issues. There is a place for everything - the need to raise issues at the right platform. I agree that our system is not perfect, and neither do I feel our system is worthy of our pride. Besides,  to be proud or not -  it's up to individuals.</div>

While there can be Acting Ministers, you cannot possibly have Acting MPs.<br><br>Secondly, I am not suggesting anything about only MPs having the righ tto raise issues. There is a place for everything - the need to raise issues at the right platform. I agree that our system is not perfect, and neither do I feel our system is worthy of our pride.

Are you trying to mitigiate your position by stretching the idea 'acting MPs' now?<br><br>Are you familiar with the NMP system? These nominated people are potential MP candidates and are unveiled by the Ruling Party to condition the minds of Singaporeans that such people may become future MPs. Simultaneously, they serve in their capacity as dictated by the party, to assess their quality and determine if they are indeed MP-material.</div>
