Why do people just blame everything on the government? <strong>Singapore is not made up of 100% government companies</strong>, so the government does not control your income. There are so many MNCs around. Your income is determined by your personal working ability and qualifications. Do not blame it on the government.

If ministers were paid peanuts, no one would want to volunteer to become one and there is bound to be high levels of corruption in the government.<br><br>Freakass,<br><br>this is some of my vlews to rebut your points. You claim that the opposotions capitalise on the issue of our minister's salary to make ppls vote for them.<br>Yes, it is true that having a huge fat paycheck is a way to prevent corruption,......BUT wat type of ppls are u gonna attract? I tell u, it is the SALARY MEN. They type of ppls that just want to have connections, earn prestige and help them springboard into the government owned enterprises as some high ranking ppls. Serving ppls should be one that is done out of passion, out of love and concern to the general well-being of the nation. When you earn a high pay check, you will choose to live in private estates and lock yourself up in the ivory tower and choose to 'imagine ' the problems of the ppls, instead of really understanding their worries. Just look at our MP in white seating for parliament, ,most of them are either looking around feeling bored, some are caught dozing off, you really will question their sincerity and lvl of interest in serving the ppls. When ask upon their views of the issue, they will just go " Yes, Yes......!!" WHY? "Because our heavenly LKY said so, so must say yes......." All this is just gerrymandering. Ironically, most of the time, i it is the oppostion that are questioning the government. For example, Steve Chia, went on to harp on the defense minister to release the figures of those that died during NS. It was then ppls knoe of the high death rate was mainly due to some reason........., if not, many ppls esp the foreigners will think our NS is a walk in the garden.<br><br>Personally, I believe that a multi party system in which the views of Singaporeans from all walks of live and background is good for our country. Yes, PAP will always boast abt their MBA, PHD, harvard, cambridge scholar candidates, but seriously does education lvl tally with the ability to serve the ppls? Yes they may be academic geniuses but do they really understand the problems of the heartlanders? Can they apply their knowledge from txtbks to solve the daily problems the ppls face? Most importantly, are they willing to walk around to interact with ppls from time to time or will they choose to do that onli when it is election time?</div>

In the process, application forms contain brief information about whether they have commited offences in the past. Now, tell me if the opposition candidates have presented themselves well enough, and whether they have put themselves across well enough to Singaporeans to deserve a seat in the Parliament.

It is up to Singaporeans to effect changes if they have the courage and the capability. Singapore is a very young country - in time to come, if enough people are able to prove themselves as effective and capable members of parliament with alternative voices, Singapore can also evolve to be like US or other western countries. Again, it is not appropriate to compare Singapore with other western systems. Good to have them as benchmark, but we need to work hard to be like them.<br><br>For those who keep complaining about the government in forums, why don't you stand for election as an opposition candidate and prove that Singapore can be like the western systems sooner than expected?<br><br></div>
