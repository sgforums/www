Unless there is a probation period for new MPs as well.<br><br>Two, a candidate is employed to go through the probation period because he or she reflected and performed well during the interview. In the process, application forms contain brief information about whether they have commited offences in the past. Now, tell me if the opposition candidates have presented themselves well enough, and whether they have put themselves across well enough to Singaporeans to deserve a seat in the Parliament. Mr Chiam is respectable because he earned his seat in Parliament. Mr Low had also risen to the occasion.<br><br>Now, please stop complaining about no democracy because there are only 2 miserable opposition seats in the Parliament. It is up to Singaporeans to effect changes if they have the courage and the capability. Singapore is a very young country - in time to come, if enough people are able to prove themselves as effective and capable members of parliament with alternative voices, Singapore can also evolve to be like US or other western countries. Again, it is not appropriate to compare Singapore with other western systems. Good to have them as benchmark, but we need to work hard to be like them.<br><br>For those who keep complaining about the government in forums, why don't you stand for election as an opposition candidate and prove that Singapore can be like the western systems sooner than expected?<br><br></div></blockquote>Khaw Boon Wan and Tharman Sharmugaratnam served as <span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>ACTING</strong></span> health minister and education minister respectively for 6 months before they were installed as <strong><span style="color: red;">FULL</span></strong> ministers.<br><br>If that is not a probational period, then what would you call it?<br><br>Yes we have out own system of government but should we be proud of it?

            <div class='col-md body'>you decide<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Wednesday, July 06, 2005<br>Devan Nair<br>Globe and Mail. Canada. March 29, 1999<br>BY Marcus Gee<br><br>IN the Singapore of the early 1980s, Lee Kuan Yew was the captain and Devan Nair his loyal lieutenant. Mr Lee, independence leader, then prime minister and now senior minister of the tiny Southeast Asian city-state, laid down the law. Mr Nair followed it. As head of the national trade union congress, then president of Singapore, he loyally parroted the "LKY" line on the importance of social order, the dangers of Western-style democracy and the evils of littering.<br><br>Then, in 1985, came a shocking break. Mr Lee told Singapore's parliament that Mr Nair had resigned because he was an alcoholic, a charge Mr Nair now calls a baseless slur. Three years later, he left Singapore for good after publicly quarrelling with Mr Lee over the arrest of a well-known government critic. Then he dropped from sight.<br><br>For the past few years, Mr Nair has been living quietly in Hamilton, Ontario. He has given no interviews and made few public statements. "I thought it was unseemly for a former president to go whacky-whacking his country," he says.<br><br>Those days of silence are over Mr Nair has decided to speak out against the continuing suppression of legitimate dissent in his country. And so, last week, he sat down in the sun-lit drawing room of a friend's house near Hamilton to talk about Lee Kuan Yew, how they drew apart and what he thinks of Mr Lee's Singapore today.<br><br>Now 75, Mr Nair is a compact man with a mischievous smile. Sipping a glass of water, he speaks in a plummy baritone that commands attention.<br><br>Mr Nair got to know his "captain" when the two were fighting to free Singapore from British colonial rule in the 1950s. A teacher whose father emigrated from India, Mr Nair taught Shakespeare while he was a member of the Anti-British League, an irony he still savours. When the British threw him in jail as a subversive, holding him for a total of five years, Mr Lee was his lawyer.<br><br>The two remained close after Singapore won its freedom from Britain. Together, they fought off an attempted communist takeover, weathered Singapore's ejection from the neighbouring federation of Malaysia and transformed their country from a run-down sea port to an economic dynamo bristling with skyscrapers. "I supported him because he was an eloquent champion of the dreams I had for Singapore," Mr Nair says.<br><br>But as Singapore grew prosperous and stable and the communist threat faded, Mr Nair began to have doubts about his captain's iron-fisted methods. Perhaps sensing his ally's doubts, Mr Lee asked Mr Nair to leave his power base as head of the trade union congress and move into the presidential palace. As Mr Nair puts it, "He kicked me upstairs."<br><br>Being president, he says now, was "the silliest job in the world. All you had to do was cut ribbons." His frustration grew.<br><br>But before he could speak out, Mr Nair found himself at the centre of a rumour-mongering campaign that labelled him a drinker and womanizer. He says he was neither, and he suspects that Mr Lee had government doctors slip him hallucinatory drugs to make him appear befuddled. "Lee Kuan Yew decided: This man is going to be a threat, so I'd better begin a total demolishment of his character. He's very good at that."<br><br>A case in point: the recent battering of Singapore's most determined dissident, J. B. Jeyaretnam. Singapore doesn't lock up its critics any more; it sues them, instead. Mr Jeyaretnam has faced countless libel suits from Mr Lee and other members of his government. If the party doesn't pay the damages in the most recent suit, the government hints it will ask the courts to shut it down, a move that would oust Mr Jeyaretnam from parliament.<br><br>That, says Mr Nair, is an outrage. Mr Jeyaretnam has shown "indomitable courage and dignity in the face of the vilest persecution."<br><br>Why didn't Mr Nair challenge his leader at the time? That question has haunted him ever since. "I was prone to hero worship and he was our captain," he says, lowering his head. "Even when I began to feel uneasy, loyalty to the captain superseded all other feelings. That was my weakness."<br><br>Mr Nair is not bitter. He gives Mr Lee credit for making Singapore a wealthy, stable place, an accomplishment in which he is proud to have shared. But how much greater that accomplishment would be if Singapore were a wealthy stable democracy. To him, Singapore today is a soulless place whose only ideology is materialism. Whether he could have changed that, Mr Nair wishes now he had spoken up earlier.<br><br><a href="http://jaundicedlenses.blogspot.com/2005/07/devan-nair.html" rel="nofollow">http://jaundicedlenses.blogspot.com/2005/07/devan-nair.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Over in Australia, PM John Howard is always questioned by the opposition leader and the media. Though some of his policies are not welcomed by everybody, he did rise up to the challenge and answer their questions for his government's actions. Sometimes he manages to convince everyone, somtimes he does not.<br>But the end of the day, he earns the respect from evrybody because at least he answers for his decision and takes the challenges from opposition and media and most of all, his people.</div>
