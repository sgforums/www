As long as the PAP does something which doesnt seem to benefit individuals directly or obviously, they shoot the PAP. These people, which are the majority, do not see the big picture. You have to ask yourself whether the actions taken by the PAP benefit the nation as a whole? Only when there is progress and stability in a nation can the government pay more attention to the individual needs. I feel that they are already trying their best to strike a balance between the two. Opposition parties, on the other hand, try to wind support by promising to do this and that for the individuals, but is it really possible to carry out the promised actions when they really take over? There are many other factors to consider you know? It's not as simple as "My residents need a playground. I'll get it done tomorrow." The opposition parties also tend to argue that the ministers' salaries are way too high, but I feel that this is a must to prevent corruption. If ministers were paid peanuts, no one would want to volunteer to become one and there is bound to be high levels of corruption in the government.<br><br></div></blockquote>so to counter corruption (which is illegal), we pay them high salary (Which is legal corruption)?<br><br>MPs who are elected get about $11k a month as allowance, when they do this part-time and still can hold their full-time jobs. Normal singaporeans, on the other hand, cannot moonlight, coz it wil affect their fulltime jobs. Double standards I feel.<br><br>Who told you that politics is a career? Only in Singapore do we get people who 'serve' the country and make it a career. Go look at USA. They really serve the country. Small country like ours pay our ministers higher salaries than even USA. So ridiculous.</div>
