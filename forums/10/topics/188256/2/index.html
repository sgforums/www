            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes I feel that many Singaporeans are very narrow-minded. As long as the PAP does something which doesnt seem to benefit individuals directly or obviously, they shoot the PAP. These people, which are the majority, do not see the big picture. You have to ask yourself whether the actions taken by the PAP benefit the nation as a whole? Only when there is progress and stability in a nation can the government pay more attention to the individual needs. I feel that they are already trying their best to strike a balance between the two. Opposition parties, on the other hand, try to wind support by promising to do this and that for the individuals, but is it really possible to carry out the promised actions when they really take over? There are many other factors to consider you know? It's not as simple as "My residents need a playground. I'll get it done tomorrow." The opposition parties also tend to argue that the ministers' salaries are way too high, but I feel that this is a must to prevent corruption. If ministers were paid peanuts, no one would want to volunteer to become one and there is bound to be high levels of corruption in the government.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding the term tht LKY used on the opposition parties, I'm sure he meant no harm. Come on lah, when you guys get emotional, dont u use strong words too? And you guys jolly well know that sometimes we dont exactly mean what we say, as in we dont use terms down to the exact details of its meaning right?<br><br>I realise that the older generation has a trend of talking bad about LKY but most of them still voted for him. I think this has become just a mouth habit. Talking bad about LKY just comes naturally, but it's just for chat's sake.<br><br>Not to mention about the petty little issues, just open your eyes and look at Singapore now. Who made it the way it is? The PAP did... Would the opposition parties who promise you better lifts for your block or things as such, be able to achieve this? I wouldnt say no, but the fact is that the PAP did it already and this proves their calibre already!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yupz... sometimes the way they do things is not necessarily the best way to go about doing it.. I still encourage that we have our own opinions about how the government is run but think before you do or say anything... Do we have to go to the extreme of replacing PAP and risk the current stability that we're enjoying now? Or do we just need to give constructive feedback to the PAP? In short, think of the gravity of your actions!</div>

These people, which are the majority, do not see the big picture.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">I would like to think that the majority of singaporeans(PAP supporters, gng by the poll results) are the one that is not seeing the big picture. Is economic success the key measurement to everything? I would like to think that we are more than that. If I gave u a million dollars and ask u to stop toking for the rest of ur life, would u do it? gng by the logic of PAP supporters, many of them would.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </span><br><br>You have to ask yourself whether the actions taken by the PAP benefit the nation as a whole?<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Again, benifits are measured only in an economic sense. Even then, is the nation as a whole benifiting, or isit jus a select few of the elites that benefits? If the nation as a whole has benefitted, why the increasing income gap between the rich and the poor??</span><br><br>Only when there is progress and stability in a nation can the government pay more attention to the individual needs. I feel that they are already trying their best to strike a balance between the two.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">How have they been doing that? by offering u upgrading? wat abt individuals in opp wards? they are not singaporeans lah, nv pay tax ah?</span><br><br>Opposition parties, on the other hand, try to wind support by promising to do this and that for the individuals, but is it really possible to carry out the promised actions when they really take over?<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">we wouldnt actually know until they are given a chance, or at least given a level playing field to showcase what they can do before we make a choice. Its just like gng for a job interview and the boss keep asking u tat cos u are a fresh grad, how can i know u can do the job that my old guard is doing? u have to give me a chance to show u mah</span><br><br>There are many other factors to consider you know? It's not as simple as "My residents need a playground. I'll get it done tomorrow." The opposition parties also tend to argue that the ministers' salaries are way too high, but I feel that this is a must to prevent corruption. If ministers were paid peanuts, no one would want to volunteer to become one and there is bound to be high levels of corruption in the government.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">wat happen to altruism? giving for ur country? the pride n honour in serving? precisely becos the govt kept ingraining in us the impt of $$$$, of economic success, that we cannot even trust that there would be someone that is not working for the sake of $$$. Did MM Lee and his cabinet have a hefty paycheck back then? Are they corrupted? If they are not, it means that low paycheck does not = corruption, if they are... well...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span><br></div></blockquote></div>
