Nobody said that the opposition is going to form the government. What I want is for them to gain experience and maybe after 2 or 3 elections take over from the PAP.

            <div class='col-md body'>With regards to the low unployment rate, I am not sure whether the report below is relevant. Unemployment rate also includes the foreign labourers and workers. So using some simple maths, you can work out that the overall unemployment percentage will drop. However, this rate does not include the unemployment rate for the locals!<br><br>http://www.mom.gov.sg/PressRoom/PressReleases/20060201+Employmentsituationinfourthquarter.htm<br><br>Whenever I make comparisons, I prefer to compare apples with apples, not apples with oranges. By comparing Singapore with Indonesia, Somalia, etc, basically you are being unfair. Should the Brazilian footballers feel thankful for their high football standard after comparing the state of Singapore football? Or should they continue to improve themselves? The PAP tried to benchmark Singapore to Switzerland's living standards. So how far have we reached?<br><br>The majority of the forumners here support the opposition because we would like them to check on the PAP. I have to admit, they do not have the quality of the PAP candidates, and I still prefer PAP to be the ruling party, but we want is accountability and checks.<br><br>A self proclaimed first world government like PAP surely do not need to resort to suing politicians bankrupt, gerrymandering, threats of upgrading and using the carrot-and-stick policies to win people's votes. Even MM Lee himself admitted it is never a level-playing field in politics. Perhaps if the PAP wants to gain the people's respects, they should rule Singapore with more sincerity and passion, allowing more freedom to people, and not rule with an iron fist. Perhaps that's why Singapore has one of the highest emigration rate per capital in the world. Ironically, SM Goh's daughter is also a "quitter" happily staying in London.<br><br>source: http://www.bartleby.com/151/fields/26.html<br><br>By the way, I am also scared that I will be sued for typing this out. I don't know which citizen living in a country ruled by a "first world" government would have such apprehension.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>

They recite the Singapore pledge, pay GST, pay their taxes, serve their NS and yet they suffer this kind of discrimination. Do the "first-world" government PAP regard these residents as nothing but political pawns?<br><br>"Staying together, moving ahead".  How ironic their slogan for this election is, judging by the way they discriminate these residents. After attending the WP rally, I am amazed by the number of WP supporters. They are defiant, fiercely loyal to WP and truly love the party and its chairman Mr Low Thia Khiang. I wonder how many people who voted PAP have such qualities.<br><br>I also personnaly feel that I have more in common with the opposition party members. The PAP MPs are mostly managers, CEOs, veteran doctors and lawyers and almost all of them hide behind appointed ministers in the GRCs to enter parliament. The opposition members, with similar education background like the majority of the heartlanders, have to fight for every vote. How many of them are willing to risk their career just to enter politics to serve people, yet knowing that their chance of being an MP is that small?<br><br></div>
