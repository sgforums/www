I'll tell you why we can blame the government.<br>They pay foreign students and deprive locals to study in our local institutions.

Where did u get your facts that unemplyment rate is UP? From the opposition rallies? Regarding high costs of living, it's a norm for developed countries. Do you know that Japan has a super high cost of living? If you want a low cost of living, please migrate to malaysia or indonesia.. Want to enjoy life, but dont want to pay...<br><br>Next, regarding your argument for low income, you blame the government for letting in foreigners? If you truly have the capabilty, you shouldnt be afraid of foreign competitors. A lot of MNCs are paying lots of money to capable Singaporeans too. On the other hand, if the government over-protects Singapore by not letting in foreigners, do you think that the Singapore market can survive globalisation? Our market is too small for stand-alone operation. We need a global market to remain competitive. Think of the big picture my friends.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not afraid of foreign competitors. My question to you is: Why does the government give them perks to study here and work here when locals can do an equally good job. Do you know that locals here who may score higher than foreign talent are denied a place because the tertiary instituitions reserve places for foreign students even before results are known? Is this fair to you?<br><br>We are using different platforms to judge unemployment. I'm using the Pre-1997 yardstick. Why should we use an unreasonable yardstick that suits the PAP? PAP says people are happy. To me happy is pre 1997 recession. And did you know that less than 50% of the employed workers last year were locals? Are you telling me that we are less able? We are less educated? And why are places reserved for them? Reports abound of young singaporeans who cannot get places in NUS/NTU and manage to get into pretigious Ivy League Universities. Do you still think we are incapable people?<br><br>Let me put the cost of living issue this way. Do you think the cost of living in Singapore could easily be lowered without unnecessary taxes from the govt? If they didn't pay ridiculous wages for themselves, do you think we would have 4% gst instead of 5%? They raise our cpf draw-out age because they hope we die before then! Is that what you want? For feck's sake.. It's your own hard earned money!<br><br>And I haven't even touched on Accountablity on Transparency yet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Are you sure you stand by your last point about Global market?<br>Are you trying to imply that to have a global market, we need foreign talent to steal jobs from capable singaporeans? To steal places in education from more than capable Singaporeans? I tell you something. Instead of stealing jobs from us, why not attract BIGGER foreign businesses to invest in Singapore? I'm fine with foreign talent in places more capable than us. But the GOVERNMENT, or rather, the PAP is cultivating a Foreign Talent policy that robs equally or more capable Singaporeans of jobs and degrees.</div>
