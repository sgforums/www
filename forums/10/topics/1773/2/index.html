            <div class='col-md body'>My answer to your doubt is actually very simple, you mention go cmpb to see specialist, do you know those cmpb MOs are military personnal? Do you think you can get down graded there easily?<br><br>As for your second question is even more simple, go to see the cmpb or unit MOs is to let them refer you to medical board to comfirm the downgrades. MOs they themself cannot happy happy say you downgrade means you downgrade. Must go through proper procedure. Lets say your specialist is the top specialist in the world, he say you got heart problem, in that case don't you think the MOs will get refer to medical board? Don't forget your specialist is TOP SPECIALIST.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for ur reply.<br><br>just want to ask u whether pple who go see specialists have major or minor problems (eg. back &amp; heart problems u mentioned), cos i dun think pple have minor problems can be easily downgraded.<br><br>but i have seen a case (my friend), cmpb approves him to be downgraded to pes C cos he has a minor facture in his elbow, he has an accident when he was a child. i understand that such thing (physical problems from accident) can be downgraded but dun understand why he can be downgraded cos he told me it's not serious (minor case) n still can lift things without much difficulty.<br><br>i'm afraid wat i have said is wrong cos i'm not too familiar with such matter, wat's ur say???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To adrian xtc:<br><br>To get downgraded or not is simply determined whether you can present yourself properly in front of the MOs. If one example a man who had slight motorcycle accidient on his legs before and require operation, althought it seems that he is perfectly all right now, in front of the MOs, he claim that sometime he still have pain here and there. Who can prove he is wrong? I think only he himself knows.<br><br>As for case of minor problems, if a person is determine to get downgrade, go see the specialist every week, sooner or later the specialist will find some fault and recommand downgrade for him.<br><br>[This message has been edited by millennium (edited 14 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>try something more serious like prolapse disc, 1 mth mc. try acting more realistically. some cases gives u 3 mtyhs mc.<br>Worse still, get some brain damage. real or fake. it could earn u a pes f........why bother with stuff that can be easily verified like wisdom tooth and such? or maybe, act crazy and try contemplting suicide. P/s just make sure u dun really do it. just talk abt it and contemplagte and play on from that point.<br><br>[This message has been edited by the truth (edited 14 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I see some of the reply I feel sad. We must understand that the defence of Singapore is very vital for us to lead normal lifes. take kuwait for example? Bcos it relies on other to defend them, the help came to late. how much was lost. You people have to understand, others will not defend you without motive. They have to gain out of it too and lucky for kuwait they have oil. my only hope is our goverment will never reverse the NS rulez.
