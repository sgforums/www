And they pay use a miserable sum of money and make us work until sometimes late at night. Worse thing is that some of the officers who earn lots of money per month push all the job to his clerks who earns 300+ per month. Life is so unfair!!!!!!<br><br>------------------<br>Zhi~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To adrian txc:<br>Have you served NS? If you have, I am sure you will see many examples there. For the sake of those who don't know, what I most commonly see from people is to see heart specialists or back specialists. These is the easiest way to get downgraded. See once cannot get downgraded see second time, second time cannot see third time, see until can downgrade than give up. Do you think poor people can afford to see specialists so many time. There are many fit people in Mindef doing clerk, do you think they really got health problem?<br><br>[This message has been edited by millennium (edited 12 March 2000).]</div>
