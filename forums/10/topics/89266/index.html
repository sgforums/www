We as singaporean, have we actually view him as an individual, and value what he has done for sgp for the last many years. It will be judgemental for us to say that he is going to rule singapore like his dad simply because he is LKY's son. Towards his new government, i think we shld adopt a wait and see attitude before condemning him even before he begins his term.<br><br>He is afterall already our PM, why dun we give him some time to prove himself just like how we give Mr Goh a few years to prove his leadership.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think this plead to support the Prime Minister is unnecessary.  We are prepared to be ruled by him, we are RESIGNED to our fates.  Eagerness or willingness to accept him is irrelevant.  He does not NEED our popular approval.<br><br>Still, he has had a good 20 years experience in governance and politics, and those high-level appointments throughout the years won't hurt in preparing him for the job.<br><br>Let's just hope Singapore will not encounter any crisis beyond his ability to contain, at least until the next PM comes anyway.<br><br></div>
