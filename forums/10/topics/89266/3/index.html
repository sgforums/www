Well, it seems u ain't thinking much when u post either. Firstly, do u know what is banking legal reserve ratio? By decreasing this legal reserve ratio, banks have more freedom to lend money, which is considered as an example of liberalising the banking sector and i dun see how the FTA is related to this.<br><br>As for American banks being better than local banks, do we have to be ashamed? In terms of size, we are of vast difference and it is stupid to compare apples with durians. The least u can do is pick an Asian bank and pit it against local ones.<br><br>Before u shoot, try to process what u are going to say thru your brain first.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </div></blockquote>ahem ahem.<br><br>Legal reserve ratio and liberalisation is a bit different. The reserve ratio and interest rates are fiscal tools use by the govt to stimulate the economy in times of a recession and to rein in inflation when necessary. It applys across the board, not just Singapore banks.<br><br>The liberalisation of the banking sector in Singapore refers to the lifting of curbs on foreign banks which has given the local banks an advantage. Under the Banking Act, the local retail banking sector is mostly dominated by local banks because of the minimun deposit requirements and restriction on number of branches or ATMs as well as other restrictions.<br><br>We shd compare our banks with global players because they are the ones that we will be completing against in future.</div>

The contend will have to be determine by it"s creator. Ideally, of course, we like to see objective reports about things in Singapore not reported by the current existing few newspapers.<br><br>It could even be a watchdog on various government policies and ministries' activities? Things like looking through HDB, LTA, MOH, MOM accounts and  would be of great interest value.<br><br>Anyway, I was expecting opposition parties to look into these and have reports on any possible inadequancies. But it looks like they are not doing this too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those who are familiar with the Romance of the Three Kingdom....<br><br>One day Cao Cao was leading his army on an expedition. The soldiers were tired and thirstyand moving at a very slow speed putting them in a vulnerable position. Cao Cao told them, there are plum trees ahead I see sweet juicy plums growing on them. Motivated, the soldiers move fast and out of the area. Of course there were no plum trees, it was a white lie told by Cao Cao.<br><br>Whenever I go on BN exercise, my PC would tell me we are still two click from the objective I would think : " Damn it that was what you said three hours ago." When I ask again he would say almost reaching. I would be skeptical but I also want to believe at the same time.<br><br>A few years ago when GCT said the economy was recovering I didnt believe him either. Our fundalmentals and external demand were still weak. The recovery was weak and will be brief. But I believe he said so to motivated, and not to misled Singaporeans.<br><br>A important element required in a recovery is confidence. A lot of times businessman makes decision based on sentiments. If he feels that business is not going to pick up, he cuts down on investment and hiring. The consumer will also spend less resulting in factories producing less and less workers being hired and more being retrenched. The recesson will be prolonged.<br><br>If the media and govt were to paint an overly bleak picture, thats whats going to happen. If I were a retrench worker would I still have the confidence to look for a new job if I see in the media everyday that there are many more unemployed and that there are hardly any jobs around ? Or would I be more motivated after seeing sucess stories of ppl who are re-employed after retraining ? Its the same for business sucess stories.<br><br>There are only a few bright sparks. But if we were to concentreated on the gloom instead of the bight sparks, we would have been enveloped by the darkness.<br><br>My last post for the thread.<br><br>Thank You for reading such a long post.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>
