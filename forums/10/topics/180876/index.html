Leaders such as SBY do pay attention on what Singapore leaders has to say...<br><br>Also... even though i do not support the PAP... But i have to say that they are managing Singapore very well... Look at SEA and Singapore's wealth and you will know. Not to mention about rich indonesian businessmen all keeping their wealth in Singapore<br><br>Regarding Taiwan...

If he who want to express it, he should dare to stand out and use his own name not using singapore name.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In foreign policy, there are some issues on which a state has to take a stand, as sitting on the fence would be detrimental or useless to the state's interest compared to siding with one or the other. This is the case with the Taiwan issue. Simply put, if we want to do business in China, we have to side with them over Taiwan. China is too big a fish to snub for the likes of a small fry like Taiwan.<br><br>It's true that we do not want other countries to interfere in our politics. But neither do we interfere in the politics of Taiwan nor China. We do not tell them what they should do; we merely give our comments and state our stand on the matter as clearly as possible. I think our handling of the matter has been excellent so far, giving us quite a bit of credit in the region regarding this issue. Just look at the uproar over PM Lee's visit to Taiwan some months back, and see how it shows that what we do is taken seriously by both parties. Hence our leaders cannot afford to sit back and watch the show, but must handle the matter carefully, which so far we've managed to do pretty decently.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our leaders have more clout overseas than in SG.<br><br>Furthermore, we do have some influence in the region.After all, we are the only other independant Republic with a Chinese majority, after Taiwan.Soon, we might be the last..<br><br>and it's important that we emphasise more on our Singaporean heritage, and not constantly emphasising the different races instead of attempting to build a common identity.<br><br>The reason why China thinks we can be subtly pressured might be due to the fact that we have become accustomed to mainland Chinese immigration.This cannot be allowed to continue, lest the mainland think they can pressure us over issues.<br><br>We hold to our own interests, and that is final.Taiwan is our friend too, and yet we cannot afford to piss China off, realistically.A tight balancing act?
