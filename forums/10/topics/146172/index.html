            <div class='col-md body'>i read with mixed feelings of sadness and bewilderment the report, 'Sentence upped for man seeking trade-off for caning' (ST, Aug 3).<br><br>Let's look at the facts of the case:<br><br>Iskandar Muhamad Nordin, an 18-yr-old with a low IQ, was sentenced to nine month's jail and 3 strokes of the cane for touching a woman's breast.<br><br>Unrepresented, he appealed, asking for a longer jail sentence in lieu of caning.<br><br><span style="color: red;">CJ obliged by extending his jail sentence to 2 years and increasing the caning to 9 strokes.</span><br><br>i have a few questions:<br><br>how did he come to be unrepresented?  did anyone in our law-enforcement agency brief him on his rights?<br><br>did the state give him access to a lawyer who could have explained to him the consequences of a failed appeal?<br><br>being diagnosed as "educationally subnormal" and suffering from "conduct disorder" and "attention deficit hyperactive disorder", how was he deemed fit to conduct his own appeal - and, in this connection,<br><br>was a professional engaged to help in this assessment?<br><br>the court scene couldnt have been more heart-rending: there stood the mentally-disturbed and retarded iskandar, helplessly alone and hoping for mercy from a learned judge not know for his munificience.  he didnt have a chance.<br><br>everyone connected with the case, except iskandar, probably saw it coming.  but how could he with his troubled mind and diminished intelligence, and with absolutely no one to help him?<br><br>the eventual punishment of two years and 9 strokes was no doubt to teach iskandar "so you will remember" never to touch women's breasts again.  and this supposed to be appropriate for a man with an IQ of 58?<br><br>surely, there is a more humane approach to helping wayward young people with mental disability.<br><br>but what did give the case a bad aftertaste was the remark by the CJ that iskandar probably wouldnt mind the longer jail term.  considering iskandar's mental state, such a derision was quite unnecessary.<br><br>i cant help wondering if the molested woman feels that justice has finally been served.<br><br>Lee Seck Kay<br><br>the above appeared in the forum of The Straits Times, 6 august.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The "sentence upped" have been common  practise 4 a long time, probably to discourage criminals to appeal, also to "warn" the people that the law/system is above all &amp; don't try to challenge it.<br><br>Normal singaporeans are oriedi deep under tonnes of "system",  not to mention any1 who commit offence. How much help can be given to these criminals, I like to know 2.<br><br>Personally I agree he must be punished &amp; the most CJ can reject his appeal but no need to increase the sentence. This is a bit too harsh for his case as a low IQ person or with mental disability.</div>

There are only 1% of the population falling under the 2 extreme ends (extremely intelligent/ extremely retarded). Hence, he's only more intelligent that only 0.5% of the overall population.<br><br>The next important question is "Is this IQ test taken independently?" It's easier to fake bad than to fake good on an IQ test. If he had taken this IQ test much earlier before the court case, this piece of information should be used to send him to IMH, under the principle that such a person should not be able to function properly in the real world and should require help from the mental professionals.<br><br>But you ask "Is IQ test a reflection of acedemic performance?" No, even though academic achievement might slightly influence how a person perform in a test. An IQ test usually has 2 components to it. A numerical components and a verbal components. For both components, there are many different tests falling under these categories. Most of these tests would be written in a language as simple as possible to ensure that language would play a small part in determining the overall intelligence. These tests tried to examine an individual's understanding of the concepts behind the language.<br><br><span style="color: red;">But last and most important question of all. <strong>WHY IS HE NOT REPRESENTED?</strong> Any psychological undergraduate will be able to help CJ to understand the IQ scores. Unless CJ himself is so sure that he could understand the IQ scores by himself. Something wrong with our legal system here?<br></span></div>

Something wrong with our legal system here?<br>[/b]</blockquote>The criminal legal aid scheme applies only if you have been charged in Court for an offence for which you do not admit to and cannot afford to pay a lawyer to help you fight the case. In this case, legal aid will probably not apply; so presumably he and his family couldn't afford a lawyer.<br><br>This is an appeal and appeals are only allowed on point of law. The defendant's case seems to be that the original sentence was excessive but it clearly wasn't if you compare it with judgments in previous cases. The CJ's policy has always been to up the sentence if you appeal for no valid reasons.<br><br>The defence of diminished responsibility is only operative in homicide cases, so that's not applicable here. Is the low IQ sufficient as a mitigating factor? If one can successfully use low IQ as a mitigating factor in a criminal case, the public naturally would want greater protection from all persons with a low IQ.

In this case, legal aid will probably not apply; so presumably he and his family couldn't afford a lawyer.<br><br>This is an appeal and appeals are only allowed on point of law. The defendant's case seems to be that the original sentence was excessive but it clearly wasn't if you compare it with judgments in previous cases. The CJ's policy has always been to up the sentence if you appeal for no valid reasons.<br><br>The defence of diminished responsibility is only operative in homicide cases, so that's not applicable here. Is the low IQ sufficient as a mitigating factor? If one can successfully use low IQ as a mitigating factor in a criminal case, the public naturally would want greater protection from all persons with a low IQ. Should they all be institutionalized like psychopaths then?<br><br></div></blockquote>Taken from wikipedia:<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation<br><br><strong>The limitations of cognitive function will cause a child to learn and develop more slowly than a typical child. Children may take longer to learn to speak, walk, and take care of their personal needs such as dressing or eating. They will have trouble learning in school. Learning will take them longer, require more repetition, and there may be some things they cannot learn. The extent of the limits of learning is a function of the severity of the disability.<br><br>There are three criteria before a person is considered to have a developmental disability: an IQ below 70, significant limitations in two or more areas of adaptive behavior (i.e., ability to function at age level in an ordinary environment), and evidence that the limitations became apparent in childhood. Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome and fragile X are the three most common inborn causes.</strong><br><br>In fact, I believe the severly retards are institutionalised. But the bigger problem is whether this ELITIST society of ours are doing enough to take care of those less fortunate.<br><br>But of course, his score of 58 on the IQ test need to be verified to be accurate. If he's really retarded, what he needs is help, not punishment.<br><br></div>

But was justice served? Was he 'rightly punished'? How a person is punished is based on whether the sentence correlates to the crime committed. This is where the book is thrown.<br><br>About the representation and proper conseiling, i'm waiting with breathless anticipation for the judiciary's answer.<br><br>Perhaps CJ might take it as a personal affront and do the honours himself?</div>
