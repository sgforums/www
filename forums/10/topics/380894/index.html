              <p>Hello <a href="/users/253318">Nighthawkies</a></p>
              <p>There is nothing for you or anyone here to be suspicious about Temasek Review.</p>
              <p>They are doing a great job, like sgforums, airing our views on Singapore matters.</p>
              <p>Don't try to blow your smoke here.</p>
              <p>Was LHL talking about you in this comment :</p>
              <p>"Every year, we attract younger Singaporeans through the YP. We give them roles, online doing battle in cyberspace and on the ground organising activities which attract younger people.”</p>
              <p>Go look at yourself in the mirror.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans are sick and tired of people bashing  Singapore's reputation in public forums. If you want to be snide about the Singapore Government, fine, go ahead but do it with evidence.

              Annonymous Agent 007,
              
              Are you an agent wannabe? 
              
              Anyway, you have the rights to your view about Temasek Review, I'm not going to argue about it. Let's wait and see what Temasek Review has to say about the rumours on the net about this then.
              
              They are doing a great job? Oh yes, depending on which side of the fence you're sitting on. Temasek Review aka Wayangparty started off by wacking Workers' Party but failed.
