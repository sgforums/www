              <p>what i agreed with is beauty is one of the factors but not the only one. do you think celebrities would be able to sell without their looks? even for men, like say 2 guys who are equally capable, assuming one is ugly and the other one beautiful. the better looking one would have a higher chance of promotion under a male boss.</p>

              <p>well...... that actually is one of the reasons why better looking people are more sucessful financially. no one said it would be pretty. i've known people who like you are above average in looks but no one ever said anything like that. circumstances are not the same for different people. it depends of personal character as well.</p>
              <p>if you do feel that way then you probably exibit signs which lead them into thinking you're a threat.</p>

              <p>its was never implied in any way looks were the only factor, in fact i've taken the effert to repeatedly mention other factors count too but it still depends on the situation.</p>
              <p>why is it when ever i say something you take it apart to use one half against the other and ignore that i've mentioned the other half? even Mohd Ali would die in a fight with me if i had him chained up first, would that then mean i'm the world greatest boxer?</p>
              <p>and likewise you're not me how do you know what my friends have told me? and i have to say again it depends on the situation, i rarely encounter your type of " mediocre" people in my work place. so either you're in a situation where such people are commonplace or you have created the situation yourself.</p>
