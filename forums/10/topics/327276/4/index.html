              <p>my company recently changed its airline travel policy from
              flying-on-a-national-carrier to flying on a
              cheapest-ticketed-airline, which means from sq to northwest or ua.
              now, i travel a lot, lot less on external customer meeting. (must
              say technology has also improved. we have virtual meeting room
              now where we can see the other person almost like
              `live' across the table. so, it eliminates internal meeting
              travel)</p>

              <p>Actually i think its the ego of men and the asian culture that women are the reserves rather than the players.</p>
              <p>Don't have to worry about the status of women too much, they're now catching up with man, better worry about ourselves.</p>
              <p>However, i still think that men are made in a way that they are more suitable as front line players while women take the backstage.</p>
              <p>Men are physically stronger, think more logically and are able to suppress their emotions better.</p>
              <p>Women, on the other hand, are not as muscular(i heard it is to provide comfort for the baby), tend to be more emotional and caring, thus making them better care givers than employees.</p>

              <p>It look good on u, and so does other bags. The trick is to make
              u think u look good in it and they do it by employing good looking
              models. As said, people employ beautiful model as ad simply because
              it is more attractive and appeal to both men and women. It is just
              like a beautiful car or beautiful buildings or a beautiful doll.
              People like to see beautiful things</p>
              <p>Com'on la... the new mindset is indeed tat men should take over
              more household chores but men is still the primary bread winner.
              Because they r the primary bread winner, they should try to protect
              their careers as much as possible and let the secondary income
              maker take care of the family. As said, it is not every case but in
              the general case. It is more asian family, in fact even in ang mo
              countries, male r the primary bread winner.</p>

              <p>Well.. if the anti-mother culture's not gonna <strong>change</strong>.. women will less likely want to give birth. And birth rates will continue to go down. Unfortunately.. this is but an Asian traditionalist behavior.</p>
              <p>And yes.. the government can step up to help change this mindset.</p>
              <p>To be honest.. I am very disgusted with the China bait and switch tactic.</p>
              <p>I have no problem watching the original singer perform live. She is also a cute little girl.</p>
