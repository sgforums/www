              You don't seem to get the point. What they are trying to say is that Singaporeans are not reproducing because they don't feel they are treated like human beings. While other govts try to increase birth rate also for economic reasons they do treat their people as human beings with all the inalienable rights.

              <p>Parents will sacrifice for their children. That is the beauty of parenthood.</p>

              <p>to have babies in a family is a private matter</p>
              <p>To have a substainable population in terms of economy makes it a national direction and objective.</p>
              <p>If there is no national interest in having babies, then on wat grounds does the gov have in implementing baby bonuses etc which is about private matters</p>
              <p>About a conducive environment for a baby, it largely depend on your expectation. It is strange tat the poorest nations have the highest birth rate while rich nations have low birth rate. Mostly it is probably due to different expectation on wat the child should get</p>
              <p>And stop at 2 is a policy stopped probably 20 years ago. Changing and modifying of policies over time is a sign of strength, not weakness</p>

              <p>Different culture.. different social system.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In poor countries.. infant mortality rate are high.. meaning many babies do not survive their first year after birth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They do not have a retirement system like CPF or IRA. So they depend on their children to take care of them when they are old, much like Singapore in the older days.. that's why our great/grandparents have so many kids.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the more kids they have.. the higher chances of having more children survive .. thus the more secure their old age.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With more children.. parents will have a different perspective of life.</p>
              <p>Back then.. even children are dispensable... because they have so many anyway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now.. in our modern time.. because parents have only 2-3 , children are precious... so the mindset has changed.</p>
              <p>Back in those days.. children start working at a very young age.. some as early as 12-13. Hardwork and dilligence was all they need to succeed in life.</p>
              <p>Nowadays.. children needs to be educated well into their 20s.. some even more..to ensure better survivals and financial independence.</p>
              <p>The financial burden on the parents are much longer and much higher in current times.</p>
              <p> I wonder why our gahmen cannot understand this... perhaps they are too set in their old ways ?? Their thinking are not catching up with times..... perhaps it is time to retire the old ministers .. and put in new blood.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your forthright reply.</p>
              <p>Written are my own words and not some 'propaganda' as you suspect.</p>
              <p>We had been made pragmatic for so long due to circumstances, that some may lost their idealism and the very purpose of existance. My take on the birth issue is to not to be bothered by whatever politics or economics come into play, rather, be the person you want to be.</p>
              <p>Life has it ups and down, and no person is free from the dictates of fate. We Singaporeans plan too much, and life doesnt goes very much to plan. But if we have an ideal and believe in it, it will be our own compass to guide us through life's vaguries.</p>
              <p>It is senseless to blame the State(our society) for low birth rates, when that decision is fully ours to make, a natural instinct of humanity. No one goes to jail for making such decisions. The only person who actually suffers, is not the State( our society), but us, in our old age, doom to loneliness when we have no issue of our own.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, the State had been rather clumsy in its attempts to prove the fruitlessness of life without children, believing that we are pragmatic beings, thus use statistical evidences to show that loneliness of old age and its finacial situation to fellow citizens.</p>
              <p>But nonetheless, our country has a heart, and the capacity to offer a good and fruitful life to each and every citizen to have a family, based on one's merit, with full opportunities for all, white or black, rich or poor. And this is not an issue for political play, for the family unit comes first even before the nation. Without the family unit ( and i don't in all seriousness mean the Lee family) , there can be no nation. Mankind would have been extinct.</p>

              <p>Interesting opinions here. The way I summarize this thread -</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1&gt; Govt wants to encourage more babies to support its economic expansion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2&gt; Singaporeans feel that the environment is not conducive and do not wish to have babies here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3&gt; Govt thinks of an alternative and imports "babies" in the form of foreign talent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4&gt; Foreign talent competes with Singaporeans for work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5&gt; Singaporeans are not happy with foreign talent competing with them for "rice" when they are hard pressed themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>7&gt; (This has not happened yet) Govt addresses the problem that the environment here is not conducive for babies and introduce welfare to make it conducive. Singaporeans have more babies. Less foreign talent is needed. More welfare costs more money thus increase taxes for annual incomes that are considered affluent maybe? And voila! ...... akan datang</p>

              <p>But what i had proposed are nothing more than philosophies for the ideal society practiced by greeks and the western culture eons ago, mix with traditional eastern thoughts for the well being of a society. I am no Plato or Confucius. I am just a humble nobody, an ordinary citizen.</p>
              <p>I do not seek to impose my beliefs upon anyone, but only that they consider the idealism and realities one faces with regards to the birth issue over what i had written.</p>
              <p>Your concept of 'work life balance' is not a tantra that can be used for all situations in reality. If you are working in the govt services, you will have my fullest support for a worklife balance - with all the benefits parents should entitle such as 3 mths maternity leaves, 5 day week, allowances, etc, because your employers are none other than us - the taxpayers, members of our society and you are one of us, and we all want the best for each and everyone of citizens.</p>
              <p>However, if you are working in the private sector, then you would have to be fair to your employers. It is their private funds that is used to create employment, get business to earn a living.</p>
              <p>If they have to employ workers with such benefits - 3mths leave, 5 day week, no overtime, no deadlines, no pressures, there would be hardly profitable or productive to stay in business and will even fold up in time!</p>
              <p>So how should private companies 'balance' your work life, when their very own survival depends on your regular attendence?</p>
              <p>Another angle to look at private sector companies is that - should you dedicate your life to the company, getting promoted and elevated above your peers, and given all the material comfort you would want - by the time, if you are fortunate, after 30 years helping your boss gain fame and riches, you will have to retire.</p>
              <p>All you will get is a handshake, a gold watch, and a thank you. Is this worth the sacrifice of giving up a family life with children for? You could have been embracing your grandchildren instead, whom will give you happiness and are priceless, worth beyond more than a miserable gold watch and a handshake, coupled with living the rest of your years with childless loneliness, watching others' children play, but none of your own.</p>

              <p>I agree that the usual association with propaganda is not good, but the actually definition of propaganda is very different.</p>
              <p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda</p>
              <p> Propaganda i<strong>s a concerted set of messages aimed at influencing the opinions or behaviors of large numbers of people. </strong>As opposed to impartially providing information, propaganda in its most basic sense presents information in order to influence its audience. <strong>Propaganda often presents facts selectively (thus lying by omission) to encourage a particular synthesis,</strong> or<strong> gives loaded messages in order to produce an emotional rather than rational response</strong> to the information presented. <strong>The desired result is a change of the cognitive narrative of the subject in the target audience to further a political agenda.</strong></p>
              <p>Yes, if work life balance is what you have defined, it is not workable. But many Countries/Companies have better work life balance. Toyota, one of the world class manufacturer under an American CEO, practise work life balance. Employees are not allowed to work more than 48 hours a week unless a written approval is obtained from the CEO.</p>
              <p>How often are employees wasting time surfing the net and doing non work related tasks in office?  My brother and his girlfriend who both worked in US found the work culture very different. You are free to come and leave the office anytime as long as the tasks are completed. There are urgent times where he works 12 hours a day to complete his tasks , but usually he is given a lot of leeway with regards to working hours. However in the same company, Singapore branch, hours are long long long.</p>
              <p>As I said, good luck promoting birthrates without work life balance. Were there issues of work life balance in Confucius/Plato’s time? Did Confucius/Plato say there is more to life to work? Didnt Plato say "A Life not examined is not worth living?" How are we going to examine our lives if there is no work life balance?</p>

              that Singaporeans are not reproducing because they don't feel they
              are treated like human beings. While other govts try to increase

If the gov want to change the people mentality and portray happy family lives to promote population growth in a soft way, u guys complained tis is gov propaganda. If they don't ask u guys to give birth and import people into the society, u guys complain tis is anti-nationalism and they r here snatching your rice bowls.

If your boss, like toyota or some US companies who wanna give the employees a good quality of life, the gov is not gonna force them to stop. Tis is all about your job and the gov cannot interfere much into it. U don't like your job environment, then I guess u should try to find a lazy job with little things and probably low pay instead.</p>
              <p>If u talk about propaganda, religion and confucianism r classified as propaganda themselves.</p>
              <p>Then wat do u suggest the gov to do ? If they promote people to give birth to babies by giving incredible benefit, r they fair to people who choose to remain single or childless (given the tax tat support tis benefit comes from all sector) ? If the gov want to change the people mentality and portray happy family lives to promote population growth in a soft way, u guys complained tis is gov propaganda. If they don't ask u guys to give birth and import people into the society, u guys complain tis is anti-nationalism and they r here snatching your rice bowls. If they do not do anything at all, the economy becomes saturated and will decline and u guys will complain economic woes.</p>
              <p>Tis is really a difficult problem</p>

              <p>These days you walk along Orchard Road, you will notice that the level of Singaporeans' Chinese has gone up, while their proficiency in English has gone down, not that their level of English was any good in the beginning. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>In another few generations, the national language of Singapore would be æ™®é€šè¯� (Mandarin) and we would be annexed by China.
