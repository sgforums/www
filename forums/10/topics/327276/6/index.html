              <p><em>most</em> women are know to be able to provide better services than man, being more patient and more capable of comunication. naturally when it comes to hiring the "face" of the airline, some do make the choices of opting for a more <em>aesthetically pleasing one.</em></p>
              <p>most will tell you they won't give a damn if you ask them, but society has proven that the beautiful on average have a higher pay and are more popular. just like why the rich have more friends than the poor. whether male or female, first impressions count.</p>
              <p>beauty is always in the eyes of the beholder, which is why the ceo's preferences is different from yours. and why certain tribes in africa like BBW.</p>

              <p>Lets zoom to maternity leave here. The others is just crap to me.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span>Paid maternity leave will be extended from 12 weeks to 16 weeks,
              and the extra four weeks can be taken anytime during the baby's first
              year.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>Here is the problem that many people see. If paid maternity leave is so long, are employers going to hire more married women with little or no children during their suitable fertility stage in life? Worst still, if you told them you are going to have a baby soon. Off the list you go.</p>
              <p>Employers want to maximise their profits and cut costs. We all should understand this. But, here is the key issue, is the government providing enough to the employers to help in financing the paid maternity leave?</p>
              <p>Should I say this? Wives during their maternity leave have no contribution at all to the company, unless their job scope allows them to work at home. They deserve the good rest. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">So, is the government covering the brunt of the maternity leave costs? </span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">Like providing more tax cuts, or directly offering the company money.</span><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>If the answer is no, I can safetly say that the policy has failed. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>i don't believe the policy has failed, but they must fine tune it to suit singapore, maybe maternity leave can involve the fathers as well? since there's always that BS about a whole package from the pap why not include the fathers as well. reservist can be intensified and shorten, everytime i go back i have to spend days sitting around doing nothing. so why not make fathers serve ns this way? who knows? guys might even have more children just to avoid reservist?<a rel="nofollow" href="327276?page=6#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif?1208925295" alt="Icon_lol"></a><a rel="nofollow" href="327276?page=6#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif?1208925295" alt="Icon_lol"></a><a rel="nofollow" href="327276?page=6#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif?1208925295" alt="Icon_lol"></a></p>

              <p>studies have shown humans in general to favour lookism, for both men and women. what people generally cannot accept is there are also cultures in this world which have vastly different standards where beauty is concerned.</p>
              <p>i've never seen her photo or in person before so when you say "eat your heart out" do you mean you've seen her before? if so are you implying she'll succeed financially or not?</p>
              <p>or is this all just bullshiit?</p>
