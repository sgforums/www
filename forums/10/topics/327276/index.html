              <p>Wednesday, 23 July 2008, 10:13 pm</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/category/andrew-loh/">Andrew Loh</a> / Deputy Editor of TOC</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">This article is inspired by what Mr Wang wrote on his blog – a very thought-provoking entry titled, “<a href="http://mrwangsaysso.blogspot.com/2008/07/human-rights-and-government-baby.html">Human rights and the Government baby incentives, Part 1</a>”. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">It led me to wonder why exactly Singaporeans would want to have kids, if they are treated as merely an economic necessity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Mr
              Wang argues that the Singapore Government’s motivation in wanting to
              raise the birth rate is “purely economic; the aim is to generate a
              steady stream of future workers for Singapore Inc” - if </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> views human rights as an ‘invention of the West”, having no relevance to us in </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Asia</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">.
              Mr Wang cites the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
              Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) to illustrate an interesting
              perspective on how human rights actually can inform national policies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">I agree with what Mr Wang says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">In his first <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A12826-2004Sep10.html">National Day Rally speech</a> in 2004, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, said: </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>This
              is a matter of values, not of incentives… We want people to have babies
              because you want them and you love them. It’s part of a happy family
              life.</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Despite
              those words from the prime minister, however, Singaporeans have become
              cynical about the Government’s reasons. “It’s not because having kids
              will provide a happy family life”, they might say. “It’s to bolster our
              economic competitiveness and indeed, our economic survival. After all,
              no babies means no workers for the future, right? No workers means our
              economy will be affected.” That’s how the thought process goes. That’s
              what the Government says all the time. It’s all about the economy. The
              sweet-saccharine citation of “a happy family life” is just packaging
              and PR.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">This
              is further reinforced by ministers’ public statements and Government
              policies – such as allowing the influx of foreigners and immigrants.
              Two years after the PM said it was a “matter of values”, he admitted,
              in his <a href="http://www.workpermit.com/news/2006_08_22/global/singapore_needs_immigrants.htm">2006 National Day Rally speech</a>: </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span class="storyheader"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">We are short 14,000 babies… We have to bring in new immigrants. If our population shrinks, </span></strong></span><span class="storyheader"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span></strong></span><span class="storyheader"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> will face a very serious problem… To grow and flourish, we must welcome
              those who can help us to reach our goals… That is the way to build </span></strong></span><span class="storyheader"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span></strong></span><span class="storyheader"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> for Singaporeans.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="storyheader"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">And
              of course, we all know that the only goal that matters here in our tiny
              island is the economic one, above all else. Why? Because, according to
              Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, </span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">“as long as we have a dynamic economy, we can solve our problems.” (<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_241154.html">Straits Times</a>).
              Do you understand now the Government’s obsession with raising the birth
              rate? Think: Babies = future workers = economic growth = dynamic
              economy = solving problems. That’s also the Government’s and the
              People’s Action Party’s (PAP) political legitimacy and relevance – if
              you’re not able to solve problems, who would want to vote for you,
              right?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">In a nutshell, if we have money (economic growth) “we can solve our problems”, and the PAP can stay in power.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Meaning lin life</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Therein
              lies the conundrum; The Government sees Singaporeans as workers for the
              economy, while increasingly Singaporeans want something more out of
              life than just being feeders for the economy monster.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The
              result is a declining birth rate because Singaporeans do not see
              anything meaningful in slogging away all their lives on the economic
              front. It’s a seemingly-endless struggle and competition which makes
              them hesitate and then decide against having kids. After all, if you
              are tired from the struggle, why would you want to put your kids
              through it as well? Where is the meaning in life?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">That’s the key phrase: meaning in life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">It
              is so often nowadays that I hear my friends wonder what their lives
              mean. It sounds almost like a crisis. “I work 15 hours a day and I
              still am not sure if I will be able to retire. So, why have kids? Just
              do what we can, eventually die, and that’s it,” one said to me. “Why
              should I worry about the survival of the economy and what-not when the
              Government sees us as just workers for the monster? Life should be
              about more than just work, work, work!” says another.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">A
              Government as obsessed with economic performance as ours cannot
              understand such sentiments. But even if it does and tries to come up
              with the solution, it will be an economic one. Thus, we see all sorts
              of economic incentives being offered, including subsidies and all. They
              have all failed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>See Singaporeans as human beings. Period.</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Perhaps
              what is needed to solve the problem of a declining birth rate is to see
              Singaporeans first and foremost and always as people, human beings –
              and treat them as such. It is, as the prime minister said, about values.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">It is about how much we as a nation value Singaporeans as human beings. Period. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">And if we do, we will include considerations of the value of human rights. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">As Mr Wang said:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">In fact, babies are very much like Temasek’s investment in Shin Corp or Merrill Lynch. <em><span style="font-family: Arial;">One day</span></em>,
              they might generate good returns, but that will have to be in the very,
              very distant future. Meanwhile, they are just a huge, constant and
              bleeding economic loss.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong>This is not an
              obstacle if you view babies and parents as humans, and by virtue of
              being human, automatically having human rights (like those under CEDAW).</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Maybe
              then Singaporeans will see meaning in their lives and would want
              children with whom they can speak of the amazing wonder of the
              experience of Life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">At
              the very least, the Government should pause and think about things
              outside the economic and not dismiss things like human rights casually
              or because of political or hegemonic reasons.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">I
              think Singapore has reached a point where it has a lot of economic
              success and now it has some surplus, and it’s time to start thinking
              about the more human element.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">- Dr Angelique Chan, Sociologist, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">National</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">University</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> of </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">. (<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/257208/1/.html">Channel NewsAsia</a>) </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">If we are going to emulate <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/Health/News/Story/A1Story20080711-76138.html">Swedish policies </a>on
              raising the birth rate, shouldn’t we also consider the Swedish approach
              to human rights as well? As Mr Wang so eloquently argued, the two are
              not mutually exclusive. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Indeed, it could be what saves </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> from oblivion.</span></p>

              <p>Dear Evanangel,</p>
              <p>I am not sure if you are a Singaporean or an ex-Singaporean. It seems Singapore Bashing is a favourite past-time of ex-Singaporeans, worthless low class type PRs who bring shame to peaceful and hardworking PRs i know here, and those suffering from a mistake they made in their own lives and take it out here on our State ( we the citizens)</p>
              <p>But just do know, whatever our political differences, when it comes to attacks on our country, we will not hesitate to unite and challenge you to your last breath.</p>
              <p>I will give you the benefit of the doubt and take you as a Singaporean, and give my personal view accordingly.</p>
              <p>Giving birth and having children are natural instincts. It is an act of love to give life to a child, the personification and the manifestation of a shared future and continuation of life's journey, hopes and dreams.</p>
              <p>We desire the best material comfort, but it doesnt come easy. You want a good life, you have to sacrifice your time now to study instead of playing computer game. You want that prada bag, you know you have to sacrifice a few lunches for it. To live is to know sacrifice.</p>
              <p>Whatever our material situation in life, there is no more worthy sacrifice than to sacrifice for our kids, the manisfestation of a couple's love.</p>
              <p>Only when you have a child will you find true happiness, for all mankind needs love. The unconditional love from a child is truly out of this world. The trust he/she holds in you, be you a crook father or president of a nation, the smiles, the laughter and cheers he/she brings, etc. There will be times of sadness, but the happiness and joys of parenthood far far outweight those times.</p>
              <p>And what better chances of you having a child in Spore than in any other half baked 'winner takes it all society', where the poor are neglected, compare to our nation - a 'loser society' where none are left out?</p>
              <p>No matter how poor you are, the State( we taxpayers ) will contribute towards your child's success, as long as the family is realistic and prepared to work hard. We hate loafers and willingly let them go to other nations and 'enjoy' their loafing lives there.</p>
              <p>Do drop the confusing talk from politicians and so called experts. Love and life is something that only you can live yourself. Seek within your heart and find out which direction you want to live. No one in our State(our society) had ever forced you to do anything you don't wish to do. Had the State(our society) ever hauled you to court for having too many children, or too little children, or being single?</p>
              <p>Do be fair to the State ( our taxpayers ) whom had contributed to your developement, from a child to you present age. You could have been born a shot dead protestor in Mynmaar, a homeless american evicted out of your house from the sub-prime crisis, a thai wondering where the economy and leadership is heading, a clueless Bruneian, a second class citizen in Malaysia, etc, etc.</p>
              <p>Your are a priviledged child of our country, a nation that previous generations had sacrifice much for you so that you may have a better life than the ones they ever had before, no matter what political differences we have. It's the nation that matters. Flaws there will be, not many, but ever ready to make the necessary changes - with sacrifices but without destroying our social fabric.</p>
              <p>May you enjoy your singlehood, but am encourage to find a good man and have kids to live a fruitful live.</p>
              <p>Cheers. </p>

              <p>Personally speaking, if one's intention of having children is to contribute to the economy, then i would suggest forget about it.</p>
              <p>Love and kids is beyond the price tags. Only the cold calculative would put a value to such principles of life itself.</p>
              <p>To increase the wealth of our economy, there are other ways and means to do so. SWF is a well thought out plan and the small amount of our population can live with it. Opening up our economy to others, FTs, FWs, etc, are other ways, when push comes to shove. </p>
              <p>When we get old, and there is no one to take care of us, with our personal and national savings exhausted, we can only either blame ourselves, or suffer in silence for the choices we made.</p>
              <p>However, our society deserves to continue on the national path of humankind. We had shown the world what we are made of, a group of humans, kicked out of a federation, with only a small port not more than 10km in length that contributes not more 20% of our wealth and would hardly pay for even  public transportation, had got together, made sacrifices and survived for 43 years, to the amazement and wonder of the world.</p>
              <p>We as Singaporeans should be proud of such achievements, sacrificed by our previous generations who had to grovel before chicken western colonnial and brutal jap masters, whom treated us as no more than slaves or animals.</p>
              <p>Proud enough to stand stall as human, bowing before no man, an equal to all, to give life to our next generations, so that they may know the beauty of our world and try to change the ugliness to an Utopia ideal wished upon mankind since the dawn of civilisation, not for us, but for them and their future generations with our help, as the previous generations had help us progress from servitude to independence. </p>

              <p>My brother and other friends earning above average pay are not really keen to have kids. They hardly have enough time for themselves, would they have time for kids? Beside having kids is a huge drain on finances. Those who can do their sums properly wont bite the govt bait.</p>
              <p>Singapore companies lacks work life balance. If they want Singaporeans to start family, the culture and atitude must change, not just paying lip service to work life balance. And attitudes may take years or decades to change.</p>

              <p>To be fair, most of our previous generation of mothers did not work. The father was the sole bread winner.

              <p>If we can sacrifice our youth to study instead of sports to get a degree, so as to earn a good job, sacrifice pubs and nites out with the boys or girls to buy material goods, are we prepared to sacrifice our time in equal measure to have kids?</p>
              <p>With money we can all the material goods we want. But material goods are not forever. At times we even get bored with it. There is only so much shoes, channel bags, trips to Australia, etc, in one life time. A condo becomes another box we come home to. A job is just labour to make your boss rich, no matter how dedicated and hard you work. </p>

              <p>Dear <a href="../../../users/242785">xtreyier</a>,</p>
              <p>I'm a Singaporean born and educated here. This country has given me a life that I can never imagine if I were to be in Afganistan or Iraq, and I feel that I'm very lucky to be here. Lucky with parents, with family, with friends etc. Your words always have a strong tinge of propaganda. Are those your true words about how you are feeling now, or just blabbering about your ideal society? We are doing well, but there are still many rooms of improvement if the government values our opinions seriously. I'm actually disappointed with their performance only for these past 2 years. Competency sets in I guess.</p>
              <p>I feel proud of the economic achievements we have in the past. All developed countries are facing the same problems of low birth rates now. But the idea of treating us as economic tools turns me off.</p>
              <p>jojobeach said this very well, "when the female finds the environment unconducive to raise
                                      a child. she will not have babies". We have the lowest replacement rate of 1.29 among other western countries.  What does it show? There is something wrong with the approach and policies the government have about couples having children. This article is written to tell the government, if they have not realise, to take a more humane approach. It is not too late for them and I applaud them for their effort. However past policies have failed with the exception of the "stop at 2" policy.</p>
              <p>I do not have a child and hope to have one someday with my future wife. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> Provided that I can afford to raise him/her up with an independent mindset and the ability to do what they love. In fact, I have planned as far as bringing them to private schools or international schools, far away from the government propaganda. Because I want them to have a mind of their own. This is something that most Singaporeans lack, we have been spoon fed too much.</p>
              <p>I read widely from the opposition side and the PAP media side and then I analyse and read further to tell from the truth and false. I don't want to be biased here.</p>
              <p>Regards,</p>

              <p>Thanks for your forthright reply.</p>
              <p>Written are my own words and not some 'propaganda' as you suspect.</p>
              <p>We had been made pragmatic for so long due to circumstances, that some may lost their idealism and the very purpose of existance. My take on the birth issue is to not to be bothered by whatever politics or economics come into play, rather, be the person you want to be.</p>
              <p>Life has it ups and down, and no person is free from the dictates of fate. We Singaporeans plan too much, and life doesnt goes very much to plan. But if we have an ideal and believe in it, it will be our own compass to guide us through life's vaguries.</p>
              <p>It is senseless to blame the State(our society) for low birth rates, when that decision is fully ours to make, a natural instinct of humanity. No one goes to jail for making such decisions. The only person who actually suffers, is not the State( our society), but us, in our old age, doom to loneliness when we have no issue of our own.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, the State had been rather clumsy in its attempts to prove the fruitlessness of life without children, believing that we are pragmatic beings, thus use statistical evidences to show that loneliness of old age and its finacial situation to fellow citizens.</p>
              <p>But nonetheless, our country has a heart, and the capacity to offer a good and fruitful life to each and every citizen to have a family, based on one's merit, with full opportunities for all, white or black, rich or poor. And this is not an issue for political play, for the family unit comes first even before the nation. Without the family unit ( and i don't in all seriousness mean the Lee family) , there can be no nation. Mankind would have been extinct.</p>

              <p>Technically speaking, the government is right in encouraging higher birth rate as human resource is the only natural resources Singapore. If we do not have critical mass the economy would suffer as domino effects would cause various industries to spiral down the drain one after each other and effectively Singaporeans would suffer.</p>
              <p>They (the government) could have taken the easy way out to keep importing FTs, but is that the solution? I dont think so as the Singaporean fabric needs to be maintain in order to keep the National Identity and of course another important reason is the National Defence. Imagine someday we need to employ Gurkhas to protect our own country?</p>
              <p>I believe the perception is wrong to think that the government wants to have children just to replenish the workforce. In order to have and maintain a true society, economy is just one and not THE factor. Families are important too as it is the basic building block of a country.</p>
              <p>To have children or not is entirely up to individual, the policies can only provide a more conducive environment (or conditions)  and encourage more people to have babies, it is too bad if sadistic views are placed upon the policies.</p>

              <p><strong>Q: Tell me which country has openly admit this is a problem and try to solve this problem?</strong></p>
              <p>A: The swedish. If not why is Singapore trying to learn from their <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/Health/News/Story/A1Story20080711-76138.html">swedish policies</a>?</p>
              <p><strong>Q: Do u think couples will listen to all sort of 'Family
                                          value', ' why u shall reproduce' ,'the country need your kids'
                                          lessons?</strong></p>
              <p>A: No, in fact the government has failed to persuade couples to have children this way. I guess the economic way failed also. The swedish have actually a lot more paid maternity leave for both husbands and wives as compared to Singapore. Monetary wise, I have not tabulated it. Maybe some kind forumers would help me? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p><strong>Without more new born kids,the existing kids will have to
                                          support more old folks when the kids become middle age.</strong></p>
              <p>I have seen many old folkes collecting empty drink cans in the streets. Maybe they have less CPF as the scheme is introduced too late for them. If this problem still exists in the future, are you trying to say that our retirement education to the citizens and CPF to help take care of us during retirement has failed? Idealy, we would want to be self sufficent to take care of ourselves in the future.</p>
              <p><strong>If u find no meaning,then who's fault?PAP again ,of course!!</strong></p>
              <p>Yes, the government's policies affect our lives. In fact, it shapes our lives into what we are now. We cannot safely say that policies made by the government has no correlation to us. It affects our lifestyle (NS, holidays we have, 5 day work week, buy expensive house to get married? and etc), finances (taxes), education...etc. I can safetly say that the government shapes our culture too. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>I love Singapore! All opinions are for the betterment of ourselves and for everyone else. I did thought about joining any party, PAP included in the future when I'm successful. Why? Because policies affect our LIVES!</p>
              <p><strong>Food for thought</strong>: In the past our Grandparents work hard for the government and country to where we are now. Billions in reserve. Shouldn't the government provide help for them too, now that some are starving in the streets? Don't flame me, the government is doing a decent job in helping the needy, but I feel that more should be done. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>to have babies in a family is a private matter</p>
              <p>To have a substainable population in terms of economy makes it a national direction and objective.</p>
              <p>If there is no national interest in having babies, then on wat grounds does the gov have in implementing baby bonuses etc which is about private matters</p>
              <p>About a conducive environment for a baby, it largely depend on your expectation. It is strange tat the poorest nations have the highest birth rate while rich nations have low birth rate. Mostly it is probably due to different expectation on wat the child should get</p>
              <p>And stop at 2 is a policy stopped probably 20 years ago. Changing and modifying of policies over time is a sign of strength, not weakness</p>

              <p>err...why should humanity NOT have more babies? If we look at it from the biological level, are we depriving ourself of that capability?</p>
              <p>Overpopulated? Hardly.</p>
              <p>Limited resources? Impossible with our scientific progress - stacked up housing, double/tripled yield grain, etc.</p>
              <p>Immortality? Impossible yet and years from fruitation.</p>
              <p>Why is the scientific mind constantly looking to the stars in attempts to unravel its secrets? Maybe one day, we singaporeans may have enough to provide for ALL in all aspects of social spending and then perhaps built our own module for the International Space Station, for research and developement of the furthering of mankind.</p>
              <p>More critically, beyond economic aspects, is the spiritual need of love, cliche as it may sound. Show me a man who needs no love and i will show you an inhuman beast. Love and the manifestation of it through our offspring, is the wild card of science and economy. I dare not even begin to presume i fully understand it.</p>
              <p>Think about this:-</p>
              <p>Economic growth and social progress elevated mankind beyond serfdom, decapitulated the nobility whom rule for thousands of years since the dawn of mankind and now made each and everyone of us all truly equal, with equal opportunity, black or white, rich or poor, to excel as a nation or loaf as we wish to extinction as a state, as we were scientifically and biologically created. Thus did economic growth and social progress helped us mankind?  </p>
