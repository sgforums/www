              <p>we talk about it not because it cannot be changed but because it is the current situation, whether it can be changed does not concern me. i'm only concerned with informing the ignorant of the current facts instead of dumping my own political views on them.</p>
              <p>And as posted previously, i'm assuming the level of service is similar (which is why even "beautiful guys" were used as an example)when i moved on to looks but you assumed looks overwrites services.</p>
              <p>beauty is always in the eye of the beholder but judging from your preferances i doubt i'll be receiving any fat tips in the near future</p>

              <p>maybe but when it comes to certain areas i usually prefer to be helped by older workers because they appear more experienced unless its an old worker thats new in the trade.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>funny thing that gay people are mentioned because i'm actually quite biased against them when it comes to service and retail areas, after working beside them and having been served by a few, the ones i've seen are quite tempermental and usually any acceptable levels of service flies out of the window together with their temper whenever they lose it.</p>
              <p>most memorable one i recalled was a rude guy in a resturant in Orchard who's service went from bad to worse when told of the poor service. and judging from his response,  it gave us a great deal of comfort that we told him whats going on after all the food is served</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore government plans to spend an additional
              S$700 million a year on measures to boost its flagging birth rate.
              Currently, it spends about S$900 million a year.
              <br> <br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his National Day Rally
              speech on Sunday night that a baby brings much joy, but can also be a
              logistic and financial challenge, so a slew of measures will be
              implemented by the government to create more time and more funds to
              help parents cope with their children.
              <br> <br><strong>Paid maternity leave will be extended from 12 weeks to 16 weeks</strong>,
              and the extra four weeks can be taken anytime during the baby's first
              year. It was previously extended from eight to 12 weeks in 2004.
              <br> <br><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There will also be a larger baby bonus for first-time parents, more
              tax incentives to encourage mothers to work, more incentives for the
              fifth and subsequent children, and more financial support for couples
              who go for In-Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) treatment. </span></span><br> <br> On top of that, Mr Lee said parenting is not just the mother's responsibility.
              <br> <br>"I used to change nappies, in the days before Pampers. So you've
              actually got to fold the cloth, you've got to put it on, you've got to
              put the safety pin, I haven't pricked any baby yet. If I can do it,
              that means anybody can do it," he quipped.
              <br> <br>Emphasising that parenting is a job for both parents has influenced
              some policy changes which he hopes will help to shift attitudes.
              <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Childcare leave, which can be claimed by either parent, will be
              extended from two to six days per year. </span></span><br> <br>There will also be one week of unpaid infant-care leave per year,
              and mums or dads can claim it until their child turns two years old. <br> <br> Mr Lee acknowledged that professional women find the cost of not
              working the highest, and he cited his own mother's work-life choices.
              <br> <br>A successful lawyer, Mrs Lee Kuan Yew chose to put her children
              first, took on fewer cases, avoided evening work functions and ate
              lunch at home every day with her children. <br> <br> He said having children is a personal choice, and parents have to decide their own priorities.
              <br> <br> The government will help by catering to demand and creating 20,000
              places at 200 new childcare centres over the next five years. There
              will also be more financial support to help kindergartens upgrade their
              staff and curricula, as well as more financial help for parents.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said: "These measures all add up to a very significant
              package. We are talking of about maybe S$700 million a year. If more
              babies are born, it will be more than S$700 million a year. But even
              that is about double of what we are spending today on child incentives
              and all together we will have about S$1.6 billion spent a year or 0.6
              per cent of GDP."
              <br> <br>For many people in Singapore, getting married is the first
              priority. Mr Lee said the government would do what it could to help,
              but urged young Singaporeans not to leave it till it is too late and to
              make time to go out, meet new friends and if necessary, join a dating
              agency.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee also spent some time sharing humorous stories from the
              feedback he received from dating agencies, including unrealistic
              expectations and poor social graces.
              <br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">He announced that the government will merge the Social Development
              Unit (SDU) which caters to graduates, and the Social Development
              Service (SDS) for non-graduates to increase matchmaking flexibility and
              activities. </span><br></span> <br>SDU will also come up with an SDU Trust Mark to ensure that those
              who prefer using private dating agencies will get quality service.</span></p>

              <p>Mostly naive and unrealistic solutions. He thinks just throw money will solve the problem meh ?</p>
              <p>Yes, Mrs Lee Kwan Yee very good.. and she is also a lawyer.. how many women are lawyers and have the luxury of doing what Mrs LKY can do ?</p>
              <p>Other women try to do the same , kena the cold storage treatment ok ?</p>
              <p>Keep extending the paid maternity leave.. what for ?</p>
              <p>Only make hiring foreign workers more attractive to companies only mah.</p>
              <p>What we need is a work life balance and work hours flexibility so BOTH parents can occasionally tend to their young during work hours.. not just for the couple months... it's the whole growing up period of their children until they reach teenage years.</p>
              <p>We all very gian paid leave meh ? After that extended paid leave.. go back to shit load of work accumulated during the maternity leave. More stressful ok ! Not only sleep deprived.. still have to work till heart attack.</p>
              <p>Babies are not horses . They don't start walking and running around.. and feed themselfs after only few days away from the womb . SG babies are not super babies They fall ill , how ? Get chicken pox or measles how ? All eat grass lor.</p>
              <p>Increase child care centers ?. Xiao boh ? More chance to hire foreign teachers ah? Is that also going to make it cheaper ?</p>
              <p>This is what a MAN will do to come up with a naive solution on a pinch. He thinks mothers after give birth already.. just hand over the baby to strangers like how she hand over her finished work ? Then why give birth if she cannot even spend more precious time with her baby ?</p>
              <p>How many mothers left their hearts with the baby at child care ? He can understand this meh ? Let mothers stay at home to bond with their children when they are young lah !!!</p>
              <p>He bloody must have never really taken care of his own babies before. Too many maids and helpers buzzing around taking care of HIS babies ,while he read his " how to be a good dad" book in his cozy office lah.</p>
              <p>Yes.. true professional mothers has the highest cost of not working. But he never understand that children WILL grow up ? Babies don't remain babies forever. A child needs their parents full time care in the BEGINNING years after birth.</p>
              <p>This cost of not working can be repaid once the child is no longer fuly dependent on her, a professional mother can always play catch up with her career. Age discrimination at the work place is the problem now.</p>
              <p>And stop the blardy open leg foreign worker policy. When the future looks bleak who will be willing to give birth ?</p>
              <p>Men.. they think they have the solution to a woman's dilemma... PFFT ~!!!!</p>

              <p>Mostly naive and unrealistic solutions. He thinks just throw
                  money will solve the problem meh ?</p>
              <p>Yes, Mrs Lee Kwan Yee very good.. and she is also a lawyer.. how
                  many women are lawyers and have the luxury of doing what Mrs LKY
                  can do ?</p>
              <p>Other women try to do the same , kena the cold storage treatment
                  ok ?</p>
              <p>Keep extending the paid maternity leave.. what for ?</p>
              <p>Only make hiring foreign workers more attractive to companies
                  only mah.</p>
              <p>What we need is a work life balance and work hours flexibility
                  so BOTH parents can occasionally tend to their young during work
                  hours.. not just for the couple months... it's the whole growing up
                  period of their children until they reach teenage years.</p>
              <p>We all very gian paid leave meh ? After that extended paid
                  leave.. go back to shit load of work accumulated during the
                  maternity leave. More stressful ok ! Not only sleep deprived..
                  still have to work till heart attack.</p>
              <p>Babies are like not horses . They don't start walking and
                  running around.. and feed themselfs after only few days away from
                  the womb . SG babies are not super babies They fall ill , how ? Get
                  chicken pox or measles how ? All eat grass lor.</p>
              <p>Increase child care centers ?. Xiao boh ? More chance to hire
                  foreign teachers ah?</p>
              <p>This is what a MAN will do to come up with a naive solution on a
                  pinch. He thinks mothers after give birth already.. just hand over
                  the baby to strangers like how she hand over her finished work ?
                  Then why give birth if she cannot even spend more precious time
                  with her baby ?</p>
              <p>How many mothers left their hearts with the baby at child care ?
                  He can understand this meh ? Let mothers stay at home to bond with
                  their children when they are young lah !!!</p>
              <p>He bloody must have never really taken care of his own babies
                  before. Too many maids and helpers buzzing around taking care of
                  HIS babies ,while he read his " how to be a good dad" book in his
                  cozy office lah.</p>
              <p>Yes.. true professional mothers has the highest cost of not
                  working. But he never understand that children WILL grow up ?
                  Babies don't remain babies forever. A child needs their parents
                  full time care in the BEGINNING years after birth.</p>
              <p>This cost of not working can be repaid once the child is no
                  longer fuly dependent on her, a professional mother can always play
                  catch up with her career. Age discrimination at the work place is
                  the problem now.</p>
              <p>And stop the blardy open leg foreign worker policy. When the
                  future looks bleak who will be willing to give birth ?</p>
              <p>Men.. they think they have the solution to a woman's dilemma...
                  PFFT ~!!!!</p>

              <p>the govt always has a policy of throwing money at a problem to "solve" it or at least appear to make an effort to stop the complains. he listed those "answers" as an alternative, a growing number of parents are known to use them even if you find it unacceptable. its just an additional choice, he's not going to pass a law to make everyone use childcare centers. he never claimed its the only solution.</p>
              <p> work life balance and work hours flexibility isn't unachievable but it
                  involves a lot of  "comfort zones" which bosses and workers will find it
                  hard to give up. at the end of the day if i'm a boss, i definately don't want to hire someone only to know she's pregnant and won't be around for the next half a year while on the payroll. likewise i wouldn't want to work for someone doesn't even bother to put my welfare in his/her heart.</p>
              <p>but welfare do not mean bosses get walked all over with people saying</p>
              <p>"the law allows me to do this so you have to give me my maternity leave what happens to your business is non of my business and if you discrimate me i'll go to MOM. "</p>
              <p>if thats your idea of protection for the workers then sooner or later workers would abuse the system and create a situation where bosses naturally prefer FTs who are more flexible and cheaper.</p>
              <p> my previous company's hours are long(10+hrs) but when you get a flexible manager, its easier to get time off when something comes up, you take your maternity leave according to your needs and co workers cover up for you when you're not around so work doesn't pile up. and thats the situation for the past 4 years i was there.</p>
              <p>things don't always have to be as negative as you perceive them.</p>

              <p>well , my ex colleague's kid's already 4 and she still takes all sorts of funny child related leave i've never heard of, another male colleague was given the same option for his kid when she was 7? so where i used to work age didn't seem to be a factor? bottomline was as long as work isn't affect anything goes.</p>
              <p>there is no policy in the world that cannot be abused only whether there's anyone trying. just as you've advocated moving with the times, once a policy/law has been passed, you'll get people who "upgrade" themselves to deal with the policy. just like declaring something unbreakable would have people try to til someone succeeds.</p>
              <p>and i'm not against protecting employee welfare, just the more extreme sides of it. on quiting my 2nd job, my boss had me signing a letter to declare i have already received all my pay when i suggested a more flexible method to resolving payment at the time.</p>
              <p>and when it comes to FTs........ at least for some employers they're more flexible and cheaper but it depends on the country of origin and the way the're hired or fired.</p>
