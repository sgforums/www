              <p>These days you walk along Orchard Road, you will notice that the level of Singaporeans' Chinese has gone up, while their proficiency in English has gone down, not that their level of English was any good in the beginning. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>As negative writers begins to move in and show off their intellectual prowess ( or rather, their lack of intellect!), I would like to comment that there is no situation that is too tough or too hard to solve.</p>
              <p>Nothing is impossible and impossible is nothing.</p>
              <p>All it takes is to understand and comprehend the problems we citizens faced, dwell no more on the past for it is history and will not change anything, and then take the necessary steps and most critically, the will to make the change, without tearing our social fabric.</p>
              <p>The birth issue, as mentioned, is beyond politics and must not be politicised. Whatever political affiliations we have, we all the faced the same issue of declining birth rates and its effects, soon to come.</p>
              <p>PAP, WP, SDA, the green party or whatever, whomever gains power,  will want to reverse this decline, not just for economic reasons, but for the well being of our State ( our society). They too, are Singaporeans, not envious PRs, or axe to grind Ex-singaporeans.</p>

              <p>LoL The role of the government is supposed to be to serve the people, be the people's means to an end: a safe peaceful society.</p>
              <p>But down in SG it seems the reverse is true: People become the means to the government's goals of enconomic growth and justification of high salary. When the economy is not good i see articles like (quote from memory) 'key to staying no. 1: young hungry Singaporeans'. And when the economy is good or going to die the govt give its ministers bonuses..</p>
              <p>How sad.... i wonder where this path will end for SG.. Doesnt the government get that nobody will treat this place as home if it continues to treat its people like livestock. I see no light at the end of the tunnel... In future i foresee SG wont be a country but some sort of huge corporation LoL</p>

              <p>if u talk about quality of life and number of hours worked, I
                  suggest u talk with the boss of your company about it. It is they
                  who give u the hours to work and it is your colleagues who
                  work OT giving to the pressure. If your boss, like toyota or some
                  US companies who wanna give the employees a good quality of life,
                  the gov is not gonna force them to stop. Tis is all about your job
                  and the gov cannot interfere much into it. U don't like your job
                  environment, then I guess u should try to find a lazy job
                  with little things and probably low pay instead.</p>
              <p>If u talk about propaganda, religion and confucianism r
                  classified as propaganda themselves.</p>
              <p>Then wat do u suggest the gov to do ? If they promote people to
                  give birth to babies by giving incredible benefit, r they fair to
                  people who choose to remain single or childless (given the tax tat
                  support tis benefit comes from all sector) ? If the gov want
                  to change the people mentality and portray happy family lives to
                  promote population growth in a soft way, u guys complained tis is
                  gov propaganda. If they don't ask u guys to give birth and import
                  people into the society, u guys complain tis is anti-nationalism
                  and they r here snatching your rice bowls. If they do not do
                  anything at all, the economy becomes saturated and will decline and
                  u guys will complain economic woes.</p>

              <p>There's never a simple solution to such a complicated problem.</p>
              <p>I don't advocate longer paid maternity leave.. because it only back fires .. and make it less desirable for companies to hire women.</p>
              <p>Paternity leave are welcome.. but most important really.. is that men are allowed more flexible work culture .. to help with the kids.. throughout the year. SG culture is horrible when it comes to work flexibility.</p>
              <p>Before a couple starts a family.. they need a nest. At the current HDB rate.. it's still a big burden for a young couple to carry...even for a 3 room flat.</p>
              <p>Being new to the work force.. young couples are worried about a stable income because they lack work experience and track records.</p>
              <p>Right now , A newly married couple is too busy paying for the house.. the bills.. working their ass off to ensure security.. and building up a SAVING... the last thing they want is more expense from making babies.</p>
              <p>Yet this is also the time.. when they are most fertile.</p>
              <p>Perhaps.. deferring payments until couples are more established in their career .. will be a good idea .This will free up more income to provide for their new additions. And start paying off the debt until they are more financially established.. and perhaps with higher income. That will help lessen the strain during the most crucial period of child bearing.</p>
              <p>Encourage mothers to go back to work after the child is in a full day school. We need to set up age discrimination laws.. so age cannot be a requisite for employment unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>
              <p>Give companies incentives to hire mothers instead of xiao mei mei from our third world neighbours.</p>
              <p>Allow for more creation of part time work.</p>
              <p>No mother wants to part with their newborn babies after only 3 months . So young women should be encouraged to give birth when they are younger.. then join the workforce when the children are older.</p>
              <p>Another issue is , single mothers and divorce mothers. More financial and social support for these group of mothers.. We should not discriminate them or make life harder than it already is. After all.. a baby is still a human being.</p>
              <p>Personally.. the NS issue needs to be resolved. Shorten the NS and reservist period. Right now.. with the global movement,  women has the choice to marry a NON-Singaporean so their son need not serve NS.</p>
              <p>Thats all for now.....gota get more beer... :)</p>

              The chinese PR on SG scolarship is really ungrateful...typical of most Chinese coming out of China but to strive for better living here...they are here beacause the over population there means very poor pay and SG woith our exchange rates 5 times of yuan...that's why many Chinese sink their roots here with their uncouth behaviour,husband snatchers,increase in crime rates,more prostitutes at Geylang,etc
              
              
              But children are God's gifts to couple...see so many hve to go for IVF( today's ST) and yet can't have kids..I seriously doubt couple have kids because of govt's incentives...babies are natural culminations of marriage of hopefully love despite our divorce rate has surpassed 7000 in 2007...

              <p>The government's policies affect our lives. Same goes with other countries in the world. The difference here is, the government doesnt value our opinions seriously and they still think that we are just ignorant citizens. Maybe there is no fear of being replaced immediately if the citizens are not happy with the performance.</p>
              <p>The policies the government made in the past are good, it brings us to where we are now. I'm very proud of it! But now, I'm sure Singaporeans are educated enough to contribute to the designing of policies. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>What do you guys think? Do we still need many more years of spoon-feeding? Political awarness in Singapore is increasing amongst the young, but the progress is very slow.</p>
              <p>Are PRs political conscious too? Discuss haha...(sounds like writting essay for exams)</p>

              <p>A simple gesture of handshake as a form of greeting is often miscontrued as something else amongst different cultures. This is only an example on the complexities of life when even a simple decision of greeting have to be considered, even within our multi-ethnic society.</p>
              <p>Similarly so, when a State ( our society ) makes a final decision on a policy.</p>
              <p>It would erroneous and i would say mischevious, if the allegation that our govt ( our elected officials ) do not listen or take into consideration of our views. Thing is, there are many clamouring to make their views known, from the constructive to the mad ones.</p>
              <p>Who should our govt ( elected officials ) listen to then? You, me? Just because you or my proposals are not selected and enacted, does that mean the govt is not listening to me and you?</p>
              <p>There are several channels of feedback the govt depends on. It is often debated on within the civil service, whom we taxpayers are paying top dollars for the best, to rationalise, streamline and find the best solution</p>
              <p> - a solution that may not suit all, but at least the majority, and a solution which will not suit even the majority now, but will ensure the long time survival of the many millions later. As well as a solution that may not suit a particular ethnic group or even all ethnic groups, but a solution that will suit our State ( we the citizens of this nation ).</p>
              <p>Decisions of which as they had made which ensured the labour of our past are fruitful and will ensure all aspects of social life are respected, not only just in the birth issue, but many other social issues as well for the present and the future. Hard and difficult decisions, simply because we don't own Singapore individually, but collectively, as a multi-ethnic nation. </p>
              <p>At the end of the day, we still have the freedom of vote - dissolving the parliament ( resignation of policy makers ) at an election, to either want the elected officials to remain for doing a good job, or vote for another team to form the next govt if they can do a better job, not just out of spite. Your vote is crucial for the survival of our society, but still, it is your choice and your level of maturity to make that one vote count. </p>

              <p>Tat is true but it is the mindset of companies and people.
              Educational knowledge does not depreciate but they r more rusty
              compared with fresh and enthusiastic graduates. Furthermore mothers
              tend to take care of their family over their career. If their son
              felt sick, they will skip an important meeting by throwing leave.
              Why companies do tis is for very human reasons.</p>
              <p>Is it ? I thought they can</p>

              <p>In the asian context, the mother is likely to be the one taking the leave. U may say tis is MCP but i believe most of the time, the women will be more likely to be the one taking the leave. Generally in an asian family, the primary provider is still the male, while the secondary income provider is the female.</p>

              <p><br>i fully support age-blind policy on vocation except on airline industry.</p>
              <p>i finds no pleasure at all on being served by middle-age ladies on the plane. i am a lot more comfortable with sq girls.  </p>
              <p>if you are traveling 18hours to stateside, i think i am entitled to a little tlc by the younger homosapiens.</p>
              <p>my company recently changed its airline travel policy from flying-on-a-national-carrier to flying on a cheapest-ticketed-airline, which means from sq to northwest or ua. now, i travel a lot, lot less on external customer meeting. (must say technology has also improved. we have virtual meeting room now where we can see the other person almost like `live' across the table. so, it eliminates internal meeting travel)</p>

              <p>Solli to dissapoint you ok ? I prefer LV Guess bag look good on ME. Even without the model holding it.. we will still buy.. because we are buying the bag.. not the model. In fact.. it is a real waste of money to hire expensive female models just to hold the bag to show me.. I'd rather they save the money and make that bag cheaper.</p>
              <p>In Asian context ?.. Harlow ?.. In the OLD asian context.. women stay home .. men work. Times are moving ahead.. not backward..now we have women working. .. gettit ?</p>
              <p>The role has changed.. why couldn't the mindset of men ? Excuses excuses..or just that men are in denial ?</p>
              <p>Women take more money ? I no understand. Please explain.</p>
              <p>And why should women be the one to take leave ? Men cannot do it ?</p>
