              <h1>Teo Chee Hean called for “leadership renewal” within political sphere</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <p class="dateleft"> </p>
              <p class="dateleft"><strong></strong></p>
              <div class="dateleft">Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean has called for “leadership renewal” not just within the political sphere but also the community during a speech made at the NUS ministerial forum yesterday.</div>
              <div class="dateleft"><em>“We need active citizens who are prepared to come forward to actively and constructively contribute to making Singapore a better home for all of us,”</em> he was quoted as saying in Channel News Asia.</div>
              </div>
              <p>He did not elaborate more on what he meant exactly by “leadership renewal”.</p>
              <p>The Singapore government is indeed in urgent need of some “leadership renewal”.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is already 58 years old this year. The two senior ministers are above 60 years of age while DPM Wong Kan Seng is 64 years old. Of course, there is the octogenarian Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew who will be 87 years old this year.</p>
              <p>The retirement age of Singaporeans is 62 and so it is high time that these ministers retire and make way for younger leaders to replace them not that Singapore requires so many SMs, MMs and DPMs to help the Prime Minister govern a country with a landmass of only 700 sqkm2.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, their services do not come cheap. The Prime Minister’s Office alone cost more than $10 million dollars annually in terms of wages alone.</p>
              <p>No country in the world has so many ministers helping a Prime Minister. Malaysia, a country of 28 million people has only one Deputy Prime Minister and no SM or MM.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo exhorted Singaporeans to come forward to build a “better” Singapore, but the PAP continues to hold on tightly all levers of power in the country and refuses to let go.</p>
              <p>Repressive and ridiculous laws are put in place to curtail the civil and political liberties of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Defamation lawsuits are employed frequently by PAP leaders to bankrupt and cripple those who dare to voice out their disagreements against them.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo ended his speech by pointing to “Singapore’s reserves and strong investment in defence as examples of big anchors that keep the country stable.”</p>
              <p><em>“So the question is: should all of you be so frightened that all of you abandon ship straightaway?  No, the answer is ‘no’. What I’m trying to put to you is, you should have a well-founded confidence in our own future. Why? Because even though we have vulnerabilities, we have anchors against these vulnerabilities, and indeed we have many, many strengths for the future,”</em> he said.</p>
              <p>Singapore was reported to have lose billions of dollars of its national reserves via its two sovereign wealth funds in failed overseas investments last year.</p>
              <p>Till today, the exact losses are not revealed to Singaporeans. How can Mr Teo expect us to have confidence in our future when the PAP appears to have so many things to hide from us?</p>
              <p>Instead of talking so much, perhaps he should practice what he preaches by replacing himself with a younger leader as part of his proposed “leadership renewal” since he always appear to be lethargic in parliament and was caught napping once on television:</p>

              <p><br>Which son ?</p>
              <p>The one who is unfortunate to be unable to see the light of day without dark glasses ?</p>
              <p>Of the arrogant one that believe his family position allow him to supercede the military chain of command ?</p>
              <p>Or was there another one more junior that presently has yet to make its own mark ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is unfortunate that this call for leadership renewal is another ploy to maintain the status quo when the existing hand-picked leadership has yet to show that they are able to stand on their own merit, and continue to be in the shadows of LKY and his schemes with election gerrymeandering.</p>

              <p>I think at this stage within the party, he maybe the only safe choice....because defence issued has been independent from local politics. He kept his name out most of the time.</p>
