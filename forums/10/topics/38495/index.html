"we need more time!!!"<br><br>bah! its been 12 goddamn years of weapons inspections and uncooperative iraq!<br><br>the french don't care about saddam or iraq... they're against it cos they want to lead a counter force against the US in world affairs.<br><br>not to mention that french companies have signed contracts with saddam to take effect once sanctions have lifted... and the Kurds have made it clear that they won't recognise it in their area of control once saddam is gone. would the new post-saddam regime recognise french contracts? i say make them eat it.<br><br>peace activists say they're against saddam but object to the killing of iraqi civillians... is there another way to remove the entire regime without killing a single civillian? make saddam leave? latest reports indicates that he won't... assasinate him? doesn't work, never has, bad idea. and many die everyday now anyway. from disease, from privation, from arrests, torture and executions.<br><br>whats this about caring for civillians? never mind if their own despot kills them, but its bad if US bombs kill them... please...<br><br>maybe the world will only wisen up AFTER they see saddam pops gas on his neighbours... or his own people again.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>War aside... where there is a sinking ship, the rats can be seen running out.<br><br>France has said that they will "support" the coalition... after they caused this war to happen.  They've vetoed everything and showed Saddam that the UN, through them, is disunited and useless.  In an insane bid for power, France lost the plot, destroyed the credibility of the UN and forced the hand of the US and its allies to act against Iraq... and this will polarise the world when the nutcases in the Middle East play the Religion card.<br><br>Now they say they will support the coalition... General Patton once said that he'd rather have a German division in front of him than a French division behind him.<br><br>Then there Hans Blix.  He comes out saying that Iraq will not use chemical weapons or any WMD on the allied troops because it will cause a change in world opinion.<br><br>Uhh... hello??? Is this doubletalk?  If he's done his job right, then what the hell is he talking about Iraqi chemical weapons?? Every single one of his reports reek like dead fish on a hot day!  There are no definite reports saying Saddam has disarmed, and there are no definite reports saying Saddam hasn't.  Yet there are weapons found to be destroyed... All this arguing was over 6 months!  And before that, Saddam had 10 years to hide his weapons!  6 months?  I can hide the blasted National Stadium in 6 months!<br><br>Soon, more rats will surface..<br><br>It is the nature of International Politics, idiots and morons.<br><br>This is such a tragedy, I almost want to cry.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the US and Israel know a little fact... and a few other people know this too... some know but refuse to admit to it.. that <strong>Palestine as a country never existed</strong>...<br>-------------------------------<br>Way back on March 31, 1977, the Dutch newspaper Trouw published an interview with Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee member Zahir Muhsein. Here's what he said:<br>The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism.<br><br>For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan.<br>---------------------------------<br><br>So what do you think of the PLO?<br><br>Remember.. these are the people whose protection of Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade cause more damage to their "own cause" then all the Israelis can ever do... remember Barak and his offer which was thrown out of the window by Arafat?<br><br>The Israelis are brutal... but there is this very true saying there..<br><br>If the Arabs put down their arms, there will be peace in the Middle East.<br>If the Israelis put down their arms, they will be extinct.<br><br>What would you do against everyone who is out to destroy you?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body">The USA should play hardball towards Sharon and the intransigent warhawks in Israel too.<br><br>These Israelis are giving the world a headache with their supremacist right to their own national survival, at the expense of the Palestinian Rights to their own land - which is as much the birthplace of any Jew as it is for the Palestinians.<br><br>The expanding Israeli New Settlements by taking land from Palestinians - through legislations, or outright land grab - is fueling the conflicts in the Middle-East.<br><br>This has given opportunity to the likes of Saddam and Osama to appear on the world stage with a legitimate cause.<br><br>This will portray the continuous efforts of USA fight against terrorism - as a battle against Muslims.<br><br>Now that an Israeli Army bulldozer has crushed a US Peacenik - offering herself as a human shield to prevent the destruction of a Palestinian home - perhaps, it is time for US to give Sharon and his warhawks a slap across their butts.<br><br>If the might of the US can dictate the departure of Saddam from Iraq, then this same strength should also allow it to demand from the Israelis a respect to the Peace Process as outlined by the UN, in their many resolutions passed - and which Israel has not observed too.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

Under that program, Iraqi oil proceeds are put into a U.N. escrow account and can be used by Iraq (news - web sites) to buy food and medicine.<br><br>The new plan, which is based on the assumption Saddam Hussein (news - web sites) will be quickly overthrown, will probably be presented for approval shortly after war begins, according to senior diplomats and U.N. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.<br><br>In an effort to win swift Security Council approval, the plan would be submitted by Secretary-General Kofi Annan (news - web sites), rather than by Washington and London, whose forces would effectively be occupying Iraq by that time, diplomats said.<br><br>Washington and London would not get direct access to the vast Iraqi cash reserves in the U.N. escrow account. Instead, control would temporarily be turned over to Annan, who would prioritize Iraq's humanitarian needs and buy the needed supplies.<br><br>London and Washington are still working out many of the details. Diplomats said the duration of the setup will depend on how long it takes the military to stabilize Iraq.<br><br>The U.N. oil-for-food program feeds 60 percent of Iraq's 22 million people. It was designed to alleviate burdens created by the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The humanitarian supplies are distributed by U.N. and Iraqi government workers, while the United Nations oversees Iraqi oil production and sales.<br><br>Over the years, the U.N. account, the oil-for-food program and an elaborate monitoring mechanism designed to prevent Iraqis from using the money to buy weapons have all been the subject of bitter debate in the Security Council.<br><br>France and Russia, with the highest number of Iraqi business deals, have accused Washington of blocking the sales of some items that could have military applications. The United States has argued that tighter restrictions were needed to prevent Iraq from rearming.<br><br>During the past several weeks, Russia and France were both accused of trying to prevent a war to protect their extensive business interests in Iraq. The Bush administration, with its close ties to the U.S. oil industry, has had to face suggestions that it is mostly interested in Iraq for its oil.<br><br>Some said that perception helped convince Washington that it should give the United Nations a role to play in Iraq, even if the Security Council refused to support war.<br><br>"The United States needs the U.N. most here because of the serious image problems it risks if this administration was seen controlling the Iraqi oil," said Lee Feinstein, a senior fellow with the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations.<br><br></div>

Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism.<br><br>For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan.<br>---------------------------------<br><br>So what do you think of the PLO?<br><br>Remember.. these are the people whose protection of Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade cause more damage to their "own cause" then all the Israelis can ever do... remember Barak and his offer which was thrown out of the window by Arafat?<br><br>The Israelis are brutal... but there is this very true saying there..<br><br>If the Arabs put down their arms, there will be peace in the Middle East.<br>If the Israelis put down their arms, they will be extinct.<br><br>What would you do against everyone who is out to destroy you?<br>[/b]</blockquote>Interesting article that you have posted, and would add that this is nothing new, as Israel has posted more then what this PLO Official has said - (try the sites below).<br><br><a href="http://www.science.co.il/Israel-history.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.science.co.il/Israel-history.asp</a><br><br><a href="http://www.cdn-friends-icej.ca/isreport/july01/history_palestine.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdn-friends-icej.ca/isreport/july01/history_palestine.html</a><br><br>Right or wrong, irregardless of whether Palestine exist as a country - which one can identify with distinctive political boundaries - the fact remains that there are displaced people, as a consequence of the 'artificial changes' made to the land by the British and French Colonial Government of this region just after WW2.<br><br>Israel as a state, or a country with defined political borders, no longer existed when the Roman Empire swept across the various communities that are found along the eastern rim of the Mediteranean Sea.<br><br>With the Romans conquering this entire region, the Jews were dispersed to the four corners of the world.<br><br>The land areas that formed the present day Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Israel were ruled in succession by peoples from outside this region from 146 B.C. till 1948 A.D - with the British being the last rulers of the land.<br><br>When the Jews were allowed to return to this land that is referred conveniently as Palestine, they had to be settled somewhere in this tight corridor of space - from the eastern shores of the Mediteranean on one side, and the banks of the Dead Sea on the other side.<br><br>With the Jews having left the place of their historical origin for more then 1,000 years and with their sudden return by political arrangements of Colonial Rulers, the local residents have to make way for the returning Jews.<br><br>When more Jews returned - (as recorded during those early days of modern Israeli history) - it resulted in more local residents being moved out of THEIR TRADITIONAL LAND.<br><br>The return of the Jews have since continued from 1948 till the present day; and with more new settlements being created from land that is legislated or simply grabbed from the LOCAL Residents - whom are conveniently referred to as Palestinians.<br><br>Even if there is no country named as "Palestine" in history - (and by extension one would conclude that there is no such people called "Palestinians" ) - it does not lessen the injustice done to these displaced people, simply to readjust history to accomodate the return of the Jews to a land that they have voluntarily fled, and an anciet country that was wiped off the map of the world for more then 1,000 years.<br><br>If every people, or race,.or community, or ethnicity, is allowed to claim their historical rights to any piece of land, and evict those who have been living on the same piece of land for generations passed to the present day, such claims can only lead to chaos, confusion to world order, and resulting in violent conflicts to preserve and reclaim territories lost.<br><br>Although, much has been said of the use of violence and terrorism by the PLO, and of their relations with extremist groups, one should not forget that the creation of Israel was made possible only by the similar use of terrorist tactics by the advanced parties of Jews that were allowed to arrive by the British Colonial Government.<br><br>The Jews that returned to this land in 1948, formed underground cells to terrorise the families of the British Colonial Government, attacking the British Military Facilities, to steal their weapons and equipment, and cause havoc and civil disorder with sabotage of civil facilities; and the ultimate terrorist weapon of assassination was also used by the Jewish Underground.<br><br>What difference does it make if the PLO is using the same strategy to ensure their own existence and their own rights to the land of their birth which they did not leave since even before the arrival of the Romans; and even before the time of Abraham - the Father of the Jews.<br><br></div>
