              <p><br>good and valid point.</p>
              <p>you must have found some 'conspiracy theory' stories about the rise of these Activists and their real motives.</p>
              <p>There is also mention that The Online Citizen writers are / were formerlly working as writers for the u-know-who . What is clear is their writing skills are as good as MSM ST newspaper writers ;)</p>
              <p>1 thing for sure, their activities have been well covered by the MSM.</p>
              <p>2ndly, their writers have been getting Mass Media appearances.</p>
              <p>I do not see as much media attention given to LTK.</p>
              <p>For now, I am observing the situation.</p>
              <p>People have been disappointed too much by the Chi stories. Cannot blame them.</p>
              <p>Yes, we must be vigilant and observe their every move.</p>
              <p>People is the largest party , so-to-speak.</p>
              <p>Lets question them to find out more.</p>
              <p>I tried but got my posts deleted immediately each time I question TOC.</p>
              <p>I think, to be responsible to the Public, they need to clarify once and for all.</p>
              <p>Avoiding and deferring this question is not long term solution.</p>
              <p>I think more things will come to light as we near 2011.</p>
              <p>A person with common sense will know not to fully believe until they can answer the questions people have asked about their involvement and the real reasons behind these people stepping forward.</p>
              <p>Who is for the People and</p>
              <p>Who is working for their boss for personal advantage?</p>
              <p>No idea man.</p>
              <p>conspiracy theory continues...Paper cannot contain the fireball of truth.</p>

              <p>It is not a surprise that the Government aka the Ruling Party has allowed the main Singapore Broadcast and Print Media to give publicity to the likes of ex-PAP annointed personalities such as Tan Kin Lian and Ngiam Tong Dow {retired Senior Civil Servant}.</p>
              <p>These "politically safe" personalities speak boldly from their minds, and are used by the PAP to act as a "safety valve" to allow this over-controlled society to have a representative voice to ventilate the built-up frustrations and disappointments.</p>
              <p>It is better to be criticised by someone whom you can control or moderate, then to be severely embarrassed politically by one's nemesis.</p>
              <p>How can the PAP accept the idea of giving the same level of publicity to CSJ or to SDP as that given to these "politically acceptable" personalities approved by the PAP ?</p>

              <p>my sentiments exactly.</p>
              <p>i winced reading all the publicity given to TKL by the local media here as `championing the cause of the man in the street'.</p>
              <p>all those who placed high hopes on TKL are hoodwinked.</p>

              <p>Once a person retires, logically he will just want to stay out of limelight and enjoy life.</p>
              <p>So if a person chooses to champion something, either he seriously believe in a certain cause, or he has no choice but is "forced" (either morally or otherwise) to do so because if not, he may face consequence to "affect" his retirement, or he is doing it for his personal "redemption".</p>
