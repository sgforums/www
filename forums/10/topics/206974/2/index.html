            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the Malaysian Press has been speculating on him playing a greater role within UMNO and Malaysian Politics as a whole. To do so, one has to win the support and consent of the core members of UMNO who will favour a strong pro-bumiputra leader who shares their sentiments and views on Malaysia politics.

These speeches have affected the domestic audience from other ethnic communities more then raising any interest from Singaporeans.<br><br>Khairy will do well to learn from PM Badawi, by remaining calm and less agitated; use the interim period to crystalyse and accumulate his thoughts and substances before making a blast at his critiques.<br><br>It has already been <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>more then two years</strong></span> since PM Badawi came into office, and not one jibe has been made from anyone in his Cabinet towards Singapore.<br><br>Even the <span style="font-style: italic;">'abominable'</span> Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar has toned down his characteristically undiplomatically fiesty attitude and remarks towards Singapore - in total contrast to his often repeated antics during Mahathir's term in office.<br><br>Change comes slowly, and PM Badawi has his plate full that will require more time to be cleared and digested - and he will show that <span style="font-style: italic;">'good Muslims'</span> exist and can be good National Leaders to rise above petty politics.<br><br></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Politics remains politics, politicans are still politicians, malaysian government built a bridge in their opposition state and singaporean government opened a MRT station in the opposition constituency. with the little development in Kelantan I can see how building a bridge in a state is such as big thing. Look at the state of development Sabah and Sarawah, and talk to the people there, they are still wandering what the central government would do for them. Badawi can make the difference, but he has a lot to do. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> In malaysia, they are used to hearing a lot, but nothing is for sure until things are done.<br><br>Khairy is not a nobody, he is the deputy chairman of UMNO Youth and is very much supported by the chairman and everybody. If even his son-in-law is quick to draw out the singapore card when he faced problem, how Pak La can prevent the others from using the card will be a real test to him, or does he want to? as long as the card benefit him? He is not asking his son in law to apologise, UMNO Youth chairman is defending him when asked by MCA youth to apologise for playing the racial card. He is not nobody.<br><br>We should leave it to them to play their game, even if they use singapore as bogeyman, but there is still a long way to go for us to have any part in the game. The better bet is still Bataam and Bintan in Indonesia.</div>
