              <p><a class="sqq" href="http://www.sgforums.com/quotation/a-nation-can-survive-its-fools-and-even-the/365612.html"><span style="color: #000000;">Singapore can survive its fools and even the ambitious. However, it can't survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable as he is known and carries his banner openly but the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers and propaganda rustles through all the alleys obviously being heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not as a traitor but speaks in accents familiar to his victims and he wears their face without a veil and collude with their arguments</span></a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">He appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men and rots the soul of a nation. Moreover, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city. He infects the body politics so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.The traitor is the plague.</span></p>
              <p><a class="sqq" href="http://www.sgforums.com/quotation/where_justice_is_denied-where_poverty_is_enforced/206375.html"><span style="color: #000000;">Where justice is denied and where poverty is enforced, that is where ignorance prevails and where any one class is made to feel that our society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them. Hence, neither persons nor property will be safe.</span></a></p>
              <p><a class="sqq" href="http://www.sgforums.com/quotation/wolves_which_batten_upon_lambs-lambs_consumed_by/321915.html"><span style="color: #000000;">Wolves which feed upon lambs are lambs consumed by wolves. We have the strong who immolate the weak who are, unfortunately, the weak victims of the strong</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"><br>There you have Nature and society combining, there you have tje intentions, there you have the scheme. Very much so a perpetual action and reaction. A cycle of vices, a host of virtues. To put it bluntly, a perfect equilibrium resulting from the equality of good and evil on earth.</span></p>
              <p>Because of the system our government implements, there are at least two kinds of cowards. One kind always lives with himself, afraid to face the world. The other kind lives with the world, afraid to face himself.</p>

              <p>I don't see it as whining nor wimps.</p>
              <p>People should speak out when there are unjust practise.</p>
              <p>Just because it had been tolerated before.. does not means it's the right thing to do.</p>
              <p>The older generations may have been abused by our own traditions..yes.. they choose to keep quiet about it... but it does not means they are not psychologically damaged by such practises.</p>
              <p>Newer generations are less restricted and more educated.. so they speak out more.</p>
              <p>The only difference ... are those who speak up.. and do something to improve upon the situation... vs those who speak up .. and not do anything about it.</p>
              <p>If you know something unjust .. yet choose to keep quiet , then you are the biggest wimp of all.</p>

              <p><br>now we're getting somewhere, true, but however, that means it could be getting into a real grey area, then you have to debate what is just and unjust. IMO, I am pro-corporal (i was caned as a kid, by both sch and parents, and yes, I beleive idiots who go deface places i walk past, or deface my car, figuratively speaking, deserve a good spanking) and pro-capital punishment (the thought of having sick fucks out to kill people back on the streets or having to pay taxes to keep their sorry asses alive makes me sick).</p>

              <p>but is true eh..kids can't stand physical punishments..look @ how many kids died in NS currently, as compared to the past..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>last time, ppl also went through the same physical exercises / punishments etc..in fact tougher? but no one complained until like that..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>whereas for now? little bit of punishment must KPKB to parents, principal, shoot emails to MOE =.='''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just like the recent case that happened in China..1 teacher reprimanded a student..and this xiao ah boy is sooooooo traumatizedddd that he KPKB to his parents..his parents felt sooooo heartpain for their kid that they went to confront the teacher &amp; forced her to kneel down &amp; apologized to the student..which is really outrageous! can't young kids nowadays not able to withstand scolding? ..i..</p>

              <p>Various issues just got me thinking, whining about corporal and capital punishment, people whing and bitching, is spanking your child wrong or right debate, etc etc... just got me thinking, in previous generations, everybody has been caned and spanked by their parents and school teachers/DM's/principal....nowadays got this big outcry against it, young men are getting traumatised and getting counselling, yada yada yada, i'm sure you get what i mean. Hell, even in the army they are saying nowadays BMT is easy compared to last time, so seriously are we breeding a society of wimps? anyone share the same sentiment?</p>
