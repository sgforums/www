            <div class='col-md body'>The answer, off course, is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="large"><strong>NO!!</strong></span></span><br><br>But if you've been reading the DEMANDS, ARGUEMENTS put forward by Australia in the NGUYEN TUNONG VAN case, you would not be mistaken to think that Singapore is NOT an independent, successful country - but perhaps in Australia's eyes, we are a backwater, colonial outpost, subject to colonial direction and instruction!<br><br>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br><br>(See extract of article from Straits Times 24/11/05 below)<br><br>By William Choong<br>For The Straits Times<br><br>CANBERRA - THE case of the Australian sentenced to death in Singapore for drug trafficking has received saturation coverage in the Australian media, with many commentators hitting out at Singapore.<br><br>'Stop this injustice. Let him live,' declared a front-page banner headline in the weekend edition of the Sydney Morning Herald.<br><br>Newspaper columnists, letter writers and callers to radio shows have also been vocal in criticising Singapore's decision to proceed with the death sentence for Nguyen Tuong Van, describing it as 'inhumane' and 'barbaric'.<br><br>Nguyen, who admitted acting as a drug courier, was sentenced to death last year after being found guilty of trafficking in almost 400g of heroin, found on him at Changi Airport in December 2002.<br><br>Public anger over Nguyen's execution has intensified recently, with calls for trade sanctions against Singapore, a boycott of Singapore commercial interests in Australia and a referral to the International Court of Justice.<br><br>In a commentary yesterday, the Australian's editor-at-large Paul Kelly yesterday argued that while Singapore had the 'most intimate ties with Australia of any Asian nation', the execution would 'inflict grave damage on its reputation in this country'.<br><br>'The hanging of Nguyen will shock many Australians; it will be seen as a punishment out of proportion with the crime. It will highlight Singapore's authoritarian nature, its denial of civil liberties and the flaws in its awesome record of success,' he wrote.<br><br>(article continues....)<br><br>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br><br><strong>If you are as disgusted as I am over Australia's boorish attitude and bullying antics, join me in a show of solidarity and loyalty - sign the PETITION featured below! PASS the word on!</strong><br><br><span class="large"><strong>Go to <a href="http://www.PetitionOnline.com/SSS01/petition.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.PetitionOnline.com/SSS01/petition.html</a></strong></span><br><br>To: The Citizens of Singapore<br><br>SHOW your support for the sovereignty of our country, for the powers of our courts, and for the fairness of our justice system!<br><br>Say NO to foreign intervention and interference! No to unwarranted insults, media bashing and derision from foreign entities and countries that have no respect for our country, our way of life!<br><br>NO to foreigners demanding special treatments, extraordinary waivers!<br><br>SHOW your rejection of those who only seek to hurt us, discredit us at ALL cost simply to achieve their unreasonable demands.<br><br>The continuous wrangling and demands from Australia for special consideration/treatment in the case of convicted heroin smuggler Nguyen Tuong Van, who is due to be hanged, has revealed the extent of the regard Australia has for Singapore and our laws, courts, and way of life.<br><br>With hardly any consideration for the sovereignty of our written laws and the fairness of our justice system, Australia has, like a bully, insisted that we treat Nguyen differently from all other criminals in Singapore, be it foreigners or locals, simply, it seems, because he has an Australian passport.<br><br>While the SingaporeÂ’s steadfast, legal and fair position on this case is lost to Australia, Australia ups the bullying ante and has gone international in its attempts to discredit us, to diminish our courts of law and to influence/interfere in the very local societal rules that we live by!<br><br>With continual Singapore-bashing in the Australian media and now, threats of hauling us to the International Court of Justice, Australia seems determined to impose on us what she deems as "right" and "wrong", and that we should bend backwards for her even when there is no merit in the request. While all these smack of (Western?) imperialism, it is made especially more pertinent since the citizens of Singapore live under the very same laws that convicted Nguyen. Is Australia suggesting that because Nguyen carries an Australian passport, he is therefore above our laws? And that we must employ double standards Â– one for locals and another for Australians/foreigners?<br><br>NO!<br><br>We sign this petition as a show of faith in our laws and courts, in our justice system!<br><br>We sign this petition as a show of faith in our position in this travesty!<br><br>We sign this petition as a show of unity against unreasonable demands from Singapore!<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Go to <a href="http://www.PetitionOnline.com/SSS01/petition.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.PetitionOnline.com/SSS01/petition.html</a></strong></span><br><strong></strong></div>
