And the older workers will again be in the same situation as in a couple of years ago," questioned Stephen Lee, president of the Singapore National Employers' Federation (SNEF).<br><br>"Our job really is to use these few years to try and change some fundamental practices of companies, to anchor the older workers as part and parcel of their everyday employment policy," he said.<br><br>This is why the proposed re-employment legislation, which will kick in by 2012, is crucial.<br><br>Said Heng Chee How, NTUC's Deputy Secretary-General: "We have started collecting information on cases and examples from our union ground, examples of extension of retirement, is it a simple extension or have there been work arrangements adjusted in different industries to facilitate.<br><br>"So we are now documenting carefully all these cases in order for us to better understand what are the tactics that would work, generally or in given industries and to see how to promote and scale up.<br><br>"We certainly cannot (rely on) the law as the cure. What we need to do is get all these examples and get the first movers, to illustrate that you are not asking companies to do national service. You are actually making a business case."<br><br>Helping Singaporeans work longer is only one part of the solution; ensuring their CPF savings last as long as possible is the other challenge.<br><br>For this reason, Prime Minister Lee announced a delayed drawdown age of the CPF Minimum Sum, starting in 2012. This will then be raised every year.<br><br>A tripartite committee was also set up to study the National Longevity Insurance Plan or better known as an annuities scheme.<br><br>Chaired by Professor Lim Pin, the committee has had six dialogue sessions with various stakeholders, among them trade unionists, employers groups and insurance companies.<br><br>"The few important things people continue to talk about is, can I believe that there is a 50 percent chance of living beyond 85. That's one of the most fundamental issue, because once they don't believe that, the whole scheme is nonsense. So that is the very important part of our work - how to let people know that this is a fact and not a fiction," explained Professor Lim, who chairs the National Longevity Insurance Committee.<br><br>"Suppose I am the one who doesn't get to live that long, do I get the money back and what is the arrangement? Those will be the kind of feedback from the ground," said Mr Heng.<br><br>While details of the scheme have yet to be confirmed, Professor Lim feels that the longevity insurance must benefit the target group, so premiums have to be kept affordable.<br><br>"It's for the low income group, they are the ones who really need it and they will be excluded if you keep on raising the costs. This is the kind of balance you have strike," said Professor Lim.<br><br>Professor Lim hopes to wrap up his committee's work with one more meeting. The final report will be submitted to the Manpower Minister by March 2008. - CNA /ls<br><br></div>
