              <p>There is a difference between freedom of speech and freedom to
              slander.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Freedom of speech:-</strong></p>
              <p>An example was during a parliamentary debate as reported in the
              press and watched on News, there was a exchanged between opposition
              political party MP Low Tk. He stood up and queried on behalf of his
              constituents whether did Mas Selamat died in custody for such were
              the rumours that were floated around.</p>
              <p>He did the right thing in expressing the freedom of speech. He
              was given that priviledge before the govt, but at the same time, he
              qualified that statement that it was only a rumour,
              unsubstantiated.</p>
              <p>When asked in return by MHA Wong if he believed in the rumour,
              he replied in the negative and sat back down, and asked no more,
              fully satisfied with the answer.</p>
              <p>This is how freedom of speech should be. Dare to ask
              responsibily, but qualify your statement with intelligence and
              rationality first. And when given the facts or faced with the
              truth, accept it gracefully and back down, do not cause anymore
              grandstanding performance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Freedom to slander.</strong></p>
              <p>An example would be CSJ slandering the govt on the alleged
              mismanagement of our reserves. He had no facts or even a shred of
              evidence to back up his words. Despite the authorities answers, he
              still continued to harp on it without any evidence in his
              newletters and the internet, causing a division and
              rift amongst the People having doubts, losing trust and
              confidence with the authorities who had done nothing wrong
              except to serve the People faithfully daily. Such actions harm
              the social fabric of our society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore welcomes freedom of speech and criticism. BUT NO ONE,
              not even yourself, would welcome freedom to slander, to lie, to
              speak half truths,  and get away scot free, using 'freedom of
              speech' as an excuse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So please, do not confuse freedom of speech with freedom to
              slander. Politically ambitious figures or anarchists often
              do.</p>

              <p>I disagree a little bit with what Atobe said previously.</p>
              <p>'Freedom of Speech' is a parlance originating from Westerners.</p>
              <p>I think everybody know about this.</p>
              <p>Not sure if it can be attributed to Confucius, or other prominent Asian thinkers, Gandhi, Buddha.......I think none.</p>
              <p>Actually if we see the Asian society around us.....you know the Thai King cannot be insulted, or u can go to jail.</p>
              <p>I think maybe some similar legislation exist in England, up to today. Cannot insult the Queen of England.</p>
              <p>But the difference with Singapore is that........Singapore has no King......so the function of the 'state symbol' , or 'senior leader' apparently is somewhat taken over to a certain extent by...President, PM....and maybe MM, not sure about him.</p>
              <p>If we look at nearby countries, Indonesia, Malaysia, actually they also had old laws prohibiting the insult of President and PM, but nowadays those laws have morphed into a more modernized, euphemized, and secularized common 'libel/ slander' law. That is the path they take. Something very similar to Singapore now.</p>
              <p>I think this characteristic is quite unique to Asian societies, as I have never heard of Bush or Blair ever sued anyone for libel/ slander, despite, actually objectively speaking, they indeed have become victims many times.</p>
              <p>This is a 'reflection' of 'social norms', so nobody can really blame LKY etc suing. It is not a matter of him, nor a matter of laws, nor application of laws, it is a matter of social beliefs. Since he live here and grew up here, and is a rather old man now, he will definitely reflect this value system.

              <p>But coming back to specifics, talking about CSJ, actually I am not clear myself, whether he is indeed a so-called 'Agressive man'.</p>
              <p>I dont know him and I dont know the specifics of the case.</p>
              <p>But I have a feeling, a gut insticnt, a guess, actually his portrayal as an 'agressive man' is a spin, an exaggeration by political spin-doctors. It is just a campaign or a spin to cast him with a certain image.</p>
              <p>I did watch a few YouTube videos of him, he seem very normal to me. Quite moderate and well-grounded. Not insane or agressive or like to yell. Everything seem usual. The time when he was interviewed, or when he was selling his books to passerbys, or when he was blocked by policemen when he wanted to demonstrate. I haven't seen any 'agressive outbursts'.</p>
              <p>So it makes me suspect this portrayal of him as 'agressive' , 'uncouth' , etc is just abit like.......spin.</p>
              <p>Tell me which YouTube video has him behaving 'agressively' , I think maybe nobody has seen one. It is quite bizarre, but when an idea is repeated over and over again, it sticks, and an image is formed in people's minds. But maybe its not true.</p>

              <p>I disagree a little bit with what Atobe said previously.</p>
              <p>'Freedom of Speech' is a parlance originating from Westerners.</p>
              <p>I think everybody know about this.</p>
              <p>Not sure if it can be attributed to Confucius, or other prominent Asian thinkers, Gandhi, Buddha.......I think none.</p>
              <p>Actually if we see the Asian society around us.....you know the Thai King cannot be insulted, or u can go to jail.</p>
              <p>I think maybe some similar legislation exist in England, up to today. Cannot insult the Queen of England.</p>
              <p>But the difference with Singapore is that........Singapore has no King......so the function of the 'state symbol' , or 'senior leader' apparently is somewhat taken over to a certain extent by...President, PM....and maybe MM, not sure about him.</p>
              <p>If we look at nearby countries, Indonesia, Malaysia, actually they also had old laws prohibiting the insult of President and PM, but nowadays those laws have morphed into a more modernized, euphemized, and secularized common 'libel/ slander' law. That is the path they take. Something very similar to Singapore now.</p>
              <p>I think this characteristic is quite unique to Asian societies, as I have never heard of Bush or Blair ever sued anyone for libel/ slander, despite, actually objectively speaking, they indeed have become victims many times.</p>
              <p>This is a 'reflection' of 'social norms', so nobody can really blame LKY etc suing. It is not a matter of him, nor a matter of laws, nor application of laws, it is a matter of social beliefs. Since he live here and grew up here, and is a rather old man now, he will definitely reflect this value system. If you expect him to embrace 'Freedom of Speech' like the western model, then that will be the weird one instead.</p>

              <p>Nice personalities, object of role modelship, but they had shown their capacity to harm societies and other humans.</p>
              <p>It's not easy to judge a person. If CSJ had been an oridinary man, in time, we would have either overlook his faults or cast him aside in friendship. But CSJ is not an ordinary man. He is a party chief of a political group seeking to form the next government of Singapore and rule over us. Thus we have to judge him more carefully before we give him power.</p>
              <p>The only way we can judge him fairly is to asses his public actions if he is worthy to rule.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fact 1. Misappropriation of research fund.</p>
              <p>1993. He was sacked by NUS for misapporopiation of fund. It doesnt matter if it was a dollar or millions of dollars. He had absolutely no right to use research fund for his own individual use. That he had, only shows his character in contempt for money not his own. And character is something that cannot be changed overnight. Would the People dare put someone like him to watch over our CPF monies and tax revenues, worth an estimated US$300 billion? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fact 2. Biting the hand that fed him.</p>
              <p>SDP was led by MP Chiam ST. MP Chiam give CSJ the chance to power, but in the end, he kicked out MP Chiam. Later, CSJ insinuated that MP Chiam was acting on behalf of the ruling party. CSJ was sued for defamation by MP Chiam, which MP Chiam won in an open court. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fact 3. Slander, lies and half truths to power</p>
              <p>CSJ was never shy to slander, spread lies and half truths to gain power. You and i are more than familiar with his cases too much to mention here again. He was given a fair trial with an independent judiciary to asses his claims, yet each time, under vow, he had no evidences. If one has no evidence, but spread lies, it will hurt the image and integrity of the innocent. If the innocent does not take action, trust and integrity will erode, chaos will reign, more so if the innocent is a head of State.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fact 4. No respect for laws. Civil Disobedience</p>
              <p>Singapore is a lawful country. We got so far as a nation because each of us know that the law is fair, equal and for everyone. Yet, he, CSJ, who seek to rule over us, continually broke the law to justify his powerlust. He doesnt give a damn to laws, and does as he pleases, such as apply for a permit to speak at the speakers corner. Easy enough, just apply to the police and usually one get it, yet he refused and went ahead, forcing the authorities no choice but to act, for the law applies to all.</p>
              <p>Even before he gain power, he is prepared to break laws. What more if he holds power, what would he tyrannically do to us innocent civilian citizens?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is more, and you can research for yourself for an objective view, but i will stop here. I am not attempting to change your mind, or asking you to support or not to support him. I only seek that you critically analyse his actions and base your own judgement to act as you will. We have only one vote, and one vote to get it right not only for ourselves, but for others in our society as well.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Those who are criticised have as much right to give their appropriate response, which is limited purely to the criticism. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">More often then not, it takes greater effort for the person who has been criticised to be rationally objective in returning a response, as the person who has been criticised will need to understand that the criticism could have been a done so due to several reasons -</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">1. Differences in opinion to the same subject</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">3. Differences or lack of detailed information surrounding the subject matter that has been presented that result in misunderstanding - causing the criticism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Anyone in public office has already offered himself to serve the larger public, and should be prepared to be criticised for any big or small actions done, as no single action will please everyon or anyone at the same time.</span></p>

              <p>The common law of England and Hong Kong recognises a ‘fair comment’ defence to defamation actions.</p>
              <p><strong>T</strong><strong>he accepted core of this defence is the right of any person to comment on matters of public concern, provided that the comment is based on identifiable and true (or privileged) statements of fact</strong>.</p>
              <p>It perhaps single-handedly justifies the strictures which have been placed upon the complexities of the law of defamation, especially if one takes account of variations between jurisdictions.</p>
              <p>The main focus of this article is malice.</p>
              <p>English and Hong Kong textbooks, as well as judges, have assumed until recently that (like the defence of qualified privilege) fair comment may be defeated by proof of malice on the part of the defendant, and that malice in this context means an improper motive.<a name="fnB2" href="/forums/10/topics/#fn2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[1]</span></span></a></p>
              <p>The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, through Lord Nicholls, has rewritten at least the Hong Kong textbooks, significantly rationalising the law, and, as it happens, bringing it closer to that of some Australasian regimes.</p>
              <p>In <em>Albert Cheng v Tse Wai Chun Paul</em>,<a name="fnB3" href="/forums/10/topics/#fn3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[2]</span></span></a> Nicholls NPJ made essentially three important point about malice in fair comment.<a name="fnB4" href="/forums/10/topics/#fn4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[3]</span></span></a></p>
              <p>Firstly, provided the basic requirements of the defence of fair comment are satisfied, the only way in which the defence can fail is if the defendant is shown to have had no honest belief in the truth of what was said.</p>
              <p>Secondly, this is not best described as ‘malice’ — which usually requires an improper motive — for motive is now irrelevant. Rather, juries should be directed that the issue is simply whether the defendant honestly believed the opinion expressed.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, in the case of qualified privilege, the use of the expression ‘malice’ is unnecessary and direction should be in terms of whether the defendant used the occasion for some purpose other than that for which the privilege is recognised. Any such remarks are of course obiter, qualified privilege not being at issue in the case.</p>
              <p>Nicholls NPJ had the concurrence of Li CJ, Bokhary and Ribeiro PJJ and Sir Denys Roberts NPJ (the last expatriate Chief Justice of the colony). The Chief Justice spoke briefly, relying on the specific constitutional guarantee of free speech in art 27 of the <em>Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China</em> (‘<em>Basic Law</em>’), rather than on the <em>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights </em>(‘<em>ICCPR</em>’)<a name="fnB5" href="/forums/10/topics/#fn5"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[4]</span></span></a> incorporated into the <em>Basic Law</em> by art 39.<a name="fnB6" href="/forums/10/topics/#fn6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[5]</span></span></a></p>
              <p>His Lordship was expanding slightly on the almost throwaway line of Mason NPJ in <em>Eastern Express Publisher Ltd v Mo Man Ching Claudia</em> that ‘in a society in which there is a constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression, no narrow approach should be taken to the scope of fair comment on a matter of public interest as a defence to an action of defamation’.<a name="fnB7" href="/forums/10/topics/#fn7"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[6]</span></span></a></p>
              <p>The <em>Cheng</em> decision has a particular significance for Hong Kong, faced with a minor epidemic of defamation litigation, and a wider importance for the common law world. The only courts bound by this decision are those in Hong Kong below the Court of Final Appeal (which is assumed not to be bound by its own decisions).</p>
              <p>But Lord Nicholls is, of course, a serving member of the House of Lords, and if this point should come before that House one assumes that he would pursue the same line.<a name="fnB8" href="/forums/10/topics/#fn8"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[7]</span></span></a> His views may also represent the current trend of judicial views in common law courts more widely or, at the very least, may be influential.</p>
              <p>This article places <em>Cheng</em> in the context of debates about the role and rule of law in Hong Kong and the position of the judiciary there.</p>
              <p>More specifically, it is something of a defence of the Court in the face of criticism which it, and especially Lord Nicholls, has received in Hong Kong.</p>
              <p><strong>This involves an analysis of the development of the defence of fair comment, in the common law world more broadly as well as in Hong Kong, especially as it concerns the notions of ‘fairness’ and ‘malice’.</strong></p>
              <p>This wider discussion is necessary because part of the attack on the decision involved the allegation that it is an unheralded imposition on the common law of Hong Kong.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Will you pretend to be smarter than those who have more years practicing and interpreting laws in more honest and analytical ways then a juvenile who is only good at role playing - as in '<em>masak-masak DeerHunting' ?</em></p>
              <p>You can pretend to hide behind the false defense that different societies interprete laws for their own societies, unfortunately you cannot hide from the fact that Human Decencies cut across borders.</p>
              <p>Human Decencies will surely expose this false defense taken to prevent honest voices from speaking the Truth.</p>
              <p>Do you think that Singapore can ignore World Opinion to its continued abuse of the Citizens' rights to Freedom of Speech ?</p>
              
              <p>If this MIW Government wish to have Singapore plugged iinto the World Community, how long do you think Singapore can ignore and isolate herself from the First World Standards of Good Governance towards its citizens ?</p>

              <p>I disagree a little bit with what Atobe said previously.</p>
              <p>'Freedom of Speech' is a parlance originating from Westerners.</p>
              <p>I think everybody know about this.</p>
              <p>Not sure if it can be attributed to Confucius, or other prominent Asian thinkers, Gandhi, Buddha.......I think none.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">The phrase - "Freedom of Speech" - may probably be 'parlance originating from Westerners' - but it does not mean that the concept of ''freedom of speech'' is exlusively a 'Western origin'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The referenced research of Confucius analects - as given in my previous reply to you - had clearly shown that even during the period of Confucius wrting his thoughts, it is clear that the concept of Freedom to choose, to speak honestly, to criticise even to the highest authority without fear - is all clear.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Freedom of independent thought is part of the characteristic of Human Behaviour - even animals has shown that different animals have the ability to be independent and unique in each of their individual characteristics behaviour - even within the same species. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Does this not indicate that individualism will surely result in differing independent views that lead to independent actions, all of which surely will give rise to different thought processes that lead to the spoken words ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If there is no individualism, do you think that there can be leadership ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely, it takes a strong individual to become a leader ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are there no such strong leader in Asian society since even before the time of Confucius ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you think that strong individuals will succumb to any pressures from preventing their minds to function, and their voices speak out for actions to respond to social injustices and abuses ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Actually if we see the Asian society around us.....you know the Thai King cannot be insulted, or u can go to jail.</p>
              <p>I think maybe some similar legislation exist in England, up to today. Cannot insult the Queen of England.</p>
              <p>But the difference with Singapore is that........Singapore has no King......so the function of the 'state symbol' , or 'senior leader' apparently is somewhat taken over to a certain extent by...President, PM....and maybe MM, not sure about him.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It seems that you are not too clear as to the extent of "Freedom of Speech" that can be characteristic to our Asian values and culture ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is "Freedom of Speech" not part of the Asian values and culture ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If we were to look at India, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and Taiwan - these are examplary Asian societies with an open political system that allow their citizens to be part of the National Political Process.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Within the Japanese and Thai societies - each has their Royal Families, whom they revere and almost worship - and even as their respective societies enjoy a wide space in exercising their invidual rights to the basic "Freedom of Speech" - they recognise and accept a threshold limit that no one cross.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">One must remember that the Royal Families - whether in Thailand, Japan, or UK - are all above POLITICS.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Royal Family isolate themselves from the political frays between political animals from different political parties - and hence, allow themselve to be ABOVE criticism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is due to the sad and mistaken belief that Royalty can interfere in politics that has led to the downfall of some famous Royal Households - from the Shah of Iran, the King of Nepal, and even the last Emperor of France-Bonaparte Napolean.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As long as MM LKY, and PM LHL are politicians - they are open targets to public scrutiny and to public criticism; the fact that they are at center-stage and are the originators of all policies that affect Singaporeans, they are putting themselves into a higher profile of being criticised or praised for all their actions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">One simply cannot cut the cake any way one wants, and not allow criticism to take place - if you want to be a cook, you got to learn to take the heat, otherwise stay out of the Kitchen.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>If we look at nearby countries, Indonesia, Malaysia, actually they also had old laws prohibiting the insult of President and PM, but nowadays those laws have morphed into a more modernized, euphemized, and secularized common 'libel/ slander' law. That is the path they take. Something very similar to Singapore now.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have they ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The only laws that I know that Indonesia has is not to insult religions; and the only laws that I know that Malaysia has - is not to insult the King, the Sultans, Islam, and not to place insults by questioning the Malay Rights.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have the Malaysian Politicians taken out libel suits in the same manner that LKY is famous for - and which leads to the political opponents being completely bankrupt and permanently taken out of political circulation ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I think this characteristic is quite unique to Asian societies, as I have never heard of Bush or Blair ever sued anyone for libel/ slander, despite, actually objectively speaking, they indeed have become victims many times.</p>
              <p>This is a 'reflection' of 'social norms', so nobody can really blame LKY etc suing. It is not a matter of him, nor a matter of laws, nor application of laws, it is a matter of social beliefs. Since he live here and grew up here, and is a rather old man now, he will definitely reflect this value system. If you expect him to embrace 'Freedom of Speech' like the western model, then that will be the weird one instead.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The difference between Western Societies such as in the UK and USA - and even in Asian Societies such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia - is that the Politicians are more tolerant towards robust political challenges that they face with no narrow sensitivities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">These politicians are open to competitive ideas, arguments, and competiting for the Hearts and Minds of their Electorates - as in Civilised Societies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Our Singapore Politicians have become soft, and too accustomed to a protected environment since the Colonial Days when Singapore was given Internal Self-Rule.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It was a period where the political opponents of the MIW were locked up for their competing ideas - courtesy of the Colonial Government help with their ISD - and placed the MIW party in an environment that gave them the latitude of political space that is unobstructed by opposing votes to any of their policies and legislations put up in Parliament.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">When one is living in a protected environment, one will always become addicted to the handicap given in the competition; and will always be dependent on that crutch to stay a few steps ahead of the competition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This incumbent Ruling Party has without any reservation or shame have helped themselves immensely by hampering the other political parties from ever influencing or winning the Hearts and Minds of Singaporeans. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In this enterprise, they have imensely succeeded by using the entire print and broadcast media at their disposal - to keep Singaporeans in a continuous state of stupor in the constant bombardment by a mono-sycophantic sound that propagate only one idiot-logy from the Master's Voice.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>But coming back to specifics, talking about CSJ, actually I am not clear myself, whether he is indeed a so-called 'Agressive man'.</p>
              <p>I dont know him and I dont know the specifics of the case.</p>
              <p>But I have a feeling, a gut insticnt, a guess, actually his portrayal as an 'agressive man' is a spin, an exaggeration by political spin-doctors. It is just a campaign or a spin to cast him with a certain image.</p>
              <p>I did watch a few YouTube videos of him, he seem very normal to me. Quite moderate and well-grounded. Not insane or agressive or like to yell. Everything seem usual. The time when he was interviewed, or when he was selling his books to passerbys, or when he was blocked by policemen when he wanted to demonstrate. I haven't seen any 'agressive outbursts'.</p>
              <p>So it makes me suspect this portrayal of him as 'agressive' , 'uncouth' , etc is just abit like.......spin.</p>
              <p>Tell me which YouTube video has him behaving 'agressively' , I think maybe nobody has seen one. It is quite bizarre, but when an idea is repeated over and over again, it sticks, and an image is formed in people's minds. But maybe its not true.</p>
              <p>So anyway, good night everybody, have a nice weekend. </p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you are posing this question to WKS - as WP LTK had asked the same manner wondering if MSK is dead while in custody - you will probably be asked by WKS if you personally think that CSJ is ''a so-called 'Agressive man' ?"</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since when was CSJ charged for mis-appropriation of research funds ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are creating a new charge which CSJ has never been accused or found guilty of ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are now creating a "slander" with the "Freedom of Speech" given to you ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In the first place, the charge of "False Financial Reimbursement Taxi-fare Claim" -  itself was slanderous in that the claim was approved by the Faculty Head one year before CSJ stood for election as a SDP candidate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Faculty Head was Dr Vassoo - a PAP stalwart, who had invited CSJ to join the PAP - and which CSJ declined.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">CSJ made a dent in GCT's Marine Parage GRC on the second attempt in a 1992 By-Election, and created shock-waves in being the first credibly qualified person to join the ranks of the Alternative Political Parties.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This had caused the Ruling Party to over-react to prevent more professionals and better qualified from joining the ranks of the Alternative Parties.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It was dubious at best for a Travel Claim approved and paid out one-year earlier to be brought up as a point of contention and used as a dubious charge of being dishonest on the part of CSJ for claiming an extra $2 in his taxi fare reimbursement claim. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Any reasonable person will know that even the same route taken on different days with different traffic conditions will cost differently; and there are more then one single route to any given destination in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In any case, how should CSJ know which is the shortest and cheapest fare if he allow the taxi driver to take the most ''honest'' route as the Taxi Company had instructed ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Second Charge of Dishonesty was similarly laughable - in that CSJ was accused of using NUS Funds to send the research papers of his wife to a university in the USA for assessment. CSJ had disputed this point in his insistence that the Faculty Head was informed that he will be including his wife's work with his research papers for assessment as the US University has approved of this joint effort.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">When CSJ protested to all the charges, the NUS Faculty head sued CSJ for slander - and in a Singapore Court of Law in which Politicians sued by the Ruling Party has never stood a chance of impartiality - needless to say, CSJ fate was as good as sealed. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">One need only ask if those vouchers for reimbursement of taxir fare and postages would have been brought up - if CSJ had accepted Dr Vassoo's invitation to join the Ruling Political Party as an Election Candidate ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Fact 2. Biting the hand that fed him.</p>
              <p>SDP was led by MP Chiam ST. MP Chiam give CSJ the chance to power, but in the end, he kicked out MP Chiam. Later, CSJ insinuated that MP Chiam was acting on behalf of the ruling party. CSJ was sued for defamation by MP Chiam, which MP Chiam won in an open court. </p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You seem to follow the Bear's efforts at deriding CSJ in the same style and with the same vigor - calling him "an attention seeking whore" in the same manner as the Bear; and now perpetuating a lie favored by the Bear that "CSJ bit the hand that fed him" as a twist from the Bear's favorite in "CSJ backstabbing CST".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With the quality of accuracy that you have displayed - do you even know the exact words in the statement that CSJ was supposed to have made and which CST claims libel ?</span></p>

              <p>Fact 3. Slander, lies and half truths to power</p>
              <p>CSJ was never shy to slander, spread lies and half truths to gain power. You and i are more than familiar with his cases too much to mention here again. He was given a fair trial with an independent judiciary to asses his claims, yet each time, under vow, he had no evidences. If one has no evidence, but spread lies, it will hurt the image and integrity of the innocent. If the innocent does not take action, trust and integrity will erode, chaos will reign, more so if the innocent is a head of State.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely, we must then question what kind of integrity and trust have we wasted 50 years of our time in building ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Or are you simply ''Grand Standing" in attempting to exagerate a simple issue, making your own juvenile intellect become several "story taller" -  as in "tall tales" ?</span></p>

Yet, he, CSJ, who seek to rule over us, continually broke the law to justify his powerlust. He doesnt give a damn to laws, and does as he pleases, such as apply for a permit to speak at the speakers corner. Easy enough, just apply to the police and usually one get it, yet he refused and went ahead, forcing the authorities no choice but to act, for the law applies to all.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The difference between "slander" and "fair comment" is like darkness and daylight - and t</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">he difference between stupidity and intelligence is comparable in the same way.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With the kind of intelligence that has been consistent with the 'Grand Standing' efforts display for a wider audience, it is not unusual that stupidity creeps in at the point when vanity climax to blind simple common sense.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You are invited to propound your views to a Mongolian today about the harm that his forefathers did in conquering vast tracts of land across continents - and you will get more then an earful for your insulting and slanderous views towards Mongolian History that is based on your own perverse interpretation and understanding from your own parochial values.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even the evil have served their purpose - as without the devious acts of Himmler, Hitler and Osama - do you think that human kind could have been galvanised to become one in purpose to defeat a common threat to Humanity ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">History seems to repeat itself in cycles, and Man has been tested once too often, and only to become complacent again and again towards the threats that is ever lurking to prevent the Human Spirit from soaring.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are we not experiencing the same even in this day and age, when the majority have to be suppressed by a powerful minority that is determined to stay in power at any cost towards the larger community ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If CSJ is not an ordiany man but a political personality - is this not the same of MM LKY, PM LHL, and everyone in the MIW Team that form the Government ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If an ordinary man that seeks political prominence require more scrutiny, are we then to subject those already in power too lesser scrutinty ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have we forgotten that those in power today are holding so much more power then even before they became the Center of the Power - is it not more imperative that the present ones should be subjected to even more critically close scrutiny ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If we are to judge CSJ fairly, should we not judge him by the Rules set by ordinary Singaporeans ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Should we allow the Rules to be dictated by those whose own self-interest will arbitrarily raise the bars to those who dare to challenge them, but will lower the bar of scrutiny for themselves and their own ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Fact 1 - what mis-appropriation of research fund are you creating ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since when was CSJ charged for mis-appropriation of research funds ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are creating a new charge which CSJ has never been accused or found guilty of ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are now creating a "slander" with the "Freedom of Speech" given to you ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In the first place, the charge of "False Financial Reimbursement Taxi-fare Claim" -  itself was slanderous in that the claim was approved by the Faculty Head one year before CSJ stood for election as a SDP candidate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Faculty Head was Dr Vassoo - a PAP stalwart, who had invited CSJ to join the PAP - and which CSJ declined.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">CSJ made a dent in GCT's Marine Parage GRC on the second attempt in a 1992 By-Election, and created shock-waves in being the first credibly qualified person to join the ranks of the Alternative Political Parties.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This had caused the Ruling Party to over-react to prevent more professionals and better qualified from joining the ranks of the Alternative Parties.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It was dubious at best for a Travel Claim approved and paid out one-year earlier to be brought up as a point of contention and used as a dubious charge of being dishonest on the part of CSJ for claiming an extra $2 in his taxi fare reimbursement claim.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Any reasonable person will know that even the same route taken on different days with different traffic conditions will cost differently; and there are more then one single route to any given destination in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In any case, how should CSJ know which is the shortest and cheapest fare if he allow the taxi driver to take the most ''honest'' route as the Taxi Company had instructed ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Your "Aunty" Atobe is laughing at your very juvenile retort.... if you have nothing to say, it will do you well to save your red face by not repeating juvenile responses that merely reveal the spiteful side of a young boy-boy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even a monkey will know how to get out of a trap in more ways than one - what happen to the boy-boy who "wanna be a deerHunter" with a pop-gun ?</span></p>
