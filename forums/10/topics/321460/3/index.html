              <p>The reason the 'deerHunter' needs the wider audience to judge any on-going argument is due to the fact that he has no clear idea where his own argument is leading him to.</p>
              <p>With the structure of his arguments based on no facts, he needs the help of others who are more knowledgeable to bail him out.</p>

              You ask an Iraqi who used to live under the tyranny of Saddam, he'll probably like the freedom in Singapore better.
              
              You ask a North Korean who lived under KJI, he'll probably say, he loves his great leader, because thats all he learnt to say.
              
              You ask an American who lived in the land of the free and the brave, he'll tell you Singapore is illiberal.
              
              All is a matter of perspective.  Democracy in its purest form, is idealistic.  Just like Communism, idealistic.
              
              Every ideal needs a reality check.  What makes it work, what kills it. Look at the politics of Asian countries that went the way of liberal democracy.  The drama of the Taiwanese parliament.  The fractious South Korea.  Every democracy has its own set of problem.  Its how you make the best of it.
              
              I can appreciate what we have in Singapore.  The stability we've traded some of our liberties for makes us an attractive place for foreign investors.  My only gripe is that many of the poor and old are neglected. 
              
              Freedom of speech?  What is that when you are an 85 year old man, forced to cut up paper and cardboard boxes for a few measly dollars.  A time when you should be at home resting, you are out in the streets, working for your next meal.

              <p>Yes, we certainly missed something here - if you still have not discern what is amiss in Singapore - from a Government that is deaf to the cries of Singaporeans protests at the unending bouts of policiy decisions that increase the financial burden on everyone.</p>
