            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>TAIPEI - On June 10, 7:40 a.m., Nie Shuwen from Taiwan boarded an airplane bound for Singapore. Upon arrival, Nie was denied entry and forced to deport. At the same time, a box of books titled Â“Nine Commentaries on the Communist PartyÂ” that was being carried by her traveling companion got confiscated. On that same day, Nie boarded an Eva Airlines Flight BR226 back to Taiwan. Upon arrival at Jiang Kai Shek International Airport in Taiwan at 5:30 p.m., a press conference was immediately held. Nie said it was unacceptable for Singapore to violate human rights and called upon the Singapore government not to concede to pressure exerted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).<br>Nie stated that the reason for her trip to Singapore was to participate in an experience sharing conference for Falun Gong practitioners. Just as she was about to go through customs, an officer checked her passport and said, Â“WeÂ’ve already been notified by Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA). You do not meet the regulations so are not allowed entry.Â” The officer could not give a precise explanation as to which regulations were not met. Nie said that after continuous questioning, the officer then stated, Â“IÂ’m not allowed to tell you the reason. IÂ’m just following orders sent by the ICA.Â”<br><br>When NieÂ’s traveling companion questioned the officer if it was because of her practicing Falun Gong that the Singapore government would not grant her entry, this officer did not deny it at the time.<br><br>Nie stated that when the officer who was responsible for her deportation found out that the Singapore government seemed to have denied her entry just because she was a Falun Gong practitioner, the officer was very shocked. She further stated that Singapore as a democratic country yet wouldnÂ’t allow entry to a compassionate Taiwan citizen and that she planned to contact the foreign affairs department in Taiwan and express a serious protest against the Singapore government.<br><br>As soon as members of the Taiwan Falun Dafa association learnt of the incident, they immediately contacted the Taiwan Representative Office in Singapore. According to an assistant named Song, officials at Singapore Airport had a name list and NieÂ’s name was on it.<br><br>The leader of TaiwanÂ’s Falun Dafa Association, Zhang Chingxi, stated that the Singapore governmentÂ’s actions were disappointing. Could it be that Singapore is now a colony of the CCP?<br><br>Zhang called on the Singapore government to by no means be an accomplice to the CCP. The CCP is currently facing a wave of withdrawals and will be broke up and disintegrated soon. Singapore should definitely not be buried along with the fall of the CCP. Zhang also called on all countries around the world that enjoy independence, liberty, and human rights to condemn SingaporeÂ’s actions that betray the freedom of belief.<br><br>Zhang said that after NieÂ’s incident, the Falun Dafa association in Taiwan has already brought the issue to the attention of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Taiwan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman Lu Michael Ching-long stated that the Taiwan government would seriously protect the rights of Taiwan citizens and that the Department of Foreign Affairs is in contact with the Singapore government but has received no response.<br><br>This is not the first time that the Singapore government has ruled unjustly against Falun Gong practitioners. On February 23, 2003, two female Falun Gong practitioners, Cheng Lujin and Ng Chye Huay, were practicing Falun Gong exercises in Esplanade Park and were later charged by the Singapore government in May 2004 with eight counts, including "Assembly without a Permit" and for "Possession and Distribution of VCDs without a Certificate."<br><br>The hearings in court lasted for a year and on April 27, 2005; the Singapore court passed a heavy sentence on the two plaintiffs, imposing individual fines of S$24,000 (US$14,31<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and S$20,000 ($11,932). The plaintiffs insisted on their innocence and refused to pay the fines. Consequently they were detained in Changi womenÂ’s prison. Both women later went on a hunger strike to protest the injustice. Under pressure, their families paid the fines and both women were released on May 3, 2005.<br><br><strong>Source: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/5-6-17/29617.html</span></strong><br></blockquote>Now that is something we cannot find in The Straits Times.<br><br>Falungong is classified as a cult by Singapore law, and the ICA is probably using it as a basis to ban Falun Gong practitioners from entering Singapore.<br><br>Probably an action meant to toe China's position on Falun Gong, the ban has been in effect since the late 1990s (1998 if I am not wrong). I don't see why Singapore should ban this organisation: it has done nothing wrong towards Singapore society, nor has it caused anybody to hurt anyone unlike real cults. The ban definitely is more politically motivated.<br><br>Singapore a democracy? Please then explain the ban.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>we discussed about Falun Gong earlier on this board,<br><br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=129999<br><br>it is clear that not many singaporean considered falun gong a religion, the buddists in singapore do not consider falun gong part of, or a branch of buddism. Many of us believe that this is a cult with political motivation. It is clear that they are banned in singapore, whether this decision has anything to do with mainland chinese or not is up to speculation. I expect those who wish to enter singapore to respect our law, whether you are taiwanese, hongkongers, americans, indians,..........!<br><br>Whether singaporeans are sympathetic towards this group of people and want the government to change the law to accommodate them is up to singaporeans. Those who do please start a thread and explain yourself.<br><br>thousands of taiwanese entered singapore every month without any problem; singapore had in the past refused entries of many people, including communists or left winged chinese, during the cold war period. If he or she were a terrorist suspect like the JI, he might even be arrested. Crying flaw in human rights in this instance shows a lack of respect for human rights.<br><br>I would not jump on every opportunity, such as this one, to condemn the singapore government, not that I like the governemt or as if there is a lack of reasons to condemn PAP or CCCP.</div>

Look where it is now.<br><br>S'pore gahmen is not only stupid, it is doing so to appease China govt.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>a box of books titled Â“Nine Commentaries on the Communist PartyÂ” that was being carried by her traveling companion got confiscated</blockquote>Wouldn't say that they were refused entry merely because they practised falungong. I have seen excerpts of that book overseas. It is a particularly inflammatory piece of work against a foreign nation and would have been banned in Singapore in any case.<br><br>I have no issue with adherents of any religion, but I do not believe it is in Singapore's interest to allow such people a platform to attack a friendly foreign nation.</div>
