              <h1>Lim Swee Say: strength of Singapore’s economy depends “not so much” on how productive we are</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">January 21, 2010</span></p>
              <p>Minister in Prime Minister’s Office Mr Lim Swee Say has another mindbogging quote for Singaporeans again. Not too long after exhorting Singapore workers and companies to boost their productivity by being “cheaper, faster and better”, he now sings a slightly different, if not confusing tune.</p>
              <p>In a speech made at a forum yesterday, Mr Lim said Singapore should invest more in R&amp;D to strengthen the nation’s economic potential.<span> </span></p>
              <p><span><em>“The strength of the Singapore economy, whether we are able to sustain our growth for the long term, depends not so much on how productive we are and how capable we are in the areas of production. I think we need to become increasingly an innovation driven economy……..All these are core strengths that the Singapore economy ought to invest more and more in the future so that we can continue to ensure that the Singapore economy will be competitive and vibrant so that they can continue to create growth and create jobs for our people,” </em>he was quoted saying by Channel News Asia.</span></p>
              <p><span>He added one way to “spur” innovation” is to in</span><span>culcate a passion for science among youths by creating “more platforms for them to share ideas and insights with young science talents from overseas.”</span></p>
              <p><span>Singapore scores poorly among the 30 most developed countries in the world in terms of innovation and research according to a UBS study released last year.</span></p>
              <p><span>The ruling party has tried to rectify the problem by pumping in billions of dollars into R&amp;D, especially the Life Sciences in recent years to catch up with others.</span></p>
              <p><span>While Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have many internationally recognized brands such as Sony, Samsung and Acer, Singapore only has Creative which was founded in the United States and even then, it appears to be struggling in the last two years or so.</span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Lim doesn’t seem to appreciate the fact that creativity and innovation is something which cannot be taught in schools, but is intricably linked to the external environment, education system and political situation.</span></p>
              <p><span>To foster creative thinking, one must first be allowed to ask questions, challenge the authorities and debunk the established order which is simply not possible in Singapore where students can get a warning from the police by wearing T-shirts printed with the pictures of White Elephants.</span></p>
              <p><span>The over-emphasis of the Singapore education system on rote-learning and academic grades is also not conducive to the nurturing of talented scientists, thinkers and entrepreneurs.</span></p>
              <p><span>Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein and Bill Gates were not all gifted academically, but ended up being the pioneers of their times. </span></p>
              <p><span>The ruling party always love to jump on the bandwagon of others and copy the success of other countries. Unfortunately, it fails to realize that it is part of the problem itself. </span></p>

              <div class="post-body entry-content">
              <div style="text-align: justify;">In my previous post, I explained how Singapore has moved rapidly up the value chain based on international comparisons of the Manufacturing Value-Added (MVA) data. Many may look at this as less of a problem and more of a positive sign as having a higher MVA indicates progression in manufacturing activity. Critics may also argue that since we are being presented with these opportunities to upgrade, there is no reason to turn them away and should instead embrace them. <br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;">The point is that moving up the value-chain too quickly has forced business costs in Singapore to rise rapidly. This is reflected by higher unit business costs here as unit labour costs in Singapore increased by 22.8 percent in 2007 to 2008. This is enormous when compared to corresponding figures of 0.4 percent and 2.8 percent in Japan and US respectively, not to mention the drop in Korea’s unit labour costs by 0.3 percent. <br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div class="separator" style="text-align: center; clear: both;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EicpFvkMb7c/S0hFrlRmItI/AAAAAAAAAEA/KBQgi0tgSJ4/s1600-h/Picture1.png"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EicpFvkMb7c/S0hFrlRmItI/AAAAAAAAAEA/KBQgi0tgSJ4/s400/Picture1.png" border="0" alt=""></a><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the rising labour costs in Singapore are not directly a result of higher productivity. Comparing the productivity growth rates released by the International Labour Organization, Singapore’s productivity increased by 3.7 percent from 1980 to 2002, thus showing that its productive efficiency is increasing at a slower rate than its MVA growth as well as its rising business costs. We can conclude from this that Singapore’s rapid rate of rise up the manufacturing value chain has contributed to higher unit labour costs here, and consequently higher business costs, which have not been compensated by a substantial increase in productivity. If we are to continue on this trend of moving up the value chain quickly, then we should at least ensure that productivity gets a greater push so that higher labour costs can be substantiated for our SMEs and MNCs. <br></div>

              <p><br>Dear Malminjet Singh,</p>
              <p>Dun worry, our govt know what to do,...business cost will rise more further when the job credit end in June, not truly on satistics alone, and beside, in what empirical survey been done to compound these satistics, our govt can move about the GDP without a clear formula, so dun worry, as my MP said, " when the ship arrive, it will automatically align itself along the bank"</p>
