              <p>No lah in country like europe, labour chief from labour party also can become PM and president lor, and in US i think demorcrat are more on top govt people whereas republican are more of labour, sometime govt demorcrat wins, sometime republican wins, but either who win, both a hypocrat.</p>
              <p>I think when i studied modern History, NTUC was form by LKY away from STU, so it is actually LKY's baby, so naturally he will appoint a minister to look after it, so far, that symbolic image had done well for Singapore, we had no strikes or industrial riots for many years, and that is good for investor and our economy.</p>
              <p>I think we shouldn't compare countries to countries, every country has is unique way of governing and progress. There are many type of models, but as long as the society is at peace, economy can make money, not much industrial disputes, i have to give credit to NTUC.</p>
              <p>Tho their Secretary General is a joker by nature, but he created alots of initiatives, i see my staffs getting those NTUC and back to school vouchers are so happy like kenna 4D, wow! i also want to join NTUC, but then, me shop at cold storage, dun live in chalets or mix with workers, so i declined their offer, i heard they said, even PMET also can join...hmmm..</p>

              <p><br>Oh, maybe i mix up abit on American politics, i only know that one of them, either demo or republican are more toward workers..thanks for the info.</p>
              <p>You see, Singapore had alway sell to investor as a peaceful and non violence economy, we work in a very good and close relationships among the 3 parties, ie Employers (SNEF), Employees(SMEEU) and the Govt. All are social partners link to each other, our govt understand that once this fabric of social partnership is broken, we are doom. And to do that, we need to keep a close watch on it, that is why a minister is appointed as a labour chief since independent. I think the issue here is more on your dislike of Lim Swee Say, not the framework of our society. If that is really the case, i got nothing more to say.</p>
              <p>Your Honor, i rest my case.</p>
