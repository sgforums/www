              <p>1. Does the opposition parties have enough candidates to compete in all GRC without giving them any walkover win?</p>
              <p>2. Have you, do you, did you ever think of a strategy of how to shut your opponent and strip them apart without giving them any opportunity to correct themselves and to sue you in court.</p>
              <p>3. The next election will be in 2012. And by now you should be 50% ready...if you are not there is no point talking.</p>
              <p>4. We need someone who can bite, I mean bite hard not just bark.</p>
              <p>5. Think positive and take this as a challenge.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A response to Chua Sheng Yang's Character Assasination on ST Forum</strong></span></p>
              <p>Dear Chua Sheng Yang,<br><br>We do not know you but we cannot standby
              and watch while you go lambasting Mr Tan Kin Lian as if you have a
              sword to grind with him.<br><br>Now, if Mr Tan is as bad as you make
              him out to be when he was CEO of NTUC, how about showing the same level
              of disdain toward PAP’s Mr Tharman Shamugaratnan?<br><br>Mr Tharman was
              a convict, convicted under the official secrets act while he was
              director of MAS. The PAP was able to ‘move on’ with his conviction,
              ignore it, gave him a place in PAP, and mind you a very high place at
              that, got back his job at MAS with very a much improved package with
              autonomous authority over the same institution that charged him for
              revealing secret information and being made the Minister for Finance
              that looks after our national reserves.<br><br>You might
              counter-suggest that we should judge people for what they are doing now
              rather than what they had done and I would be the first to agree with
              you.<br><br>Whether we agree with your assessment of Mr Tan or not is
              not my intention in this post. All I know is that Mr Tan stepped
              forward when all the others in higher places have turned their backs
              and ran away. We cannot ignore this fact and this fact alone gives
              immense credit to Mr Tan. Thousands upon thousands have found it
              comfortable to lean on his shoulders and these thousands, for whatever
              reasons you may suggest otherwise, cannot be wrong.<br><br>Furthermore,
              if Mr Tan is as self-serving and attention grabbing like you claim he
              is, I do not doubt for one moment that the PAP machinery will let him
              do what he has been doing thus far. The fact that the PAP machinery did
              nothing to him suggests that he is doing something right for the
              community of depressed investors which even the PAP found it not
              necessary to entertain.<br><br>Mr Tan Kin Lian's effort for being so
              quick off the block in helping the misled investors when others in
              higher office were still in shock and did not know how to react is very
              much laudable.<br><br>Perhaps it was because of his swift reaction that
              prevented the Opposition from making it an issue of their own and thus
              prevented a more direct confrontation between Opposition-led investors
              against the ruling PAP govt. The cost of such confrontation could be
              tragic in its most extreme sense, and, who is to say it won’t happen?
              Money is the root of all evil and because of money, it can lead one to
              misplaced sanity and may even kill for or because of it.<br><br>Mr Tan Kin Lian is a true son and a true hero to the people of Singapore and no one can dispute this.<br><br><br>Best regards<br>Concerned Citizens</p>

              <p>didn't seem to help those who's mindset "improved" has it? we need people in there who know how to work with people, people who can throw correct questions in the parliament without killing off their own careers.</p>
              <p>sometimes instead of asking why something is happening this way, can also turn around and ask why things not done that other way and then suggest the method to do it. no point take mp pay, ask one question, someone answered "our researched show cannot" then diam diam sit down liao.</p>
              <p>sometimes i really wonder..... are these politicians really the cream of the crop?</p>

              <p>The latest one has to be by bespectacled Teo Ho Pin. He said that residents should be thankful for their hard work on planning the investments instead of heaping blame and that these investment returns go towards reducing the amount of conservancy charges required.</p>
