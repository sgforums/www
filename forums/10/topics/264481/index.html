Either it can developed the land on its own or to sold out the land to private developer. In choosing the former option, the government is in a better position to earn revenue to offset or to suppress the rising taxation than to leave it to the private developer which often charge at prevailing market rate.<br><br>How to you propose to recovery the money other than levies method?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
