              <p>we know that it is stupid to jump over this matter ...  but
              the 15 years old, at that time of moment cannot rationalised this
              ...  he could be lost, angry and is not able to convince his
              parent ...  at that moment, he see no meaning in life
              ...  he do not know waht to do and since he had sucidal
              thought before, he naturally do what he thought was the right thing
              .. please do not call him stupid .. have we consider his plight,
              his feeling, his emotion, he was lost and
              helpless...   he just wanted to end it
              all. </p>
              <p> then again, can we blame the parent...  tell me, how
              many of you have graduated from a school of parenting that taught
              you how to be a good parent, doing the right stuff and bring the
              child up properly ??  There is any right?  Even if there
              are books, they call tell you so much as it will not work for many
              as the enviroment, culture, character are never the same ... 
              many of us are on a permanant probation as a parent.. 
              learning from mistake ..  and picking up a few things here and
              there ...  I hated it when people say the parent should do
              this and should do that ...  if parent do know, you thing they
              still want to do it and failed ...  sigh ...  I can only
              say the boy's parent may not see what is coming and is trying to
              convince him what is good and right for him... </p>

              <p>in the black and white matter - the parents were obviously the one who caused the situation. but in the light of mercy, yes, they wouldn't have known better, and were only doing the best they could - if all you have is a hammer, every problem would look like a nail.</p>
              <p>but unfortunately, i've seen so many controlling parents - controlling to a fault. fiery temper, my way or the high way, it really disgusts me so. all the kids i've seen with controlling parents, either turn up dead, or suddenly in one fit of rebelliousness go wild and become party boys and girls.</p>
              <p>so i can't really... close one eye and just use a "it's just bad luck" to wrap up the entire scenario.</p>

              <p>this incident has shown two things:</p>
              <p>1) there are an increasing group of people who are weak in the
              mind, who cannot face obstacles, difficulties without putting on a
              brave front. he should sit down and discuss with his parents
              properly. i fully understand why his parents want him to join track
              and field. even if they insist on their way, there are other ways
              to release the stress like listening to music, taking up drama as
              "merit cca" or doing it as a hobby and stlil continue with track.
              he has shown himself to be mentally weak in making decisions and
              even took his own life over a trivial matter. whether the cca case
              is an isolated incident has no relation.</p>
              <p>2) to take his own life is an extremely selfish act to his
              parents. his parents worked hard to nurture him and pinned
              expectations on him to become a fine young athlete. he is not
              considering his parent's well-being and feelings when he commits
              suicide. the fault should not be put on his parents, maybe his
              parents have their own reasoning and beliefs as to why he should
              join track and field.</p>
              <p>there are many more things to life than just choosing your cca.
              his priorities in life are not right and he cannot expect
              everything in life to go his way.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Thats a pretty fucked up argument.  Pardon my french, but its not directed at you but rather at your argument.</p>
              <p>1.  Do you even know the full story behind this boy's life? What kinda stress or difficulty he's been through?  Would he have time for Drama as a "hobby" when he has 4 times a week track training?  Not every human being is a rational being, even more so for a 15 year old. He did sit down to discuss with his parents to discuss about the switch of CCA, but the parents refused. </p>
              <p>Now, I cannot imagine what grounds a parent would have to object and refuse to their child's decision over a "trivial" matter like a CCA.  If it was a "trivial" matter, surely the parents would consent and this tragedy would not have happened.  The problem was that the parents did not see it as "trivial" while the child did.  What then is having a "strong mind"?  I think he was pretty "resolute" about his decision even at the price of death. </p>
              <p>2.  I think this is the worst thing I've ever heard.  THat a child's life is to live up to the nurture and expectation pinned on him.  So is a human's life nothing more than just a long term investment with expected high ROI.  What kinda value system is it that we have here that we consider our children to be just the bearer of or nurture and xpectations? Every Child is a Unique individual, with his own dreams and aspirations.  You crush those hopes and dreams when you talk about him as just an "investment."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its not getting easier being a kid in Singapore.  You've got a stressful education system with so much foreign competition.  You've got parents with materialistic value systems that devalues the child to just an investment. When the child fails to see himself as another unique individual, entitled to his own dreams and his own future, what is there to live for?  To be just another piece of meat for others to consume? </p>
              <p>For a person to be treated as an investment by his own parents has gotta be the worst value system a society can have.</p>

              that secondary school, JC or university of choice because the odds
              are so high. and every parent is definitely guided by 1) love. but
              you should never count out the investment bit which plays a 20%
              role at least in raising of children</p>

              <p>not every parent thinks like u. some parents who dunno better show their "love" in very selfish ways.</p>
              <p>at what age do u think a child shld be held completely responsible for his own behaviour? to me, 15 is still quite young and impressionable..</p>
              <p>his parents have gone overseas for a holiday. but i doubt a holiday can erase the memory of losing a child. :/</p>

              <p>True lah... we feel sad when we read such stories, but on the other hand, it serves as a warning to all.  Dont drive anybody up the wall. Some may chose to end it in a more drastic way.  Can happen to anybody here.</p>
