              <p>Kids do not owe their parents or their school a living, glory or medals. The latter two have a responsibility to him and to society though to nurture them properly...they didn't let him explore his interest in theatre, for fear of not gaining more medals, and resilience was obviously lacking in him.</p>

              <p>u'll be surprised that there are some parents who have this "my way or the highway mentality". at best, the kids grow up without learning how to make decisions or have an opinion, at worst, suicide.</p>
              <p>so my advice to all parents are, "if you think that so long as your intentions are good and that's all that matters, the ends justifies the means, i hope that mentality comforts you when you're hosting your kids' funeral"</p>

              <p>this incident has shown two things:</p>
              <p>1) there are an increasing group of people who are weak in the mind, who cannot face obstacles, difficulties without putting on a brave front. he should sit down and discuss with his parents properly. i fully understand why his parents want him to join track and field. even if they insist on their way, there are other ways to release the stress like listening to music, taking up drama as "merit cca" or doing it as a hobby and stlil continue with track. he has shown himself to be mentally weak in making decisions and even took his own life over a trivial matter. whether the cca case is an isolated incident has no relation.</p>
              <p>2) to take his own life is an extremely selfish act to his parents. his parents worked hard to nurture him and pinned expectations on him to become a fine young athlete. he is not considering his parent's well-being and feelings when he commits suicide. the fault should not be put on his parents, maybe his parents have their own reasoning and beliefs as to why he should join track and field.</p>
              <p>there are many more things to life than just choosing your cca. his priorities in life are not right and he cannot expect everything in life to go his way.</p>

              <p>it is sad... and fr the article which says tt they live in a "stevens road condo", they are definitely a well off family.</p>
              <p>usually, when kids fr such a gd background rebel, it's cos their parents or other authority figures were too conservative or were nt ard for them when the child needed them.</p>
              <p>definitely, parents need to let their kids make their own choices... i tink a lot of parents today, especially those who are busy wif their own lives, jus wan the "convenient" way out... instant obedience... and fail to see tt to get their child to listen to them, they, too, must listen to the child.</p>
              <p>even if they tink it's a mistake, must still let the kid make the mistake and experience the consequences for himself or herself.</p>

              <p>we all hate our parents at one stage especially when they are extremely controlling. only solution for me that time was to do what they say, and produce the best results. After that try to wiggle free. lol. but then again, it worked for me cause my parents are working parents. i got smarter n started to exploit the loopholes. lol.. but still producing results. n overtime...  =D</p>
              <p>but i am sure parents mean well for the kids. just that sometimes while trying to teach us to be independant they try to control us at the same time. So its kinda fuked up.</p>
