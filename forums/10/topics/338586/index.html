              Up till then, no one would have thought Wen Yi as a troubled or even self-destructive sort. The Secondary 3 student of Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) was described as cheerful and was well-liked by his classmates and respectful towards his teachers, the Coroner's Court heard yesterday.
              <p>A police investigation report presented in court said that on Feb 13 this year, Wen Yi skipped track-and-field training to play football. He was caught by his track teacher and questioned.</p>
              <p>He later complained to his classmate that he had been dealt track training sessions four times a week as punishment; he also said he was going to die, but his classmate assumed he was joking.</p>
              <p>On their way home in the same bus, Wen Yi was cracking jokes and did not appear depressed.</p>
              <p>Staff Sergeant Raymond Chng of the Tanglin Police Division said in his investigation report that Wen Yi's mother received a call from the track teacher that afternoon about her son's ditching his training for football. The teacher, Mr Ng Yeong Joo, 38, who had been told that Wen Yi wanted to switch to drama, told the teen's mother to advise him against it.</p>
              <p>That evening, in a talk with his parents in their Stevens Road condo home over the matter, Wen Yi said he had lost his inspiration to run and insisted on the switch.</p>
              <p>His parents tried to talk him out of it, but he refused to listen.</p>
              <p>He then announced that he had planned to make the switch the following month, 'but I am going to do it now'. He headed for his bedroom, followed by his mother, who sensed something amiss. Before her eyes, he walked up to the window, opened the blinds, climbed onto the ledge, pushed the window open and jumped out. She rushed forward but was too late.</p>
              <p>Staff Sgt Chng said that a day before, Wen Yi had sent a classmate a text message in which he said he was going to commit a crime - jump off a building as a 'final feat of rebellion' and let his craziness be known to the world. 'Will you as a friend accompany me on this day?' he had asked.</p>
              <p>When he took up track-and- field in 2006, his attendance was irregular, but he blossomed into a medal-winner last year.</p>
              <p>His parents were not in court yesterday. Asked why by State Counsel Lee Cheow Han, Staff Sgt Chng said the couple have gone overseas to forget what had happened. They have another child, a girl aged 10.</p>
              <p>State Coroner Earnest Lau recorded a verdict of suicide.</p>
