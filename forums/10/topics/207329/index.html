            <div class='col-md body'>Note the growth areas in Singapore's economy. That's where jobs are available in the manufacturing industries...<br><br>"SINGAPORE'S manufacturing output in July went up 19.6 per cent compared to a year ago, the Economic Development Board said on Monday.<br><br>In the statement, it said that the seasonally adjusted index fell 2.2 per cent from June. Manufacturing output grew by 22.6 per cent in June.<br><br>The biomedical manufacturing cluster led the higher output by growing 52.6 per cent in July.The transport engineering cluster grew 44.2 per cent.<br><br>The electronics cluster grew 11.1 per cent. EDB said that the growth was due solely to the semiconductor segment, which grew 44.4 per cent. The data storage segment of the cluster fell 23.8 per cent as manufacturers move their factories out of Singapore.<br><br>The precision engineering cluster was up 9.2 per cent. The chemical cluster grew only 0.4 per cent. general manufacturing grew 2.2 per cent.<br><br>For the first seven months of the year, EDB said that manufacturing output was up 16.6 per cent over last year."<br><br>(Straits Times, 28 Aug)</div>
