              <p>I have heard of a businessman</p>
              <p>who thinks very highly of himself.</p>
              <p>he keeps reminding people he is a millionaire,somehow.</p>
              <p>he keeps hinting to people he stays in expensive places and drive expensive cars.</p>
              <p>he keeps hinting to people he try to dress humbly even when he is rich.</p>
              <p>he keeps telling people his main aim in doing business is not to earn money but to help society.</p>
              <p>he keeps telling people he has connections and he was given business when he did not know anything about running a particular business. that he knows many important people.</p>
              <p>he keeps telling people he buys things for charities and religous organisations and visits terminally-illed patients.</p>
              <p>do you think he donates certain amount of percentage of his revenue to some religious organisations?</p>
              <p>He intimidates people who resign even though his employee served the notice properly. he intimidates them saying he knows a lot of influential people and those who resign, indirectly affecting his revenue earning ability, that he can make this guy future gone by asking his friends who are business owners to refuse job opportunities to these ex-employees. or simply find ways to make their lives in other companies miserable.</p>
              <p>He says he is a leader in society and knows VIP.</p>
              <p>When talking to staff, he always preach. he always talk in lengths such that his staff also tak boleh tahan and tulan. and he preach religion to his staff and people he meet.</p>
              <p>he always thinks that he is smarter than you.</p>
              <p>what is you views of such people?</p>

              <p>unfortunately,</p>
              <p>he is very influential both in non-secular and secular arena and has connections with VIP, if u know who I mean.</p>
              <p>thus, i can only voice out here without revealing his name.</p>
              <p>he keeps reminding me that he is a greenroot leader, if u know wtf i mean.</p>
              <p>he said long ago, he was asked to take part or spearhead an island-wide project and led to success.</p>
              <p>I think some may already know who I talking about since this guy is known to others as well as someone who is a 'millionaire' and not to play play with him.</p>
              <p>actually, many people in sgpore are millionaires if their flat, car and savings and investments and cpf are considered by the time they reach 50-66.</p>
              <p>he needs to be a billionaire in order to impress me.</p>
              <p>he is a devil masked in a sheep's skin trying to sell ko-yo to naive people who will work for him using preaching to saiko them.</p>
              <p>This reminds me of a cult from usa that saiko'd many of his disciples to surrender their salaries to him and women to give him free sex and mass suicide.</p>
              <p>the power of persuasion is very great and it exist, at least I have known this kind of bad people exist.</p>
              <p>people, please beware.</p>
