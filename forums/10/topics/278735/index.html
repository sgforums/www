Singaporeans appear to mind less than, say, a Brit, American or Thai.<br><br>However, there are implications of it for a democracy. Theoretically, democracy means about the right of people making a choice.<br><br>A party that wins everything causes the survival of other parties to be at stake and hampers their build-up and this in turn discourages competition and leads to walkovers.<br><br>In my view, elections with walkovers mean lesser people get to exercise their choice and almost rids the purpose of having an elections. For this, all seats have to be contested and this role ends up in the opposition's plate. Activists and renowned bloggers can neither block the ruling party's power nor do they wish to.<br><br>However, for all the desire opposition parties have, limited success increases their difficulty in getting good people to join them and become candidates, causing the walkovers.<br><br>It is a vicious cycle, as I have wrote in an article in 2005:<br><br>http://melvintansg.blogspot.com/2005/03/vote-for-chance-to-vote-again.html<br><br>There are almost no examples in the world of zero opposition in a democracy. Effectively, even Singapore has 3 opposition MPs.<br><br>Regards</div>

It's simply how you defend your stand.<br><br>Also, in relation to your question, one interesting point to note is the fact that the President of Singapore was conferred certain powers with a view to act as an independent check of the government. That is why the government must actually consult the President whenever they desire to draw from the country's reserves or make any major decisions involving State-owned companies.<br><br>The President that really did this job well was the late President Ong. He made the government sweat, and in the end, fell out of favour with them. This is realistically the only check and balance of the government that we have who has some power to actually restrict arbitrary decisions of the government.<br><br>In Australia, they do have an interesting concept in their Federal and State governments in that the opposition will become shadow ministers. That is unfortunately, not viable for Singapore due to the obvious difference in numbers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think a zero opposition democracy like Singapore has its own advantages in its own way. Like, we are able to change policies faster, make more decisions faster from the government since practically there is no need to debate as all is just a walkover. Being this fast, may be a plus point for investors to come to Singapore which it has been for the past decades.<br><br>Of course its not that they dun have disadvantages, such examples would be the million dollar salaries that they pay themselves and ever increasing gst and such without a valid or reasonable reason. Increase gst to help the poor and pay million dollar salaries to minister is to deter corruption is neither a valid nor reasonable reason.<br><br>At the end of the day, we just need to consider whether which type of government has more pros den cons. I believe myself true democracy is the best form of government but i don't believe every country is suitable for it. Let the people choose the type of government through elections, however I think the stage is set too high for oppositions by the PAP.</div>
