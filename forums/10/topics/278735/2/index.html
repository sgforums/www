Like, we are able to change policies faster, make more decisions faster from the government since practically there is no need to debate as all is just a walkover. Being this fast, may be a plus point for investors to come to Singapore which it has been for the past decades.<br><br>Of course its not that they dun have disadvantages, such examples would be the million dollar salaries that they pay themselves and ever increasing gst and such without a valid or reasonable reason. Increase gst to help the poor and pay million dollar salaries to minister is to deter corruption is neither a valid nor reasonable reason.<br><br>At the end of the day, we just need to consider whether which type of government has more pros den cons. I believe myself true democracy is the best form of government but i don't believe every country is suitable for it. Let the people choose the type of government through elections, however I think the stage is set too high for oppositions by the PAP.</div></blockquote>Interesting points but I beg to differ. For the PAP to change policies does not need them to have zero opposition. Rather, it needs only two-thirds majority.<br><br>In Singapore's case, it is 84 / 3 = 28 x 2 = 56 PAP seats. Opposition seats will need to be 28 to give PAP 56 seats.<br><br>While having zero opposition and 28 opposition appears to be no different, this is only in the sense of a "rubber stamp" Parliament. However, the latter would mean a more stable, well-grown and capable opposition who can take over the government sooner than the former and is encouraged by their success given by the people to field a full slate thereby giving every voter in Singapore a choice.<br><br>Whereas an opposition party with no seats in Parliament will languish and find it difficult to either recruit both candidates and members or recruit good ones in better case scenarios.<br><br>They will also find it harder to reach out to the people via media and constituency activities and will probably crash the country if they suddenly find themselves with 42 seats and asked to operate after having zero seats for so long.<br><br>Regards</div>

Thereby, they are more experienced and knowledgeable and an easier and lesser time<br>to tide over the changes which may come.<br><br>As much as I do not like the PAPs, the opposition is greatly a disappointment to me with actions like forgetting to hand in a form. While their mindset for the greater good of Singaporeans is worth praising, their capability of running the country is reflected by such mistakes they make.<br><br>People like CSJ, to me is a patroitic Singaporean, for his love of his country, he went all out to fight against the PAP where setbacks like bankrupt and jail terms does not stop him. While we should give him a tap on his back for his determination, I do not want a leader like him.<br><br>PAP may be seen as ruthless, uncaring or selfish, they still have some qualities worth commenting. Like how they defended their rule over the decades, giving oppositions no chance at all. I mean, you won't want a government that loses its place in every election right?<br>While this shows that we have a true democracy and oppositions are as strong as the current government, but if one is to look in the other way, the current government is weak since it loses their place easily to their opposition.<br><br>Because this shows that the government is easily pushed over, especially when it comes to diplomacy with other countries. With low opposition in Singapore, we are showing the world our government is strong and are able to put down any forms of oppositions in place and that we are no push overs.<br><br></div>

Furthermore, they think that we are deprived from voicing out and the right to make a choice which I think is rather true.<br><br>There are many reasons why we are not fighting back. Here's a few that I personally think I myself should not choose the opposition.<br><br>1) No capable opposition(As they have no chance to showcase their skills, this is debatable)<br>2) A certain amount of risk is involved, too many 'what ifs' should there be a change in government<br>3) It has become a way of our life to silently take the bashing from the government<br>4) 42years undisputed champions, this means they are capable of defending their position. (though i think some of the actions are a little underhand)<br>5) Looking at our neighbours, I'm glad I'm a Singaporean. I don't mind paying abit more for security.<br>6) I have not been victimized yet. I know this seems selfish but, how many of us are not?<br><br>Anyway, many governments in the world also wished they could be like us. Every election to them is a pain in their asses.

Is the desire for change one to improve the overall quality of life, or is it one for the sake of change. I personally feel that at times, it does seem as if it's the latter.<br><br>Also, I personally don't see the need to bring the system in Singapore in line with other democratic systems. I believe in modifications to better serve the people. There isn't much point to have a system that's in line with the rest of the others and not have it work for the good of the people.<br><br>I'm not against change. I just feel that the intentions for change should be clear and the overall welfare of the people should be the main driving force effecting change.<br><br></div>

Thanks.  wow, din know even if Opposition wins another unbelievable 25 more seats, ruling party still gets to decide how it wants to change the policies.<br><br>I think [b]its all about money </strong>to attract talents. This jus my personal opine.<br>What if hypothetically, a rich tycoon willing to sponsor Opposition to pay same top dollar for talent to join Opposition? Will that help in anyway? Is that possible in the 1st place? Can tycoons donate to Opposition?<br>Again, this is merely a hypo question.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Hi,<br><br>Yes. However, 28 seats can turn into 29 or more seats more easily than zero or 3 seats. With 29 seats, the opposition combined can block the PAP from passing a legislation that involves changing of details in a statute.<br><br>The concern then would be whether the opposition will be responsible enough not to block the PAP for the sake of flexing muscles. This is why I believe in a responsible opposition that has to analyse the situation and agree with PAP if the situation calls for it, although I have seen significants numbers on the internet appearing to disagree (unless I read them wrongly).<br><br>As to using money to attract talents, I am not sure if it will work. Money may not attract talents if a party's leadership can't tell who's a talent and who's not. Of course, we have to bear in mind that any selection process is not 100% foolproof but there exists a wide margin of error depending on who's the leadership.<br><br>Tycoons may donate to the opposition but personally, I think at the present moment, it is neither advisable nor probable due to the situation.<br><br>Regards</div>
