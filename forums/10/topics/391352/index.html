              <h1>Singaporean worried about Temasek Holdings raising funds via placement of public bonds</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">February 19, 2010</span></p>
              <p>A Singaporean by the name of Lim Kay Soon has written to the Straits Times Forum today expressing his fears about Temasek Holdings’ “upward revision of its private fund-raising scope from US$5 billion (S$7 billion) to US$10 billion”.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p><em>“By raising funds via placement of public bonds which Temasek fully and unconditionally guarantees, Temasek is no longer only managing Singapore’s surplus funds. It has, in fact, morphed into a semi-private fund management company,”</em> he wrote.</p>
              <p>Set up in 1974 to manage Singapore’s strategic “assets”, an euphemism for state-owned companies, Temasek Holdings has evolved to become a major international fund under the leadership of Ho Ching, the wife of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>Under her charge, Temasek bought stakes in many international companies such as Thailand’s Shin Corp, Australia’s ABC Learning and U.S’s Merrill Lynch which were all disastrous flops resulting in loss of billions of dollars.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim is concerned about Temasek “indirectly leveraging on its triple A status – which comes from Singapore’s surplus funds – to access global private funds.”</p>
              <p><em>“As with all investments, there are two possible outcomes, winning or losing. Should Temasek lose all of Singapore’s surplus funds, that would be sad, but Singapore would be able to painfully bear with it. On the other hand, should Temasek also lose with its borrowed money, it will not only hurt Singapore’s pockets, but may also shake the world’s confidence in Singapore as a top financial centre,”</em> he added.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim’s fears have been misplaced. Temasek Holdings is a “commercial entity” or an “Asian investment firm” which is owned solely by the Ministry of Finance. It has nothing to do with Singaporeans or Singapore. Neither does it have to account to anybody for its investments decision.</p>
              <p>He ended his letter by asking if Temasek should be allowed to trade with Singapore’s future:</p>
              <p><em>“Singapore’s financial strength and stability is a key pillar of its economy. Should Temasek be allowed to leverage on and trade with the nation’s future?”</em></p>
              <p>Mr Lim should stop wasting time asking questions which will yield any answers from the authorities. He should just accept Finance Minister Tharman’s exhortations and “trust” the system.</p>
              <p>After all, whether Temasek makes money or not is really none of Singaporeans’ business since they will never benefit from it in the first place.</p>

              <p>That's Martingale, you can't keep on losing on every bet right, if you double with every loss, you will eventually win, at least that's the logic behind it. Good thing casinos have table limits. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Originally, <em><strong>martingale</strong></em> referred to a class of <a title="Betting strategy" href="/wiki/Betting_strategy"><span style="color: #002bb8;">betting strategies</span></a> popular in 18th century <a title="France" href="/wiki/France"><span style="color: #002bb8;">France</span></a>. The simplest of these strategies was designed for a game in which the gambler wins his stake if a coin comes up heads and loses it if the coin comes up tails. The strategy had the gambler double his bet after every loss, so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. Since a gambler with infinite wealth will <a title="Almost surely" href="/wiki/Almost_surely"><span style="color: #002bb8;">with probability 1</span></a> eventually flip heads, the Martingale betting strategy was seen as a <a title="Certainty" href="/wiki/Certainty"><span style="color: #002bb8;">sure thing</span></a> by those who advocated it. Of course, none of the gamblers in fact possessed infinite wealth, and the <a title="Exponential growth" href="/wiki/Exponential_growth"><span style="color: #002bb8;">exponential growth</span></a> of the bets would eventually bankrupt those who chose to use the Martingale. It is widely believed that casinos instituted betting limits specifically to stop Martingale players, but in reality the assumptions behind the strategy are unsound. Players using the Martingale system do not have any long-term mathematical advantage over any other betting system or even randomly placed bets.</p>

              <p>The events unfolding at Temasek is due to the fact that even the PAP believe that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_lzrGUGAWM"><strong>’Money No Enough’</strong> </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now that there is a counselling service for those known to be addicted to gambling - it is suggested that the "dragon and the horse" should both seek counselling before attempting to fool around with Singapore's Money.</p>
              <p>It is stooooopid for MM LKY to create the two key safeguard on Singapore's National Reserves - with one held by Parliament and the other by the Elected President - when the annual surplus is diverted from the Finance Ministry to the GIC and Temasek.</p>
              <p>With a PAP selected and approved candidates dominating Parliament and unable to vote according to each personal conscience, and the Elected Presdiency being a PAP "annointed and appointed" person - it does not take too much imagination to see the inability of both holders of the Keys being dumb and deaf to the situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is recommended that the following be viewed - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5opFJ73GaY"><strong>’Singapore Temasek Holdings handle Employee Bonus Plans’</strong> </a>- so as to understand how Singaporeans can be expected to be treated by this PAP government.</p>
              <p>Otherwise review the following from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCZJYPW3QXw"><strong>‘from Singapore Election 2006’</strong>  </a>so as to prepare ourselves for <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP_fas_XueU"><strong>’Singapore General Election 2010’ </strong></a></p>
