Imagine how much profits a bank can make if they can force every Singaporean to "save" $20,000 at 3.5% and $40,000 at 4% on a long term basis with regular contribution.<br><span style="color: red;">I don't think CPF has ever hold itself as a bank. So your 'unfortunate' thingy is out of place. Without having to repeat tirelessly, CPF is also not a pension fund. It is simply a compulsory savings scheme with contributions from employers. The original aim still remains - that is as a providence after retirement. However, retirement is no longer seen as 55. It has been pushed to 62 or 65? That's because SGreans are having so good a life that their life-span has also increase. With the exception of a few fit and trim who died suddenly at marathons, the general populace are now living longer. So as a retirement scheme, it has to be able to support the 'extended life'. If it can be ascertain that every CPF member will definitely died at age 65, then withdrawal at 55 is no problem - 10 years to witttle away 30-35 years of savings is still OK.</span><br><br>If a person earned 4% compounded interest over 30 years, his 1 dollar would have been 1.03^30 = $2.427 dollars.<br><br>If a bank can achieve 8 % returns over 30 years, the bank would have made 1.08^30 = $10.06 dollars for every dollar invested.<br><br>If such a bank exist, they can earn ($10.06 - $2.427) $7.635  per dollar saved by Singaporeans.Now thats profits! I am sure you agree the govt can keep them because its like a bank.<br><br>And if you think CPF is paying good guaranteed rates, you should look at <a href="http://www.avivadirect.sg/whatweoffer/bige/benefits.html" rel="nofollow"> AVIVA big E </a>. They can pay 3.5% interest with guaranteed returns yet make a profit from it.<br><br>If there is a bank that can force people to save like the way CPF board does, let me know. I would be first to buy shares of such a bank.<br><span style="color: red;">You seemed good at figures but poor in logic. Do banks share their profits with you, the depositor? How much interest do you get from your savings bank? Do you know how CPF rate is pegged? Go research that!</span><br><br>You should search your conscience and think if its right making all these profits from the retirement savings of Singaporeans. The pioneer batch of Singaporeans in the CPF scheme were only allowed to invest in unit trusts in 1999 and were earning "risk free interest". Now many of them do not have enough to retire and have to postpone retirement despite Singapore having one of the highest savings rate of 40% in the world.<br><span style="color: red;">Your statement about making profit is subjective. You should apply the same yardstick to banks where you put your savings if you don't leave it with CPF. Therefore, I think your conscience is muddle up here!</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I understand the reason for unlocking CPF savings is to enable members to buy homes, and if they don't or got spare beyond the minimum sum, they can invest in approved securities. What you failed to realise is this: there is a minimum sum to ensure there is enough for retirement. There are many CPF members who got millions in their accounts. These people want to use it for property and stocks! These people have certainly more than they need for retirement.

Every month, quarter, half-yearly or annually?  I think the NUS economists are wrong in saying Â“members have not benefited from compounding". The question is how often interest rate is payable. If it is once a year, that is obviously different from 12 times a year!  Unless you know the exact meaning of the word Â‘realÂ’ you cannot be certain whether inflation has been factored in!  However, my common sense tells me this: even if CPF pays 2.5% per year for the next 5 years, my Â‘realÂ’ interest rate can never be less than 2.5%, excluding inflation rate, average dividend rate, average SIBOR rate, etc.<br>Again: you have to answer my question on how CPF pegged its rate.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Your chart on dividend is irrelevant.  You are assuming that CPF is an investment scheme or fund!!!! IT IS NOT !!!! If you keep thinking that CPF is an investment scheme and not a provident fund Â– your arguments will be like someone who said: Â“I saved $1.00 by not taking the bus.Â” Why not say -  I saved $10 by not taking a cab???</span><br><br>You cant seem to comprehend the simple logic that in the case of CPF board, both the stake holders and the depositor are the same. Now who is weak in logic?<br><span style="color: red;">You are mistaken; you have an account with CPF.  You donÂ’t have a share in CPF !!!<br>When you place your savings in the bank Â– you are the depositor or account-holder. You are not a stakeholder of the bank!  Go read up your finance or economics. Maybe you should go to NUS where the professors canÂ’t tell it right.</span><br><br>The same yardstick would not be used on banks because they are profit making entities. Is CPF a profit making entity? Especially when the stakeholders are different? You say there are many CPF members with millions in their account. how many percent??<br><span style="color: red;">Now, you are contradicting yourself.  On one had you want CPF to be like bank and invest company, and on the other hand you say the same yardstick cannot be applied. Also, what has the number of members with millions in their CPF got to do with your postulation? I merely mentioned them just to compare with those who have little in their CPF. Actually the issue and the on-going debates should be:<br>1) populace living longer;<br>2) CPF balance insufficient to see to the end.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">The issue is not about returns or investment. Those with low incomes cannot even meet the minimum sum. If you tell this people about investment and the rate of return - they will call you shioa!</span><br><br>And you cant comprehend simple figures? The govt makes the difference between what it pays out to the members and what it earns from GIC and Temasek.<br><span style="color: red;">Now, I see what your arguments are about. You are not concern about those earning low incomes, having insufficient CPF to see to their grand golden old age.  I am afraid we are on different wavelength. </span><br></div>

The earlier part was factual, the later part seemed clouded with political overtone.  Like I said in some other threads - set aside the personal gripe, political agenda or sympathy and look squarely at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">circumstances giving rise </span></span>(or need) for a change (or twist) to the CPF.<br>While it is good to question, debate, oppose - one must not be prejudicial, bias, factor in personal agenda or worse still vendatta. I see over and over again an UNDERLYING assertion in all the threads I read: that the gahmen is up to no good, delaying withdrawal so as to profit from poor CPF or rich CPF members, using the fund for personal empire-building, dynastic entrenchment, and a whole lot of unconnected issues and allegations.<br>The bottom-line is this: Are you against the scheme per se or are you against the gahmen or some political figures? I know this is difficult to segregate cos the annuity scheme is a gahmen initiative not a private one.</div>

I went thru schools and had many opportunities to correct professors. One such: a professor at a Speak Mandarin Campaign said Chinese who cannot speak Mandarin are not Chinese. I stood up and asked him: did his grand cho-kong speak Mandarin? He couldn't answer me and his face changed colour. I was sure he looked like an Indian!</div>
