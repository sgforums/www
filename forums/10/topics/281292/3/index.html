The earlier part was factual, the later part seemed clouded with political overtone.  Like I said in some other threads - set aside the personal gripe, political agenda or sympathy and look squarely at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">circumstances giving rise </span></span>(or need) for a change (or twist) to the CPF.<br>While it is good to question, debate, oppose - one must not be prejudicial, bias, factor in personal agenda or worse still vendatta. I see over and over again an UNDERLYING assertion in all the threads I read: that the gahmen is up to no good, delaying withdrawal so as to profit from poor CPF or rich CPF members, using the fund for personal empire-building, dynastic entrenchment, and a whole lot of unconnected issues and allegations.<br>The bottom-line is this: Are you against the scheme per se or are you against the gahmen or some political figures? I know this is difficult to segregate cos the annuity scheme is a gahmen initiative not a private one.</strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">There is nothing easier to segregate then the difference of the Government's intentions and the actions as clearly seen from what has transpired and from the words used in their speeches.<br><br>The beginning of the post was factual based on events that had been documented, while the future is more murky as the course of events from what had been documented differs from what has transpired and yet to be recorded in historical acounts - all of which can only lead us to think and conclude that this Government has been dishonest to Singaporeans.<br><br>Leaving aside your own bias and knee-jerk reaction to see every negative post towards the Government as a political agenda or personal prejudice, can you even begin to appreciate the gravity of what the Government is proposing and expect Singaporeans to swallow ?<br><br>It is easy for the Government to dictate and force Singaporeans to accept that what has been decided is based on their own idea of it being the Best for Singaporeans.<br><br>Surely, the collective wisdom of all clear thinking and yet-to-be senile Elderly - as will as those soon to be elderly - will be of higher standards than that of a handful of MIW Elite in Cabinet ?<br><br>If this Government aka MIW respect Singaporean and will make Singaporean responsible for ourselves, then the Government aka MIW should put this Annuity Scheme to a Referendum, and with both sides accepting the outcome as a National Project.<br><br>However, the Referendum should be transparently prepared, and not in the same crooked one-sided manner that guarantee a single outcome in the purposeful manner that the MIW desire - as had happened in the cunningly designed Referendum to join Malaysia.<br><br></span><br></div>

Like I said: I see the need for annuity scheme based on the circumstances arising not from political objectives however you want to view them in your own scheme of thing. All I can detect is that you have little reason to support or not to support the scheme but plenty of <span style="color: red;">political vibes</span>.<br>Perhaps, you can suggest an alternative solution - present it to the opposition for them to do battle for you, or you can even go to parliament and petition.<br>Let me hear your alternative, not political vibes!</div>

It continues to act as a deterrent to would-be aggressors. Hardly anyone, then and now, will disagree that National service should be continued.<br><br>The annuity scheme, on the other hand, requires that one use a portion of one's CPF to <span style="color: red;"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">PAY</span></strong></span> for an 'insurance-styled' coverage for extreme old age, an age that has been proven statistically inept in SG but which nonetheless was selected by our govt and used as a benchmark.<br><br>In essence, the govt is suggesting, forcefully through legislation, that we fork out a compulsory sum of our own monies to pay for our own well-being.<br><br>Does that sound right to you?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by TheGoodEarth:</div><div class="quote_body">Coming back to annuity - go take up a finance course or actuarial science.

BTW, investing in Msia is really dangerous for pure breed Sporean. U guys dont know how Msia works whereas I know how both Spore and Msia works.
