            <div class='col-md body'>In reply to a question by opposition MP Low Thia Khiang (Hougang) on whether the GIC uses funds from the CPF funds to invest, Dr Ng said: Â“The answer is no.Â”<br><br>Using a banking analogy, he explained,<br><br>Â“You put money in a bank and you agree that you put it there and you get 2 per cent. The bank publishes a report and says of all its earnings, it earned 8 per cent. You go to the bank and say, I want 8 per cent.

Imagine how much profits a bank can make if they can force every Singaporean to "save" $20,000 at 3.5% and $40,000 at 4% on a long term basis with regular contribution.<br><br>If a person earned 4% compounded interest over 30 years, his 1 dollar would have been 1.04^30 = $3.24 dollars.<br><br>If a bank can achieve 8 % returns over 30 years, the bank would have made 1.08^30 = $10.06 dollars for every dollar invested.<br><br>If such a bank exist, they can earn ($10.06 - $3.24) $6.82  per dollar saved by Singaporeans.Now thats profits! I am sure you agree the govt can keep them because its like a bank.<br><br>And if you think CPF is paying good guaranteed rates, you should look at <a href="http://www.avivadirect.sg/whatweoffer/bige/benefits.html" rel="nofollow"> AVIVA big E </a>. They can pay 3.5% interest with guaranteed returns yet make a profit from it.<br><br>If there is a bank that can force people to save like the way CPF board does, let me know. I would be first to buy shares of such a bank.<br><br>You should search your conscience and think if its right making all these profits from the retirement savings of Singaporeans. The pioneer batch of Singaporeans in the CPF scheme were only allowed to invest in unit trusts in 1999 and were earning "risk free interest". Now many of them do not have enough to retire and have to postpone retirement despite Singapore having one of the highest savings rate of 40% in the world.<br><br>P.S. I am waiting for the CPF board to release the returns on the funds under the CPF investment scheme till 2007. They are using 2005 data and did not take account into the rise the market lately.<br><br></div>

For the central bank MAS, there is no chance of default because they can just print more money.This probably makes it one of the profitable "bank" as it can invest all the money and repay its obligation by printing paper. Other commercial banks would have to keep a portion uninvested to meet their potential liabilities.</div>
