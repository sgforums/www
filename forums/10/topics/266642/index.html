But then again, does not frozen water take on the shape of its container?<br><br>This is one or MANY reasons, myself along with many others, are holding back on having children.<br><br>==============================================<br><strong>PRI 1 REGISTRATION: SOME PARENTS TRY DESPERATE TACTICS<br>SON, PERFORM FOR PRINCIPAL  </strong><br><br>This month, parents of 6-year-olds are battling to get their little ones into a primary school of their choice next year. Principals of several primar schools describe to FAITH TEO some of the tactics some parents try to get their way<br>July 08, 2007<br><br>THE MY-CHILD- THE-GENIUS PARENT<br><br>Mensa memberships, result slips and recommendations from elite kindergartens, and certificates from expensive speech and drama classes are commonplace now.<br><br>Increasingly, principals find themselves sitting through a circus-act of 'talents' as parents make their children play the violin, perform complicated ballet moves or write Chinese calligraphy.<br><br>'Some even make their four-year-olds read to the principal, as a way to secure a place in the future,' revealed Madam Ng Siew Huang, vice-principal of Pei Chun Public School.<br><br>'However, it's very stressful for the child to perform in those few minutes. It's quite unhealthy for the kid. Sometimes you wonder why parents have to pressure them so hard.'<br><br>Madam Ng added that showcasing talents, however earnest, does not mean an automatic place.<br><br>THE SUPER-VOLUNTEER PARENT<br><br>Some parents offer their services to the school years in advance.<br><br>'They start applying for volunteer work as soon as the child turns 2.<br><br>Usually we will reject them as that's too early, and we don't know if criteria or policies for Primary One registration will change in the meantime,' said Mrs Seline Ng.<br><br>Some schools have even upped the minimum number of volunteer-hours from a basic 40 to 60, and St Hilda's Primary School's vice-principal Danny Poh said the school regularly conducts interviews with hundreds of parents vying for a few places.<br><br>THE SUPER-RESUME PARENT<br><br>Some parents even showcase their own talents as an indication of their child's future potential.<br><br>They write detailed resumes of their accomplishments, whether in work, sports or the arts.<br><br>Resumes are sent in 'to show us how much they can help the school in volunteer work', said MrsSeline Ng, principal of Rosyth School.<br><br>THE POOR-THING PARENTS<br><br>One principal had to deal with the same crying parent three or four times because she wanted her child to be in a school near to where her babysitter lived.<br><br>It was draining for both the principal and the parent, who got more agitated each time she was rejected. But Pei Chun's Madam Ng makes it clear that rules are rules.<br><br>'They hope we can give them a concession. But we're not in a position to do that because we have to follow rules.'<br><br>THE CLOSE-PROXIMITY PARENT<br><br>These are usually parents who have some cash to spare. They'll either uproot their families to within a kilometre of the school, or buy properties in that range so that the addresses can be used for registration.<br><br>Said Rosyth's Mrs Ng: 'They express it during parent volunteer interviews. Or they write to us to tell us that they're buying houses or condos within the area, or that they have already put down deposits for a property.'<br><br>THE THROW-MONEY PARENTS<br><br>These parents offer to 'donate' large sums if this can secure their kids a place.<br><br>'I once had an offer of $38,000 in cash donations from one parent. Some want to replace all the computers in the school's computer labs,' said a principal of an elite primary school<br><br>'The offers are rejected if the intention is not altruistic, because these donations don't give their child any priority over the rest.'<br><br></div>
