            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I agree with Atobe that our roads are planned  years ago.<br><br>The Bedok Reservoir Ave 3 link to the PIE was planned more than 10 years ago. It is only now being made.<br>I come to this conclusion, because all these years, I noticed the Bedok Green Secondary School signage was built at an odd curve. I always wondered when I passed it, why it was built in that manner. When the link was being built, I understood. The curve fitted exactly with the slip road. When the school was built, the slip road had already been planned.<br>So it is something that was planned more than 10 years ago, to cater to todays situation.<br>That is why the CTE is inadequate today.<br><br>But there is also the "stadium effect". This was coined by Mr Yong Nyuk Lin, the first minister appointed to handle the congestion issue in the 1970s. He introduced the Park &amp; Ride system, which caused him to be parked in London, as an envoy.<br>My Yong surmised that there is enough road space and the transportation system adequate, the problem being that the massess comming out all at the same time, like after a football match. This is the problem,he said.<br>I agree with that. The congestion is most acute going to work and going home. At other times, special events causes congestion.<br>Too many people owning cars, want to use their cars, at the same time.<br>Congestion don't happen 24/7.<br><br>Staggering work hours would help disperse the some of the volume of traffic. Developing regional centres, and dispersing the business centres would also redirect traffic away from the CBD. Tampines and Woodlands were earmarked as regional centres, and more is supposed to come up, I wonder what happened to that plan.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"> <span style="font-style: italic;">Originally posted by Atobe</span></div><div class="quote_body">The Traffic Police should change their attention on catching speedsters, but to actually manage traffic situations along Expressways. </div></blockquote>Yes, the TP can help in regulating traffic. I think this is the best ad hoc solution. Their presence not only induces better driving discipline and courtesy. They would also help ensure a smooth flow of traffic. Traffic need to flow, speed is not essential. There is no point in speeding along the expressway, only to queue and wait your turn at the exit.<br>The TP should go about policing traffic, rather than nabbing offenders.<br>The Police should then take over the duty of catching the offenders. Smoky exhaust, overloading, illegal modification let the police handle those.<br><br>This is only part of a multi faceted approach to traffic management. Other aspects can also tacitly contribute to the efficient  management of vehicular traffic on our roads. Town planning, population distribution, business districts, social education all can play a part.</div>

Your minimum down-payment is still-born bird-brain. What impact does it make? To those who cannot afford, they will find ways to meet the minimum - another loan from somewhere.<br>Let me say your gripe - whether you are car-owner or not, is that the gahmen (why PAP?) is collecting monies.  So, you don't want the gahmen to have revenues - but you want everything to be paid for by PAP members?<br>Again, your last statement is just idiotic.
