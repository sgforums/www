            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br><strong>Does ERP work?</strong><br><br>What is it?<br><br>What does it do?<br><br>1. <strong>Tax road usage</strong>?    Is there no <strong>Road tax already</strong>? double tax?<br>2. Solve congestion?  Ease congestion? Give u a better driving experience?<br>3. a Painful decision for your own good?<br><br>So what the ^&amp;%$# does it do?<br><br><strong>You the People have any %#@#@ thing to say</strong>?<br><br>No? I take that as acceptance, even approval?<br><br>To help the majority understand my point, consider this:<br><br>1. <strong>Assumption</strong> : ERP is good and effective. It helps ease congestion and gives you a greater more enjoyable driving experience.<br><br>2. So, good, you implement it everywhere. Extend the ERP reach. <strong> All roads get ERP</strong> starting from the time you exit your estate onto the main road, since people accept it that it works.<br><br>3. You charge S$1 more. extend the hours to cover 9 to 5 and 5 to 9.<br><br>What would be the effect?<br><br>1. <strong>No more traffic congestion?</strong>  People deterred to drive to work and just shutdown their car having paid S$40K-200K?  No need to drive to work? No need to use it for groceries? No need to send kids to school? Wife to work? So, they rather place their car in the carpark and let it rot? Taxi need not ply? Transport trucks and cars need not operate and transport companies shutdown? Car makers close shop as no one wants new car? Toyota, Nissan, Mitshubitshi exit singapore? thousands car sales men/women jobless? 2nd hand car dealers bankrupt?  COE only $1?<br><br>2. <strong>Life goes on, people kpkb but LL</strong>, no choice, life must go on, show must go on, tax increase but LL still pay and pay until they kb but accept their fate. Thus, traffic congestion continues as it was before since all roads are ERP'd. After a year, People memory get alzheimers. Like it never happened. All in your imagination.<br><br>Which scenario would it be?<br><br>Why the world only singapore has ERP (maybe some roads on taiwan) ?<br>USA so many jam, why they not so smart to implement? They think it will not work due to above assumption scenarios?<br><br><strong>Is it not just a form of additional road tax?</strong><br>I am as ignorant as many singaporeans. Just as naive as them. So, let me know your views. <strong>What is your say</strong>?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing they didn't notice is the jams ERP has caused to all the other so called "detours".<br><br>Yesterday i tried to avoid the CTE ERP at 6pm but then ended up getting stuck along bendemeer for 1 hour.<br><br>And yes. While in the jam, I question the existence of ERP too. I mean the amount of traffic/ vehicles are the same. They either use the roads that have ERP or they use an alternate route. Say before ERP, 60% of the vehicles are on Expressways, 40% on the alternate road. During ERP, 70% on the minor roads and 30% on expressways. What is the point of this? Why would they want more cars to travel on minor roads (2 lanes) when expressways have 4 lanes?<br><br>Imho, it doesn't solve problems. ERP only sweeps the dirt under the rug by boasting that it increases the vehicle travelling speed on expressways by 15-20%. What about those other roads that have travelling speeds reduced by 50-70%?</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>If you are the rich, you will not detour. You will simply pay and hope that they raise it even higher so that even more will detour. One day you will start to see differentiated ERP, that is some lanes will cost more than others in the expressway itself if people continue to vote in dictators because of the fear the dictators has put in their hearts.<br><br>Therefore the proposal below, I think, is still the best all things considered.<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=276529" rel="nofollow">The way to make PAP accountable without getting rid of them</a><br><br>This proposal is so powerful until people actually warn me that I might have police reports made against me for making such a proposal.<br><br>Promote it if you want a fairer system in Singapore!</div>
