            <div class='col-md body'>This problem is easy to solve. Just take away their car (MM, SM, PM &amp; MP plus their family &amp; relative &amp; civil servants) and call them to take public transport. If they want to convince other to take public transport, they should be the one to do so, but I doubt they would do so.

            <div class='col-md body'>Damn. Where was I when this thread started.<br><br>ERP certainly by no means reduces the traffic problem as the total number of cars on the road remain at least the same. Truth be told, the total number of cars on the road are actually increasing every year.<br><br>The only thing the ERP really achieves, apart from the obvious filling of government coffers, is that it eases a little traffic from implemented zones. This, at the expense of the smaller roads that, under current ERP implementation, are deemed not obstructive to the business district.<br><br>Recently, they wisened to the fact that as a result of the ERP, traffic congestions were occuring in the areas immediately sorrounding "town", like redhill and kallang. Thus ERP is being implemented on those roads too.<br><br>What would be the eventual end of this as the number of cars keep increasing? We find that ERP will have to be implemented on several other roads as soon as people find another way to bypass the ERP.<br><br>While I won't be quick to say only the rich benefit from this arrangement, the folk who are headed to town for work usually are able to claim the ERP back from their bosses, the big multinational companies. Which DOES leave the poorer non-town folk with lesser choices for roads.<br><br>My conclusion is that ERP is a temporary road-diversion solution which in the longer run has to be implemented on all the roads, because of the "pushover" effect. What we are left with effectively then would be "taxes" of sorts but no solution.<br><br>What would genuinely reduce the traffic problem? And what are the side effects?<br><br>1. People take public transport.<br><br>This certainly is the ideal. The slight side-effect would definitely be the increase in costs for public transport as the public transport companies scramble to increase their fleet.<br><br>Greater business costs and sharp demand for public transport would cause prices to increase at least twofold, which translates to some $1-2 extra per trip. Fuel prices can also be expected to increase due to the drop in consumer demand for petrol as there are less and less car owners. The amount is a small price to pay. Estimating a daily return trip at $6, this would translate to $180 monthly per commuter. Still better than paying $700-$900+ a month for a car.<br><br>There is a slight problem with this arrangement. Transport past midnight will be completely dependable on taxi services as no one wants to pay $700 a month for a car they can only use at midnight.<br><br>I hope there wont be additional costs as a result of 24 hour operations or increase in demand for taxis past midnight.<br><br>SBS, SMRT, Comfort DelGro, and their majority stakeholder Temasek Holdings will have some planning to keep costs minimal.<br><br>2. COEs are not given out as readily as they are now.<br><br>The government intervenes by not allowing as many cars to be sold. The great demand for COE, would most certainly push up COE costs to the ceiling. The drop in the number of applications for COE will certainly pose a recorded drop in the government coffers. Our economy will also lose out on the revenue that these car companies generate. Cars become a luxury item and everyone else will have to use the public transportation system which will have to adapt itself to cater to the greater demand. Revenue generated through Road Taxes will also suffer. This scenario seems very uneconomic, the only respite is the public transportation scene.<br><br>Considering the choice of ERP over the alternative methods presented here.<br><br>ERP is easy to implement and is a source of revenue. Singaporeans, being who they are will continue buying cars as cars have become a status symbol of sorts and also a convenience. COE and Road Tax revenues don't decrease.<br><br>People will also choose public transport over driving their car to work, never mind they having paid for it. They'd drive the car after work hours. After all $180 a month for transport still beats the $200-$300 for petrol costs. And less headache. The only minute difference is that the money goes to Temasek Holdings, rather than the MNC petroleum companies.<br><br>As a result, every economic sector makes money. The public transportation sector sees an increase in demand. Temasek Holdings shares will do well. The COE and Road Taxes keep coming in.<br><br>It makes economic sense. Us? We can work till 65 to pay every loan we've taken. While the government helps invest our money in CPF for us, returning us part of the investment profits when we die.<br><br>Frankly why do we even bother thinking about it all. They've got it all planned out for us.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Gazelle,<br><br>We've time and again shown that there is nothing "great" about the current government policies.<br><br>I'm not complaining against the government as much. Every government has its weaknesses and strengths.<br><br>In fact I don't have a REAL Problem with most of their policies. I don't approve of many things sure... but I dont have a REAL Problem except.... the following.<br><br>1. All those explanations they give to us.... it is so dumb, it's an insult to our intelligence.<br><br>2. They herald to the world that we are a free nation when we are not. If we are not, so be it. This is my bad fortune. But why pretend? Why think that it's easy to mislead us. Are we that stupid?<br><br>3. Why get rid of the opposition employing the most unethical of means. What did JBJ do to deserve a defamation lawsuit and made bankrupt. He said the following words, "I have here, in my hands, a case I have brought against SM Lee and PM Goh". That's all. Factual sentence. And he was sued for defamation in the hundreds of thousands. And whatever happened to his case?<br><br>Why did he do that? LKY called his team-mate, Tang Liang Hong an anti-christian and something to the effect that pointed to him being a racist.<br>That is a ridiculous and outrageous statement considering that JBJ is a christian! Who deserved to be sued? But where was the Law?<br><br>Why destroy the life of someone who loved Singapore enough to fight all the way for it? Was it worth it just to preserve power? Where was the Law?<br><br>So please, please for goodness sakes, wake up. All the propagandist materials you give without having any substance to back it up.... it doesnt work with us. Maybe you are ignorant about the facts.<br><br>But we are not stupid. It doesnt work on us.<br><br>A good and gracious loser knows when he has lost a debate and bows out in grace.<br></div>

So which is it now? Should we carry on being greedy? Or should we take the public transport? Doesn't the government have our welfare at heart. If they reduce the number of COEs, then eventually most people would afford it a luxury item status and not think too much of it. It's precisely because they can take loans so readily now and cars are so readily available now that this mindset has taken over like a poison?

So which is it now? Should we carry on being greedy? Or should we take the public transport? Doesn't the government have our welfare at heart. If they reduce the number of COEs, then eventually most people would afford it a luxury item status and not think too much of it. It's precisely because they can take loans so readily now and cars are so readily available now that this mindset has taken over like a poison? Never mind we have to spend the next 10 years of our lives slaving.<br><br>So the question. Should we let the poison run its course, or do we stop the poison?<br><br>There is only one beneficiary should the poison run its course.
