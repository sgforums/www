I cannot find a better solution.

Fuel prices can also be expected to increase due to the drop in consumer demand for petrol as there are less and less car owners. The amount is a small price to pay. Estimating a daily return trip at $6, this would translate to $180 monthly per commuter. Still better than paying $700-$900+ a month for a car. "</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's simple to conclude from all the posts I've read that, the government has not done an efficient job in solving congestion issues, in FACT, they couldn't solve. And therefore they implement more and MORE ERPs just to push the problem aside, and not solve it at all.<br><br>Who would want a government that doesn't know how to nip a problem in it's bud, and only create problems after problem?<br><br>Firstly, if everyone were to stop driving private cars, and take public transport, transport ridership would increase. We'd see more and more congested buses and trains everyday, and arrival times would have to be shortened. This means that the transport companies would then have to purchase MORE transport vehicles just to supply the passenger crowds.<br><br>And with that, fares would certainly increase. It seems that whatever the government does, it is all related to money.<br><br>I have to agree that, there is no long-term problem to solve this issue, and even that, ERP just creates more and more problems. A simple question, "<strong>Why the heck is ERP there in the first place?</strong>"<br><br>The government would reply, "<strong>To improve congestion issues on the EXPRESSWAYS.</strong>"<br><br>What about detour roads?<br><br>Then the government starts applying ERP to every single road, meaning that if you drive from your house to the city areas, it'd probably cost you a hefty sum per day, and if you do that every day, it'd accumulate into a HUGE sum for a month.<br><br>Who is going to chalk up that much money?<br><br>Soon, people get fed-up and choose to take public transport. The government says, "<strong>YAY. We've solved the problem of congestion.</strong>"<br><br>Pfft. Maybe you can ask them how it is like to take a sardine bus everyday, 24/7/365. AND, not forgetting fare increases.<br><br>You see, it all revolved around the term "MONEY" again.<br><br>I'll leave you with a question.<br><br><strong>Is the government REALLY trying to solve problems, or are they out for another cause?</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the congestion problem will he inherent to Singapore.<br>Because we have limited road/parking space, and there is just too much cars.<br>That means congestion will always be with us.<br>The government can only shift it here and there.<br>They are in a dammed if you do, dammed if you don't situation.<br><br>How would the people take it, if the car population is to be reduced?<br>That means people who want a car, and can afford it, would not be able to own a car.<br><br>How to get employers to stagger the work hours, so that morning and evening peak hours are spread out.<br>Large events also contribute, anyone who owns a car wants to drive there. All of them at the same time.<br><br>Vehicle traffic is to be viewed like water moving around a duct system. It has to keep moving. But unlike water, any vehicle that stop, would be an obstruction to the flow. Thats why all vehicles must be in good repair. And also what about vehicles involved in collisions, they too present an obstruction. Then there is that input/output equation. When input is greater than output, a back up results. Traffic lights improve or retard the flow?<br><br>Is it possible for hundred of thousands of quirky drivers to drive round and round without getting off or stop?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Congestion will always be with us.</span><br>Get the government to shift it so somebody else's route. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
