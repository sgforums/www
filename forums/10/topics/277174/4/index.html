Is this not equal to congestion? Congestion still exist. So why ERP? But in your oxfordian rebuttal, please also comment on what happens to this diverted traffic? I tell you, it flows into smaller roads creating its own congestion there. and so you may say, that is why ERP is extended further. And so my sec4 commonsense will tell you that there will be no end to this as the vicious cycle of spreading congestion to elsewhere will continue. Allow me to enlighten you that the number of cars in singapore is never reduced. It only increase every day and month. COE is low now. Cars are needed and a status symbol. How can Singaporeans not want it? 1st world standard want to cramp on bus? How glorious? share air in a congested 4x4 box with anyone with any coughing disease? lung disease? skin disease?  And to this, you may argue that I should not go out in that case, to which I will say, no its not that I will not go out. I will choose to own a car for convenience and less need to cramp with people. Ok with you or not? Can approve my lifestyle or not?<br><br>Your logic on ERP is long long ago defeated.  Give it a rest. And all these points did not come from me alone. So many forummers have given the same.<br>Pitty you having a job like this to counter to so many strong rebuttals and all you can do out of desperation is to use your mama to douse the fire?
