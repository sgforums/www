This is just for illustration purpose. This is to show that COE need not be controlled by skyrocket prices. All you need is $1.<br>But this will mean the government takes in less money. It depends on what is the concern here.<br><br>Restricting to businesses, 1st come 1st serve, these are just my basic suggestions.  Are you competent of coming up more oxford solution? I not oxfords standard lah, I only sec4 but I use commonsense to respond to your scholarstic rebuttal.<br><br>As said, COE or no COE (as in COE= $1), I can achieve the same congestion control. So, why have COE? Is there another reason?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Okay lah, since you so bombastic, I dun argue with you too much this point lah. I come up a better  solution of no-COE lah then I come back to you lah.  You think this is impossible?    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Now, I direct your attention to  ERP.  As many have experienced, like the COE, with ERP or no ERP, the result is the same ---&gt;&gt;&gt;  Traffic Jams and Congestion. Never solved.<br><br>You will and can only rebut by saying that ERP divert some traffic from CTE. Even so, there is still congestion as all experienced. Reduced some congestion but still congestion. Is this not equal to congestion? Congestion still exist. So why ERP? But in your oxfordian rebuttal, please also comment on what happens to this diverted traffic? I tell you, it flows into smaller roads creating its own congestion there. and so you may say, that is why ERP is extended further. And so my sec4 commonsense will tell you that there will be no end to this as the vicious cycle of spreading congestion to elsewhere will continue. Allow me to enlighten you that the number of cars in singapore is never reduced. It only increase every day and month. COE is low now. Cars are needed and a status symbol. How can Singaporeans not want it? 1st world standard want to cramp on bus? How glorious? share air in a congested 4x4 box with anyone with any coughing disease? lung disease? skin disease?  And to this, you may argue that I should not go out in that case, to which I will say, no its not that I will not go out. I will choose to own a car for convenience and less need to cramp with people. Ok with you or not? Can approve my lifestyle or not?<br><br>Your logic on ERP is long long ago defeated.  Give it a rest. And all these points did not come from me alone. So many forummers have given the same.<br>Pitty you having a job like this to counter to so many strong rebuttals and all you can do out of desperation is to use your mama to douse the fire? Good try but no use. I would rather listen to the Real reasons given for implementing the ERP than to accept that it reduces congestion. I not primary school pass only leh. I sec 4 ok.<br></div></blockquote>Judging from the complete lack of cohesion in your arguments, I am not surprised you only have sec 4 education. Little boy, read my posts before your respond. That's why you will fail English comprehension...you fail to read.<br><br>Since when in this thread have I defended the ERP? As I have said, the ERP will not solve the congestion problem, only the COE does. The ERP only ameliorates the problem by diverting traffic to less congested routes. It will not help if almost all the roads are congested because of the large car population.<br><br>The government should not have listened to the whiners who want to own private cars. Drastically reduce the number of COEs and allow the prices of cars to skyrocket. That will curb the demand. In a few years' time, with the completion of public transport infrastructure projects like the Circle Line, the road congestion will ease.<br><br></div>

There has to be a balance between people's desire to own cars, and the space available to build roads. So, all kinds of schemes have been tried. While some has the desired effects, others don't. For a long time, there was this gripe about COE. Now, it is ERP. I am sure, the last word about car ownership has yet to be spoken.<br><br>5) Every individual will be affected by any public policy - I don't use the term PAP policy or gahmen policy.

Now that evening ERPs have come in and timings extended, car owners have to pay to get home for dinner or work late in the office till ERP has ended.<br><br>Have you not noticed that the govt raises prices for the slightest of reasons to solve problems?

            <div class='col-md body'>Did you read above that car ownership was restricted within a privileged circle? Due to the mandatory downpayment.<br><br>Yearly COE quotas were also lower than today due to the high prices and lower demand. This system worked fine and we did not have the many jams that we see on our roads today.<br><br>While there's no stopping Singaporeans from taking other loans to cover these car downpayments, it will also make the individual think twice before he commits himself like this. Who in his right mind, would take a loan to service a $1500 per month instalment if it is such that he has to even take a loan from elsewhere to cover the high deposit?<br><br>Did you also read that the overall payment on a ten years loan without downpayment is higher than a 7 years loan that has a downpayment?<br><br>The govt should be concerned that these people who buy their cars....do they have enough for retirement? As 85% of Singaporeans stay in HDBs, if flats were not priced so high, then it may still be alright.<br><br>Do you see the link?</div>
