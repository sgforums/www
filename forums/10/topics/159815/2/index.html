Lets say that we have just 5,000 peasants earning roughly 1k a month (thats a ridiculously low estimate btw, the real numbers much higher).<br><br>Each person has $200 sucked into CPF. 200 x 5,000 is $1 million. Thats $1 million a month for the government to use! 12 million dollars a year just from this tiny group! I haven't even added the employer's contribution somemore.

There is only 1 solution as far as I can see whilst the govt will not chip in...<br><br>Singaporeans should work as long as they can and when they can no longer do so, emigrate to a third world nation. Sell everything, HDB flat and all...and go to a ulu part of Indonesia or Sri Lanka for retirement. The $50k you get after settling all your debts in Sg will give you a fairly comfortable life there.
