            <div class='col-md body'>Good points, Gun. Tanks have two basic roles in war:<br><br>1. Support the Infantry by breaching fortifications. A tank in this role must be able to:<br><br>a. go where the infantry go<br>b. charge over a trench<br>c. smash through concertina wire and other obstacles<br>d. demolish bunkers with direct fire<br>e. gun down enemy infantry<br>f. survive fire from Infantry weapons.<br><br>2. Anti-tank. A tank in this role must be able to:<br><br>a. outmaneuver enemy armor<br>b. effectively destroy enemy armor with its armament<br>c. survive fire from enemy armor<br><br>The problem is that these two roles conflict. The first role demands a small, light vehicle with numerous smaller weapons (MGs, AGLs, demolition guns), i.e. a light tank. The second demands a heavily armored behemoth with a few powerful weapons (high velocity gun, ATGMs), i.e. a MBT.<br><br>The AMX13SM1 is not that bad a tank in the Infantry support role. It is small and powerful enough to squeeze and bash through jungle terrain and be where the infantry are. Its gun is good enough to demolish most field fortifications. It can be fielded in enough numbers to lay down lethal anti-personnel fire with its MGs. Its front armor is thick enough to face enemy infantry. I wouldn't mind having one of these with my platoon in the middle of the jungle.<br><br>However, it really really really sucks in the anti-tank role. It is far too lightly armored and its gun is deperately inadequate. It is so bad that it is a joke.<br><br>The Infantry support role is more important for combat in our region, due to the terrain and the fact that potential opponents don't possess much armor. Also, the best anti-armor platform is the helicopter, rather than other tanks, even MBTs (and we have Apaches now). However, our choice of light tank should not be SO WEAK against enemy armor.<br><br>As long as the new light tank does not sacrifice too much in pursuit of the anti-tank role, it will be good. It needs to be just as powerful and small as AMX13SM1, so it can climb hills, cross streams and squeeze through jungle. It should still have multiple MGs and AGLs, not just a coaxial MG. Whether this can be accomplished while giving it heavier armor and a new 105mm gun is the question.<br><br>The Bionix chassis is pretty good for this. It is very compact, in particular very narrow. It's only 20cm (8%) wider than AMX13SM1, though it is 50% heavier! I think that skinny-ness was one of the main design criteria for the Bionix since it stands out so much. The Bionix currently has the same power/weight ratio as the AMX13SM1 but a tank gun will reduce it, so a beefier powerpack will be needed to keep it at 20 hp/ton. The armor protection is already sufficient for a light tank role.<br><br>On a completely different note, the best light tank in Vietnam IMHO was probably the M50 Ontos. It had six (!) 106mm RRs, four .50 cal spotting rifles and one 7.62 mm MG. It proved to be the tank that the VC/NVA feared the most.

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess we can all agree that<br>1. we need a new light tank to replace the SM1. The light tank has to at least have the following capabilities:<br>a. 105 mm low-recoil, high velocity  main gun (with optional autoloader).<br>b. Thermal Imager, advance fire-control system<br>c. 2 axis stabalised for both the sights and the main gun.<br>d. (optional). Independent Commander Sight/TV (Thermal) incorporating a hunter-killer mode.<br>e. Defensive aid system including a laser warning device and probably IR warners.<br><br>SAF also need to replace or upgrade the Centurions. My personal opinions are that the the SAF should consider the following options:<br>1. Replace with CV90-120T<br>2. Upgrade the Centurions with a new CTG 120mm gun, a new turret, upgraded fire-control system, new engine and automotive systems such as suspensions, automatic gears, etc to a standard somewhat like the South African Olifant 2B.<br>3. Replace with the M60-2000 (M60 chassis with M1 turret with 120mm main gun).<br>4. French Leclerc (diet version - to drop it down to just over 40 tons).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've seem the centurion too during my bmt days, I was on a bus somewhere in lim chu kang area and I happen to saw a mbt on a trailer. I knew its not a amx at 1st look. I thought tat perhaps the saf was evaulating a new tank replacement. I ask a fren who was in armour and he dare not tell me anything at tat time. An officer from armour came for recruitment talk and he mentioned tat saf got other tanks he can't speak openly. Later the bionix was introduced and I tot he was talking about it.  However I deduced tat wat I saw was not a bionix due to the turrent design.  I forgot about the incident until a year after the incident when I was in mph and I happened to browse a JANES armour book. I remember the tracks of the mbt I saw and so I slowly flip thru page by page till I found the centurion. And it happens to list singapore as its operator. I found my answer! recently I spoke to my fren about the centurion and he was more willing to tell me about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My fren told me that there were two types of centurion in s'pore. One was from india and older model. another was from sweden or israel. The latter model is newer with better features.  He told me that NSF/Men are not allowed to know that such tanks exists in S'pore an only Regulars are allowed to train in them. During an exercise at ROC during his NS days, he managed to find a centurion sitting around with the driver hatch unlock. He and his frens climbed inside and they found that it was spacious compare to the AMX-13. He called it a luxury. They were almost caught in the act and were lucky to escape.</div>

Tanks have two basic roles in war:<br><br>[snip]<br><br>The AMX13SM1 is not that bad a tank in the Infantry support role. It is small and powerful enough to squeeze and bash through jungle terrain and be where the infantry are. Its gun is good enough to demolish most field fortifications.

I wouldn't mind having one of these with my platoon in the middle of the jungle.<br><br>However, it really really really sucks in the anti-tank role. It is far too lightly armored and its gun is deperately inadequate. It is so bad that it is a joke.<br><br>[snip]<br><br></div></blockquote>What do you mean that the the SM1 gun is inadequate? You mean it doesn't penetrate well even with the Sabot rounds or it is not stabalised for fire on the move?<br><br>Well, I am wondering why ST Kinetic and SAF can't come up with a quick interim solution to upgrade some with a 105mm stablised gun. Oh I know some of you guys might say that the recoil is too great... but nowadays there are a couple of low recoil L7 guns out there....<br>BTW, check out the Austrian SK-105 Kurassier series especially A3 version, which uses the AMX-13 FL-11/FL-13 turret, armed with a 105mm gun, and its gross weight is in the 17 to 18 ton region - the same as AMX-13.
