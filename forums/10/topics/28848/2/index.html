            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps SAF future light tank can also carry the MBT Lahat Laser Guided Missile which can be fired from the 105mm main gun.<br><br>Quote from the website:<br>---------------------------------<br>LAHAT was designed by IAI subsidiary MBT to meet the requirements of the armoured corps. Utilizing the semi-active laser homing guidance method, LAHAT can be designated by the firing tank or by an indirect designation, by another tank, helicopter or forward observers. Firing the LAHAT requires minimal exposure in the firing position, (commanderÂ’s sight only) as the designating tank (not necessarily the firing tank) has to maintain line of sight to the target throughout the flight of the missile. With a low launch signature, the firing position is very difficult to detect, from all ranges. The missileÂ’s trajectory can be set to match either tank (top attack) or helicopter (direct attack) engagement. Finally, the missile uses a tandem warhead which can defeat modern armour and reactive panels. The main warhead has a high penetration capability, defeating all known armoured vehicles at high impact angles typical of top attack trajectories. The introduction of LAHAT to conventional tanks requires minimal modifications, including the introduction of a laser designator in the gun sight, and inclusion of LAHAT programming in the fire control computer. The LAHAT is stowed like other rounds in the ammunition rack, and handled just like any other type of ammunition.<br><img src="http://www.defense-update.com/directory/lahat-du.jpg"><br>LAHAT is designed to match all types of 105 and 120mm guns, including low recoil guns, including those arming light attack vehicles such as Centauro, AMX-10RC or LAV-III. Unlike other tank rounds, LAHAT does not need a tank gun for operation, in fact, LAHAT modifications are already considered with 106mm recoilless rifles, BMP-2 APCs, Hummer all terrain utility vehicles and as self protection for air defense elements, on the M-163 Vulcans.<br>---------------------------------<br><br>Reference: <a href="http://www.defense-update.com/directory/lahat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.defense-update.com/directory/lahat.htm</a></div>

In fact, some EU members are in the process of replacing<br>the  Milan with Spike or another 5th gen ATGMs like Trigats and<br>Javelin.<br><br>What I've gathered from various source is that he Milan system with<br>similar package as the Spike is heavier.This includes the<br>Mira night-sight (8kg) + ready-to-fire-missle + (11kg) + firing post<br>(17kg). Making around 30kg in all field setup.<br><br>Spike's published data is 26kg with missile loaded.<br>What is truely impressive is that the system uses the missile's<br>dual mode IIR/CCD seeker instead of a seperate optics like the<br>Milan's Mira nitesight. The entire system is integreted using the<br>missile's own seeker to detect, id, acquire, and guide.<br>All these with fire&amp;forget with mid-course update controls and<br>non line-of-sight firing positions allows the Guard to worry less<br>about taking cover while waiting for the missile to impact  !<br><br>Also, the Spike as rng of 2.5km to 4km with lobe or flat<br>trajectory flight path  while  Milan2 is 2km with LOS control.<br>This shows how advanced the Spike optic, control algothim and<br>missile's propellent are.<br><br>Here's one of link of comparision of 3 types of ATGM.<br>Notice many of data still remain classified.<br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/ptone50/SPIKE.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/ptone50/SPIKE.htm</a><br><br>And Spike is one of the few missiles that is small and<br>safe to fire in small confines which makes it deadly in<br>urban warfare (read HDB heartland) where MBTs becomes<br>white elephants  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><a href="http://www.global-defence.com/webpages/WSpart9b.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.global-defence.com/webpages/WSpart9b.html</a><br><br><img src="http://www.jed.simonides.org/missiles/atk/milan_series/milan2.jpg"><br><br></div>

Moreover with the egonomically design MANPAD set from Israel, it actually less shoink compare to using the universal MANPAD set. One soldier will MANPAD 2 missiles.<br><br>The other operator will carry the CLU, NV, tripod and the Battery house in a specially design MANPAD set made by Israel.  It is not only lighter than the firing post of Milan, but more compact which means than the centre of gravity of the weight  while doing Manpad is actually closer to the soldier body as compare to Milan. This strain lesser on the back.<br><br>What is most remarkable of this missile is that it can be use against slow flying or hovering helicopter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The membrane are protected by cover cushion from both end and these cushion will only be taken off before they are mounted on the firing post.<br><br>According to what I know, the protective membrane is to protect the missile from being interrupted by external signal source like signal from the radio set. All this signal can accidentally activate the missile. Secondary to prevent dust from going in as all the electronic device are extrememly sensitive to all this particles.<br><br>Once the operator press the firing button, The firing post will sent the signal to the luanch tube and abt 0.5sec later the membrane will automatically "pop" out. After this abt  0.3sec the missile will launch from the tube. The tube will eject backward at the same time.</div>
