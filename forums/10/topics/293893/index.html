Anyone is a RESIDENT  if he is a PR    or a citizen.<br><br>2. FT all should have no problem getting a PR in very short time. Rumor has it that this is world record time. I dunno.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>3. So a FT can be a PR who can be a citizen.<br><br>4. Employment figure so far has been using this term to tell you the story of the state of employment of.....erm...RESIDENTS. I must appologise that so far no one in this forum has been able to provide the employment figures for CITIZENS, including myself. So, very sorry sincerely for that.<br><br>Thus, more influx of Residents by way of PR, means<br>The Employment rate will change.  Just use your imagination.<br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>I present you, Sg. The world record holder of many titles.<br>Most importantly, you contributed to the current state.<br>Of course I will nebber say sorry state. I will only can say very good good the good good state.<br>Although cost of living and salary has not been rising in tadem,<br>I congratulate all you that this is your sg.<br>so many PRs for you to play with. I mean play things like shuttercorking, pocket(foot)ball, go-lee etc.<br><br>Enjoy your RETIREMENT!!  Competition forever till you give up or retire or enjoy. Enjoy the medical services.  Enjoy the ERPs that makes driving such a traffic-congestion-less experience. Enjoy.<br><br>You will be enjoying even more. I enticipate for you.<br></div>

Before that Singapore was merely an entreport or trading outpost.<br><br>Speaking of Transport, a dedicated Transport minister whose functional duty is transport should have the commonsense if not expertise of creating values for motorists who were being penalized with triple taxes (Excise, COE, ERP) like easing the long-promised congestion problem.<br><br>Despite paying higher and higher ERP fees which together with excise duty, and COE are costing each motorist a fortune there is hardly any lessening of congestion. Yet he was still trying to explain the failure away calling for yet more holistic solution as if triple taxations are not holistic enough.<br><br>He was so lacking in vision that he cannot see that with all these ever-increasing ERP fees there should be some acceptable solutions in sight.<br><br>What kind of talent is this. One would have imagined that anyone with some basic knowledge would have come up with apportioning the billions of COE/ERP and excise taxes for provisions of alternative routes for non-ERP paying motorists to filter some congestion for those who are paying the ERP.<br><br>As for Khaw he must have thought such a great deal of his medishields tapping on people's CPF to pay higher for all his beds including the C Class beds that he is now trying to use the means tests to push more people to pay even higher medical fees.<br><br>There is simply a limit to people's patience to what they can bear with all these money-sucking ministers digging into people retirements savings with all the shields.</div>

GIC was his brainchild and he persuaded LKY to allow Singapore to invest their reserves, something unheard of in the 80s. Read about him and you find that he was a problem solver for many practical problems. Sometimes, the most talented people in running a country are poor politicians in winning votes and power struggles. Maybe thats why so little people know about him anymore.<br><br>The current government is just hot air. This hub that hub. Ask the PAP government to grow the economy without increasing the population, and you can see how bad they are at implementing policies. If IR fails, its time to boot PAP out.<br><br></div>

The more our leaders are trying to get talents even with more pays the lesser talents we seem to get.<br><br>Therefore the moral of story is we should leave people to choose their own leaders through the community internal knowledge of such talents rather than trying to impose too much on their true choice. Let the leaders be thrown up by the people themselves. They know who are good and who can be trusted.<br><br>It is the same story with education as the more the leaders try to promote the brighter students the less good students we are getting. Neighbourhood schools are producing better students now with less emphasis on elites schools.<br><br>It is clear that by doing more sometimes we will just get less.</div>
