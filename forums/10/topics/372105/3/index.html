              <p>Who is LKY ?</p>
              <p>What was the history behind the formation of the PAP ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The PAP was started by two persons - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporegovt.blogspot.com/2006/02/part-ii-true-founders-of-singapore-man.html">Dr Toh Chin Chye and Dr Goh Keng Swee on their return from London to Singapore(*1).  </a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">While in London as a student from 1949 to 1953, Toh Chin Chye led the anti-colonial group of Malayan students known as Malayan Forum. The Forum provided a place for native nationalists to debate and to examine the future of Malaya. Before returning to Singapore, Goh Keng Swee, the then chairman of the Forum, nominated Toh to succeed him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In his early years, Toh was very much a socialist and close friend of Dr Goh Keng Swee during his days in London. Together, they took up the political cause and came back to Singapore in 1953. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Later, Dr Goh, Kenny Byrne and Dr Toh formed the Council for Joint Action with Lee Kuan Yew as the legal advisor. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">That was how LKY got involved in union politics. During then, LKY was also the legal advisor to Samad Ismail (editor of Utusan Melayu and ex-detainee), Lim Chin Siong and Devan Nair. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The few of them would always meet in the “basement” of LKY’s house but with special attention from the “Special Branch” (old version of ISD), they would always be watched and risk being detained without trial. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Toh did not belong to the first wave of founding members who met at LKY’s house; he was still in England when the “basement group” first met. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">However, after Dr Toh joined the group, it was Dr Toh who proposed the formation of an open and legal political party to champion the cause of nationalism and independence of Malaya.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">“<em>Sometimes, I wonder what would have happened to our basement group had I not pushed for it to register as a political party. What if I had not come back to Singapore? You know, in 1953, I was advised to go to USA to continue my research. If I had gone that route, would anyone have started the PAP? Would the basement crowd have remained in Kuan Yew’s house? Would it have come together at all?</em>” –<em> <strong>Dr Toh Chin Chye.</strong></em><br></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Would Singapore have been different if Dr Toh Chin Chye had accepted nomination to be the Prime Minister on at least two occassions ?</p>
              <p>On both occassions, he declined the position in support of LKY, who had tendered his resignation at the behest of disgruntled party members - and on both occassions, Dr Toh gave his unwavering support to LKY in the interest of the PAP.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">On at least two occasions, Toh Chin Chye’s name was floated as an alternative Prime Minister to LKY. In 1961, they lost two successive by-elections to Ong Eng Guan and David Marshall. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">On 17 July 1961, Lee Kuan Yew wrote a letter to Dr Toh, Chairman of the CEC. He wrote that the trade unions, the Middle Road Crowd wanted him to resign and they wanted Dr Toh to take over as the Prime Minister. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Dr Toh read the letter to all the Cabinet Ministers and CEC members during a Cabinet meeting. All who were present were stunned. Yong Nyuk Lin asked Dr Toh, “Should we accept his resignation?” Dr Toh replied, “No,” because it will divide the government and it will appear to the people of Singapore that they are being unsteady. So they declined the resignation. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Dr Toh could very well make himself as the Prime Minister, but he didn’t. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In 1964, in the aftermath of race riots in Singapore and Malaysia, LKY offered again to resign as PM in an attempt to ease the strained relations between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In the wake of certain extremist demands from UMNO (United Malays National Organization) to arrest LKY for the ostensible reason of preventing him from causing more political and ethnic tension within Malaysia, Dr Toh and his comrades stood by LKY. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If LKY was arrested and detained without trial, Dr Toh or Dr Goh might have been the next logical choice to become PM of Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Dr Toh’s support and ability to rally members behind LKY probably prevented the Malaysian government from arresting LKY. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sadly, the PAP came first before the interests of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Who is LKY ?</p>
              <p>In the years during Colonial Rule and when Singapore was part of Malaysia, LKY was a strong advocate of Human Rights to Freedom of Assembly, Open Debate and the Exchange of Competitive Political Ideas, unfettered Press and Broadcast Media - as seen in his Parliamentary Speeches in the Singapore State Assembly when David Marshall was the Chief Minister of Singapore, and also in his speech in the Federal Parliament in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; color: black; font-size: 12pt;    '>"</span><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; color: black; font-size: 12pt;    '>But we either believe in democracy or we not. If we do, then, we must say categorically, without qualification, that no restraint from the any democratic processes, other than by the ordinary law of the land, should be allowed... If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally. If you believe that men should be free, then, they should have the right of free association, of free speech, of free publication. Then, no law should permit those democratic processes to be set at nought, and no excuse, whether of security, should allow a government to be deterred from doing what it knows to right, and what it must know to be right... "- Lee Kuan Yew, Legislative Assembly Debates April 27, 1955</span></em></p>
              <p> <span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; color: black; font-size: 12pt;    '><em>"If we are to survive as a free democracy, then we must be prepared, in principle, to concede to our enemies - even those who do not subscribe to our views - as much(sic)constitutional rights as you concede yourself."</em> -<em> Lee Kuan Yew Legislative Assembly Debates Sept 21, 1955</em></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; color: black; font-size: 12pt;    '><em>"Let us get down to fundamentals. Is this an open, or is this a closed society? Is it a society where men can preach ideas - novel, unorthodox, heresies, to established churches and established governments - where there is a constant contest for men's hearts and minds on the basis of what is right, of what is just, of what is in the national interests, or is it a closed society where the mass media - the newspapaers, the journals, publications, TV, radio - either bound by sound or by sight, or both sound and sight, men's minds are fed with a constant drone of sycophantic support for a particular orthodox political philosophy? That is the first question we asked ourselves. I would like to see minds stimulated and debate provoked, and truth refined and crystallized out of the conflict of different evidence and views. I, therefore, welcome every and any opportunity of a chance to agree, or to dissent, in order that out of thesis comes synthesis - thesis, anti-major premise, anti-premise, synthesis, so we progress... I welcome every opportunity to meet members of the opposition, and so do members of my party, over the radio, over the television, university forums, public rallies. We never run away from the open encounter. If your ideas, your views cannot stand the challenge of criticism then they are too fragile and not sturdy enough to last. I am talking of the principle of the open society, the open debate, ideas, not intimidation, persuasion not coercion... Sir, the basic fundamentals we asked ourselves...is whether the duties of the Minister of Information and Broadcasting are to produce closed minds or open minds, because these instruments - the mass media, the TV, the radio - can produce either the open minds receptive to ideas and ideals, a democratic system of life, or closed and limited. But I know that the open debate is a painful process for closed minds...But let me make this point: that 5 million adult minds in Malaysia cannot be closed - definitely not in the lifetime of the people in authority. It is not possible because whatever the faults of the colonial system, and there are many...they generated the open mind, the inquiring mind." - Lee Kuan Yew Dec 18, 1964 Malaysian Parliamentary Debates</em></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>What changed the PAP political idealism that was so eloquently expressed by LKY after Singapore was kicked out of Malaysia ?</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporerebel.blogspot.com/2005/08/umno-extremists-may-detain-lee-alleged.html">Prior to Singapore being kicked out of Malaysia, the Malaysian Government had considered arresting LKY and even the entire Singapore Cabinet(*2). </a></p>
              <p>LKY's arrests must have been considered as already evidenced by the publicity given in the speeches made by Malaysian Politicians from UMNO and even from the MCA, when both parties saw LKY's challenge to the political status quo as destructive to what was agreed between Tunku and LKY before the merger was completed. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.allexperts.com/e/l/le/lee_kuan_yew.htm">In his biography, Lee Kuan Yew stated that he did not sleep well, and fell sick days after Singapore's independence. As the British prime-minister at the time, Harold Wilson expressed concern upon learning of Lee's condition from the British High Commissioner, John Robb(*3). </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who was holding the fort during the critical days immediately after the devastating events of Singapore being kicked out of Malaysia ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporegovt.blogspot.com/2006/02/part-ii-true-founders-of-singapore-man.html">With LKY devastated over the separation and tearing on national television (and later seek solace in Changi Villa), Dr Toh and other Minister held the fort. Opposition members demanded Dr Toh for a parliament seating but was only able to recommence on December 1965. The crucial stabilizing role that Dr Toh played after the separation could not be under-estimated(*4). </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is LKY the real pillar of strength that propaganda has made him out to be ?</p>
              <p>Is a mentally weak person fit to lead a nation, when he depends on Machiavelli's ways to rule and force the political process to his will ?</p>
              <p>Is Singapore what it is today from his singular vision and ability to mobilise people ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the first generation Old Guard removed from the PAP and from Government, now LKY reign supreme, and the remaining surviving members in their old age left impotent by the gag order imposed from the Official Secrets Act which they have signed acceptance while in Public Office.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans remain anxious to view whatever honest biographies of the historical events that transpired as viewed and recalled from the different minds of those who loved and continue to have hope for Singapore.</p>
              <p>History is being re-written to glorify the LKY image as THE Founding Father of Singapore and he do not seem to be too inmodest in allowing such accolades to be continued.</p>

              <p>Go to Shanghai you will see americans arguing with cashiers in Chinese; go to å“ˆå°”æ»¨, and even beijing ç�‰ç’ƒåŽ‚ you will see Russians traders bargaining in Chinese, go to ä¸¹ä¸œ you will find all the Koreans speaking Chinese that put many Singaporean Chinese to shame..</p>
              <p>Do you think Chinese will speak Japanese to do business in China?</p>
              <p>and of course this is different when Chinese come to Singapore to do business, they will be expected to speak English, Mandarin, Malay, or Tamil, these are our official language.</p>
              <p>ho, and when you hear Singaporean speaking Chinese, you know straight away that is Singlish, the ji tak ji tak mandarin.</p>
              <p>if you don't like LKY, all you can say is "we don't need him to tell us what is already known." but, do you know?</p>

              <p>I think lky ought to apologise to us for the stop at 2 birth control policy.   Bringing in more foreigners to solve the problem of falling birth rate does not help.    Foreigners turn citizens will know how hard life is to cope with the constant increase in living costs to allow them to give birth to more children.   </p>
              <p>In whatever matters, singaporeans are always the ones to be pointed at by LKY, lhl and the members of the thunderstrike team.   Never once they admit their mistakes, turn over a new leaf.</p>
