However I do feel that it is very threatening for the opposition party in Singapore to have both Law and Home Affair ministers as PM Lee deputy. It seems to me that if anyone who want to get into politics, it has got to be PAP, or else, you will get yourself into deep shite.<br><br>Correct me if I am wrong<br><br></div>
