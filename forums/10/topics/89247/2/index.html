            <div class='col-md body'>Welcome to the NSP Singapore Web Page<br>Dear friends,<br><br>The National Solidarity Party (NSP) is a Political Party founded in July 1987. It is also a founding member of the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA), led by Mr Chiam See Tong of Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency.<br><br>NSP is represented in Parliament by its CEC member, Mr Steve Chia -- who was appointed by law to become the Non-Constituency MP -- when he contested in the Choa Chu Kang SMC in the 2001 GE and garnered the most percentage of votes among the Opposition losers.<br><br>The NSP believes that there must be competition in politics. This competition for the peopleÂ’s support will bring about a better and more progressive society. We cannot continue to allow the PAP Government to "yi shou zhe tian," (meaning "to rule Singapore with total control.") We must not give them too much power -- without a proper checking and balancing mechansim being established. There must be greater accountability of Government policies, decisions and expenses at the Parliamentary level.<br><br>The NSP believes that power tends to corrupt, and absolute power tends to corrupts absolutely. This corruption need not be financial. It can be complacency, cronyism, intolerance, or taking the publicÂ’s support for granted, just to name some examples. There is too much domination held in the hands of a few key persons in the PAP Government. This is unhealthy for the longer term growth and progress of a knowledge based society.<br><br>It is the mission of NSP to help build a strong credible, viable, people oriented alternative political institution to challenge and compete with the PAP. It is our hope to help restore confidence and trust back to the Opposition political movement, and make it as a viable contributor to the democratic growth of Singapore society.<br><br>We need your understanding and support. As we try to build a strong foundation for the political alternatives with quality people, we hope you can be open to us and support our cause at the next coming General Election.<br><br>Remember!! Do not give the PAP too much power. Give them more of the peopleÂ’s pressure. Then they will truly learn to start listening to the feelings and aspirations of the people.<br><br>Thank you for your time in reading and understanding our cause.<br><br>The Central Executive Committee<br>National Solidarity Party<br>(member of the Singapore Democratic Alliance)<br><br><a href="http://www.nsp-singapore.org/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.nsp-singapore.org/index.php</a><br><br>The above was taken off NSP homepage.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Free speechÂ—Singapore-style</strong><br>By Carol Divjak<br>20 June 2000<br>Use this version to print<br><br>By August 2000 Singapore is to have a speakers' corner! Is this a chance for Singaporeans to experience free speech? It hardly seems likely, given that the city-state has been ruled for the last 40 years by a single party using police state methods to quash political opposition.<br><br>The project is intended to give the impression that democratic rights are being granted, if ever so gradually, by a benign government that has everyone's interests at heart.<br><br>The issue provoked a Â“lively and light heartedÂ” debate in Parliament according to the Straits Times of April 26. Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng told the Opposition: Â“Actually we don't think it's a good idea but if that's what is wanted and if we can manage the risk, we will provide for it. We'll let you try it out.Â”<br>The venue will be Hong Lim Park, from 7am to 7pm daily. Speakers must register at the Kreta Ayer Police Post, show ID and bring their own soapbox. No licence will be required under the Public Entertainment Act and, according to Wong Kan Seng, no subject will be tabooÂ—apart from religion and topics that will incite racial hatred. Orators will be bound, however, by the existing internal security and libel laws.<br><br>The ruling Peoples Action Party regularly uses the defamation laws to bankrupt those who dare to criticize the government. And the Internal Security Act has been used to detain, without trial, anyone seen as a threat to the government. In some cases offenders have been jailed for years. This has created a climate of fear and submission.<br><br>Joshua Jeyaretnam, one of only three opposition MPs, commented: Â“People get all sorts of false ideas about liberalisation in Singapore. I'm sorryÂ—it's a mirage.Â” Keeping speakers bound by the existing limits would make the free speech venue a Â“contradiction in termsÂ”.<br><br>The very fact that speakers must register with the police will be sufficient to deter any critical debate, and reinforce the claim that Singaporeans have nothing to complain about.<br><br>When asked if speakers will be recorded or videotaped, the Home Affairs Minister said people should not be surprised if curious onlookers, research students or journalists turned up with recorders. Given the history of Singapore most people would rightly suspect that the internal security police will also be keen recorders of the proceedings.<br><br>The government controls and manipulates political expression in every sphere. There is no right to strike or protest. Films, TV and pop music are heavily censored. Many books and magazines are banned, and home satellite TV antennae are illegal. The tolerated news media is totally subservient to the government, which issues open threats of recriminations if the official line is not followed.<br><br>The establishment of a speakers' corner is a cynical exercise for letting off steam over the increasingly difficult lives of middle class and working class people. Singapore has not gone unscathed in the wake of the Asian economic breakdown. Mass retrenchments and wage cuts have been coupled with an extremely high cost of living. A fiercely competitive education system puts enormous pressures on students and families.<br><br>Such a safety valve has been discussed in official circles for more than a year following the arrest of Singapore Democratic Party secretary general Chee Soon Juan, who was jailed twice last year for speaking in public without a permit and then refusing to pay the fine.<br><br>In front of crowds of up to 600, his speeches included reading quotes from the Singapore Constitution guaranteeing free speech. His colleague Wong Hong Toy faced fines or jail for assisting Chee by adjusting a microphone and speaker. They were charged under the Public Entertainment Act, which has now been relaxed for the purposes of the Speakers' Corner.<br><br>Chee's fate provoked considerable unfavourable comment in the Western media, as well as disquiet among business and professional people in Singapore. Like others in the pro-democracy movement throughout the Asian region, Chee is attempting to replace an autocratic government with one less subject to cronyism and more accountable to the demands of international capital.<br><br>The Singapore government, sensitive to developments such as the fall of Suharto in neighbouring Indonesia, and aware of seething resentment over the lack of democratic rights, is being forced to make some cosmetic changesÂ—hence Speakers' Corner.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm happy with the government and what it has done for us.<br><br>Although there are blemishes here and there, I'm happy because I have a safe place to live in, a roof over my head, clean water supply, freedom of movement amongst other things.<br><br>Though the government sometimes makes decisions that disturb the people, I believe it does start off with good intentions.<br><br>It's not easy to run a country. It IS like managing a company, except it's alot more complicated, having to touch on very sensitive issues and ensure that all the sides are well-taken care of.<br><br>I don't blame anyone for complaining, because I think it's only a human nature to complain. But I hope it really stops there, at plain complaining. Otherwise, you can complain and really dislike the way the government does things, but make sure you take a pro-active approach dealing with it.<br><br>There is no total freedom in this world. You can steer a ship in an ocean and go whereever you want, or you can fly a spaceship and go to the ends of the universe, but can you really get out of the universe, or row your boat away from the Earth?</div>

His colleague Wong Hong Toy faced fines or jail for assisting Chee by adjusting a microphone and speaker. They were charged under the Public Entertainment Act, which has now been relaxed for the purposes of the Speakers' Corner.<br><br>Chee's fate provoked considerable unfavourable comment in the Western media, as well as disquiet among business and professional people in Singapore. Like others in the pro-democracy movement throughout the Asian region, Chee is attempting to replace an autocratic government with one less subject to cronyism and more accountable to the demands of international capital.<br><br>The Singapore government, sensitive to developments such as the fall of Suharto in neighbouring Indonesia, and aware of seething resentment over the lack of democratic rights, is being forced to make some cosmetic changesÂ—hence Speakers' Corner.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>WTF after reading this , i felt like i've been oppressed my whole life and i didn't even know it!?! sounds like the westerners think that we're all living in a prison?<br>and well what do you know?
