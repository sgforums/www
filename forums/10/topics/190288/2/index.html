It just so happen that they are either brought up in a Mandarin/dialect domineering family or simply just not good in English.<br><br>Although I must agree with you that Mandarin should be an option rather than a compulsory subject, I for one am thankful that Mandarin was shoved down my academic throat during my younger days. Many Singaporeans are becoming highly valued for employment in the PRC and HK because of their strong command of English as well as their ability to communicate in Chinese (both spoken and written).  We do have an edge over many of our ethnic Chinese counterparts in Asia in that respect.<br><br>The size and growth of the Chinese economy is an opportunity for us to tap in. If you are big enough, you can afford to be high handed too. That's the law of the jungle. At the moment the PRC is on the ascendancy and even if that is not forever, I will live for that moment to fatten my own purse. Why let the opportunity slip by? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I know many Chinese who have acknowledged their inability to communicate well in English which is why overseas service providers go all out to communicate with them in Mandarin.  On the other hand, the younger generation, whilst increasingly adept in speaking English, tends to prefer to communicate in Mandarin.  I do long for the day when they are able to read English documents as well as Singaporeans. But that would mean Singaporeans like me would have outlived our usefulness in the PRC. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>edit: typo</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm bilingual although i'm more of an engilsh potato. Say ratio -  eng : chi =  80:20. but i can speak relatively good and fluent madarin and can still recognise and read chinese words/characters.<br><br>both sides of my family are english-speaking. and the only people i speak madarin and dialect to are my 2 grandmas. So i guess, that kinda helped too.<br><br>honestly speaking, the speak madarin campaign is totally stupid as now, so many people in China are indeed picking up English to catch up with those western and european countries.<br><br>Morever, English is an international language. It's the gateway to mass communication. Like what is expected of mass comm students; your english must be good.<br><br>but the pathetic thing about 70% of S'poreans, is that they are f*ckin' chee-nas and the standard of english they have and use is such a disgrace that i wouldn't call myself a Singaporean.<br><br>Let's just say there's segragation everywhere. English-oriented people would call chinese-oriented people chee-nas. and chinese-oriented people would call english-oriented people snobbish 'potatoes' (kentangs). We can never shed the images and perceptions.<br><br>And AMPs (angmoh pai or kentangs, english-oriented people) would associate with anything liberal and chee-nas (chinese-oriented people) would the opp.<br><br>To be strongly bi-lingual is difficult but it's possible.  I can say i'm extremely versatile in communicating with people from all walks of life. Sometimes, i would converse in perfect english esp. to foreigners/prcs from western countries/china or eastern countries respectively. In that way, i wouldn't be disgracing anyone or displaying my pathetically poor articulation if i have any. (which obviously i do not)<br><br>I feel sorry for chinese-oriented fools, cause they can never communicate well with people from western countries. The 'lahs' and 'lehs' and 'paiseh', (Singlish) etc and broken english or heavily chinese-accented english is so damn irritating and purely displaying their ignorance and also badly reflects on how 'successful' our education system is (regarding language teachers and teaching of english).<br><br>During my parents' time, their teacher made it a point to drill their grammar well into their head. And they have no problems in articulation, or construction of correct sentences. Now that the system have changed, some teachers are even worse than the students! They communicate in broken english, Singlish or heavily-accented English. How disgraceful!<br><br>Speaking about Singlish as a national identity; we already have enough national identities.  We don't need one more disgraceful one.<br><br>Why do we deem English more superior than Chinese/Mandarin?<br>Just take a look at those kids; the ah bengs/ ah lians, minahs/mats, anjacs, etc.<br><br>Their English is absolutely terrible. And their common language is chinese/mandarin. And when they try to 'impress' someone with their 'excellent' english, they would be making a fool of themselves; a total  laughing stock. So who the hell wanna be like them??!!!<br><br></div>

I have business dealings with the Chinese and in my experience, I have the advantage because I speak Mandarin. Unlike my western colleagues, I can read their legal contracts myself and I can email them in Chinese on a Sunday morning.<br><br>That gives me an advantage over western competitors. Western firms see that too: my house mate got a prime job in Beijing because he speaks and writes Chinese.
