            <div class='col-md body'>It is only a general statement based on assumptions that the more educated a person a better will he make a leader.<br><br>As with so many MM Lee's policies of the past, many of them do not quite produce the desired outcome as predicted or assumed.<br><br>By paying million-dollar salaries, Singapore still does not manage to attract talented ministers who could better solve our serious problems like disaffective divide between government and people, (an important and critical criteria to nation building), perpetual rising costs due to short-cuts in policy making and double-charging of people (HDB Flats double-charged on lands) and all the profiteering schemes by all the GLCs etc.<br><br>Passions, determinations, fundamental political/governing philosophy, EQs and motivational factors are all missing from the scholars and highly educated Ministers resulting in our current problems.<br><br>Education is only 30% important. 70% are other factors. The more highly educated is a crook the more mischief sometimes will be caused by him as seen in the million-dollar losses suffered by Sembawang Marine, APB, NTUC Choicehome and even NKF.</div>
