              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan has apologised for the overcrowding situation at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. <br><br>Writing in his blog on Monday, Mr Khaw said the hospital's Accident and Emergency department is always packed with patients having to wait for a bed in a crowded room, or corridor. <br><br>Several times a week, the hospital even had to divert civil defence ambulances to other hospitals. <br><br>This in turn has spread the overcrowding situation to hospitals like Changi General Hospital and Singapore General Hospital. <br><br>Many of the patients are from Woodlands and Yishun in the north and Mr Khaw hopes the new Khoo Teck Puat Hospital will ease the load when it opens. <br><br>He added that on hindsight, <strong>his ministry made a mistake</strong> ...by not building the new hospital two years earlier. And he said that is why plans for the Jurong General Hospital in the west were started last year. <br><br>Separately, major changes are coming up in the health sector, especially in the allied health professions. And Mr Khaw said legislation will have to keep up. <br><br>He said he has already gone to Parliament to register dental hygienists and advanced practice nurses. Physiotherapists, occupational therapists and other allied health professionals will be next in line. <br><br>Community hospitals will be another focus of the ministry next year. Mr Khaw said several more will be built in the northern and eastern part of Singapore, next to acute care hospitals. <br><br>More nursing homes will also be built within HDB estates. Mr Khaw said these will be modern facilities and will also be located in the north and east of Singapore. - CNA/vm </span></p>

              <p><br>Well not exactly... With TTSH being the central hospital... It caters to a wide area... naturally more ambulance will send patients there... Not even SGH's A&amp;E has tat much of a problem...</p>
              <p>It's the location of the hospitals that's the problem... how there's 3 hospital in the west (I counted in SGH as west) but only 1 in the east... Hopefully the new hospital (Dunno wat name) at yishun will curb the north side's demand...</p>

              <p>What is human traffic? at night, traffic of patients seeking medical attention is not reduced, no change in patients hospitalized, only visitors are not allowed.</p>
              <p>the problem with our government hospitals is that there are fewer nurses per 100 patients, burmese nurses are more submissive, PRC nurses have learnt from the singaporean nurses, when all dept heads sleep, they are in charge!</p>
              <p>you can have a choice of nurses if you go to mt e or glaneagles, besides burmese, singaporean, prc, you also have philippinos, indian, even australian and new zealanders. want to stay longer?</p>

              <p>What is human traffic? at night, traffic of patients seeking medical attention is not reduced, no change in patients hospitalized, only visitors are not allowed.</p>
              <p>the problem with our government hospitals is that there are fewer nurses per 100 patients, burmese nurses are more submissive, PRC nurses have learnt from the singaporean nurses, when all dept heads sleep, they are in charge!</p>
              <p>you can have a choice of nurses if you go to mt e or glaneagles, besides burmese, singaporean, prc, you also have philippinos, indian, even australian and new zealanders. want to stay longer?</p>
