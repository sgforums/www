I had experienced the grass on the other end, and chose to come back. I would have been granted immediate PR with my qualifications.<br><br>Cheaper cars, housing overseas?

            <div class='col-md body'>i dun have the freedom to migrate yet, only 14 yrs old, but I won't migrate in future even if i can...<br><br>i agree with wombat, u gain some, u lose some, for example, if you go elsewhere, u may get cheaper housing, cars,no CPF, welfare , less strict laws, etc, but you get lower standard of education, expensive taxes, insurance coverage, longer travel times, etc, so it boils down to what you think is important to you... no place is really perfect, but i am happy with Singapore as it is. (unless Chee Soon Juan come to power then I really got nothing to say about fellow Singaporeans..., i'll stick around to grab everything in m y house and run like siao)</div>

Protected?...in a sense yeap. Our goverment is quite efficient, compared to a num of countries. Is always good to expand your horizon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for where is better, it all depends on what you want in life. Whether you are willing to give up your life, friends, relatives here...and plunge into a new culture and enviroment.<br><br>Just do not take things at face value, based on what other say. If possible, try experience it first hand...it's way much different. But do be prepared for a culture shock.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
