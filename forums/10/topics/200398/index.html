Hence 'point of view' is the right term to describe historical references.<br><br>Just look at how the Japanese gloss over their wartime atrocities,  angering the Chinese and Koreans in the process? I don't mind if Koizumi visited his war shine to pay homage to the dead, but refusing to admit the past is as good as not taking responsibility for the actions of your countrymen.<br><br>Just like 'National education'. History of Singapore should equate to how a fishing village became a modern metropolis. As it is, there seems to be an over-emphasis on how the times were bad in the 60s and how the PAP came to power and cleaned up crime, corruption and brought safety and security to our shores.<br><br>It reads like a history textbook of the ruling party.
