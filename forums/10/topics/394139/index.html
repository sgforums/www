              <p><span class="update">
              </span></p><p><span>NEW DELHI : The recent global financial crisis has lead to a shift of economic power from the West to Asia, and the continent has emerged from recession much more quickly than countries in the West. <br><br>Singapore Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong said Asian countries should now start engaging each other more proactively, putting aside their differences to help the region emerge as an economic and strategic powerhouse. <br><br>China is still India's biggest trading partner despite an unresolved border issue between the two nations. <br><br>In the last four years, their bilateral trade has more than doubled to US$41 billion. <br><br>Mr Goh lauded both countries for expanding their economic cooperation while avoiding further conflict. <br><br>He said such cooperation will go a long way towards facilitating a new global architecture revolving around Asia. <br><br>Mr Goh said: "Stability in the relations between the major powers, such as between the US and China, as well as between China and India, will continue to be key. There will always be inherent tensions in these great power relationships as they compete for influence, markets and resources. <br><br>"But there are also built-in stabilisers in the growing interdependence of countries in a globalised and deeply interconnected world." <br><br>Speaking at the Asia Society Conference in New Delhi, Mr Goh said reordering of the global power structure was inevitable as Asia continues to grow. <br><br>He added that for the region to make the most of the new order, 'major and emerging powers must learn to adjust and accommodate each other'. <br><br>Mr Goh said: "The European Union is not the benchmark for the eventual shape of the regional architecture in Asia. Instead, the regional architecture in Asia will be much more fluid, with many overlapping layers and mechanisms in order to accommodate the disparate political, cultural and economic interests in the region." <br><br>Earlier, he met India's Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, Montek Singh Alhuwalia, and Leader of the Indian Opposition in Parliament, Sushma Swaraj. <br><br>He sought their support to use Singapore as a converging point for Asian leaders and businessmen to meet. <br><br>He said Singapore was interested to play the role of catalyst to allow Asian businessmen to network and collaborate on a neutral platform. <br><br>Mr Goh encouraged Indian leaders to look at Singapore and other ASEAN countries not only as trading partners, but also as a platform to pursue wider strategic interests in Asia. <br><br>Singapore and other ASEAN countries have emerged as big trading partners of India. But other countries, including US, China and Japan, are already engaging Singapore and Southeast Asian region more proactively. </span></p>
              <p><span>As Senior Minister Goh pointed out, Asia can truly emerge as one big marketplace when India shifts its policy of merely "looking East" to "engaging (the) East". <br><br>Meanwhile, the Confederation of Indian Industries hosted a lunch for Senior Minister Goh on Saturday afternoon. <br><br>The lunch was attended by several Indian business leaders, including Subodh Bhargava, Tarun Das and Vinayak Chatterjee. <br><br>They had a wide-ranging exchange of views on recent developments in India and Southeast Asia, and discussed how the private sectors in the two countries could further strengthen economic cooperation, especially among small- and medium-sized enterprises. <br><br>Mr Goh will leave for Singapore on Saturday night. - CNA/ms <br></span></p>

              <p>whether too early or late, it is his selling point to the west. It is good that SM marketed Asia, not just singapore, to the west. He represented Asia, and not many leader in Asia will hv that capabilities to market the Asia market to the West.</p>
              <p>We, Asia, had alway been a underdogs of the west, be it on economy, fashion, entertainment, creativity, education, etc etc we have alway look at them as a model, but today the wave had changed. Those lazy short hour working, welfare dependent western are relooking into their economy to see how best they can tap on Asia and also learn from Asia.</p>
