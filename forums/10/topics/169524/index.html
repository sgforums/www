It will give you any sort of information you want, just to get out of suffering. Secondly and most importantly, these persons have not been found guilty of a crime. If they are convicted terrorists, I have no issue with the death penalty being applied on them. Hell, I have no problem with convicted terrorists being hanged, drawn and quartered. I believe in being tough on crime too.<br><br>It is the hypocrisy of western governments that I find objectionable.

I think pikamaster has already pretty much highlighted this point for you. They'll confess to crimes they had never committed, make statements under duress, implicate other innocent people, give made-up information.... in the end, all you get is the wrong information.
