Most of the time, they fingered the patriots correctly.<br><br>The watergate scandal which impeached ex-President Nixon came from a close source and informant called 'deep throat'.

Terrorist cells are programmed to work independently and is completed isolated from other cells. They are transmitted information from an undisclosed control source that even they have no knowledge. In most cases, the target, H-hour and mode of release is only issued a few hours before the hit. That's how they make life so difficult for the CIA.<br><br>It's all very clandestine.

            <div class='col-md body'>torture works for extracting information eg. the byzantines tortured captured turkish POWS and extracted valuable information without which constantinople would have fallen sooner. for those who talk so much about banning torture, do they have a more potent method of extracting valuable information needed to save lives or is their talk merely rubbish? if you want to walk the walk you must know how to talk the talk, lets see what viable option these idiots have to get information out of die-hard terrorist scum.</div>

They have not committed any crime and hold no useful information, therefore torturing them is superfluous and wrong.<br><br>What about convicted criminals that are part of a ring of... say... terrorist?

Most of the time, they fingered the patriots correctly.<br><br>The watergate scandal which impeached ex-President Nixon came from a close source and informant called 'deep throat'. Information provided was extremely accurate and was the primary cause of Nixon's downfall.<br><br>The israeli Mossad uses dozens of agents to inflitrate palestinian circles, obtaining vital information in their 'assassination' strategy of hitting key 'packages'. As much as you hate their kill-first-ask-questions-later tactics, you have to give them the thumbs up for success rate. They've effectively got Hamas, Hizbollah and Islamic Jihad visibly shaken everytime they score a hit.<br><br>Getting close to the people responsible and knowing them is probably the best way to obtain the information. It isn't fullproof...but then again, so is torture.<br><br></div></blockquote>You brought up a good point. I remember reading that the CIA had a lot of trouble infiltrating into Al Queda. Apparently (I can't remember the source I read it from) the top people in al queda surround themselves with a select loyal group of aides whom you can't pay for information. They believe very strongly in their cause.<br><br>Most operatives get killed when trying to infiltrate this particular network, that's the reason for the sketchy intelligence coming from al queda.<br><br>Also, most terrorist network follow a "divide and conquer" management via cells. Each cell does not know who or what another cell is doing or even if their terrorist attack is being coordinated with other cells. If you can capture or infiltrate one cell, you still have an intelligence vacuum from the other cells.<br><br>All these setbacks caused the "informant" methods to be rather problematic and ineffective. Of course if informants can become more effective at information gathering and allow governments to study and preempt senseless loss of lives, so much so that torture becomes redundant or less effective in comparison, then I say abolish torture.<br><br>But until that day comes, torture is still the sensible, low cost, high yield method of choice.</div>

It should be easier to do that than to label a political opponent a homosexual, and even that has been done.<br><br>And what if you are wrong about the terrorist suspect?

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha, torture more or less started and roll-balled into the radicalizing of the Islamist movement. It begins with this man called Sayed Qutb. He was a functionary of Egypt's Ministry of Education, sent to US while on a scholarship to study the educational system. As he travelled around, he became increasingly disenchanted with America. The very things that, on the surface, made US look prosperous and happy, Qutb saw as signs of an inner corruption and decay. He perceived crassness, materialism and selfish individualism among other stuffs of those lines.<br><br>So he travelled back to Egypt and was determined to control those forces in his own country. His vision was to have all the modern benefits of Western science and technology, but a more political Islam to provide a better moral framework. Then Qutb realized that the individualist culture was already spreading in Egypt, trapping the masses. "What was needed, he believed, was an Ã©lite, a vanguard who could see through these illusions of freedom, just as he had in America, and who would then lead the masses to realize the higher truth.<br><br>On his return, Qutb became politically active in Egypt. He joined a group called the Muslim Brotherhood, who wanted Islam to play a major role in governing Egyptian society. And in 1952, the Brotherhood supported the revolution led by General Nasser that overthrew the last remnants of British rule. But Nasser very quickly made it clear that the new Egypt was going to be a secular society that emulated Western morals. He quickly forged an alliance with America. <strong>And the CIA came to Egypt to organize security agencies for the new rÃ©gime. Faced with this, the Muslim Brotherhood began to organize against Nasser, and in 1954 Qutb and other leading members of the Brotherhood were arrested by the security services. What then happened to Qutb was going to have consequences for the whole world.<br><br>In the 1970s, a film was made, that showed what happened in Nasser's main prison in the '50s and '60s. It was based on the testimony of survivors. Torturers who had been trained by the CIA unleashed an orgy of violence against Muslim Brotherhood members accused of plotting to overthrow Nasser. At one point, Qutb was covered with animal fat and locked in a cell with dogs trained to attack humans. Inside the cell, he had a heart attack.<br><br>Qutb survived, but the torture had a powerful radicalizing effect on his ideas. Up to this point, he had believed that the Western secular ideas simply created the selfishness and the isolation he had seen in the United States. </strong> But the torture, he believed, showed that this culture also unleashed the most brutal and barbarous aspects of human beings. Qutb began to have an apocalyptic vision of a disease that was spreading from the West throughout the world. He called it jahilliyah, state of barbarous ignorance. What made it so terrifying and insidious was that people didn't realize that they were infected. They believed that they were free, and that their politicians were taking them forward to a new world. But in fact, they were regressing to a barbarous age."<br>- small excerpt from The Power of Nightmares. Aired on the BBC channel.<br><br>So those ideas influenced one events after another, and met up with Ayman Zawahiri (radicalized even more after being tortured in the likes of Qutb - ignorant muslims can be killed), who later was the mentor of Mr.Bean Laden. After continous failed bloody uprisings in Egypt and among other Muslim masses themselves, they turned to America as an act of desperation.</div>
