            <div class='col-md body'>Digress from the topic at hand for some comic relief...<br><br>Read something on the blog of Scott Adams (the guy that drew  <a href="http://www.dilbert.com" rel="nofollow">Dilbert</a>)<br><br>...<br>ThereÂ’s a lot of talk about whether The United States should torture terrorists. Those opposed to torture say it doesnÂ’t work. That includes people who should know, like John McCain.<br><br>Now, if torture doesnÂ’t work, and it makes the rest of the world hate the United States, that seems like a no-brainer. But I canÂ’t help thinking there are three bits of information I need to know before making up my mind.<br><br>First, why is torture so widely used if it doesnÂ’t work? I mean, seriously, a lot of professional torturers are putting a lot of effort into it. Has the CIA really never looked into it? Is it like astrology, where people believe it without the benefit of any science?<br><br>Second, is torture ineffective for EVERY type of question, or just the kind where you canÂ’t tell if the guy is lying? I can see how it wouldnÂ’t work for questions like, Â“What is Osama thinking now?Â” ItÂ’s too easy to lie. But is it also ineffective when you say, Â“IÂ’m going to keep torturing you until we find the guy that you say has the nuclear suitcase bomb. WeÂ’ll stop as soon as we find him. No rush.Â”<br><br>Third, apparently we are successfully getting information from captured terror suspects. Are they giving us this stuff because we played annoying music near them and made them stand up for a long time? Has doing a Â“little extraÂ” ever speeded things up?<br>...<br><br>...<br>If you think that torture doesn't work, why does interrogation work? No one doubts that plain old interrogation (torture lite) often works. Does it make sense to you that additional discomfort would make interrogation work slower or less often?<br><br>If you think there's no moral justification for torture, would you accept the nuclear destruction of NYC (for example) to avoid torturing one known terrorist? (No fair extending my question to more ambiguous hypotheticals.)<br></div>

But however, our government has been a constant ally to Israel and its protector the United States. So technically (pls don't take these words out of context) the terrorists have a reason, no matter how incredible-sounding, for attacking us. And btw, Yishun MRT is supposedly the station used by a large proportion of Americans. Hence, the terrorists aim to destroy the Americans, not their "fellow" Asian Singaporeans.<br><br>2) Whether they torture terrorists themselves or outsource it to places like Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Israel, Eastern Europe, Russia, China, Thailand or (surprise, surprise!) Singapore, they are still violating their own constitution and international law. Such things are not mere business transactions.<br><br>3) There are some things worse than death. You obviously haven't read reports or watched documentaries on torture victims. Go and google for some of these. Anyway, so what if they crack?

But however, our government has been a constant ally to Israel and its protector the United States. So technically (pls don't take these words out of context) the terrorists have a reason, no matter how incredible-sounding, for attacking us. And btw, Yishun MRT is supposedly the station used by a large proportion of Americans. Hence, the terrorists aim to destroy the Americans, not their "fellow" Asian Singaporeans. </blockquote>Oh how convenient. Almost all countries in the world have ties to USA or Israel.<br>What right do these terrorists have to restrict our soverign right as an independent nation to choose who we make friends with?<br>Anyway, the reason you gave is wrong. JI wanted to form a caliphate that includes Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Southrern Thailand and Mindanao and they want to do it through terror on innocent people.<br><br><blockquote><br>2) Whether they torture terrorists themselves or outsource it to places like Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Israel, Eastern Europe, Russia, China, Thailand or (surprise, surprise!) Singapore, they are still violating their own constitution and international law. Such things are not mere business transactions. </blockquote>The nations of the world should use any weapon or means to fight terrorists and to destroy them.<br>BTW international does not say it is illegal to torture terrorists.<br><br><blockquote><br>3) There are some things worse than death. You obviously haven't read reports or watched documentaries on torture victims. Go and google for some of these. Anyway, so what if they crack? Will they provide the accurate information just because they crack??<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>the pikamaster </blockquote>If they do crack, they will give useful information.
