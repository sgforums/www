Please read people's posts carefully before you make any comments. None of us - and definitely not me - is asking for terrorists to be given therapy, or to be "nice and understanding" toward them. (And anyway, once again you are jumping the gun; can you assure that the police are 100% right in every "crook" they nab?) We are saying that we must not let the terrorists drive us to forsake our own values and descend to their level, except perhaps for role-playing educational purposes. Interrogation can be fierce without including torture, physical or mental. The problem with you, Silverpal and your zealot authoritarian wackos is that you pple can't think of anything between the extreme of beating someone to death and giving him candy canes in prison.<br><br>Please think more carefully next time.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>the (sad) pikamaster</div>

But I do agree with you that all the other stuff is pretty real down here. My point was that how far are we willing to enahnce it. Today's NYT carried an article which mentioned that a couple's "intimate moments" at a park was captured by a spy camera tracking some alleged cyclist criminals. Out of common decency, a reputable newspaper such as NYT will not define "intimate moments" exactly, but we can probably guess what the term refers to.

Out of common decency, a reputable newspaper such as NYT will not define "intimate moments" exactly, but we can probably guess what the term refers to.

We are saying that we must not let the terrorists drive us to forsake our own values and descend to their level, except perhaps for role-playing educational purposes.
