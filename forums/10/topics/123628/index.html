            <div class='col-md body'>so political leaders have to follow the orders of religious leaders ? If the muslim religious leaders wanted all women, regardless of religion to wear tudungs we have to follow ? If Catholic says abortion and contraceptives r banned, we banned them in the whole nation ? If christian want u to donate 10% of their money to tilth and force u to go to church on sunday u have to go even if u r nto a believer ? If the taoist want the idol of their deities be placed at every building, then we place them in our house regardless of religions ? If hindu want the people to walk through burning charcoal on thaipusam, all the people have to do tat ? Sorry man, political leaders consult the religion leaders on religious sensitive issues. The final decision lies on them. If u r religious, then u can individually follow the advice of your own religious leaders. As long as it is not some crazy acts they r not gonna stop u. Why ? Because there r people who do not believe in your religion and they should be free to do watever they want. Things make sense if u believe in your religion. It is plain nonsense if u don't believe in it.<br></div>

From the times of medival Europe, the Church participated extensively in politics - from the frequent decrees of excommunication, to the Crusades - the Church and the politics of the land mixed frequently, often to the suffering of the common men.<br><br>Medival China was no different, emperors were seen as given divine mandate - they were seen as sons of heaven.<br><br>Whether it is right or not is a different matter, but in reality religion still plays a constant and powerful role in politics - just check out Malaysian politics, American politics or politics in the Phillipines for example.</div>

And anyway, the action is only done by Governor Jeb Bush, not yet by the White House.I believe someone further down talked about how religious leaders "cloak their poor intentions in religious respectablity". Well, the same applies for secular leaders , or other secular "experts"., who cloak their poor intentions in moral and humanitarian and democratic respectability.<br><br>So euthanasia = "mercy killing"; we are killing someone to prevent that person from suffering agony. Remember the guy who jumped floors with his kids after he llost all his money at the casino? Presumably that guy was killing his kids to spare them future agony at their father's demise. So Common Sense tells you that this should be considered euthanasia as well, shouldn't it? But no, somehow we ahve nobody arguing for that. Instead what we ahve are many people calling that man sadistic and insane and etcetc. But when the doctors perform the act of authanasia, suddenly they are considered heroes, and defenders of Right of Choice.<br><br>It shocks me to see how Americans, a people that prides itself on promoting Human Rights around the world, can in the same breath condemn the Death Penalty and praise euthanasia. Euthanasia violates the most sacrosanct of all the Human Rights - the Right to Life. SO far there is no international HR organization that has thrown any backing behind Mr Schiavo, despite the fact that the Schiavo Case has stirred up even more media attention than Darfur and the Indonesian Quake combined, or the Abu Ghraib Massacres. Amnesty International, for example, has not written a single report or news-flash or urgent action request for people to support Mr Schiavo and have the feeding tube of Terri removed, the same way the organization does for people on the death row, or gays who are arrested for being who they are.  AI still focuses on Sudan and the Death Penalty, and that is right. Essentially, there is no mercy involved in euthanasia; that is bland rhetoric, the same kind government leaders use when they talk about national catastrophes: hmmm... wonder why Microsoft donated so much more tsunami aid relief money than the British and American and Australian governments combined. It's simply a way for doctors to slack; it is medical negligence if the patient suffers while being kept alive, not the fault of God or those who want to keep the patients alive. besides, the key flaw in the argument for euthanasia is this: how can people in a state of extreme pain and suffering, or in a vegetative state like Terri Schiavo,  be able to make a rational decision about their own lives? Their desire for death may be merely a suicidal impulse; in other words, euthanasia is essentially assisted suicide. ( no law court would accept the testimony of such a person) And what is assisted suicide? Isn't it murder?<br><br>Thus, for once, and once alone, the Republican Government may be right in their intervention.<br><br>And anyway, Mr Schiavo has vested interest in hospital money of his wife, so his defence of euthanasia is not merely out of altruistic concern for Terri.<br><br>Go read the New York Times, and you'll find out more.<br><br>the pikamaster (who opposes the Casino, the Death Penalty, Homosexual Discrimination, Abortion and Euthanasia)</div>
