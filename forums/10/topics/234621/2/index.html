            <div class='col-md body'>there is value that police and teachers and other civil service provide.<br><br>The problem here is that the ministers and etc think their value so high that no matter the amount of pay, it is never enough.  While their true value, everyone can see is not worth the current amount we pay them. This is the disconnect.<br><br>The other problem is that high pay is equated with unrelated things such as virtue, less corruption, passion to serve, ability to serve, attration of quality people to serve, higher IQ in academics require higher pay to keep them in the country and etc.  Reality proved the different and sometimes opposite. There are countless examples out there.<br><br>As far as I can see:<br>They scream show them the money. We shout, show us your value.<br><br>Now, this is a turning point where people got to think.<br>Would SG be less well run with a lower paid cabinet?
