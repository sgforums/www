He was the Former Chairman &amp; CEO of Goldman Sachs before he became US Treasury Secretary. His former pay was US$37m in 2005 and would have doubled easily by 2007 had he remained in Goldman Sachs that is one of the World's largest &amp; most successful investment bank. Anyone know what's his present pay as US Treasury Secretary, I believe it's only a few hundred thousands - so much less than US$1m. By comparison, How could Pappies justify their grossly overpaid remuneration that is only sustainable because of the low grey matter of 66.6 Sinkee.</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
