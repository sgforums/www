It practises a form of democratic autocracy that accommodates popular will to vigorously implement its policies and get effective results.' He mentions this in light of the various challenges that Singapore had experienced and the Government's ability to effectively deal with them.<br>Detractors of 'democratic autocracy' regard it as a form of pseudo-democracy. This implies that the ideals of democracy - namely, the promotion of civil and political liberties, limited government, free and fair competitive elections - are not implemented by the regime even though it claims to be democratic. While the aforementioned ideals are characteristics of liberal democracies, let us remind ourselves that liberal democracy is just another form of democracy.<br><br>That means democracy is an essentially contested concept, one that is subjected to personal interpretation. The Singapore Government, according to the article, believes in an autocratic form of democracy which is deemed necessary to stave off challenges that threatened to destabilise the status quo.<br><br>Such a perspective would make Thomas Hobbes proud. According to Hobbes (1651), absolutist government is the only alternative to anarchy and disorder and that citizens have an unqualified obligation to the state. To limit the power of government is to risk a descent into 'a state of nature'. Such arguments can be found in his book, Leviathan (1651).<br><br>Given that Singapore is such a small country with big neighbours and limited resources, then perhaps the existence of a Leviathan-type government is more beneficial than a liberal democracy. Politics requires one to be practical. Idealism serves no purpose if it does not yield effective results. I maintain the argument that Singapore's form of democracy serves to establish an efficient and effective government that is able to deliver the goods. Rather than aspiring for limited government, let's think about its feasibility in terms of efficiency, especially so in contingent times.<br><br>Perhaps we could benefit from Plato's wisdom when it comes to democracy. Plato used the analogy of the ship (Republic, 488 AD) to describe the inefficiency of democracy - everybody on board wants to take control of the ship, regardless of whether they are competent.<br><br>In this state of affairs, Plato argued that only a carefully designed rule by highly educated experts would be equal to the task - a rule based on a carefully designed dictatorship of reason.<br><br>Reza Shifdar Buang </span></div>

It makes no sense to deliberately reduce the wages of lower level staff by bundling the same percentage reduction to that of the senior management level, as the senior management should take greater responsibility if the company is in the black.<br><br>How will that jeopardize the 'system'? The attraction to serve should be the overiding principle, not the attraction of very high wages bordering on exhoribitant.<br><br>You seem to forget that these super-scale earners are being paid with taxpayers' monies- our monies, and they are <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>adamently refusing to disclose </strong></span></span>the formula by which they 'calculate' they pay. Herein lies the difference between the govt sector and the private industries - open competition and the drive to meet operating profits determine how much pay and bonuses a CEO or director is given.<br><br>Govt institutions on the other hand, do not have profit-driven indicators to demonstrate why certain people deserve the wages and bonues they are receiving. It is all too convenient that our ministers peg their pay to those of TOP SALARIED staff working in MNCs, claiming that is what they would have earned had they turned down the chance to 'serve', the opportunity cost if you will.<br><br>Given how certain minstries are being run, i'm not sure whether they would indeed be able to earn equivalent salaries compared to what they currently take home had they dived into the private sector.<br><br>For private sector companies, to survive, one must embrace change; the company culture must embrace it. With the changing face of consumers and the impact of globalisation, any organisation that does not effect change as a norm will surely lose out to far more competitive companies. Thus i cannot understand why your mindset believes a change in management is BAD for a company. Wage costs are perhaps the biggests overheads of any private company, and wage caps are always in place to stem the flow.<br><br>If managers feel they are not being paid sufficiently, it is only natural that they leave for better opportunities in the market. This frees up promotion vacancies for promising stalwarts or protÃ©gÃ©s who could even do the job better.<br><br>The pull and push factor of the job market is a fundamental concept of any industry. It is what drives the private sector to provide suitable renumeration packages for their employees, under threat of losing their best talents if they fail on this account.<br><br>Can the same be said of underachieving ministers or senior civil servants? Do they deserve their pay if they are not producing and is there a neutral board of directors that reserves the right to dismiss them for failing specific targets?</div>
