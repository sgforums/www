              <p><strong>Lee on Singapore immigrants and migration of Singaporeans</strong></p>
              <p>Mr Lee: “Yeah. I mean, you take Singapore. When I was born, this island had probably 450,000 people. By the time of Second World War, nearly one million, it grew with trade and so on. Three-and-a-half years of Japanese Occupation cut off from all sea routes, no food, no medicines, no textiles, no nothing, the population dispersed into all the surrounding areas to grow tapioca in order to survive. It went down to about half-a-million. British came back, restored the system, trade grew, went back to one million. By the time we became independent in1965, we were about two million.</p>
              <p>“So, long stretches of rubber estates, pineapple plantations, mangrove swamps I used to cycle down to town from the countryside, it’s now just highway upon highway, tall buildings. We now have four-and-a-half million people, 3.2 million our citizens, the rest foreigners working here and our planners are projecting for growth to 6.5. I said, look, go slow. Do we want to hit 6.5? Maybe we should… My demographers tell me 5.5 is the more likely target unless we ramp up the immigration. Even 5.5, already at 4.5, we have complaints from our people who say, look, will you keep those permit holders, those strange Chinese and Indians who don’t look like us far away because if we have them nearby, at night in the weekends, they come near our places<br>because we’ve got bright lights and they stay around and leave the place littered and make a terrible noise. If we don’t have them, who’s going to climb up all these scaffoldings and bend these steel bars?”</p>
              <p>Q: “So, how serious is the brain drain, sir?”</p>
              <p>Mr Lee: “The brain drain is pretty serious, our brain drain, losing them…”</p>
              <p>Q: “To China?”</p>
              <p>Mr Lee: “No, losing them to America. No, we’re not losing to China.”</p>
              <p>Q: “Not China?”</p>
              <p>Mr Lee: “China, they’ll come back. You want to be Chinese or do you want to be Singaporean. You go to China, you’re going to compete against 1,300 million very bright fellows, hardworking, starving. Do you stand a chance to be on top of that pole? No, but if you go there as Singaporean with a different base, speaking English which they can’t, with connections to the world, then you’ve got a different platform. What happens is they go to America, Americans then collect them, the bright ones. You stay for two, three years in their companies, acclimatize them to the company culture and take them to China, if they speak Chinese.</p>
              <p>So, they’re part of the American team. Now, if they are working in China, I think they’ll come back because they don’t want their children to compete against Chinese. But if they decide to take the Green Card and settle in America, then I think we’ve lost them and they are going to America and those who don’t want the hard competition here go to Australia and Canada.”</p>
              <p>Q: “You have percentages on that, sir?”</p>
              <p>Mr Lee: “We’re losing about… According to the people who give up their citizenship and take out their savings, their pension funds, we’re losing about, at the top end, 1,000 a year, which is about, if you take the top 30 per cent of the population, thereabout four or five per cent.

              coming here because of better prospects, learn English, you can
              learn Chinese at the same time and so on and the Indians are near

              <p>If one is to look at the recorded thoughts of LKY - these will provide a small window into the workings of his scheming mind that always focus on only one goal - the continued domination of his own creation on Singapore.</p>
              <p>Whatever the methods employed - whether diluting the existing population with new arrivals, or subjecting locals to forced lower wages to meet foreign investors' needs - the end game remains unchanged : "filling the stomachs and dulling the minds" so that his domination will be resentfully tolerated.</p>
              <p>At this stage, he is 85 years.</p>
              <p>At best, he can see only the prospects of two more elections - as he has little or no confidence that nature will afford him the same mental agility, nor will his body parts remain healthy to support conciousness.</p>
              <p>All the life and organ prolonging vitamins and herbal tonics will not help him to last beyond age 95.</p>
              <p>Even if he should live beyond 95, science and technology will allow him to continue by just shuffling along, or wheeled around like an organic plant living on nutrients fed via treated air and liquid mix.</p>
