            <div class='col-md body'>Our leaders like MM Lee often talk as if their policies, and assumptions are always correct and infallible.<br><br>PM Lee has challenged people to robust debates. Vivian Balakrishnan have also openly invited non-conformist people to take part in policy debates.<br><br>As a test to our PM and Ministers' words of honour and sincerity to engage the non-conformist citizens, I applied to join in their internal policy debates within youngpap.<br><br>So far my self-invitation was not accepted. There were hardly any logical or good replies of substance to many posts of forumers here on their condemnations of our ministers giving themselves big sweep first prizes based on wishy-washy benchmarking which could hardly convince any 3-year old kids.<br><br>Many posts in youngpap forum and other forums on major government policy errors were hardly robustly countered with acceptable facts or figures by minister Lui Tuck Yew who announced his plan three months ago to counter cyberspace government criticisms.<br><br>What do all these inabilities to carry out promises or robustly debate people's views on government policies which went wrong like the NKF or Shin Corp.<br><br>By MM Lee's showing of disdain towards cyberspace government criticisms, it only shows that he is not as cosmopolitan as he claims in his latest speech.<br><br>All these facts only show one thing - there is no such thing as talents or global talents or ministers being worth blank pay checks as none of them none or not many of the ministers who have resigned to join the private sector have been turning around big businesses or making many more millions than when they were in service.<br><br>Truths are truths and will always remain truths. Untruths about the worth of our ministers will eventually be debunked by citizens in this internet age.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1st, I think LHL doesn't read this site, but he does get his PAP/staff to read and send him summaries.<br>2nd, when he reads these negative comments, he most likely does not reflect on them, but instead thinks about how they are wrong and/or how he can counter them. If he really listens to the people, he would never have given the ministers the raise.<br>3rd, just before the elections, LHL would give out free $$$ in new-s'pore shares etc, and announce more districts are slated for upgrading. With the windfall, most people would vote PAP.<br><br>perfectly stretagy for an imperfect system</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In 2002, among my various posts to the Feedback Unit I suggested that since Singapore is a small country and instead of confronting Mahathir and other Asian Leaders with spats of all kinds, the government should conduct its foreign relations with other Asean Countries with a strategy of building confidence and trust among the people of two countries. I suggested people of Asean should start some kinds of people-to-people  projects.<br><br>Tonight it was announced by PM Lee over the news the government has launched certain People-to-People projects involving youths of Asean countries.<br><br>There was not a single acknowledgement from Feedback Unit such original ideas were actually from the people. Before this our ministers were regularly engaged in quarrels with Mahathir to the benefit of no one.<br></div>
