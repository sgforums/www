Robert Barro's<br>article was written in in 1992 while Dan Fineman's article was more<br>than 12 years on in 2004. More than a decade separates these two<br>articles and little has changed during this period.

Afterall, it would be in the best material interest<br>of Singapore's Ruling Elite to carry on this game of deception for as<br>long as possible.<br><br>Is all this mere conjecture or fact?

Barro<br>1,217 words<br>2 April 1992<br>The Wall Street Journal Europe<br>(Copyright (c) 1992, Dow Jones ...<br><br>The city-states of Hong Kong and Singapore are two of the heroes of economic development. Gross domestic product per capita grew in both countries at a remarkable 6% a year from 1960 to 1990, and the levels of production per person advanced in each country from one-quarter of the U.S. level in 1960 to about three-quarters in 1990.<br><br>These economic success stories motivate us to look at the histories of the two countries to find clues about the policies that enhance growth. The investigation is especially revealing because the governmental actions pursued by Hong Kong and Singapore have, in major ways, been polar opposites. Hong Kong has been largely laissez faire, whereas Singapore has pursued an aggressive form of industrial policy. (One would therefore identify Singapore's policies with Paul Tsongas's and Hong Kong's with Ronald Reagan's. Bill Clinton's policies fit better with those of the formerly socialist economies of eastern Europe. I have no idea which countries' economic policies to identify with George Bush's or Jerry Brown's.)<br><br>One should begin with some of the many similarities of the two countries: small city-states that began under British colonialism as trading centers with immigrant populations from China. Neither country has significant agriculture or natural resources, except for harbors. Both economies are highly open to international trade and have remarkably high ratios of exports and imports to GDP. Neither government imposes much direct regulation on business, and neither has high ratios of government consumption purchases or transfer payments to GDP.<br><br>Each has been politically stable for some time, although Singapore had difficulties in the 1960s and Hong Kong's prospects for 1997 are uncertain. They are nearly identical in age-adjusted fertility and mortality rates, although Hong Kong had somewhat higher population growth due to greater in-migration. Both countries are strong on education, although Hong Kong had an educational advantage in 1960 and continues to enjoy that advantage today.<br><br>I could start the list of differences by noting Singapore's constraints on civil liberties, illustrated by its limitations on the circulation of The Asian Wall Street Journal (a constraint that no doubt limited the Singaporeans' access to the latest innovations in economics). More important contrasts from an economic standpoint involve the government's role in three areas: the volume of saving and investment, the role of foreign investment and the amount of spending on public infrastructure. Singapore has been far more activist in these areas, especially in using the tax and pension systems to compel private saving and in subsidizing foreign investment and entrepreneurship in targeted industries. Its direct public investment has also been much greater than Hong Kong's.<br><br>Hong Kong has, in general, been far less interventionist. The major exception is its monopoly position in landholding. The government's land policies have allowed vast, potentially valuable holdings to lie fallow and be brought into productive use only at a remarkably slow pace.<br><br>The differences in government policies have led to dramatically different behavior of investment and the balance of international payments. In this story, I am using the purchasing-power adjusted national-accounts data reported by Robert Summers and Alan Heston in the May 1991 Quarterly Journal of Economics. (I used data from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to update to 1990.) The Summers-Heston data show that Hong Kong's gross investment has been reasonably stable since 1960 at around 20% of GDP, and its current account has typically been near balance.<br><br>Singapore's gross investment was 13% of GDP in the early 1960s, reached 21% between 1965 and 1969, and then soared to an average of nearly 40% since 1970. This staggering amount of investment has been financed partly by the highest saving rate in the world (thanks to governmental coercion, rather than an especially thrifty disposition of the populace) and partly by massive borrowing from abroad (until the mid-1980s). Another way to put this is that Singapore's prosperity in terms of production has not been translated nearly as much as Hong Kong's into high levels of consumption. In 1989-90, when Singapore's per-capita GDP was 104% of Hong Kong's, its per-capita private consumption was only 71% of Hong Kong's.<br><br>Prof. Alwyn Young of MIT's Sloan School discussed many of these facts in a recent study ("A Tale of Two Cities: Factor Accumulation and Technical Change in Hong Kong and Singapore," forthcoming in the National Bureau of Economic Research's 1992 Macroeconomic Annual). His stress was on the effects of the different governmental polices on productivity and growth. The main findings follow from the facts already presented: Although Singapore has plowed twice as much of its GDP into investment, the growth rates of GDP have been about the same.<br><br>Singapore has, in other words, gotten much less out of each unit of investment. This low return involves two effects: First, there has been so much investment that the real rate of return on capital has fallen to near zero, and second, the growth of productivity (output per unit of quality-adjusted labor and capital) in Singapore has been much slower than in Hong Kong.<br><br>Prof. Young attributes Singapore's low productivity growth to its industrial policy of picking winners to target for investment. The problem has not been so much the choice of the wrong winners, but rather the tendency to select new winners too often. Since the late 1960s, Singapore has shifted from a trading-post economy that had a large role for the British military and non-export-oriented manufacturing to an emphasis on export-oriented textiles and clothing, petroleum refining, various electronic products, computers and financial services.<br><br>Allegedly, Singapore is now targeting biotechnology and striving to become the Asian center for corporate headquarters. All of this in 20 years in a country of less than three million. One can admire the initiative in tackling one technology after another, but productivity would likely have been better if they had stayed in an area long enough to gain the production efficiencies that result from learning and experience.<br><br>I should recall that this discussion concerns two of the great success stories among the world's economies. Hong Kong and Singapore are co-champions in growth rates of per-capita GDP since 1960, and these performances reflect many favorable elements, such as friendly economic climates and political stability. Singapore's shortcomings have to be interpreted relative to Hong Kong's strengths, not relative to the many economic disaster areas of the developing world.<br><br>A fair conclusion, however, is that Singapore's forced saving and industrial targeting have been mistakes. These policies have led unnecessarily to reduced productivity and welfare. This lesson is important for developing and developed countries, but the implications for the 1992 presidential election in the U.S. are unfortunately unclear. None of the prospective candidates offers the free-market policies of Hong Kong, and Ronald Reagan and the leaders of Hong Kong are ineligible for the office.<br></div>

Although Singapore markets itself as a low-tax country with world-class social programmes, in reality the government taxes heavily and spends little. The resulting huge surpluses -- largely hidden and off-budget -- strengthen the ruling party but weaken the economy. Unless the government drastically loosens fiscal policy, businesses will lose competitiveness and long-term growth will slow.<br><br>Singapore's political system and fiscal strategy are inextricably intertwined. Only a government dominated by a single party could consistently post such large surpluses and only an extraordinarily well-financed state could exert such extensive control over political and economic life.<br><br>Big structural surpluses most benefit the ruling party, to the detriment of the private sector. Unconstrained by tight finances, the government pays cabinet members and civil servants some of the world's highest public-sector packages. Although generous salaries discourage corruption, they also lure the best talent to the government and ruling party. Private enterprises -- and rival political parties -- suffer brain drains. When campaigning, the ruling party argues that the opposition lacks capable leaders. Because high pay has attracted the island's brightest to the government camp, the claim rings true.<br><br>A variety of analytical shields obscures the embarrassing size of government surpluses. Accounting principles differ from global standards. A bewildering array of statutory boards, government-linked companies, investment corporations and holding companies transact among themselves at undisclosed prices. Key data such as the government's share of national savings and the profits of holding companies and investment corporations are kept secret. One analyst calls the national accounts a "masterpiece of obfuscation."<br><br>Actual surpluses greatly exceed the already impressive stated numbers. From 1991 to 2001, the government reported surpluses averaging 3.6% of GDP, but Mukul Asher of National University of Singapore calculates an adjusted average of 9.7%, nearly triple the announced figures. Official budgets exclude land-lease revenues, investment income and profits from off-budget state bodies. Because Asher includes only publicly disclosed revenues, his adjustments understate real surpluses.<br><br>The high-surplus strategy lowers Singapore's standard of living. Deprived of disposable income by numerous taxes, Singaporeans consistently consume a share of GDP 10-20 percentage points below Hong Kong levels, while Hong Kong maintains a higher per-capita income. Their high-revenue, low-expenditure government leaves Singaporeans a smaller slice of a more modest pie.<br><br>Overly stringent fiscal policies sap Singapore's competitiveness. Excess surpluses depress the cost of capital and encourage firms -- many state-owned -- to overinvest. According to JPMorgan, listed Singapore companies provided a return on equity below the non-China developing Asian average in four of the last five years and half the United States benchmark since 1996.<br><br>An excessively pro-fiscal design is contributing to a looming crisis in Singapore's national pension plan, the Central Provident Fund, or CPF. Rather than invest balances on beneficiaries' behalf, CPF pays contributors a low, artificially determined interest rate. The state pockets as a hidden tax the potentially huge difference between the actual investment yield and what beneficiaries receive. In contrast to most countries' schemes, Singapore allows working contributors to pay medical bills with plan balances. The resulting outflow depletes retirement funds but relieves the government of potential health-care liabilities.<br><br>Arguably, provisions allowing home buyers to tap CPF balances work to similar effect. State entities own an estimated 85% of the island's land. If, as some analysts believe, CPF financing has contributed to high land prices, the government gains from home purchases, while pension balances dwindle. Largely as a result of its fiscally friendly features, CPF will prove grossly inadequate for meeting individual retirement needs.<br><br>Slower economic growth has eliminated reported surpluses this decade, but the lack of change in broader fiscal policies indicates that actual balances remain high. Until the dominant-party political system that thrives on outsized surpluses undergoes fundamental reform, Singapore will struggle with an underfunded pension plan, inefficient businesses and sickly consumption.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This message was forwarded to you from Straits Times Interactive<br>(http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg) by MellanieHewlitt@...<br><br>Comments By Mellanie Hewlitt<br>Singapore Review<br>1 Oct 2004<br><br>With an obscene amout of surplus in Medisave Reserves, huge hidden fiscal<br>surpluses enrich the Singapore government and state enterprises but impoverish<br>the private sector and tax payers.<br><br>Lack of Transparency is a common issue with the CPF Board and State Owned<br>Enterprises.
