            <div class='col-md body'>By Tan Boon Seng, Feb 10, 02<br>See Singapore Government Directory (Interactive) for more detail<br><br>Government-linked companies (GLCs) appear to be playing a bigger role in the Singapore economy than ever before. With Singapore experiencing possibly its worst economic downturn since independence, the government is re-examining its economic policies.<br><br>The governmentÂ’s deepening and broadening involvement in private enterprise is among the policies being scrutinized by the governmentÂ’s Economic Review Committee. Some officials hint at a reversal of this practice but others appear to disagree.<br><br>A closer look at the issue suggests that reversing this policy is difficult. The governmentÂ’s withdrawal from business could hurt the employment, income and ownership interests of people closely connected to it Â–<br><br><strong>1.   relatives of senior government leaders,<br><br>2.   former senior government officials,<br><br>3.   former senior military commanders,<br><br>4.   current senior government officials, and<br><br>5.    current and former ruling party politicians. The outcome may also hurt the governmentÂ’s efforts to co-opt its politicians from the private sector. </strong><br><br>The Policy Debate<br><br>Minister of State for Trade and Industry Raymond Lim in November said that the government might in future do less of  Â“leading from the frontÂ”. He also suggested the possibility of introducing competition law to address the dominance of GLCs. Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry, in December said that: Â“What really matters for East Asia is a shift towards open, competitive markets, and away from the state-driven industrial policies and the collusive domestic networks that have led to low returns on investment.Â”<br><br>However, Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier-General Lee Hsien Loong, who is heading the Economic Review Committee, has clarified the extent to which the government will withdraw from business. He said GLCs would continue to be Â“one of the thrusts forwardÂ” for the Singapore economy. His wife, Mdm Ho Ching, who is Director of Temasek Holdings and Deputy Chairman of Singapore Technologies, has shared her dream for Singapore Technologies to become a Â“global championÂ”, Â“to make the seemingly impossible, a realityÂ”. Mr S Dhanabalan, Chairman of Temasek Holdings, has also made it clear that the government will not withdraw from businesses it deems it to have a Â“strategicÂ” interest in. Mr Dhanabalan said the government also intends to be involved in businesses of a high-risk nature. These remarks were made even before the committeeÂ’s work had begun.<br><br><strong>The Interests of People Closely Connected to the Government</strong><br><br><strong>1) Relatives of senior government leaders</strong><br><br>That the government seems reluctant to withdraw from enterprise could be complicated by its potential effect on the interests of people closely connected to the government. DPM Lee and his father Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew are at the helm of GIC, possibly SingaporeÂ’s largest GLC in terms of assets. DPM LeeÂ’s wife, brother, and a few other relatives are also holding key positions in GLCs. While the situation is presumably a coincidental outcome of free market meritocracy, it could be a source of constrain as DPM Lee considers how to revive private enterprise in Singapore. The following table illustrates the situation:<br><br>Family Members Relationship To DPM Lee Present GLC Post<br>Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong   Deputy Chairman of GIC<br><br>Mdm Ho Ching Wife Chairman of Chartered Semiconductor, ST Engineering, ST Capital, StarHub, Deputy Chairman of Singapore Technologies, and Director of Temasek Holdings and SembCorp Industries (Singapore Technologies unit)<br><br>Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew Father Chairman of GIC<br><br>Brigadier-General Lee Hsien Yang Brother Chief Executive of SingTel Group and SESAMi Inc (SingTel unit), and Director of Singapore Technologies Industrial Corporation and National Computer Systems (SingTel unit)<br><br>Colonel (Dr) Kwa Soon Bee Uncle (MotherÂ’s Brother) Managing Director of Jurong Bird Park, Chairman of Wildlife Reserves Singapore and Director of Keppel Land<br><br>Mr Edmund Lee Cousin (FatherÂ’s BrotherÂ’s Son) Chief Executive of DBS Vickers (DBS and Singapore Technologies unit)<br><br>Mr Kwa Chong Seng Cousin (MotherÂ’s BrotherÂ’s Son) Deputy Chairman of Temasek Holdings (Ministry of Finance unit)<br><br>Mr Ho Sing Brother-In-Law (WifeÂ’s Brother) Vice President of Singapore Precision Industries 2000 (Singapore Technologies unit) and Director of Advanced Materials Technologies (Singapore Technologies unit)<br><br>Mrs Lee Suet Fern Sister-In-Law (BrotherÂ’s Wife) Director of SembCorp Logistics<br><br>Ms Lim Suet Boey Sister-In-LawÂ’s Sister (BrotherÂ’s WifeÂ’s Sister) Senior Vice President of SembCorp Utilities<br><br>(continue next post)<br><strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(part 3)<br><strong><br>2) Former senior government officials</strong><br><br>Though not an explicit policy, it has become an institution of sorts that senior government officials in Singapore move on to hold key posts in GLCs after their service in government.

            <div class='col-md body'>(part 4)<br><br>As with any business, state-controlled or otherwise, there is a tendency for managers at the top to appoint people whom they have shared a common past with. Since many past and present officials lead GLCs, these people tend to appoint other past or present officials to key positions in the GLCs. For example, Mr Liew Mun Leong was Chief Executive of SISIR from 1988 to 1992 when Mdm Ho Ching served as a Member of the SISIR Board. He is now Chief Executive of CapitaLand, the property arm of Singapore Technologies. Ms Leong Wai Leng was Deputy Chief Executive of SISIR from 1990 to 1993. She is now Deputy Chief Executive of Raffles Holdings, the hotel arm of Singapore Technologies. Mr Anthony Seah was a Division Head of SISIR from 1988 to 1991. He is now Chief Executive of PREMAS International, the property management arm of Singapore Technologies. Colonel Tham Kui Seng was General Manager of a SISIR subsidiary from 1991. He is now Chief Executive of CapitaLand Residential. Given the perceived shortage of talent in Singapore, Colonel ThamÂ’s experience as the ArmyÂ’s logistics chief is presumably valuable in efforts to develop Â“premier, high qualityÂ” homes around the world. Colonel Kee Teck Koon was Director of SISIR from 1991 to 1993. He is now Chief Executive of The Ascott Group, the serviced residence arm of Singapore Technologies. With nine years in the Armed Forces behind him, Colonel Kee leads Â“Asia PacificÂ’s largest serviced residence companyÂ”, building a Â“luxury brand that projects an elegant, meticulous lifestyle that appeals to top executivesÂ” and offering Â“the ultimate refinement in served accommodationÂ”. Lieutenant-Colonel Ed Ng was General Manager of a SISIR subsidiary from 1990 to 1991. He is now Executive Vice President of CapitaLand.<br><br><strong>If the government withdraws from business, a prestigious and lucrative destination for senior government officials would be taken away. Senior managers of GLCs are compensated at globally competitive levels. Many of them are also shareholders of the GLCs they manage. Non-executive directors are paid regular directorÂ’s fees and are even given stock options, which can be substantial. The stipends are not pittance. They may lose out if the government gives up ownership of GLCs.</strong><br><br>(continue in next post)</div>

Some of them receive not just directorsÂ’ fees but also stock options. For example, Lieutenant-Colonel Boon Swan Foo, Managing Director of Agency for Science, Technology and Research, owned 224,433 ST Engineering shares, 2,005,000 ST Engineering share options, 28,800 Chartered Semiconductor shares, 14,250 ST Assembly share options, and 53,850 CapitaLand share options among other interests as of year-end 2000. Colonel (Prof) Lui Pao Chuen, Chief Defence Scientist of Ministry of Defence, owned 161,444 ST Engineering shares and 12,950 SembCorp Industries shares, among other interests as of year-end 2000.

            <div class='col-md body'>Commentary on Ministers "pay cut"<br>Singapore Review, 2 May 2003<br>By Mellanie Hewlitt<br><br>The headlines blared loudly in the 2 May 2003 issues of the Straits<br>Times and Business Times "Pay cut? Ministers ready to lead by example:<br>DPM", announcing to the entire world this selfless act of leadership by<br>Singapore's Ruling Elite.<br><br>In what appeared to be an initial move to reduce severely inflated<br>salaries, to more reasonable industry standards, Singapore's Ruling<br>Elite have bowed to public pressure and hinted at accepting a pay cut.<br>Or have they?<br><br>What exactly does "Leading By Example" mean? Lets try to put some<br>substance behind those brave words. As of last count, average take home<br>pay of a Singapore minister was well in excess of SGD100,000/- a month.<br><br>The below table puts things back in proper perspective: (these are<br>basic figures as of July 2000 and did not include last year's pay hikes<br>or other benefits. Otherwise the updated numbers may well be much<br>larger)<br><br>1. Singapore Prime Minister's Basic Salary US$1,100,000 (SGD1,958,000)<br>a year Minister's Basic: US$655,530 to US$819,124 (SGD1,166,844 to<br>SGD1,458,040) a year<br><br>2. United States of America President: US$200,000 Vice President:<br>US$181,400 Cabinet Secretaries: US$157,000<br><br>3. United Kingdom Prime Minister: US$170,556 Ministers: US$146,299<br>Senior Civil Servants: US$262,438<br><br>4. Australia Prime Minister: US$137,060 Deputy Prime Minister:<br>US$111,439 Treasurer: US$102,682<br><br>5. Hong Kong Chief Executive : US$416,615 Top Civil Servant: US$278,538<br>Financial Sec: US$315,077<br><br>Source: Asian Wall Street Journal July 10 2000<br><br>In relative terms, less then 20% of Singaporeans here have take home<br>salaries exceeding SGD100,000/- A YEAR.<br><br>In stark contrast, BASIC SALARY FOR A MINISTER STARTS AT SGD1,166,844 A<br>YEAR,OR JUST UNDER SGD100,000 A MONTH.<br><br>What these ministers earns in just ONE MONTH exceeds the ANNUAL TAKE<br>HOME salary of 80% of Singapore's income earning population. Lets not even<br>begin to compare annual packages which will exceed SGD1 million easily.<br><br>With the above numbers and figures now in perspective, it is easier to<br>give substance to the words "leading by example". Several facts are<br>noteworthy here;<br><br>a) That the ministerial salaries are grossly out of proportion, even<br>when compared with their counterparts in much larger countries (US and<br>UK) who have far heavier responsibilities.<br><br>b) That these salary reductions were long overdue. In the past, such<br>handsome  remuneration were "justified" on the back of resounding<br>performance. However,  Singapore's economy has been in the doldrums of<br>a recession for several years  now (with beginnings reaching as far<br>back as the 1997 Asian economic crisis).  This economic barometer is a<br>rough measure of performance and implies that  ministerial salaries<br>were due for review at least 3-4 years ago.<br><br>c) That adjustments should be made to bring them back within the<br>industry  benchmarks. Taking the salary of US vice president as a rule<br>of thumb, the  percentage for reductions should start at 50% of current<br>pay. Even if a Singapore minister takes a 50% pay-cut, he would still<br>be earning much more then the US vice president.<br><br>d) The percentage reductions should greater then 50% if the intent is<br>to bring  the salaries within the perspective of Singapore's domestic<br>scene.<br><br>With such inflated figures, it is understandable why the local<br>government controlled media (Singapore Press Holdings) have taken pains<br>to exclude mention of actual numbers for the world to see. The numbers<br>would be too glaring and no amount of window dressing or creative<br>writing could have reconciled these numbers with a sane figure and<br>restored credibility.<br><br>It is unlikely that Singapore's Ruling Elite will accept such huge<br>salary cuts. Exactly How much and when the ministerial pay-cuts takes<br>effect is not revealed. Ask any man on the street and 9 out of 10<br>responses indicate many agree the current ministerial salaries are<br>grossly inflated, especially in these lean and difficult times.<br><br>Said a long time forumer from an internet political chat group:<br>"First of all the Ministers are NOT leading on pay cut. Workers'<br>salaries have been drastically reduced since the beginning of the<br>recession while thousands have been unemployed. so the Ministers are<br>NOT LEADING. they are only CATCHING UP. And they have several decades<br>to catch up on."<br><br>"Secondly, how much of a pay cut will Ministers take? 10%? 20%? unless<br>its a cut that will affect their lifestyles, it is merely symbolic and<br>they would still not know what it feels like to be a normal worker. as<br>such, this is not Leading by Example. Its just another bogus political<br>propaganda stunt"<br><br>A 29 yr old executive who requested to remain anonymous admitted<br>sheepishly ; "The numbers (ministerial salaries) are a national<br>embarrassment really, because it reflects the underlying materialistic<br>value systems of Singapore Ministers. No matter how you look at it, the<br>fact remains that our ministers are money faced, and these are supposed<br>to be Singapore's leaders, with value systems that Singaporeans should<br>follow." "It (the ministerial salaries) puts Singapore in a bad light<br>in the eyes of the world. The rest of Singaporeans really put in an<br>honest days work for every penny they earn. And the process for review<br>and approval of the ministerial salaries is also a joke. Imagine<br>sitting on the board and approving (on White Paper)your own salary<br>increments! Its all a wayang show".<br><br>This also raises the question as to the authenticity of the actual<br>process for review and approval of cabinet minister's salaries. Who<br>decides on these numbers? Is there independence and transparency?<br><br>Veteran opposition figure J.B. Jeyaretnam on Wednesday, Nov 20, 2002<br>challenged Singapore government ministers to take a pay cut to show<br>they understand the economic hardships faced by the public. And the<br>over-riding concern is that Singapore's Ruling Elite are unable to<br>appreciate the economic hardship that the masses face in these tough<br>times.<br><br>The growing public resentment comes afew months after PM Goh's careless<br>comments that "lay-offs were not all bad", drew a backlash from the<br>public with a flood of e-mails being sent to the foreign press to<br>register public indignation.<br><br>Source Sg_Review group<br><br>Singapore Review welcomes honest feedback on this hotly debated topic.<br>You can Send your comments to the editor:  sg_Review@yahoogroups.com<br><br>To subscribe, simply send an e-mail to:<br>Sg_Review-subscribe@yahoogroups.com<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The governmentÂ’s Public Sector Divestment Committee in 1987 recommended that the government withdraw from commercial activities where its role was no longer needed to avoid competition with the private sector. Since then, the government has reduced its stakes in several GLCs through public offering of shares. It has also selectively divested a few companies.<br><br>Yet its participation in the economy remains entrenched and has even become more widespread. The government continues to control many of the GLCs that are listed on the Exchange. New acquisitions, ventures into new businesses, and the corporatisation of services previously administered by statutory boards have expanded its involvement in the economy. The liberalization of certain industries previously monopolised by a GLC have resulted in only more GLCs.<br><br>Given the above-mentioned fact, Singaporeans will have to continue to endure higher costs of living and doing business because of the following reasons:-<br><br>(1)  GLCs are not originally created by entrepreneurs from good ideas or application of technologies. There are not true business entrepreneurship and do not represent any particular gains or benefits for the economy as a whole. They are re-constituted from existing tax-payers' services previously provided using people's monies or taxations to save government's expenses in running these services.<br><br>(2)  The more government farms out such essential services the more they become GLCs and the more people's monies end up in these GLCs sucking up the liquidity from the market and reducing the vibrancy of business.<br><br>(3)  So, the More GLCs are formed to spring off as companies the more they will act as government subsidiaries not knowing how to do real business but sucking up public monies to let them build more GLCs which again cut into the smaller and smaller pies of the domestic businesses. The business entrepreneurship and vibrancy of local businesses and SMEs will be curtailed by expanding GLCs. GLCs when gathered into bigger conglomerates wil lead to greater monopolies. Greater monopolicies will lead to higher prices of goods and services.<br><br>(4)  Local privately owned businesses and SMEs are the real entrepreneurial businesses which fuel growth in manufacturing and technology applications and create jobs. They will be stifled one by one from growth. GLCs will cut into their paths and take away their business opportunities. Government will award jobs to the GLCs or their associates at the expense of local privately owned businesses.<br><br>GLCs do create jobs but they create only highly paid CEOs which take away profits because such CEOs where previously were paid entrepreneurially lower salaries overnight occupy prime jobs with big titles thereby sucking up profits and liquidity from the market. GLCs can be run more effectively if they are broken into small units for private companies to re-constitute them into money making ventures. Now they are just using public monies and create surpluses through monopolicies and all monies go to keeping up the look-good boards and CEOs to create off profits.<br><br>The more monies and profits from public go to the private sector the more business will expand for Singapore. The more monies are taken by GLCs, the more these GLCs muscle in on the local businesses to deprive them of opportunities and monies go to the pockets of individual CEOs and their cohorts of highly paid officials.<br><br>GLCs should be broken up into more vibrant SMEs and let the true businessmen and entrepreneurs run them for expansion into the creating more technology start-ups and more jobs.<br><br>GLCs only look good like the old MediaCorp which will fail the moment they are exposed to competitions. They eventually will be saved from failure by breaking them up and let more private sector people run them in the true competitive spirit.<br><br>Government should reexamine the policy so that they will not let GLCs have their way which eventually will be sucking up more or using tax payers' monies to curtail true business vibrancy.<br><br>The same tax payers' monies paying that kind of monies as paid to GLCs through farming off of essential government services could have been turned around many more times if these monies are earned in the private companies.</div>
