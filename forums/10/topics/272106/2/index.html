He was charged with murder.<br><br>Due to discrepancies in the prosecution and an appeal to high court, the case was sent back to the lower court for a re-trial and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. After appealing again to the high court, his conviction was quashed but the Federal Sharia Court reversed the high courtÂ’s decision and it was back to square one. He was guilty of murder again.<br><br>He was in prison for 18 years since 1988 for a crime he did not commit.<br>His execution was postponed several times, most recently until the end 2006.<br><br>Finally, when Mirza was about to be executed, Prince Charles made a plea to President Musharraf to spare MirzaÂ’s life. The death sentence was commuted to a life sentence. Under Pakistani law, this equated to a 14 year term. Since Mirza had already served 18 years, he was released on 17th Nov 2006.<br></div>

He was charged with murder.<br><br>Due to discrepancies in the prosecution and an appeal to high court, the case was sent back to the lower court for a re-trial and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. After appealing again to the high court, his conviction was quashed but the Federal Sharia Court reversed the high courtÂ’s decision and it was back to square one. He was guilty of murder again.<br><br>He was in prison for 18 years since 1988 for a crime he did not commit.<br>His execution was postponed several times, most recently until the end 2006.<br><br>Finally, when Mirza was about to be executed, Prince Charles made a plea to President Musharraf to spare MirzaÂ’s life. The death sentence was commuted to a life sentence. Under Pakistani law, this equated to a 14 year term. Since Mirza had already served 18 years, he was released on 17th Nov 2006.<br></div></blockquote>The Sharia courts deserve no respect at all. Whoever works for them ought to be butchered.</div>

In most countries you're considered innocent and you need evidence to prove you're guilty. Here if you're convicted of a crime you're automatically labeled as guilty and you need evidence proving your innocence which is similar to what happened in the story.</div>
