            <div class='col-md body'>Just read the innocent man....it really makes you dulan towards the judiciary...<br><br>Dennis Fritz was an ordinary man living an ordinary life in Ada, Oklahoma. A school teacher whose wife was brutally murdered in 1975, Dennis was raising his young daughter on his own. On the fateful evening of May 8, 1987, Dennis was enveloped by a sudden foreboding sensation. He could not explain the eerie feeling in his gutÂ—the sense that something is about to happen. Two hours later, he was under arrest, handcuffed and on his way to jail on charges of rape and murder.<br><br>From the outset the evidence against Dennis and his eccentric friend, Ron Williamson, in the murder of Debbie Sue Carter were non-conclusive. An overzealous prosecutor, intent on winning, relied on flimsy circumstantial data to create the illusion of guilt. Distorted statements, questionable testimony of a jailhouse informant, faulty hair evidence, dream confessions and other bizarre clues completed the prosecutionÂ’s circle of deception.<br><br>Dennis was convicted after a swift trial. The vote of a single juror saved him from the death penalty and he was sentenced to life behind bars. His co-defendant, Ronnie Williamson, was sentenced to death.<br><br>In prison, Dennis immediately immersed himself in an intense study of the law and wrote hundreds of letters and appellate briefs in his own defenseÂ—hoping against hope that someone would take an interest in his case. It was a tortuous journey, but Dennis was relentless. After ten desperate years he discovered the Innocence Project, a non-profit legal organization devoted to exonerate the wrongfully convicted through post-conviction DNA testing. With the aid of Barry Scheck and irrefutable DNA evidence, Dennis and Ron were exonerated. The real killer, who turned out to be one of the prosecutionÂ’s key witnesses, was finally brought to justice. On April 15, 1999, after twelve years of wrongful imprisonment, Dennis and Ron were free men. Their long journey toward justice was finally over.</div>

How could they give a guilty verdict with evidence which are non conclusive on the outset? was there no court of appeal?  This is the sad state of the american jury.<br><br>It was not the absence of death sentence that save him, it was the single juror. Lucky him. The juridicial process through which a suspect is investigated, prosecuted, trial and sentence is the main issue, not the punishment after sentence.<br><br>In Singapore, not sure if Dennis would be found guilty, but is unlikely to be sentenced to death, since there is indeed little evidence against him, and he would have the chance of appeals.<br><br>But it is true that if he were sentenced to imprisonment here, there is no Innocence Project, or any non-profit legal organization devoted to exonerate the wrongfully convicted through post-conviction DNA testing. If any such organisation exists, their help would have to be sought during the trial period, before guilty as charged.<br><br>May be such organisations exist in america because have are always wrong verdicts given by their courts.

Now, if a similar case were to happen here, would anyone be equally confident of successfully bringing the case against this regime and expect those multi million-dollar thugs - who hardly ever takes responsibilities for errors that arise under their watch - to concede the failings of this regime's judiciary in public?<br><br>Then again, with a press that is ranked 154th in the world for press freedom, it'd be a miracle if such cases even came to light, isn't it?  It's indeed ironic how much scrutiny is placed on the failings of the world's most liberal nations where press freedom is an integral feature of society, while little attention is given to rogue regimes which seem to be such utopia given their seemingly lack of negative press coverage due to the absence of a credible press.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

A jail term without parole is only to be reserved for hardcore criminals or multiple murderers, for example.<br>If an innocent man is convicted, he or his friends or relatives should be allowed to seek redress.<br>If the judiciary system has made an honest mistake, somebody will have to compensate dearly for his lost years.
