              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">GRC 'myth'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">GRC has already been implemented for 13
              years yet it remained a contentious issue because it was viewed  by
              many as unfair and only benefited the ruling party.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">However I think Single Member
              Constituencies (SMC) system can also guarantee minority
              representation in parliament by some modification on its
              implementation</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This is how it works :</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <ol>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif;">The
              	Elections Department would specify the required number of minority
              	representatives in the all SMC constituencies according to the
              	percentage of the minority community in the total population.</span></p>
              </li>
              </ol>
              <div id="cg_msg_content"><ol>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif;">The
              		Election Department will designate which are the constituencies as
              		minority represented only constituencies.</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif;">Political
              		parties could only nominate a minority candidate to contest in
              		these designated constituencies. So only minority representatives
              		will guaranteed be elected into parliament.</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif;">These
              		minority represented SMC should be rotated among all the
              		constituencies in every General Election.</span></p>
              </li>
              </ol>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif;">The
              	advantage of the said rotation is that a MP will not be staying in a
              	constituency for too long. The electorate will find it beneficial
              	and be more then happy to accept the scheme because PM or other
              	heavy weight ministers will one day come to serve them in their
              	constituency</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              </div>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Likewise this system could also be
              applied to ensure the desired gender representation.</p>

              <p>GRC is a brainchild of PAP, it can also be a deadchild for them.</p>
              <p>By Creating GRC, they put a top man there with the smaller ones leaning and grouping with him for security and career advancement. But if that top man failed, it can become a diseaster for all.</p>
              <p>If oppositions can take over just 2 GRCs, LKY would be regretting creating GRC, which could ultimately or partially destroy his party chances.</p>

              <p>PAP arrogant has caused its own downfall. I have over the past years commenting on the wrong policies especially, high property prices caused by foreign buying, income gap btw rich and poor, downgrading of living standard of average Sinaporean, influx of forigners that caused hardship for ordinary Citizens and the brains all but no heart way of governing. it all come to one things, money!! if governing is all about money talk, there is no compassion and there is no heart to serve.</p>
              <p>We can have all the casino, the high rise building but if the ppl felt that they are been taken over and relegated as 2nd class citizen in their own country, the government would eventually falls.</p>
              <p>Remember all uprising is by peasants and though there is no bagger in Singapore, we already have the peasants class that continue feel been sold out with all the foreigns faces appearing even at supermaket and 7-11.</p>
              <p>Not to mentioned, Singaporean are now been deprived of a decent home by the high price caused by these foreign buying.</p>

              PM Lee has said that he will not have by election to get the heavyweight ministers back if they lose their GRCs.
              
              If the opposition is to win 3 GRCs, the PAP will lose 3 heavyweight ministers and other ministers for state.
              
              Who are the PM Lee going to get to form the Cabinet then ?
              
              Allow untested elected MPs to be in the cabinet.
              
              So, indeed as Angel7030 said, the creation of the GRCs allows the PAP to bring in anyone in good times but if PAP loses a few GRCs, the quality of the cabinet will be affected severely and PAP will lose its reputation of a good government and hurt its chance in the next election too.
              
              Indeed, GRCs will be a double-edged sword for the PAP.
