              <p><br>The US market is not only serving the US domestic market alone, nearly 1/3 of it stock values is traded by countries outside US. When the french first started the stock exchange, one thing on their mind is that human are greedy pigs, they will put their money in hoping for a gain, we can provide that service for them, and as times goes by, trading, which was suppose to be visible, eg you give me cows, i give you textile in return, become invisible leading to paper trading and now electronic trading, and this type of trading is dangerous, because no actual of exchange of goods take place can be deem as exchanged in paper or electronic, and when after years of gain and speculation, the stock or the capital is actually a void, and when finally everyone start to realize the seriousness of it, panic takes place, stocks and bonds become junk just like greece is not experiencing and more so with other EU countries, the earlier profitable moment and gain will taken by rich capitalist or player, leaving the poor investor crunching on their lost....today STI 450 losers against 54 gainers.</p>

              <p><br>and meltdown is going to be worst than the world had ever see, cos china financial insitutions and the going concern of their trading and buying is not as transparent as the west and here,  and certainly higher in term of unethical management, meaning undertable trading.</p>

              <p><br>Heh, i think Japan's been on borrowed time since the Lost Decade. I just don't see how it's going to climb out of this deep dark hole it's in right now. But i see a slow descent as more likely than a crash and burn.</p>
              <p>But you're probably right on China. It does have the luxury of being able to implement draconian methods to cool the bubble down.</p>
