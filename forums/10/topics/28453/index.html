But we don't dispute that reasoned open debate on controversial issues is a sign of a mature self-confident Singapore from a civil society argument perspective. That's what all these internet forums are for, to slowly build up our resilience towards valid criticisms and tolerance of dissenting views.<br><br>However, on the issue of Singapore's water spat with Malaysia and the role Singaporeans could play, we are standing on the soapbox and voicing inter-state, rather than intra-state, concerns. By the dissent in our ranks, Malaysia would know what makes us tick and what could cause us to pressure the government to even be more accomodating towards the Malaysians' scam.<br><br>For example, some of us already dislike the idea of drinking Newater. It's a matter of time before Malaysia starts a propaganda drive to hit Singapore on that front like mentioning about the harmful effects of Singapore's Newater in the long term etc. Those who are already on the fence where Newater is concerned might just go along with the Malaysia ploy that we should just pay a bit more for their sweet water as after all, it is merely the price of a plate of char kway teow per 1000 gallons of water, something that Singapoeans can afford anyways.<br><br>Afraid of dissenting views? We all know it depends on the context and a straight yes and no answer would be inappropriate.<br><br>To take a step back, let's look at our own metaarguments here. Both of us have different views on why Singaporeans should have their own mind on the water dispute. Your angle is a civil society one while ours is a flag waving one.<br></div>
