The exhibition is very interesting.<br>The concept 'One reaps what one sows' is the basis of the legend of the Ten Courts of Hell.<br>Each court dishes out different punishments befitting the sins commited in oneÂ’s life.<br>The influence of Confucianism is evident. The punishment for disrespect for the rule of law is more terrifying than that for murder.<br>Examples of punishments meted out for scumbags:<br>1.	For wickedness: Boiled in a cauldron, disemboweled, and put in a volcanic chamber<br>2.	Corruption and greed: Handcuffed and beaten<br>3.	Disrespect to elders: Have your ribs pierced, body grilled, your lungs, heart, liver, intestines and eyes torn out.<br>4.	Violating a Confucian principles or being an unjust official: Have your heart removed, knees crushed and face scraped by a mental instrument<br>5.	Breaking promises: have your lips split<br><br></div>
