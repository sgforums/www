              <h1>8 in 10 HDB flat “owners” find their 99-year leasehold flats “value for money”</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">February 19, 2010</span></p>
              <p>According to a household survey conducted by HDB in 2008, over eight in ten HDB flat owners find their flats “value for money”.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The key reasons quoted are appreciation in value, good location and proximity to facilities.</p>
              <p>About 85 per cent of Singaporeans live in public housing built by government agency HDB which falls under the purview of the National Development Ministry.</p>
              <p><em>“Residents attributed their pride mainly to homeownership as they were proud of their ability to own a flat,”</em> said an HDB statement.</p>
              <p>There is a pervasive public misperception that Singaporeans really “own” their HDB flats.</p>
              <p>The high rate of “home ownership” in Singapore has been used repeatedly by the ruling party to trumpet its own “accomplishments”.</p>
              <p>In reality, Singaporeans are only leasing the flats from HDB for a period of 99 years.</p>
              <p>When one buys a private condominium, one has to sign a “Sales and Purchase” agreement from the developer.</p>
              <p>However, in the case of Build-to-Order flats, the agreement is termed as “Agreement for Lease” which essentially means that one is leasing the flat from HDB. (read more <a href="http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10321p.nsf/w/BuyingNewFlatApplyHDB?OpenDocument"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the flats are subjected to many restrictions not found in the private sector such as an ethnic quota when selling them and a minimum five-year period of residency.</p>
              <p>Another misperception is that the rising prices of flats helps to “create wealth” for Singaporeans, a message drummed home repeatedly by PAP leaders over the years.</p>
              <p>A research done by two NUS professors NUS professors Abeysinghe and Gu Jiaying in 2008 showed clearly that “higher property prices, instead of creating a wealth effect, exert a significant and negative “price effect” on consumption expenditures leading to a fall in the average propensity to consume.” (read article <a rel="nofollow" href="http://temasekreview.com/2009/09/03/debunking-the-hdb-myths-part-3-rising-prices-of-hdb-flats-generate-wealth-for-singaporeans/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>As house prices go up, the increase in the value of housing assets is accompanied by a concurrent rise in the financial liabilities of households, in the form of higher downpayments for purchase of residential properties and burgeoning housing loans.</p>
              <p>Unless one emigrates or downgrades to a smaller flat, there is no way one can unlock the asset value inherent in the flat.</p>
              <p>The prices of HDB flats have skyrocketed in recent years fueled by increasing demand from immigration in the face of limited supply of flats.</p>
              <p>Based on the findings, it appears that many Singaporeans are still unaware of the precarious situation they are in.</p>
              <p>It is strange that they will find their flats “value for money” when they can easily afford a bungalow in Australia, Canada and elsewhere with the kind of money they are paying for them in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Coming back to HDB, this is what I feel. It's a lack of choice in Singapore. Most people have to buy a HDB, and in Singapore, we do not believe in rental (everyone prefers to own). In addition, the property market is artificially controlled by the govt (HDB is used to control the prices in Singapore), therefore they are able to keep the prices high.</p>
              <p>In fact, from my study of the markets in HK, Singapore, UK, Australia, USA, Singapore is the only country where the govt has almost direct control of the market.</p>
              <p>In USA, I am enjoying a huge home with a nice backyard, and driving a sports car. Restaurants prices are more affordable than in Singapore. Groceries are more affordable than in Singapore. It's so much unlike in Singapore, where everything is artificially kept at a high price so much so that it's not worth the $$$ to own.</p>

              <p><br>Such a lifestyle would be clearly unsustainable in Singapore though. And unless the United States really makes an geninue effort(which i doubt) towards sustainable growth, won't last long in the USA either.</p>
              <p>From a environmental perspective i prefer the current urban planning. Concentrate the population and leaving the island's jungles and reservoirs untouched.</p>
              <p>Could you give details to how exactly is prices kept artificially high ? I mean, surely a large amount of food that you buy in the US is growned locally rather than imported, would that have accounted for its cheap price?</p>
