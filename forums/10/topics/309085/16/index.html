              <p>for muhamed to read the quote i quoted. man.. i can't believe he's that delusional to think that just getting rid of the security guard, and hire someone new will make a difference.</p>
              <p>obviously he doesn't know how people influence one another.</p>
              <p>new guy comes in, on the ball, and damn kilat. then he sees his boss slacking, his colleagues slacking. and 1 year later. he's slacking.</p>

              <p>exactment. what really gripes me is how ridiculous it is.</p>
              <p>paid so much, but do so little. if what you say is true. the important jobs are done by the lower managerial positions, shouldn't they be the one being paid more?</p>
              <p>anyway, what i said still applies la. i don't think the minister was on the ball enough. he probably work office hours, with like 20 tea breaks in between, play a little golf, eat a little snack.. read a little email..</p>

              <p>paid so much, but do so little. if what you say is true. the
                  important jobs are done by the lower managerial positions,
                  shouldn't they be the one being paid more?</p>

              <p>no i don't. why do you think people switch to open office, or linux, or anything else that they don't have to pay to get the same thing, or even better for that matter?</p>
              <p>they don't think microsoft deserves the money for coming up with shitty products, when they can get better things for free. free because the people who created them, created them not because of money, but because of the passion.</p>

              <p>ok la. i'm tired of discussing this. i only hope that he gets caught soon. he was apprehended by indonesians right? and coincidently they are asking our govt not to let the indonesian PRs serve NS, maybe now they will extend their service to us, then in return ask that we exempt their people from NS? ok la. i'm being ridiculous now.</p>
              <p>lets hope he gets caught and get slaughtered by the gangs in geylang or in tampines. (police so effecient wor... can catch gangsters..)</p>
