              <p><br>The son after he reaches adulthood, the parents pretty much leave him to his life. he murders someone, he is responsible.</p>
              <p>If the parents grew up teaching the son how to kill, then yes, they should be accountable. (e.g. Anthony Ler case, although it is not a father/son case)</p>
              <p>For WKS, do remember this is not the first time such a thing has happened. Since WKS has been home affairs minister, 3 prominent persons managed to give the system a slip.</p>
              <p>The system had allowed a grille-less window, non-functioning CCTV in a sensitive installation.</p>
              <p>This is a government contract, you dun just call your yellow-page guy to install a CCTV. Director has to submit a proposal, find quotation, and after delivery, submit post-comissioning report...</p>
              <p>if cctv hasn't been working (in an sensitve installation), wouldn't a person in competant authority ask why there is no follow up in the proposal.</p>

Disputing means the police and the judiciary, legislative and executive are all a big lie and we are living a big huge lie.

              <p>Who else in the PORE history manage to escape never caught or escaped longer than abang?  Abang is breaking his own record as the day pass.</p>
              <p>Tell me it does not surprise you that a limper can be undetected for so long in a tiny place?</p>
              <p>If he were  spotted  even once but manage not to get caught, that is at least something. The reality known to us is no one can  even smell abang.</p>
              <p>A mystery.</p>
              <p>So many mysteries.</p>
              <p>TW also got a case mysterious one.</p>
              <p>JFK also mystery never found out why 100% sure.</p>

              <p>I never said WKS is supposed to be blamed or is supposed to be found to be in dereliction of duties.</p>
              <p>I am more astonished by what the committee found. Since 9/11, MHA did a comprehensive review of all govt installations. many of the steps taken was to protect government buildings and restrict access to all government buildings</p>
              <p>one visible step taken was public is no longer allowed to park within a government building.</p>
              <p>But yet we have a detention facility that is so outwardly porous? Again, I would like to mention, this is MHA's third publicised case of escape.</p>
              <p>The committee did find faults in the system. Punishments were meted out.</p>
              <p>But are we told enough ? as much as the secrecy of ISD ops have to remain confidential and we as members of the public  have to have confidence in them, yet such an incident happen.</p>
              <p>And when it happened, we just get the "due process" going and a final "let's move on"</p>
              <p>Its like the NSF who escaped with a rifle, the official word is that he was missing as of 2359. All of us who served NS knew this is just an administrative time.... but yet.. the official word and the pubilc is informed he was missing as of 2359.</p>
              <p>Those who are or were working for civil service knows too, how investigations are "really" carried out.</p>

              <p>I never said WKS is supposed to be blamed or is supposed to be found to be in dereliction of duties.</p>
              <p>I am more astonished by what the committee found. Since 9/11, MHA did a comprehensive review of all govt installations. many of the steps taken was to protect government buildings and restrict access to all government buildings</p>
              <p>one visible step taken was public is no longer allowed to park within a government building.</p>
              <p>But yet we have a detention facility that is so outwardly porous? Again, I would like to mention, this is MHA's third publicised case of escape.</p>
              <p>The committee did find faults in the system. Punishments were meted out.</p>
              <p>But are we told enough ? as much as the secrecy of ISD ops have to remain confidential and we as members of the public  have to have confidence in them, yet such an incident happen.</p>
              <p>And when it happened, we just get the "due process" going and a final "let's move on"</p>
              <p>Its like the NSF who escaped with a rifle, the official word is that he was missing as of 2359. All of us who served NS knew this is just an administrative time.... but yet.. the official word and the pubilc is informed he was missing as of 2359.</p>
              <p>Those who are or were working for civil service knows too, how investigations are "really" carried out.</p>

              <p>Out of desperation, would he not go into a house and blow up the house with readily available gas used for cooking?</p>
              <p>Where are the security patrols? Do you see any related to abang?</p>
              <p>Abang, you are so clever, can go unsmelled and detected by anyone in a tiny little small dot. you seem like moving very little, almost can say completely still, hidding under the ground lying down with the rotten carcasses of the dead animals underground.</p>

              <p>I am getting worried about what happened to Abang, aka Freedom Walker of the 21st century.</p>
              <p>He walked '5000 miles' and may walk how long more ? another '5000 miles'?</p>
              <p>Acturely, I am very the worry.</p>
              <p>I worry, if he indeed is still in the pore, there will always exist a risk to the people.</p>
              <p>I worry also because there is no report to the public what is going on with the search, any progress, found anything, clues etc.</p>
              <p>I worry 'cos my prediction of 6 months or less is nearing its expiry date. In 6 days or less, Abang would have clocked 4 months of escape.</p>
              <p>sigh....lets hope abang returns to his cage soon.</p>

              <p>How do you know he really walked out of the Detention Centre?</p>
              <p>If he really did, how do you know that he is still in Singapore?</p>
              <p>At hand, there are more risk to concern like the price hike in food, petrol and other commodities and not forgeting ERP. These risk are more genuine because it literally affects every single one of us here and nothing is going to stop the hike!</p>
