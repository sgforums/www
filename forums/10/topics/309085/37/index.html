              <p>Excellent point. By law, prisons, lock-up, holding areas, etc are places for confinement. They have to conform to certain standards and different degrees of standards like security checks, security personnel involved, etc. You cannot suka suka build a cell and call it a lock-up. It has to be legally designated a lock-up. In general, prison has the highest standard, lock-up comes next, holding areas, etc.</p>
              <p>I do not think that whitely road detention centre is categorised as a prison; the reason why it is called a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">detention centre</span>.  It does not even have watch-towers for goodness sake.  It is a detention centre which doubles up as a rehabilitation centre under the purview of the ISD. Detainees undergo a rehabilitation process before being released back into public. Detainees are usually political detainees or people with harmful ideologies like communists, religious freaks from all religions, etc.  </p>
              <p>ISD is a division in MHA. Police is another division in MHA. Same with Civil Defence, Prisons, ICA, etc. However, I reckon the Whitely Road security part is purely handled by Gurkhas.</p>

              <p>He did escaped from Indonesian authorities once or twice but the Indonesians saw him in the act of running so he was recaptured. So, please bear in mind that this is not the first time he is doing this.</p>
              <p>He is a hardcore escape artist. He cannot be allowed even a small window of opportunity. A small lapse in judgement is all he needs. So, it would be very wrong to treat him like any other fanatic. Sometimes, you try to give confidence to the relationship between a criminal and yourself in order to take him over to your side. You buy them the food they like. Give them time off to smoke. Talk about thier families. Maybe even let them take a loo break in a loo which is not secure ;) Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not work. And in some cases, it may have disastrous consequences. Risks are high and so are the rewards if they decide to turn around and work for you. Not too sure if that is the case with Selamat.</p>

              <p>it seems like there's a baby face imprinted on it. i speculate it could be that he used some form of black magic to escape. it might sound ridiculous but this is what i observed</p>

              <p>As Singaporeans, we tend to forget that we are in locale which still believe and use the black arts. Do I believe them? Yes. If they charm you, they can walk right past by you and you will notice but will forget immediately later. That was how the sarong indonesian robbers went around robbing houses near Yio Chu Kand and Jalan Kayu wearing just sarongs. In many cases, the occupants were inside the houses when they did thier thing. They told the police and this was reported in the New Paper that they used a magic dust and that wearing sarongs were part of the ritual. Ever encountered someone and you feel very `hot' inside you? Ask the person if he uses a `barang'.</p>

              <p>No country has completely secure borders. Police have even caught an illegal swimming across the strait and using a styrofoam box to hide his head. Problem was the styrofoam box was going against the current so they went to check it out. This kind of stuffs will never appear on your radar.</p>
              <p>But to take a boat and simple speed across the border is not easy. The blockade runs are mostly unsuccessful simply because the PCG have a lot boats commanding small sectors all around the main island. Also, the PCG has cameras ringing the entire main island. Most people would usually dump thier contents in the middle of the sea and ask the illegals to swim themselves to Singapore. Those who can`t swim or swim well will drown.</p>
              <p>Just want to add that Singapore is very secure versus conventional threats. It`s the unconventional and asymmetric ones which are unpredictable.</p>
