            <div class='col-md body'><p><span>SINGAPORE: World police group Interpol has issued an urgent global security alert for Mas Selamat Kastari, the Singapore leader of the Jemaah Islamiyah militant network, who escaped from a Singapore detention centre on Wednesday. <br><br>Interpol posted an Orange Notice, or urgent worldwide security alert, on its website, after a request from Singapore. The Orange Notice means the militant leader's photograph and fingerprints will be issued to each of Interpol's 186 national central bureaus. <br><br>Meanwhile, Singapore continued to search for Mas Selamat who escaped from the Whitley Road Detention Centre on Wednesday afternoon. <br><br>Police officers were seen combing the area along Lornie Road, and around the Caldecott Broadcast Centre. They also put pamphlets in the mailboxes of the low-rise houses along Andrew Road. <br><br>The search team also looked around the cemetery on Sime Road. <br><br>Earlier the Home Affairs Ministry said security has been tightened at all places and buildings in the vicinity of where he might have escaped to or could be hiding. <br><br>The Ministry was responding to a query from Channel NewsAsia on whether security personnel have pulled out from the Whitley Road area where the search for Mas Selamat had centred. <br><br>The fugitive walks with a limp and is not known to be armed. <br><br>Photos of Mas Selamat, both clean-shaven and with a beard, have been released by officials who are appealing to the public to come forward if they have information on the fugitive's whereabouts. They can contact the Police at 999. - CNA/ir <br></span></p></div>

              <p>One good thing about mainstream media being controlled by the state, is that when the regime screws up, the media will not criticise and instead play down the incident, so no pressure on the minister to resign.</p>

              <p><strong>... a very good question asked... but don't expect a REAL answer...</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>=========================================</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Why a lapse of four hours before public was notified?<br>Posted by theonlinecitizen on February 29, 2008</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Straits Times Forum Page.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear Sir,</p>
              <p>The escape of Mas Selamat, and the subsequent response to the escape, has raised many queries. However, I would just like to touch on one sore point that struck me immediately upon hearing the news.</p>
              <p>Why was there a lapse of 4 hours between his escape and the notification to the public? Remember the area is surrounded by houses and schools.</p>
              <p>I would like to quote Mr. Wong Kan Seng. During parliament, Mr Wong replied: “Our security agencies assessed at the time of Mas Selamat’s escape there was no imminent danger to the public. The focus then was to lock down the Whitley Road Dention Centre and then start a systematic operation to find and arrest him. The priority is to arrest him. No efforts will be spared to track him down.”</p>
              <p><br>Mr Wong added: “The picture of Mas Selamat is splashed all over the country. Look out for him and if there is any information of anyone that looks like him, report the case to the police and you can be sure the police will look into it thoroughly.”</p>
              <p>What a disappointing answer!</p>
              <p>Are there techniques that can accurately predict the behaviour of a person? Can the authorities be certain that Mas Selamat, a desperate terrorist on the run, will not harm the public? What then has changed over the period of 4 hours? Why is the public’s help being sought now, and not from the very start?</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat would understandably be desperate and feeling the heat. A simple, plausible scenario where Mas Selamat had limped to a nearby road and approached an unknowing member of the public to borrow a hand phone to contact his accomplice. Within an hour, Mas Selamat could’ve been anywhere in Singapore! Furthermore, we can only count ourselves lucky that he did not hijack a car, or take a hostage in his bid for freedom. Any number of people could’ve been injured or killed if that had happened.</p>
              <p>Why wasn’t the public notified immediately?</p>
              <p>I believe both such scenarios could have possibly been prevented by alerting the public to his escape and placing them on alert. Remember his limp would have made him easy to spot.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the area is bound by busy roads and residential areas. I dare say many motorists listen to the radio while driving. Would an immediate radio broadcast through all stations helped? Perhaps one of the drivers would have noticed something. Could immediate news bulletins through various avenues like TV Mobile, or SMS alerted the people?</p>
              <p>Once again, why was there a gap of four hours? Did the authorities think that the public will riot in panic and fear if we found out about the escape? Well, the answer is all around you. Are we panicking? Or are we keeping our eyes peeled for a man with a limp?</p>
              <p>All this has led me to one conclusion: that the authorities were hoping to apprehend him without alerting the public. It seems that the public was only alerted when the authorities recognized the fact that Mas Selamat could not be apprehended any time soon.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">And this leads us to perhaps the most important question of all: If Mas Selamat had been apprehended within the four hours, would this have been reported and made known to the public at all?<br></span></p>

              <p>what I find thats irritating is the media reports - notice they only report positive reactions of the police still having public faith etc and not the part that many people, from the ones I spoke to, are really angered at how something like this can happen in the first place, who's to blame? during coffee breaks, many have said that  the minister should take repsonsibilty. what's the point in paying someone so much money? and we're talking 2 million by the way. if singapore is a corporate company (they have compared singapore to one - espeically when it comes to their salaries and how their pays have been benchmarked to CEOs and COOs) the company would have fired the guy already - most of us would know that!</p>
              <p>looks like its another case of - 'lets sweep this under the carpet and hope for the best and speak to media to ask to report only positive reports and no gorvernment criticism of any sorts'. this is rather scary. the shit hits the fan - let just say 'sorry it has happened' and get on with our money making. we are talking about a terrorist here, not just some loan shark or drug abuser that got away!
