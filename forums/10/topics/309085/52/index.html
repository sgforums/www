              <h3><a title="Permanent Link to Escape Of Mas Selamat" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wp.sg/wordpress/?p=69">Escape Of
                                      Mas Selamat</a></h3>
              <div>
              <p>Two weeks have elapsed since the escape of Mas Selamat Kastari
                                      from the Whitley Road Centre.</p>
              <p>Since the occurrence, the immediate priority has rightly been
                                      placed on his recapture. Our security forces have been hard at work
                                      in an island-wide manhunt, and Singaporeans too have put up with
                                      various inconveniences at checkpoints and other areas to facilitate
                                      this massive operation.</p>
              <p>Many questions have been raised about how this incident could
                                      have taken place in a country which prides itself on safety and
                                      security. In seeking to reassure Singaporeans, the Minister for
                                      Home Affairs has established a Committee of Inquiry under the
                                      Prisons Act “to discover how the escape occurred and to recommend
                                      appropriate actions to prevent such an incident from occurring
                                      again”. (MHA letter to media dated 7 Mar 08).</p>
              <p>As Whitley Road Centre is gazetted by law as a prison, the
                                      government’s decision to convene the inquiry under the Prisons Act
                                      is not wrong. The problem is that the Prisons Act states that such
                                      inquiries shall not be open to the public. The Committee will
                                      submit its report to the Minister, and no part of the proceedings
                                      may be released to anyone except with the Minister’s written
                                      permission.</p>
              <p>This raises important questions as to how much the public will
                                      eventually be told, since the Minister retains the discretion to
                                      release the findings as he sees fit. In a matter of such high
                                      public interest as the escape of a high-risk terror suspect from a
                                      government-run facility, what assurances or checks are there that
                                      the public will be given full information? In the interest of
                                      transparency, other governments have conducted public hearings into
                                      sensitive matters such as intelligence failures.</p>
              <p>One option is for the President to appoint a Commission of
                                      Inquiry under the Inquiries Act. He can do so when he considers
                                      that having a Commission to inquire into any matter would be for
                                      the public welfare or in the public interest. This regime will
                                      allow the inquiry to proceed in public as the President shall
                                      direct. If there is concern that release of certain sensitive
                                      information will jeopardize the national interest, the President
                                      may direct that certain information not be made public.</p>
              <p>Moreover, since Singaporeans have been marshalled to assist the
                                      authorities to hunt for Mas Selamat, the least the government could
                                      do is to keep us fully informed of the inquiry and its
                                      findings.</p>

                                      Party on Tuesday urged the Government to keep the public fully
                                      informed of the committee of inquiry's (COI) probe into the escape
                                      of terrorist Mas Selamat Kastari, who has been on the run since Feb
                                      27.</p>
              <p>It said that as the inquiry is being carried out under the
                                      Prisons Act, which means that the Home Affairs Minister retains the
                                      discretion ot release the committee's finds as he sees fit, this
                                      raises the question 'as to how much the public will eventually be
                                      told.'</p>
              <p>Said the party chairman Sylvia Lim in a statement: 'In a matter
                                      of such high public interest as the escape of a high-risk terror
                                      suspect from a government-run facility, what assurances or checks
                                      are there that the public will be given full information?'</p>
              <p>'Moreover, since Singaporeans have been marshalled to assist the
                                      authorities to hunt for Mas Selamat, the least the government could
                                      do is to keep us fully informed of the inquiry and its findings,'
                                      she added, noting the huge security forces involved in the
                                      island-wide manhunt, and the various inconveniences at checkpoints
                                      and other areas which Singaporeans have to put up with to
                                      facilitiate the massive operation.</p>
              <p>Ms Lim, who is a Non-constituency MP, said many questions have
                                      been raised about how the escape could have taken place 'in a
                                      country which prides itself on safety and security.'</p>
              <p>While it is not wrong for the government to convene the
                                      three-member inquiry, headed by retired judge Goh Joon Seng, under
                                      the Prisons Act, the opposition leader noted that such inquiries
                                      are not open to the public.</p>
              <p>&lt;!-- show media links starting at 7th para --&gt; 'The
                                      Committee will submit its report to the Minister, and no part of
                                      the proceedings may be released to anyone except with the
                                      Minister's written permission,' she said.</p>
              <p>She suggested an alternative option: a COI appointed by the
                                      President under the Inquiries Act in the interest of public welfare
                                      or public interest.</p>
              <p>'This regime will allow the inquiry to proceed in public as the
                                      President shall direct. If there is concern that release of certain
                                      sensitive information will jeopardise the national interest, the
                                      President may direct that certain information not be made public,'
                                      she said.</p>
              <p>Separately, the Criminal Investigation Department is also
                                      looking into whether criminal wrong-doing was involved in the
                                      break-out of the leader of the Singapore Jemaah Islamiah (JI)
                                      terror network from the Whitley Road Detention Centre.</p>
              <p>Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng has said that there was a
                                      'physical breach' and 'security lapse' at the detention centre's
                                      compound, which has since been plugged.</p>
              <p>The panel, which will also recommend changes to prevent similar
                                      break-outs, is expected to complete the review in a month. The
                                      other two committee members are retired police commissioner Tee Tua
                                      Ba and deputy secretary for security and corporate services Dr

              <p>&lt;!-- story content : start --&gt; THE opposition Workers'
                                      Party (WP) has called for an alternative panel to be set up by the
                                      President to look into the escape of terrorist Mas Selamat
                                      Kastari.</p>
              <p>Instead of the committee that was set up by Deputy Prime
                                      Minister and Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng, the WP proposed
                                      yesterday that President S R Nathan appoint a Commission of Inquiry
                                      under the Inquiries Act so that investigations 'can proceed in
                                      public as the President shall direct'.</p>
              <p>In a press statement signed by chairman Sylvia Lim, the WP noted
                                      that Mr Wong's Committee of Inquiry is being set up under the
                                      Prisons Act.</p>
              <p>This is not wrong, since the Whitley Road Detention Centre is
                                      considered a prison under this law, said Ms Lim.</p>
              <p>However, she pointed out: 'The Prisons Act states that such
                                      inquiries shall not be open to the public. The Committee will
                                      submit its report to the Minister, and no part of the proceedings
                                      may be released to anyone except with the Minister's written
                                      permission.</p>
              <p>'This raises important questions as to how much the public will
                                      eventually be told, since the Minister retains the discretion to
                                      release the findings as he sees fit.'</p>

                                      has stated that after the Committee of Inquiry completes its
                                      inquiry, we will give a full account to the public on how Mas
                                      Selamat escaped and what has been done to tighten security to
                                      prevent such a thing from happening again.'<br> <strong>HOME AFFAIRS MINISTRY SPOKESMAN, in response to The Straits
                                      Times yesterday</strong></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>As announced by the government, the independent committee is
                                      headed by former High Court judge Goh Joon Seng and will look into
                                      how Mas Selamat, 47, broke out of the detention centre a fortnight
                                      ago and recommend changes to prevent similar breakouts.</p>
              <p>'In a matter of such high public interest as the escape of a
                                      high-risk terror suspect from a government-run facility, what
                                      assurances or checks are there that the public will be given full
                                      information?' asked Ms Lim, who is also a Non-Constituency MP.</p>
              <p>'In the interest of transparency, other governments have
                                      conducted public hearings into sensitive matters such as
                                      intelligence failures.'</p>
              <p>Since Independence, seven Commissions of Inquiry have been
                                      formed, including one on the Sentosa cable car accident in 1983 and
                                      another on the Hotel New World collapse in 1986.</p>
              <p>In recommending that the President appoint a commission of
                                      inquiry under the Inquiries Act, Ms Lim noted that this would
                                      'allow the inquiry to proceed in public as the President shall
                                      direct'.</p>
              <p>'If there is concern that release of certain sensitive
                                      information will jeopardize the national interest, the President
                                      may direct that certain information not be made public,' she
                                      added.</p>
              <p>She asserted: 'Since Singaporeans have been marshalled to assist
                                      the authorities to hunt for Mas Selamat, the least the Government
                                      could do is to keep us fully informed of the inquiry and its
                                      findings.'</p>
              <p>But Ms Lim also gave credit to the security forces, saying they
                                      have been 'hard at work in an island-wide manhunt' and that the
                                      immediate priority has 'rightly' been placed on Mas Selamat's
                                      recapture.</p>

              <p>LEONG WEE KEAT<br> weekeat@mediacorp.com.sg</p>
              <p>THE Workers’ Party (WP) is<br> urging the President to appoint<br> a Commission of Inquiry to look<br> into the escape of detained Jemaah<br> Islamiyah leader Mas Selamat<br> Kastari, instead of the<br> committee appointed for that<br> purpose by the Minister for<br> Home Affairs.<br> P a r t y<br> c h a i r m a n<br> Sylvia Lim<br> noted that<br> under the Inquiries<br> Act — a<br> new law<br> passed last<br> September —<br> the President<br> of Singapore<br> can appoint a<br> Commission<br> to look into<br> any matter<br> “for the public<br> welfare or in the public interest”.<br> He can also direct that the inquiry<br> “proceed in public”.<br> Her party’s concern is that<br> the current Committee of Inquiry,<br> as established under the<br> Prisons Act, allows the Minister<br> to “retain the discretion to release<br> the findings as he sees fit”.<br> “The problem is that the<br> Prisons Act states that such inquiries<br> shall not be open to the<br> public … This raises important<br> questions as to how much the<br> public will eventually be told,”<br> Ms Lim said in a statement,<br> even as she noted that it was<br> technically “not wrong” to convene<br> the inquiry under the Prisons<br> Act since the Whitley Road<br> Detention Centre — from which<br> Mas Selamat escaped on Feb 27<br> — is gazetted as a prison.<br> The current committee is<br> headed by retired High Court<br> judge Goh Joon Seng, with former<br> Police Commissioner Tee<br> Tua Ba and the Home Affairs<br> Ministry’s deputy secretary for<br> security and corporate services,<br> Dr Choong May Ling, on board.<br> In response, a Ministry of<br> Home Affairs spokesperson said<br> that Deputy<br> Prime Minister<br> and Home<br> Affairs Minister<br> Wong Kan<br> Seng has stated<br> that “after<br> the Committee<br> of Inquiry<br> completes its<br> inquiry, we will<br> give a full account<br> to the<br> public on how<br> Mas Selamat<br> escaped and<br> what has been<br> done to tighten security to prevent<br> such a thing from happening<br> again”.<br> Pointing out that the escape<br> of a “high-risk terror suspect”<br> was a matter of “high public<br> interest”, Ms Lim, who is a<br> Non-Constituency Member of<br> Parliament, said that if the concern<br> was that “release of certain<br> sensitive information will jeopardise<br> the national interest”,<br> the Inquiries Act allows the<br> President to direct that such<br> facts not be made public.<br> Ms Lim added that “since<br> Singaporeans have been marshalled<br> to assist the authorities<br> to hunt for Mas Selamat, the<br> least the Government could do<br> is to keep us fully informed of<br> the inquiry and its findings”.</p>

              <p>I think our dear friend is probably hidden by some sympathisers out there getting drinks/food for him daily.  The govt should come up with a reward that does not make use of the tax-payer's monies.  $ will act as a push-factor to those sympathisers who are sitting on the fence, particularly a 7-figure sum.  Motivating some informers or betrayals will be the best bet to find him.</p>

              <p>To get this amount, probably as an out-of-the-box method, Mr Wong could suggest a way to motivate/mobilise all the ministers to donate a portion of their pay increment for the month into a "Find Mas Selamat Reward Fund".  I believe this could easily add up to a 7 figure sum?</p>

              <p><strong>... this is SO ANNOYING.!</strong></p>
              <p>.. I don't know to believe this news article or not...</p>
              <p>... could well be further attempt to enforce public believes that MSK is still alive...</p>
              <p>... perosnally, I now think MSK's dead - long before February...</p>
              <p><strong>======================</strong></p>
              <p><strong>'I think I saw Mas Selamat'</strong> <br> <br>A FORTY-YEAR-OLD mother of three was on her way home from work the afternoon Mas Selamat Kastari escaped from the Whitley Road Detention Centre when she spotted a limping man along Thomson Road.</p>
              <p>She was on Mount Pleasant Road, a short distance from the detention centre, when she saw him approach a stranger.</p>
              <p>Although she saw him on Feb 27, it was not until three days later that she realised he might have been the fugitive Jemaah Islamiah leader.</p>
              <p><br>A lecturer in communication skills, she said it was a report in this newspaper that prompted her to call the police. She asked not to be named.</p>
              <p>This is what she told YEO GHIM LAY and CHONG CHEE KIN:</p>
              <p>'I had just finished my work that day and was heading back to my home in Bishan. I work in Stevens Road and usually knock off at about 4.30pm to 4.45pm.</p>
              <p>I was at Mount Pleasant Road and waiting to turn into Thomson Road when I had to stop at the junction. That was about 5pm.</p>
              <p>I saw a Malay man on the other side of Thomson Road, walking on the pavement against the flow of traffic on that side.</p>
              <p>He was walking towards the bus-stop in front of the St Joseph's Institution (SJI) International school.</p>
              <p>He had a limp in his left leg. He was dressed in some sort of brown or beige outfit which looked like a T-shirt. He was a little on the plump side, but not fat, and wasn't very tall. He looked very similar to the description they released later of Mas Selamat.</p>
              <p>He didn't look well dressed - he was very scruffy, like a vagrant.</p>
              <p>There was a Chinese woman dressed all in white walking on the pavement towards him and she was talking on her mobile phone.</p>
              <p>When they came towards each other, he held out his hand, looking like he was asking for money, but she ignored him.</p>
              <p>I stayed to watch because I was worried he might do something to the woman.</p>
              <p>But then he started crossing the road. There wasn't a pedestrian crossing, and he put up his hand to ask the approaching motorists to let him pass.</p>
              <p>He stopped at the middle of the road, where there was a barricade. He was facing me then, and I could see his face from the front.</p>
              <p>He looked very disoriented, very dishevelled, like he was in a daze. He didn't look like he knew where he was going, or like he was looking for someone.</p>
              <p>All this took a few minutes and I had to move off because there was a car behind me.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure where the man went after that.</p>
              <p>It didn't occur to me at the time that this could have been the terrorist who escaped, because the news didn't come out until that evening.</p>
              <p>I only realised that he might have been Mas Selamat on Saturday morning, when I read in The Straits Times about a similar possible sighting near the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped in Toa Payoh Rise, just down the road from where I had been.</p>
              <p>There was a side profile picture in the papers, and it looked like him. He wasn't clean shaven, had a beard, and looked scruffy.</p>
              <p>I called the police. That afternoon an investigating officer met me and took me to the place. I showed the officer where I saw the man.</p>
              <p>If the man I saw was Mas Selamat, it didn't look like it was a planned escape. He didn't look like he was waiting for someone to pick him up.'</p>
              <p><strong>==========================================================================</strong></p>
              <p>Finally, after D+16 following the escape - some solid confirmation of the direction that MSK took after escaping from the Whitley Detention Centre.</p>
              <p>Considering that the Detention Centre is at the far end of the ex-Police Academy - almost directly opposite the St. Joseph International - it is remarkable to note the difference is performance between MSK and the leadership's thinking faculties employed to recapture him.</p>
              <p>Its approximate location can be described as follows - if one start from the main entrance of the ex-Police Academy {at the slip road from the PIE to Thomson Road}, and scan across the huge Parade Square that is parallel to the PIE [Whitley to Jalan Toa Payoh], then one can spot an old style Government type Primary School building, that sit non-descript at the end of the Parade Square, and shielded by a clump of trees.</p>
              <p>Its main entrance seems to be from the Mount Pleasant side - nearer to the slip road where one drive from Stevens Road into the PIE towards Jalan Toa Payoh.</p>
              <p>From this Thursday Straits Times news article, it is remarkable the speed that a limping man has taken in escaping from the Detention Centre - and surely reflects the determination of an escapee in getting as far away as possible within the limited time.</p>
              <p>MSK escape was discovered at 04.05PM and this lady lecturer reported spotting MSK at Thomson Road at about 04.30PM. - it is amazing that the Authorities at the Detention Centre did not cordon off a wider area immediately after the discovery of the escape.</p>
              <p>Almost 20 hours later, during the next morning - the area bounded by Whitley-PIE, Chancery Lane and Dunearn Road was cordoned off and a search was made - which was in the opposite direction and far away from MSK's last spotted location at Thomson Road-Mount Pleasant Road junction.</p>
              <p>This new information released in this Thursday edition of the Straits Times surely will reveal the inability of those in the leadership position of the Detention Centre in acting faster to track down MSK, and it surely reveals a narrow mentality in continuing to doubt MSK's ability.</p>
              <p>From where the Detention Centre is supposed to be till he was spotted by the reported lady lecturer - it is a distance of almost 1.5 km - it is not difficult even for a limping and desparate MSK to cover this distance in about 25 minutes.</p>
              <p>The refusal of the Home Affairs Ministry in making a general public announcement over Radio and TV immediately after the escape - until almost 6 hours later - surely must have undermined the efforts to recapture him. Detailed but very brief information of the escape was further made available only as the days went by without MSK being found.</p>
              <p>Now that a member of the public has seen MSK on the loose - at least we know that he is not dead in captivity - and with his immediate and larger family all being under close watch, he can only depend on some old contacts for help, or he will have to take refuge in lorry parks, or in the shrubs under the express ways and bridges, or in some abandoned, or unused, or seldom used buildings.</p>
              <p>He can only move around at night - under cover of darkness.</p>
              <p>The police will need to intensify neighborhood patrol at night - visiting neighborhood markets, food centres, and lorry parks - where he can spend the night.</p>
              <p>They should check out the thick shrub, which makes great cover for MSK - as much as it makes Singapore into a famous Garden City.</p>

              i second your idea. But think we can call it "Gold (Mas in Malay means gold) Hunting Reward" as everyone will be motivated to go gold hunting. The initial amount of the reward can be WKS's pay for Mar 2008 and for every month that Mas is not found WKS will have to give up his salary for the reward.

              <p>Would you rather have mas selamat on the run or would you prefer to have MS surrender himself to the authority?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only way to get MS surrender himself it to give him a chance to renew himself. His is human too you know..we all make mistake</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not suggesting we should forgive what he has done, but rather give him an opportunity to serve his sentence and be a free man.</p>

              <p>If MAS is the type that is able to respond to reform and re-education efforts - he would not have made a break for freedom.</p>
              <p>He is the hardcore diehard believer in his chosen path of political ideals, and will never be subjected to change.</p>
              <p>Do you believe that diehards like the infamous Osama Bin Laden, and the Indonesian Cleric Abu Bakar Bashir can be so easily indoctrinated with new social and political values ?</p>
              <p>These are the guys who will inspire and indoctrinate their new political idea of a religious empire onto anyone whom they can awe and subject to their own values and control in the interpretation of their Religious-Political Philosophies.</p>
              <p>These are the guys who will want to usurp the reins of political power by the back door - not through personal merit as in some meritocratic society - but through the control and agitation of emotional and psychological - religious fervor.</p>
              <p>Can we negotiate or reason with a person whose mind is closed, and is dedicated only to a chosen cause ?</p>

              <p>so, was any explanation given to how he escaped , what method, what was the flaw if any and did he escaped on his own and without any premeditation or plan or  just by chance or purely good luck or no one got any idea? it just happened and what then to do ?</p>
              <p>its been over 2 weeks, but I am still confident in 6 months or less, he will be caught given our men and women in uniforms and non-uniforms are so talented.</p>
              <p>I also don't mind we advertise to the whole world for  talents who can find out the above answers, if none of any of those i asked can be answered.</p>
              <p>see, this is the kind of talent we should embrace and talk about.  common skills ones, easy to train.</p>
              <p>If more and more shun IT jobs given the cost competitiveness and the great abundance of supply and the highered like never before cost of living and the high stress and long hours and low quality of life, how many want to work in IT till 85?</p>
              <p>If less locals go into IT, means more foreigners are needed in addition to status quo. wow, its good to be a businessman when you control the market and labor cost continues to be on the low or goes lower.</p>
              <p>as for employees, well, they asked for it. if u know wtf i really mean.</p>

              <p>was any image or video captured at all?</p>
              <p>was there secruity guards watching the monitor of online surveillance at the time?</p>
              <p>If they saw mas escaping, they would have screamed right?</p>
              <p>If they did not, was there any sensor to detect motion?</p>
              <p>If they did, was there anything done about it?</p>
              <p>If they did not and there is video footage, can CNA broadcast it?</p>
              <p>when it comes to anti-terrorism, transparency is key. critical info should be disseminated to the masses.</p>
              <p>As of today , greennich meantime, I have no idea :</p>
              <p>1. how he escaped,</p>
              <p>2. is he REALLY still in sgpore? likewise, can also ask, is he REALLY not in sgpore?</p>
              <p>3. any video? If have say have, no release is still better than not to say anything. The public may feel anxious.</p>
              <p>4. any clues? any witnesses? any thing at all?</p>
              <p>5. is there security breach on the part of our talented people?</p>
              <p>6. what is the status? progress? report?</p>
              <p>7. how safe are we given a JI terrorist leader is on the LOOSE?</p>
              <p>8. what precaution should sgpore and citizens take?</p>
              <p>9. What is the estimated time of capture?</p>
              <p>10. is it impossible to capture even if he is still inside the island?</p>
              <p>personally, I am confident he will be captured soon. but as always, I am curious to know, and so too are many, i assume. </p>

              <p>For me what surprised me is......that he had the desire to run.</p>
              <p>It means....</p>
              <p>The security people had not broken his will.</p>
              <p>I think they should.</p>
              <p>I mean, prison, the whole concept is to re-form right..?</p>
              <p>And, terrorists, are people who have strong ideological beliefs, right?</p>
              <p>So I think it is legitimate, that terrorists have to be given a strong mental re-education. Much much stronger than common criminals who dont have any ideological reason for carrying their acts.</p>
              <p>A special program must be designed. I think they must have known some already.  The police, or the intelligence, they must have known how to break people, including for extreme cases like the mind of a terrorist.</p>
              <p>So what surprised me, is not only the lack of security at that prison, but also, lack of success in this regard, mental re-education.</p>
              <p>They must apply a much stronger program.</p>

              <p>this is from wikipedia's article on "Ninja"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"<strong>The predecessors of Japan's ninja were so-called rebels favoring Buddhism who fled into the mountains near Kyoto as early as the 7th century A.D. to escape religious persecution and death at the hands of imperial forces</strong>."<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference">[6]</sup></p>

              <p>Intonjutsu is the Ninja art of "disappearing" and 
                                  comprises various walking and stealth techniques such as <strong>Gotonpo</strong> (hiding knowing, using the five elements concepts), and <strong>Shinobi-Aruki </strong>(silent movement steps and leaps). Ninjas were experts 
                                  in adapting and improvising in any situation the natural environment 
                                  advantages, such as water flows, trees branches, or any natural 
                                  obstacle. Combined with the attention-distracting techniques, 
                                  with disguise or even taijutsu, and based on a deep understanding 
                                  of all the 5 nature basic elements, such techniques assured 
                                  Ninjas all the "ingredients" to conceal or escape 
                                  from difficult situations.</p>
