              <h1 class="clr">Committee of Inquiry’s report will be useful for other countries too</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The final report by the Committee of Inquiry, set up to
              investigate the escape of Jemaah Islamiyah leader, Mas Selamat Kastari,
              will serve as critical knowledge for other countries as well.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat escaped last Wednesday from the Whitley Road Detention Centre.</p>
              <p>He
              has been held under the Internal Security Act since 2006, as he had
              allegedly plotted to crash a hijacked plane into Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng announced the formation of the independent committee on 2 March.</p>
              <p>The committee will likely submit a report in a month or so.</p>
              <p>Retired Judge, Goh Joon Seng heads the 3—member panel.</p>
              <p>Also
              on the panel — former Commissioner of Police, Tee Tua Ba and Deputy
              Secretary of Security at the Home Affairs Ministry, Choong May Ling.</p>
              <p>Experts said this is an authoritative panel and the members are logical choices.</p>
              <p>They
              noted that the retired judge would be able to address legal issues,
              while the ex—police chief will have knowledge about law enforcement.</p>
              <p>Experts
              said the committee will likely study areas like how he managed to
              escape from the detention facility, the initial moments when he
              disappeared and the centre’s security infrastructure.</p>
              <p>The panel will also likely make recommendations on how to prevent such an incident from happening again.</p>
              <p>Experts
              also added that other countries would read this final report closely to
              compare it with their present security practices.</p>
              <p>Using that report, other regional authorities can tighten their own detention procedures.</p>
              <p>Associate
              Professor Kumar Ramakrishna, member of the Head Centre for Excellence
              for National Security at the S Rajaratnam School of International
              Studies, said: "The importance of providing such an authoritative
              analysis and investigation would be certainly to provide what would
              amount to the definitive view and official view on the subject of this
              detainee’s escape.</p>
              <p>“It also would help to quash a lot of public speculation and answer a lot of questions which may be in people’s minds.“</p>
              <p>He
              added: “I think the commission’s work will be very important and useful
              to not just within the government but to analysts outside, as well as
              to our counterparts in the region as well.”</p>
              <p>In another development, authorities in Johor are assisting Singapore to track down Mas Selamat.</p>
              <p>Johor’s
              Police Chief, Mokhtar Shariff said his department has distributed
              photos and details of the wanted man, to its personnel manning all the
              entry points in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>He added that the Malaysian law enforcement officers have also "been instructed to arrest the fugitive on sight."</p>
              <p>The Police Chief said that “Singapore had made an official request for assistance from Johor."</p>
              <p>INTERPOL,
              the world’s largest police organisation, has already elevated a
              security notice on Mas Selamat to Red Notice, with an arrest warrant.
