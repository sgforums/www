              <p>Actually...IMHO, terrorism is simply using fear to make a point about something. Its purpose, is similar to war which is the continuance of diplomacy by other means. However, its true purpose like war is to serve itself.</p>
              <p>It would be prudent to actually strengthen and make critical emergency infrastructures such as the SCDF camps and various public and private hospitals hard targets now. Imagine having your civil emergency resources taken out...you got your armed forces and law enforcement agencies but you can do jack-shit.</p>

              <p>An urgent worldwide security alert, or Orange Notice, has been issued by INTERPOL after the escape of an alleged leader of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist group from a jail in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat bin Kastari escaped from the Whitley Road Detention Centre on Wednesday 27 February where he was being held following his deportation from Indonesia to Singapore in February 2006.</p>
              <p>Following a request from Singapore, INTERPOL issued the Orange Notice - which includes Kastari’s photograph and fingerprints, essential elements to help law enforcement officers in their search and eventual verification of his identity when located and arrested – to each of its <a href="/Public/Icpo/Members/default.asp"><span style="color: #0000ff;">186 National Central Bureaus</span></a> (NCBs).</p>
              <p>“Singapore is clearly doing all that it can on a national level to locate this fugitive and through issuing an Orange Notice, INTERPOL and all of its member countries can support these efforts on an international scale,” said Executive Director of Police Services Jean-Michel Louboutin.</p>
              <p>The Orange Notice was originally created to warn police, public entities and other international organizations of potential threats related to disguised weapons, explosives and other dangerous materials; however it can also be issued by INTERPOL’s General Secretariat in Lyon, France for any act or event which poses a risk to the safety and security of citizens around the world.</p>

              <p>imo its the usual tidak apa attitude of the police n all, i m sure they
              must have asked the same qtn as us (look at wks face when he spoke in parliment) and thinking "how can a limping man get so far,
              he must still be in the detention centre". perhaps tats why there wasnt
              any public announcement until 4hrs after the event. they must also have
              expected he wud b caught soon hence without a news release, thing wud
              hv bn easier to cover up. but then...<br><br>from watching the news, u
              dun see any dog unit being used to search. they cordon off the area
              where sji, scgs is... watever for? frm the detention ctr, its much
              easier to move into bkt brown cemetery n frm there cross over to
              macritchie. frm macritchie, its a simple trek to bkt timah, mandai,
              sembawang, yishun which is all either near to the chk pt or opposite
              the malaysian coastline. a short swim across n he will be in malaysia.
              with all the malaysian police there concentrating on the election, how
              will they be able to spare policemen to search for a limping malay man
              in a sea of other malay men?<br><br>moving up north to kelantan, he
              will def b able to hide amongst all the sympathetic pas folks there or
              maybe even cross over to pattani in thailand. once he is off this
              island, he is gone. unless he does something silly like going to a
              mosque for friday prayers n then being recognized. :)</p>

Maybe he hasn't even visited the Whitley Detention Centre in all his terms, <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> perhaps he was busy playing golf with his P4P buddies, no time to visit Whitley Detention Centre.</p>

              <p>The escape is probably planned. When his family came to visit him, it was the signal to tell him to escape. Another friend of his is already parking his car outside, waiting for his escape. And since the JI leader escaped, he probably ran to the car and the car zoom off to that friend's house. Right now, the JI leader must probably be having a feast at his friend's HDB house while watching the news and laughing at the Singapore police and SAF.</p>
              <p>With his friends buying all the food for him, he probably just needs to stay indoor and plan the next step via internet.</p>
