              <p>Hahah...yeah think the Singapore gahman will scale down...(based on report..)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reasons:</p>
              <p>1. The jam at Causeway has already invoke the furor of the Sin-M'sia peeps...now everyone wants to stone him to 7th heaven...</p>
              <p>2. The ciggies trafficking warlords have secretly issused a bounty for Mas's head (above the shoulder) because the heightened security has drastically affected the sales of smuggling of ciggies and other contrabands.</p>
              <p>Once again, our gahman is so smart...indirectly getting citizens and neighbours to work without raising any bounty for Mas head (above shoulder!!) and killing multiple birds with one Mas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the side effect:</p>
              <p>By purposely leaving Mas in the jungle, the habitat of  the monkey kingdom is now being threatened. More monkeys are forced to enter people's home in search of food because Mas has wipe out most of the berries in Bukit Timah, MacRitchie and the Pierce reserviors. This result in AVA having to loan out more monkey traps to homes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My question is: could the 'monkey' be Mas??? Stealing food from homes????</p>

              <p>An UnDeniable truth. What can I do but to count the days abang went on hike around the island?</p>
              <p>I only felt better after realising that abang has woken up all poreans to the truth.</p>
              <p>i am sure wkss will make right what was done wrong.</p>
              <p>without security,  no need to talk about :</p>
              <p>1. world record pay.</p>
              <p>2. world class airport</p>
              <p>3. world class education.</p>
              <p>4. world class sea port.</p>
              <p>5. world class tourism port.</p>
              <p>6. world class sgpore eye.</p>
              <p>7. world class F1.</p>
              <p>8. world class trade</p>
              <p>9. world class economy</p>
              <p>10. world class medical hub.</p>
              <p>without a ROBUST and proven security,</p>
              <p>sgpore is at risk of an ATTACK from any country or guerilla forces or platoon of commandos or snipers or assassins.</p>
              <p>1 life is too many.</p>
              <p>Lets do put in our effort to make this system strong from weak.</p>
              <p>to do this, I propose:</p>
              <p>1. sgporeans voice up more .  If only security is made a concern, weaknesses exposed earlier, abang could not have escaped. sgporeans are accountable just like our leaders who are so so accountable that i cannot describe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.  listen to less of crass 90 fm for the very one-kind of news. the king who wore a transparent invisible shirt did not end up well nor was he wise king.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. we need a stronger voice to represent the PEOPLE to keep our security people on their toes at ALL TIMES.  More pressure is good : people work longer and at the same salary. productivity goes up. can work till 65 or 85.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. the pore should re-think its handling of influx of foreigners.  Can the pore detect who is doing bad things to the pore?  so easy to come and go here. too easy. How robust is the securing of sgpore? I mean Really, no based on impression.  this case proved somethings. I expect no more repeated security flaws and weakness. Who is RESPONSIBLE ultimately? no one?</p>

              <p>i am sure wkss will make right what was done wrong.</p>
              <p>without security,  no need to talk about :</p>
              <p>1. world record pay.</p>
              <p>2. world class airport</p>
              <p>3. world class education.</p>
              <p>4. world class sea port.</p>
              <p>5. world class tourism port.</p>
              <p>6. world class sgpore eye.</p>
              <p>7. world class F1.</p>
              <p>8. world class trade</p>
              <p>9. world class economy</p>
              <p>10. world class medical hub.</p>
              <p>without a ROBUST and proven security,</p>
              <p>sgpore is at risk of an ATTACK from any country or guerilla forces or platoon of commandos or snipers or assassins.</p>
              <p>1 life is too many.</p>
              <p>Lets do put in our effort to make this system strong from weak.</p>
              <p>to do this, I propose:</p>
              <p>1. sgporeans voice up more .  If only security is made a concern, weaknesses exposed earlier, abang could not have escaped. sgporeans are accountable just like our leaders who are so so accountable that i cannot describe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.  listen to less of crass 90 fm for the very one-kind of news. the king who wore a transparent invisible shirt did not end up well nor was he wise king.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. we need a stronger voice to represent the PEOPLE to keep our security people on their toes at ALL TIMES.  More pressure is good : people work longer and at the same salary. productivity goes up. can work till 65 or 85.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. the pore should re-think its handling of influx of foreigners.  Can the pore detect who is doing bad things to the pore? Has the pore's CRIME RATE increased over the years due to the influx? can the influx be controlled better like only accepting real talents? Or just paper talents?  so easy to come and go here. too easy. How robust is the securing of sgpore? I mean Really, not just based on impression.  this case proved somethings. I expect no more repeated security flaws and weakness. Who is RESPONSIBLE ultimately? no one?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> 5. Conduct a nationwide security audit in all areas:</p>
              <p>a. Physical security.</p>
              <p>b. Computer and internet security</p>
              <p>c. Infrastructure security.</p>
              <p>d. People security.</p>
              <p>e. Economy security.</p>
              <p>to really do a clean test, we need to engage 3 parties who are neutral parties. Their audit and test and certification results will then lead to a white paper as to what needs to be changed, enhanced , improved, secured, corrected, personnel changed, personnel engaged.</p>
              <p>last but not least, we should engage truely international security experts to come here and hold a permanent position and secure sgpore. We do not know what are all the areas weak in security. Maybe no more. But! still it means this need to be discovered.</p>
              <p>I URGE our talented talents leaders do what is right , for their own sake and our sake. act now!  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I think they are thinking of what to write about the Toilet Break. The report too short also cannot mah. Must be a very detailed report. Like how he climed out. Use which leg to step, which hand to reach, how much force to use, then need to calculate Newton's Law.</p>
              <p>LOL! All the useless paper work. Chop down all the trees in Singapore then maybe can find him.</p>

              <p>There are 27 other JI members in the DC. They know Mas Selamat is now not among them. He has "escaped". A new JI member is captured recently. Won't they put 2 and 2 together if Mas Selamat is <em>simply </em>released. Everyone knows that when the ISD realease you, it is because you have been well behaved, and promised to behave well in future. If Mas Selamat talked, and is released as a reward, he is a dead man.</p>
