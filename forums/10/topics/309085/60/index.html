              <p>If this turn out to be true,</p>
              <p>i am sad to say, it would reflect something else about our bombastics. in addition to the toilet break problem.</p>
              <p>they say, there is no evidence that he is outside liao even after more than 1 month? i lost count how long he escaped.</p>
              <p>I seriously like to hear our talented leadership come out to the public and address this concern. If got chance, I like to ask 'live' "is there any evidence he is still in the pore?"  I will then follow up with "is there any evidence he is still Not in the pore?" </p>
              <p>I expect they have some evidence for at least either 1. Else, how?</p>
              <p>the pore. YOG coming here. How? By then will there still be evidence that he is still in the pore?</p>

              <p>When the public announcement was first made - 8 hours after the jail break - it sounded too impossible to be true, for the simple reason that MSK breaking out from the toilet would have still landed him inside the fence compound of the Whitley Detention Centre.</p>
              <p>Questions:</p>
              <p>How did he penetrate the wire fence and avoid being cut by the razor wires on top of the fence ?</p>
              <p>Did he walk out from the front gate with security non-existent at the the perimeter area of the Detention Centre ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The search that was conducted in the early hours of the following morning - some 14 hours after the escape - and concentrating in an area that is less then one kilometer from the Detention Centre was testing the idiocy of the most intelligent Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Questions:</p>
              <p>Why will MSK be hiding so close to the Detention Centre after all the trouble taken to get out ?</p>
              <p>Why was the drag net not enlarged immediately after the escape was discovered, with the Primary Cordon being activated at least one kilometer or more around the Detention Centre, and a search immediately conducted along all possible axis of escape within the cordoned area ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the course of the next 48 hours after the jail break - the authorities could not even decide what were the clothes worn by MSK during his escape.</p>
              <p>Question:</p>
              <p>Why was it first reported that MSK escaped without wearing any shirt and only wearing blue shorts ?</p>
              <p>Why was this followed by another report that he had in his possession a pair of traditional Malay ''baju kurong'' ?</p>
              <p>Why was it decided - some 72 hours later - to report that MSK was wearing the clothes of the Detention Centre that consist of light beige no collar T-shirt and dark brown long pants ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Almost five days after the escape, the Straits Times reported a lady lecturer spotting MSK - on the day of the supposed escape - limping along Whitley Road near to the junction with Thomson Road - which was about one kilometer from the Detention Centre. Yet this lady had come forward only about 24 hours later, when she found out from the morning papers {that published the news the morining after the jail break}.</p>
              <p>Question:</p>
              <p>What took her so long to make the report, when news of the jail break was already on TV in the 10 p.m. news in English, and also in all other channels ?</p>
              <p><br>Another ten days later, the Wan Pao reported that a taxi driver spotted MSK emerging from the secondary forest at around 6.00a.m. - when he was driving along the Mandai Road between the north bound Yishun road and the north bound Upper Thomson Road.</p>
              <p>Question:</p>
              <p>How fast did the Police Field Force react to this sighting and deploy the search parties with this fresh lead ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the passing of an entire month, the Singapore Police and ISD has no clue where to begin to locate him.</p>
              <p>This surely must reflect poorly on the Singapore Security Service when compared to the Indonesian's - which was able to track MSK despite the larger land mass and population size. </p>
              <p>At the end of the day, it is surprising that PM LHL has not made further comments on this matter, while MM LKY had spoken his views on at least two separate occassions that gave the impression that MSK actually escaped the Detention Centre alive - despite the seemingly impossible odds of not having a tool to break through the perimeter fence, even after escaping from the Detention Building through the toilet window and still inside the fenced compound of the Detention Centre.</p>
              <p>It seems that this Government is leaning on the immense reputation of MM LKY to lend some sense of credibility to an incredible escape from someone whom MM LKY would have given little respect for the education level that MSK had received.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">DPM Wong to update Parliament on COI’s findings on Mas Selamat’s escape</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng will update MPs on the
              Committee of Inquiry’s findings on Mas Selamat Kastari’s escape, when
              Parliament sits on Monday.</p>
              <p>The Jemaah Islamiyah leader had escaped from the Whitley Detention Centre on February 27 this year.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will deliver a statement on the government’s responsibility in the matter.</p>
              <p>MPs
              will also ask about the impact of Mas Selamat’s escape on investor
              confidence, and what measures are in place to prevent a recurrence.</p>
              <p>The issues of rice and the cost of living will also be discussed in the House.</p>
              <p>MPs’
              questions will include how export restrictions by some countries will
              affect Singapore’s rice supplies, and what steps are being taken
              against traders who hoard rice illegally to take advantage of high
              prices.</p>
              <p>Two bills will come up for a second reading, including the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Bill. — CNA/ms</p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>Do not believe in this propaganda that anything like this - or worse - can destroy Singapore - as this line of talk is created to instill fear and make Singaporeans continuously dependent on the only single Political Party that Singaporeans have been manipulated to live with.</p>
              <p>New York City suffered a worse calamity on 11 September 2001 - that reverbated across the globe, yet it picked itself up, found its footing, re-organise itself with a new reality, and prepared itself again that it will not happen.</p>
              <p>Bali also suffered an earth shattering hit that was supposed to have destroyed its charm and innocence with the Bali bombing that killed over 200 visitors. Yet, it picked itself up, rebuild and rehabilitate itself from the scars and restored its own image again.</p>
              <p>The same was repeated in London, Riyahd in Saudi Arabia, and Jakarta - LIFE goes on the days after these incidents.</p>
              <p>Life is a perpetual cycle, and the ingenuity, resilience and determination to survive is a characteristic of Humans.</p>
              <p>Without this Ruling Party, Singapore had thrived as a free entrepot, with a reputation of matching the best in the region during its own time in the early History.</p>
              <p>Without this Ruling Party, Singaporeans will still manage to perform as Hong Kong does with its own arrangements in its own constellation of fortunes and misfortunes.</p>
              <p>With or without MSK escape, Singapore will still continue, and Singaporeans will live as the day before he was captured, as much as the days after he had escaped.</p>
              <p>This kind of propaganda is merely old politics to drive fear of the unknown future, and make the originator of such propaganda as the sole dependent source for the security of everyone.</p>
              <p>Can they provide the security that we need, when they fumble with the simple task of keeping in captivity an important prisoner whom they acccused of being the Leader of a Terrorist Cell ?</p>

              <p>as for the media, the govt are expecting you to forget about what has happened. when almost everyone start to forget, the search party can then stop searching completely.</p>

The COI believes that these actions by Mas Selamat could have been done to test how the guards would react. This could also have helped him prepare for his actual escape attempt.<br><br>"This planning had not been noted by the guards, possibly because the guards are frequently rotated to avoid over familiarisation or fraternisation with detainees."<br><br>And in response to a question from opposition non-constituency MP, Sylvia Lim, Mr Wong said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is expected to make a ministerial statement in Parliament on Tuesday on government responsibility for Mas Selamat's escape.<br><br><br>- CNA/so <br><br>"</p>
