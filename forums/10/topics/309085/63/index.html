              <p>now seems to me WKS is not responsible for the fiasco. to me only lah. when leader of all leadership asked, who thinks uncle should resign, no one uttered anything.</p>
              <p>by this, i think indeed maybe, uncle is not responsible at all.</p>
              <p>i feel proud of the pore. our parlaimentarians and near centurions. they have made the pore proud by making this known to the world.</p>
              <p>1st world.</p>
              <p>world record.</p>
              <p>honest.</p>
              <p>integrity.</p>
              <p>like this how can have corruption?</p>
              <p>this shows why we need Opposition.</p>
              <p>Many complacently denied the need of a stronger opposition. They are not knowlegeable about life yet.</p>
              <p>This fiasco shows the need for a  strong opposition.</p>
              <p>Else, who would ask what LTK asked?</p>
              <p>So interesting question.</p>
              <p>Of course, in the end, our leadership gave a super duper convincing reply that silenced everyone in the room.</p>
              <p>good debate good good. opposition has a place.</p>

              <p><span class="postbody">A series of security lapses were found by the
              committee of inquiry which apparently has no scope to find and publish
              its own findings.
              <br> <br> So a higher committee consisting of PM and MHA discussing what to do and what to say is convened to supersede the COI.
              <br> <br> Let us look at the security lapses:-
              <br> <br> (1) A gaping window in the prison toilet.
              <br> (2) A fence that can be easily scaled or climbed over through the adjoining structure.
              <br> (3) CCTV not working at the same time.
              <br>(4) Guards failing to stop prisoner from locking himself in the
              toilet with an ungrilled inviting window blamed on renovation
              contractor for not doing a proper job.
              <br> (5) Absence of guard in watching post over the entry/exit and fences.
              <br> (6) Toilet which is lockable from inside with an ungrilled window within.
              <br> <br>According to PM Lee he was satisfied that the minister of home
              affair is competent with the overall prisoner facility and set-up and
              the above-stated world-class lapses.
              <br> <br> Obviously these lapses were not his own (PM)'s responsibility as well.
              <br> <br>Talents, leadership they claimed to have when approving their own
              million-dollar salaries but when it comes to such series of lapses as
              stated in the foregoing they said one must have the courage to standby
              the minister or the higher up who are certainly looking aghast why the
              window gap was so big and they did not notice it.</span></p>

              <p>When something happened at the MRT, CCTV not working.</p>
              <p>When Mas did a toilet break, CCTV not working again.</p>
              <p>How can Mas be so heng to know that within the 11 mins of his departure, the CCTV is not working ?</p>
              <p>Just summarise the finding as all the guards were sleeping. (They are just following the poodles)</p>
              <p>That would be a simple reason.</p>
              <p>It is funny and shameless that these poodles want the high salary tagged with the top earners and when they made a mistake, they concluded that it is still better compared to a much worse condition.</p>
              <p>This lapse of responsibilty is NOT acceptable in a FIRST WORLD country.</p>
              <p>How can the boss and lackey accept such ridiculous explanation ?</p>
              <p>It is just a insult to the general public.</p>

                                      (should) be appropriately punished," he said.</p>
              <p>The prime minister reiterated that punishments must depend on

                                      and (is) afraid to do something for fear of making mistakes, that —
                                      as Dr Goh Keng Swee used to say — would be the biggest mistake of
                                      all," said Mr Lee. — CNA/ac</p>

              <p>In the private sector, people -:</p>
              <p>A) Get Fired for mistakes on this scale.</p>
              <p>B) Take responsibility and resign.</p>
              <p>Logically, if you follow private sector payscale, then why not follow private sectors way of weeding out people who just don't make the scratch?</p>
              <p>This is not a mistake that was made by the fear of making crucial decisions.  So this is not going to build a culture of people being afraid to make mistakes.</p>
              <p>This IS an example of people failing do what they are paid to do.  No one made a bad call except for the female SDO.  This is a failure to react to a highlighted security issue.</p>
              <p>Evidently, the window panel was highlighted as a security issue, and hence it handle was sawn off to make it harder for it to be opened.  They did not add a grill, but chose to just saw off the handle. Unfortunately, this reflects a half hearted effort to secure against a potential breach of security.</p>
              <p>This is not to say that WKS should be fired or resign.  But someone else other than 2 Ghurkas and an SDO must take responsibility for not reacting to a reported security flaw.</p>

              <p>Well both applied basics.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat :  He studied the routines of the guards, the area, the terrain, and planned way before hand to escape. He only had one chance and made full use of it.</p>
              <p>WRDC : guards did not have proper basic protocols. Infrastructure very questionable. How can CCTV not work. we are talking about hardcore, well trained terrorist. There should be proper procedures to handle these kind of people.</p>
              <p>Moreover, he had already said that one day he will escape. Shouldn't the authorities had taken the cue????</p>
              <p>Any security experts would laugh at the way he escaped. Moreover this is not the first time someone escaped from the place.</p>

Why would there be toilet paper in a cubicle without a latrine? And if there are only urinals, why would Mr Mas Selamat have to remove his trousers instead of just pulling it down like all males do when they urinate? <br><br>There doesn't even seem that there is a tap in the cubicle. How did the detainee turn on a non-existent tap and leave it running? <br><br>The toilet paper, the COI tells us, could have been used by the prisoner to break his fall as he jumped out of the window. The SDP is surprised that the COI didn't also report finding a ladder in the cubicle.<br><br>Let's put things together: <br><br>1. The guard neglects to watch the prisoner as he changes out of his prison clothes.<br><br>2. Toilet rolls were left in the toilet which has no latrine and the prisoners don't use them.<br><br>3. The guard sees the detainee "flipping" his trousers over the top of the door and doesn't find it strange, and hears tap water running when there doesn't seem to be a tap in the cubicle.<br><br>4. The prisoner knows exactly where to run to, scale a fence, climb a walkway and jump to freedom in less than one minute when he doesn't have a clue as to the surroundings. <br><br>5. Two cameras are either not working or no one paid any attention to them during the escape.<br><br>What are the odds of the above all coming together at the same imperfect moment to facilitate Mr Mas Selamat's escape? This Government must think that Singaporeans all just graduated from nursery school.<br><br>Let's get real. Even if it is to be believed that two of the surveillance cameras were not being monitored, surely there must have been the tapes. What did they show? Did the COI not look at these?<br><br>Even if these two cameras were not monitored, or working, at the time of escape, there are other cameras within the detention centre which will capture the movement of the security officers immediately after the alert went out. What did these show?<br><br>Did the COI question doctors and medical professionals who attended to Mr Mas Selamat? If no, why not? If yes, what were their reports of the prisoner just prior to his escape? When did they last observe the detainee? What was his physical condition then? Can the COI confirm that reports show that Mr Selamat was still alive on or before 27 Feb 08? <br><br>It is even more bizarre that through all this, there is not any press report about what the detainee's family think and feel. One would imagine that Mr Selamat's parents, siblings or spouse who have something to say especially now that he has disappeared under the most mysterious of circumstances. And yet, there is only silence. What about the foreign press? Have they been prevented to interview the family? <br><br>This COI report raises more questions than it gives answers.
