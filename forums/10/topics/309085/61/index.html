              <p><br>u know what guys,</p>
              <p>I am super impressed by the leadership when he confidently said abang is still   'inside'.....ermm....inside where? inside the pore lah. I din mean inside the cell lah.... that would be scary to think that he is still lying on the floor of the cell when he is said to have escaped even when he is limping and can climb up the toilet, to outside the toilet and knows exactly where the infrastructure is weak and escape totally UNDETECTED. STEALTH.</p>
              <p>I think even james bond and jackie chan have to give it up for abang.</p>
              <p>david blaine also cannot make such an escape.</p>
              <p>Totally UNDETECTED.</p>
              <p>So, I am impressed by 2 people:</p>
              <p>1. leadership who is confident for some reason he is still 'inside'.</p>
              <p>2. abang who is capable of escaping totally undetected, better than jackie chan, david blaine and david copperfield and some say james bond.</p>
              <p>very impressed so confident. So, why need evidence? ha ha.  </p>

              <h1 class="clr">Officers responsible for Mas Selamat’s escape to be disciplined</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Officers responsible for Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) detainee Mas
              Selamat Kastari’s escape from the Whitley Road Detention Centre (WRDC)
              will be disciplined and penalised, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng
              said in Parliament on Monday.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong said this will include those at the junior officer level,
              all the way up the chain of command to the supervisory and management
              levels of the detention centre.</p>
              <p>The Commissioner of Police and
              the director of the Internal Security Department (ISD) have also been
              told to replace all the WRDC officers — as identified in the Committee
              of Inquiry report — who were responsible for Mas Selamat’s escape.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Wong, who had spoken to the officers from the ISD and the Gurkha
              contingent of the police force, added: "I can see that they feel the
              disappointment most acutely because they have fallen short of the high
              standards that Singaporeans have come to expect from them."</p>
              <p>"This
              security lapse in WRDC came as a rude and painful shock to them; all
              the more when the mistakes have turned out to be so simple as to appear
              silly and incredible. I was shocked and disappointed when first
              informed of Mas Selamat’s escape on 27 February 2008 via a message on
              my handphone," he said.</p>
              <p>While calling this incident a "dark
              stain" on the successes the ISD had against terrorism, Mr Wong also
              highlighted some of the department’s achievements, and he called for a
              balance in how the whole episode is viewed.</p>
              <p>He said, "Do not
              misunderstand me. I mention these facts not to absolve or excuse the
              ISD from responsibility for its officers’ mistakes or lapses. I mention
              these facts because we need to be fair and balanced in our judgement
              and not ’throw the baby out with the bath water’.</p>
              <p>"Yes, this
              episode of Mas Selamat’s escape is a bad mistake and officers who did
              not carry out their duties as required will be held accountable.</p>
              <p>"But
              ISD — the organisation — and the many dedicated and committed officers
              who continue to serve in it are resolved to pick themselves up, recover
              their spirits and move forward relentlessly in their national mission.
              We must support them in this."</p>
              <p>Mr Wong added that it was
              absolutely essential to find out whether Mas Selamat had been assisted
              by anyone inside the centre, as not detecting this could lead to more
              escapes.</p>
              <p>The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) — through a
              series of interviews, forensic examination of the site, and polygraph
              tests — found no evidence to suggest any collusion on the part of
              Internal Security Department officers, detention centre staff or guards
              involved.</p>
              <p>It concluded that the escape was the result of a
              combination of factors and was not under the control of any one
              individual. The attorney—general has thus seen no need to press any
              charges.</p>
              <p>However, while there is no evidence to suggest external
              help in the escape, it is not clear whether Mas Selamat could have
              secured help after his escape, which is still being looked into.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong also acknowledged the disappointment and frustration Singaporeans feel over Mas Selamat’s escape from detention.</p>
              <p>"I
              understand their frustration. This incident should not have happened.
              But since it did happen, my priority had to be — to establish the full
              facts of what (happened) and how it happened, and at the same time,
              galvanise and focus the energies of the home team and its partners,
              including the community, to tackle the situation at hand," he said.</p>
              <p>He
              added that despite their disappointment over this security lapse,
              Singaporeans have stepped forward to work with the government to
              address the immediate challenge.</p>
              <p>"I am deeply grateful for the
              way Singaporeans have rallied behind our efforts even as they rightly
              expect a proper accounting," he said.</p>
              <p>He thanked the many
              Singaporeans who have actively put their minds to the problem — to
              share their ideas and help the security agencies. — CNA/ac</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Singapore details terror suspect escape</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE - An unsecured bathroom window and complacent guards allowed
              a top terror suspect to flee a high-security prison in February,
              Singapore's deputy prime minister said Monday.</p>
              <p>In announcing the results of a probe into the embarrassing escape,
              Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng said Mas Selamat Kastari, who
              allegedly once plotted to hijack an airplane and crash it into the
              city-state's international airport, had planned his Feb. 27 escape over
              time.</p>
              <p>Speaking in Parliament, Wong said Mas Selamat climbed out
              of a ventilation window of a toilet cubicle before a scheduled weekly
              visit with his family. The window did not have a grill on it, Wong said.</p>
              <p>"In
              my view, the security weakness of this window is the single most
              crucial factor which enabled Mas Selamat to escape," Wong said.</p>
              <p>Wong
              said there was no video recording of the escape since closed-circuit
              television coverage of the area was being upgraded to add motion
              detectors.</p>
              <p>The escape triggered a monthlong nationwide manhunt in
              which police, special operations officers, elite Gurkha guards and
              soldiers combed the island nation's forests. Border security was
              tightened.</p>
              <p>Wong said the probe found no evidence suggesting that
              it was an inside job, but said the guards should have kept Mas Selamat
              in sight by preventing him from closing the cubicle door.</p>
              <p>"Complacency, for whatever reason ... had crept into the operating culture" at the detention center, Wong said.</p>
              <p>Wong said the officers responsible for Mas Selamat's escape would be disciplined, penalized and replaced.</p>
              <p>Security
              breaches are rare in tightly controlled Singapore, an island nation of
              4.5 million people that is a 45-minute boat ride from Indonesia where
              Mas Selamat is alleged to have links with the Jemaah Islamiyah terror
              network, blamed for a series of attacks that have killed more than 250
              people since 2002.</p>
              <p>In response to lawmakers' questions, Wong said
              authorities believed Mas Selamat had not managed to flee the country,
              and that there is a risk the fugitive would launch a retaliative attack
              on the city-state.</p>
              <p>"We consider him to be a key trigger in the
              terrorist network," he said. "If he could leave Singapore and connect
              back with his (Jemaah Islamiyah) friends, they could well launch a
              revenge attack."</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat is said to be the former commander of the local arm of the Jemaah Islamiyah.</p>

              <h1 class="">Officers responsible for Mas Selamatâ€™s escape to be
              disciplined</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Officers responsible for Jemaah Islamiyah (JI)
              detainee Mas Selamat Kastariâ€™s escape from the Whitley Road
              Detention Centre (WRDC) will be disciplined and penalised, Deputy
              Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng said in Parliament on Monday.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong said this will include those at the junior officer
              level, all the way up the chain of command to the supervisory and
              management levels of the detention centre.</p>
              <p>The Commissioner of Police and the director of the Internal
              Security Department (ISD) have also been told to replace all the
              WRDC officers â€” as identified in the Committee of Inquiry report â€”
              who were responsible for Mas Selamatâ€™s escape.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong, who had spoken to the officers from the ISD and the
              Gurkha contingent of the police force, added: "I can see that they
              feel the disappointment most acutely because they have fallen short
              of the high standards that Singaporeans have come to expect from
              them."</p>
              <p>"This security lapse in WRDC came as a rude and painful shock to
              them; all the more when the mistakes have turned out to be so
              simple as to appear silly and incredible. I was shocked and
              disappointed when first informed of Mas Selamatâ€™s escape on 27
              February 2008 via a message on my handphone," he said.</p>
              <p>While calling this incident a "dark stain" on the successes the
              ISD had against terrorism, Mr Wong also highlighted some of the
              departmentâ€™s achievements, and he called for a balance in how the
              whole episode is viewed.</p>
              <p>He said, "Do not misunderstand me. I mention these facts not to
              absolve or excuse the ISD from responsibility for its officersâ€™
              mistakes or lapses. I mention these facts because we need to be
              fair and balanced in our judgement and not â€™throw the baby out with
              the bath waterâ€™.</p>
              <p>"Yes, this episode of Mas Selamatâ€™s escape is a bad mistake and
              officers who did not carry out their duties as required will be
              held accountable.</p>
              <p>"But ISD â€” the organisation â€” and the many dedicated and
              committed officers who continue to serve in it are resolved to pick
              themselves up, recover their spirits and move forward relentlessly
              in their national mission. We must support them in this."</p>
              <p>Mr Wong added that it was absolutely essential to find out
              whether Mas Selamat had been assisted by anyone inside the centre,
              as not detecting this could lead to more escapes.</p>
              <p>The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) â€” through a series
              of interviews, forensic examination of the site, and polygraph
              tests â€” found no evidence to suggest any collusion on the part of
              Internal Security Department officers, detention centre staff or
              guards involved.</p>
              <p>It concluded that the escape was the result of a combination of
              factors and was not under the control of any one individual. The
              attorneyâ€”general has thus seen no need to press any charges.</p>
              <p>However, while there is no evidence to suggest external help in
              the escape, it is not clear whether Mas Selamat could have secured
              help after his escape, which is still being looked into.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong also acknowledged the disappointment and frustration
              Singaporeans feel over Mas Selamatâ€™s escape from detention.</p>
              <p>"I understand their frustration. This incident should not have
              happened. But since it did happen, my priority had to be â€” to
              establish the full facts of what (happened) and how it happened,
              and at the same time, galvanise and focus the energies of the home
              team and its partners, including the community, to tackle the
              situation at hand," he said.</p>
              <p>He added that despite their disappointment over this security
              lapse, Singaporeans have stepped forward to work with the
              government to address the immediate challenge.</p>
              <p>"I am deeply grateful for the way Singaporeans have rallied
              behind our efforts even as they rightly expect a proper
              accounting," he said.</p>
              <p>He thanked the many Singaporeans who have actively put their
              minds to the problem â€” to share their ideas and help the security
              agencies. â€” CNA/ac</p>

              <h1 class="clr">COI recommends building new detention centre in Changi Prison</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The Committee of Inquiry (COI) that was formed to look into
              Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) leader Mas Selamat Kastari’s escape has
              recommended that a new detention centre for internal security detainees
              be built in Changi Prison.</p>
              <p>This is one of several recommendations made to prevent a recurrence of such an incident.</p>
              <p>Deputy
              Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng said the
              Director of the Internal Security Department (ISD) and the Director of
              Prisons will co—chair a team to study the implementation details for
              the new facility.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong said: "The COI’s recommendation to
              shift the detention centre to the Changi Prison Complex will, among
              other things, ensure that security and prison operating standards of
              the detention centre are always tied to best practices.</p>
              <p>"At the
              same time, ISD can tap (the) Prison’s medical and food logistics for
              its detainees. However, and let me emphasise this, careful thought must
              be given to how to operationalise this plan to ensure that it meets
              ISD’s needs, while at the same time not undermine (the) Prison’s
              operating regime.</p>
              <p>"Among other things, we definitely do not want
              to expose the prison inmate population to ’contamination’ by extremist
              detainees. This has been the bad experience in many countries where
              prisons have been one of the most fertile sources of new terrorist
              recruits."</p>
              <p>The COI has also recommended that the ISD assumes
              overall command and control of the Whitley Road Detention Centre (WRDC)
              and that frontline officers should hold regular exercises and security
              audits.</p>
              <p>The committee also put forth the suggestion that there
              should be better coordination and communication among the Gurkhas, ISD
              and the management of the centre.</p>
              <p>And even though the COI has
              found no evidence of connivance, collusion or assistance given to Mas
              Selamat by any individual who could have aided him in his escape from
              WRDC, the possibility that the JI detainee had secured help after his
              escape has not been dismissed.</p>
              <p>The home affairs minister also
              briefed Parliament on Monday on the outcome of separate investigations
              conducted by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the ISD.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Wong said: "The CID investigation has been completed with extensive
              interviews and forensic examination of the site. Polygraph tests were
              also administered to some witnesses to support investigation. The CID
              has found no evidence to suggest collusion on the part of any of the
              ISD officers, WRDC staff or guards involved.</p>
              <p>"The CID submitted
              its investigation papers to the Attorney General’s Chambers to
              determine if any offences have been committed. I am informed that the
              Attorney—General has considered the investigation papers and concluded
              that there is no basis to lay criminal charges against any individual.</p>
              <p>"In
              my view, while the COI and the CID investigations found no malice or
              criminal liability on the part of any officer implicated in Mas
              Selamat’s escape, there is no avoiding the fact that the escape would
              not have happened but for the security and operational lapses
              identified by the COI.</p>
              <p>"Complacency for whatever reason — be it
              fatigue given the protracted security operations by ISD since 2001 or
              routinisation over time — had crept into the operating culture at WRDC.
              That no detainee had escaped from WRDC before may have been one reason
              why an escape was unimaginable in the minds of those who run WRDC.</p>
              <p>"Even
              when the guards became concerned over the time Mas Selamat was taking
              in the toilet, they did not think that he might have escaped."</p>
              <p>As
              to why the COI could not conduct its proceedings publicly, Mr Wong
              explained that it was to protect the intelligence personnel and their
              operational systems which are highly classified and sensitive.</p>
              <p>That is why the government has decided to only release an Executive Summary of the full report.</p>
              <p>He
              said: "Exposing these details in public would compromise the persons
              and processes involved in our security and intelligence operations, and
              put these operations at risk. Holding the inquiry out of public view
              enabled the COI to have the full and unfettered access needed to fulfil
              their mission and establish the full facts.</p>
              <p>"We had also
              considered releasing the COI’s report with the sensitive parts blacked
              out. But that was not feasible as the details are extensive. It would
              not only make understanding the report difficult, but also fuel the
              distraction of baseless speculation." — CNA/so</p>

              <p>Amazing that CNA had dutifully bombarded Singaporeans with a condensed version of the 1 hour WKS performance in Parliament, and flooded its website with varying reports of the same garbage spoken by WKS.</p>
              <p>Why did WKS hold the Head of the WRDC - with the rank of Superintendent {equal to a full Colonel} - responsible for the security lapses in the building design, which resulted in a supposed miscommunication with the contractor that renovated the Centre ?</p>
              <p>Was there a budget shortfall that did not allow the grill to be replaced, and that the Superintendent was so dumb and complacent not to realise that a toilet available to the prisoners have no grills to its window openings ?</p>
              <p>Who approved the designs to convert the Whitley Primary School into the a Detention Centre - that featured the <strong>external perimeter fencing to converge with the wall</strong> of the Detention Centre Building, with the toilet windows opening directly into the world outside ?</p>
              <p>Surely it cannot be a lowly ranked Superintendent influencing the designs when this School was converted into a Detention Centre - as he was probably assigned to this WRDC from some other posts ?</p>
              <p>Was the Superintendent held accountable for the simplistic thinking that by sawing off the window handles will prevent the window from being open ?</p>
              <p>How could a plump MSK squeeze through this small window opening that is made even narrower from a top hinged swing out window, and being mounted about 1.8 meters from the floor - with the drop on the other side even more ?</p>
              <p>The explanations given by WSK raises even more questions than his answers.</p>
              <p>Surprisingly, CNA did not give any <em>ad verbatim</em> report to the Q &amp; A that followed - in which Opposition Leader T. K Low raised the public concern that MSK had actually died and not escaped from prison.  </p>
              <p>Amazingly, WKS - in the usual PAP counter towards the Opposition queries - had condescendingly challenged LTK if it was also LTK's personal position on this statement - with CNA camera focused on LTK shaking his head to indicate a negative response; and allowed WKS to proceed with his ministerial statements without any clear and definite reply to LTK's question.</p>
              <p>It is even more amazing that WKS could speak in such an aloof manner - as if he was a meer observer and passing judgment on the events after the findings was concluded by the appointed committee that cleared a path for him to take.</p>
              <p>It shows the genius of WKS in coming up with simplistic reasons that the continuous tempo of high security since 2001 led to the fatigue of the security forces - as if our security forces are in front line combat equal to the US Armed Forces dying every other day and exposed to live bullets in a combat zone since 2001.</p>
              <p>It is sheer hypocrisy for the Political Leadership not to place full responsibility on the Home Minister, when it will demand accountability from the leadership and senior management of other organisations for the mistakes made by their subordinates.</p>
              <p>The James Gomez Election 2006 affair was one, as well as the persecution of J.B. Jeyaratnam for the supposed  accounting errors of the previous WP which he led.</p>
              <p>It is about time that the Political Leadership exercise real responsibility and show real leadership in accepting the position that the ''buck stops here'' - especially more so when the buck amount to more then a million per minister per year.</p>
              <p>In his monthly meetings with all the Heads of his Home Team, what was in WKS agenda ?</p>
              <p>Did he concentrate his Agenda entirely in monitoring the political activities of CSJ, JBJ, all the members of the Alternative Political Parties, and all potential threats from Singaporeans, and lost sight of the weaknesses in his own infrastructure ?</p>
              <p>If the reason given by WKS is about fatigue from the security forces, he is probably hinting at his own fatigue for being in politics and in the Home Ministry for far too long - leading to complacency in his leadership role to the Home Team.</p>
              <p>What more can we expect from the Rulers of this Animal Farm ?</p>

              <p>... after such a long time, they produce such a Report...</p>
              <p>... this is as good as NOT reporting anything at all...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... what's worse, is WKS didn't even answer LTK's suggestions that MSK died and this is all an elaborate cover-up fiasco! WKS challenged LTK (which is equivalent to a threat); ".. is this your believe that he died?..."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... I personally believe MSK died while under detention as a result of Torture techniques over-done...</p>

              <p>Mas Selamet managed to escape cause he closed the door and was out of sight for 11 min. The door of the toilet cubicle should not have been closed according the standard procedure.</p>
              <p>But <strong>why the toilet cubicle has door in the first place if it is never meant to be closed?</strong></p>
