              <p>I think MS is still alive and kicking.... and laughing at the authorities...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If he still can't be found at the end of this year... I believe someone (who is responsible for this) at the top of the government should be released from his duties... if not, I would say it's a disgrace to our PORE... a total disgrace...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps, in the next election, we should start thinking whether these highly paid people should be elected again... don;t u think it's a total waste of our hard-earned resources...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would expect another Tsunami to hit PORE, just like Maaysia and the USA.... don't u think so???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The authorities want us to move on..... so let's move on...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If something bad really happens again, it's just another honest mistake that someone up there has made.... so please, please, forgive them.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think if we were in Japan now, the minister-in-charge would have "kamikaze" or stepped down with grace.... don't u think so???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well.... this is the PORE, not some other countries.... and who chose those people up there, not us???</p>

              <p style="margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">''Let's move on...'' - is this not typical of SM GCT's generosity and willingness to accept matters at its face value ?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">During the 2006 Elections - in response to the James Gomez ''loss of papers saga'' - it was also the amicable SM GCT who said - ''Let's move on''.</span></p>

(But when <strong>Deputy Prime Minister <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wong Kan Seng</span></strong> spoke to him later and <strong>explained why he was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">still pursuing the matter</span></strong>, Mr Goh felt a need to probe further. He suggested that the Worker's party should hold a press conference to clarify the matter.)</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;     "><br><br></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;     "><span style="color: #0000ff;">On 1st May, Worker's Party Low Thia Kiang said that he was not going to comment further.

              <p>Hello forum,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. What is the status of the search operation in tiny little dot? any increase in the effort? Why not? If not searching, what is the reason?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. What is the Estimated Time of Capture assuming this comes from the talents that exist to do the job?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. What is the COST spent to-date  on searching for abang as a direct result of the fiasco and inability to secure a limping man ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. What plans are inplace to ensure this fiasco will never happen again?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Who shall be responsible if this ever happens again?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6. If the case is still wide open and there is no trace of abang, why is it asked that we 'move on' ? What is the artistic and scholarstic intention behind these great mighty words of wisdom?</p>

              <p>1. What is the status of the search operation in tiny little dot? any increase in the effort? Why not? If not searching, what is the reason?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>3. What is the COST spent to-date  on searching for abang as a direct result of the fiasco and inability to secure a limping man ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. What plans are inplace to ensure this fiasco will never happen again?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Who shall be responsible if this ever happens again?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6. If the case is still wide open and there is no trace of abang, why is it asked that we 'move on' ? What is the artistic and scholarstic intention behind these great mighty words of wisdom?</p>

              <p>Short memory? yah, many people has this 'disability'.</p>
              <p>This is a long proven problem. about half a century old.</p>
              <p>I take Ginko Biloba everyday and this improved my memory. No believe ?</p>
              <p>See, I still remember</p>
              <p>1. the NKF fiasco    and</p>
              <p>2. the ex-NTUU Home chief who did CORRUPTION. </p>
              <p>3. Limper break the toilet lobang big big. and all the numerous numerous weaknesses that exist in the system.</p>
              <p>so, as can be seen, above prove I do not have short term memory unlike many many.</p>
              <p>These are merely 3 of the items in the history book I can recall on-the-spot for you now. </p>
              <p>History will remember Villians, Unaccountants, Despotados, Corrupted Highly eds, and Materialistic cheats of public trust.</p>
