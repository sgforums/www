              <p><br>haha, good one!  I feel even more upset hearing the revised description that he walks with a noticeable limp only if he runs or walks briskly!  AND apparently someone came forward to say they spotted him 70 minutes after he escaped at a petrol kiosk near the detention centre.  IF they had sound the alarm immediately and not wait 4 hours (still no good explanation for the 4 hours delay!), they might have acted on the tip much sooner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The way the run the whole damm operation, I have to ask, er... did the police check his cell?  Maybe all this time, he is sleeping in his cell, wondering why he has not been fed for several days and no-one has come to check on him.  It sounds ridiculous but that's how I feel about the bleedy DPM and his team of jokers.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000099; font-family: verdana;">Like <a href="http://ivyidaong3.blogspot.com/2008/02/lorries-trailers-tail-back-to-mandai.html"><span style="color: #006699;">YG</span></a>, I think he would have headed for <strong>Bukit Brown cemetery</strong>, which is quite deserted. He would have met his accomplice there, changed into jogging gear and cross over Lornie Road and hide in the <strong>MacRitchie Nature Reserve</strong> which is linked to the <strong>Bt Timah nature reserve</strong>. Here there are plenty of places to hide, and where food and clothing can be left behind for him. <br><br>Hence, I don't understand why during the first few hours, the police concentrated their search in the Malcolm Road and the Dunearn Road areas. Afterall, in order to get to Malcolm Road, he has to cross a very busy <strong>Pan Island Expressway</strong>, one way or another. Could it be because they were worried that this guy would catch hold of some school kids from St Joseph's Institution or Singapore Chinese Girls School and used them as hostages? <br><br>If Mas Selamat had indeed escaped to MacRitchie Reservoir, it would be quite ironical.</span></p>

              <h1 class="clr">JI fugitive could break cover</h1>
              <p>As police and army officers and their tracker dogs continued their
              intensive search of the forested areas in various parts of Singapore
              yesterday, the public kept their eyes peeled for fugitive Mas Selamat
              Kastari.</p>
              <p>He is believed to be still within the Republic’s borders and having
              gone for more than 100 hours without shelter or food since his escape
              last Wednesday afternoon is likely to break cover.</p>
              <p>Believed to be
              on his own, this could be the crucial period when an emotionally
              erratic and desperate man on the run, makes his move, most likely under
              the cover of night.</p>
              <p>Most in Singapore know his face many have
              received MMS photos of the man from the three telcos but the police
              have added another element to watch out for: Any person wearing
              ill—fitting clothes, avoiding eye contact, or trying to conceal his
              appearance by wearing a cap, sunglasses or coat.</p>
              <p>Police say that
              Mas Selamat, a trained mechanic, is adept at jumpstarting motor
              vehicles. “He would try to look for means of transportation ... It is
              possible that he may be able to start a car, motorcycle or even a motor
              boat given his background as a mechanic,” a top police officer told
              reporters yesterday during a briefing at the Special Operations Command
              (SOC) the first since the escape that launched Singapore’s largest
              manhunt.</p>
              <p>Said Assistant Commissioner Wong Hong Kuan, Director of
              Operations: “We believe that he is unaided in his escape. Mas Selamat
              needs money, food, shelter and clothing to try and escape from
              Singapore.”</p>
              <p>One new point: The former Jemaah Islamiyah leader’s limp in his left leg is only noticeable when he runs or walks briskly.</p>
              <p>AC
              Wong urged the public to be extra vigilant Mas Selamat could have
              stolen a knife to arm himself and to report any thefts immediately. If
              you spot him, call 999, but do not try to apprehend him, was the advice
              from the police.</p>
              <p>Why was the public only notified some four hours after the escape?</p>
              <p>AC
              Wong said the priority in “the first few hours” was to step up border
              security and get the search going. “We needed to be sure of what was
              actually happening, before giving out information. In any operation, we
              always refine our tactics, including managing communications to the
              public.”</p>
              <p>Even as he spoke, more than 300 calls have been received
              by the police, said Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng, who was also
              visiting the SOC base, to check on the morale of the search party.</p>
              <p>Paying
              tribute to the troops, Mr Wong said all leads provided by the public
              were being followed up. No stone would be left unturned, he assured
              Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Today understands that last Wednesday at about
              5.15pm 70 minutes after Mas Selamat escaped a bus commuter reported
              seeing a man, believed to be the fugitive, at a petrol kiosk near the
              detention centre.</p>
              <p>Four hours before the prison break, a SingPost
              van was stolen after the driver had left the engine running near the
              Woodlands Civic Centre. The stolen vehicle has still not been found.
              Authorities would not say if it was linked to the Mas Selamat hunt.</p>
              <p>“We
              are grateful for the support from Singaporeans, community leaders and
              corporate bodies. All efforts count, big or small,” said Mr Wong. <br>He acknowledged the inconvenience to travellers from the 100—per—cent security searches at the land checkpoints.</p>
              <p>“I
              thank them for bearing with us,” he added. Border controls at all land,
              air and sea entry ports as well as unauthorised immigration points
              remain on high alert.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s reputation “has taken a knock”,
              admitted Mr Wong. “We must learn from mistakes so that we do not repeat
              them. We will recover from this.”</p>
              <p>The authorities do not consider
              Mas Selamat an immediate threat as the JI network in Singapore has been
              crippled. “But in the long term, who knows?” said Mr Wong.</p>
              <p>The
              Internal Security Department has been speaking to Mas Selamat’s family
              and asking them “a lot of questions to see if they know anything”, he
              said. He was heartened by the spontaneous community response, where
              many Singaporeans from all walks of life took the initiative to
              disseminate pamphlets and posters on Mas Selamat.</p>
              <p>This was in
              addition to efforts by grassroots leaders to distribute police fliers
              at various places such as town centres, MRT stations and bus
              interchanges. In all, over 54,000 posters and flyers have been
              distributed.</p>
              <p>More than 1,000 officers are involved in the
              manhunt. SOC Commander, Assistant Commissioner Raymond Yeo said the
              search could go on “indefinitely as we have the manpower and the
              resources”.</p>
              <p>The break—out has also dominated Internet chatter
              with more than 400 people joining five groups on popular social
              networking site Facebook to discuss Mas Selamat’s escape.</p>
              <p>Interpol
              has also issued a red alert for Mas Selamat on top of a previous orange
              alert which means that any law enforcement officer among the
              international police network’s 186 member countries can help arrest him
              on the spot.</p>
              <p>Indonesian authorities have mobilised its navy, army
              and police around the Riau archipelago to track down Mas Selamat.
              Police officers are monitoring the ferry terminals while naval ships
              are checking trawlers and fishing boats. TODAY/</p>

              <p>Come to think of it.......you think it is easy to escape from Internal Affairs custody?  It could be a æ”¾é•¿çº¿é’“å¤§é±¼(literally lay down a long line to catch bigger fish).  In English it means using Mas as a bait to nab the ultimate leader of JL in neighbouring country.</p>
              <p>So if any JL member read this, please don't help Mas. Unless you cut open his stomach and remove that casio GPS that IA implanted in his body.</p>
              <p>If within weeks, Indonesian police announced that they managed to nab the key person of JL together with Mas, then my theory is correct. Indonesian police will be more than happy for this deal because they got the credit although it is our sniper that fire the shot on the fugitive left leg three toe.</p>
