              <p>Minister of Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng said in Parliament on Thursday that Mas Selamat was taken out of his cell to go to the family visitation room to wait for his family.</p>

              <p>Mr Wong explained that this is because the agencies assessed at that time that there was no imminent danger to the public, and that the focus then was to lock down the immediate vicinity of the detention centre.</p>
              <p>He added that there was no information that the escapee has any plan that threatens public security.</p>

              <p>don't say sorry. step down. this is like the SARS episode all over again. china didn't warn others when they suspected the SARS virus was rampant in china. they tried to control the situation, but only inform others when it blows out of hand.</p>
              <p>i believe that the word used to describe them then was "irresponsible".</p>
              <p>i think this word can be used here again to describe those involved in the security of singapore home affairs.</p>

              <p>&lt;!-- Author --&gt; By Ng Kai Ling &lt;!-- more than 7
              paragraphs --&gt;&lt;!-- story content : start --&gt;A SECURITY
              lapse at the Internal Security Department's Whitley Road detention
              centre allowed Mas Selamat Kastari, the leader of the Singapore
              Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) network, to escape on Wednesday
              afternoon.</p>
              <p>Minister of Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng said in Parliament on
              Thursday that Mas Selamat was taken out of his cell to go to the
              family visitation room to wait for his family.</p>
              <p>There, he requested to go to the toilet and then escaped.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the
              incident should not have happened and he is 'sorry that it
              had'.</p>
              <p>He added that security at the centre has since been stepped
              up.</p>
              <p>MP Teo Ho Pin earlier asked: Why, since Mas Selamat is a
              security threat, did the authorities take four hours to inform the
              public of the escape?</p>
              <p>&lt;!-- show media links starting at 7th para --&gt;Mr Wong
              explained that this is because the agencies assessed at that time
              that there was no imminent danger to the public, and that the focus
              then was to lock down the immediate vicinity of the detention
              centre.</p>
              <p>He added that there was no information that the escapee has any
              plan that threatens public security.</p>
              <p>He emphasised that the priority now is to arrest the Jemaah
              Islamiyah leader and no efforts will be spared.</p>
              <p>All checkpoints are on high alert in case the escapee tries to
              leave the country.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong urged the public to stay calm and warned that anyone who
              renders assistance to Mas Selamat is commiting an offence.</p>
