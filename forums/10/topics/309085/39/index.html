              <h1 class="clr">Youths alerted through Youth Bank to look out for Mas Selamat</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Over 6,000 youths were alerted via SMS and email to look out
              for alleged Jemaah Islamiyah leader, Mas Selamat Kastari, through the
              Heartware Network’s Youth Bank.</p>
              <p>This was done through Youth Bank’s Volunteer Mobilisation and Call
              Centre (YVMCC), which is normally used to keep youths updated on
              community safety and security issues. Youths were asked to contact the
              police if they see the fugitive.</p>
              <p>Adding on to the alerts are messages on its website at www.heartware.org.</p>
              <p>And to tap on the online messaging network, there will be a Microsoft Windows Live tab to alert users about Mas Selamat.</p>
              <p>Youth Bank is an online portal, with a database of youths who volunteer at 44 Volunteer Hosting Organisations (VHOs). — CNA/so</p>

              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><span><em>SINGAPORE: An independent Committee of Inquiry has been set up to find out exactly how Mas Selamat Kastari escaped from custody and will also propose measures to prevent this from happening again. <br><br>The report should be ready within a month. <br><br>This is in addition to police investigation by CID into any possible criminal wrongdoing centering around the escape. <br><br>Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng gave this assurance after visiting Special Operations Command officers involved in the search. <br><br>The physical breach that was discovered in the escape has been dealt with and security has been beefed up at Whitley Road Detention Centre. <br><br>Also, Mas Selamat’s family members have been questioned extensively to see if they know anything. <br><br>However, many holes still remain. <br><br>And so, independent investigations are underway. <br><br>Home Affairs Minister, Wong Kan Seng, said: "There is an independent police investigation to look into whether any criminal wrongdoing has been committed. We should not speculate that there is but we must not rule out any possibility. That is why it becomes a police investigation led by the CID. <br><br>We also need to look at the whole system, process of the Whitley Road Detention Centre. And we want to get to the bottom of how he managed to escape and what measures can be taken to stop this from happening." <br><br>Mr Wong said a Committee of Inquiry has been set up to give an objective, balanced and comprehensive report on what happened. <br><br>The committee is chaired by Goh Joon Seng, a retired judge (and current member of the Council of Presidential Advisers), with former police commissioner and current ambassador-at-large Tee Tua Ba, and Deputy Secretary of Security at the Home Affairs Ministry, Choong May Ling, <br><br>Meanwhile, authorities are committed to continuing this search until he is found. <br><br>Mr Wong continued: "After searching the whole of Singapore and after searching every possible lead and every possible haunt where he may be found, we will have to find a way to find him through other means. <br><br>"No doubt our reputation has taken a knock but we must not be demoralised by it - we must learn from mistakes so we do not repeat them." <br><br>Mr Wong said cooperation with Malaysian and Indonesian authorities remain good and these countries have tightened their border security. <br><br>Mr Wong also said that Mas Selamat will not be of immediate danger if he is on his own and is unable to access any materials that can cause any harm. However, he cautioned that this might not be the case in the long-term. <br><br>While taking all necessary precautions, Mr Wong urged members of the public not to be cowed and go on living life as normal. -CNA/vm </em></span></p>

              <p>Sad thing is, when Mas Kastari hears the bark a mile away, he would have gone in opposite direction.</p>

              <p>I do not know what you mean by tracker dogs. These dogs are trained to follow the scent of criminals and lead officers to him/her. Feel free to contact K-9 and ask for a demonstration. They have a pit at Woodlands Checkpoint. They can give a demonstration there too.</p>

              <p>They will not disclose the usage of such equipment for operations. If you see them, than you`ll know it`s there like K-9. If you look to the skies over Bukit timah on the day of the escape, you will see a toy aeroplane <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Even if they do not want to disclose, they can merely mentioned that military reconaissance equipment is being used. None of that.</p>

              <p>A lot of people are surprised that the fugitive has yet to be found given Singapore`s advanced state. Some people have even gone to the extent of linking this to the 3G SAF. This is not surprising. It`s our first time to graple with such a situation in a long time.</p>
              <p>However, this completely misses the cruz of the issue. A lot of the equipment which the SAF and SPF have are for large-scale conventional scenarios; wars, military conflicts, riots, civil unrest, etc. They are not meant for sucking out individual fugitive rats who merge with the native population and environment. Try and ask the police or SAf to find your missing tabby cat which ran away with a handsome tom-cat. See if they can find it or not. You can bring all the best radars in the world and try and scan for the missing cat. It will still be very hard to locate the missing tabby cat.</p>
              <p>So, it`s a totally different ball game we are talking about here.<strong> The</strong><em> </em><strong>tactical and strategic picture is completely different.</strong> That is why many terrorists are still on the run in many developed countries with advance equipment and systems. That is why Osama is still free. That is also why there are many people still wanted by the Singapore police. That is also why there are many missing persons yet to be found.</p>
              <p>In the current situation, the best form of equipment is still your eyes, noses and brains. It takes a lot of physical effort and manpower. And that is what the police have been doing. At the same time, the police and other enforcement agencies would still have to focus on the daily routine of keeping Singapore safe from criminal elements. The public can also help by keeping thier senses attuned to signs of Kastari. A little understanding will go a long way towards resolving the Kastari problem.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>the police made critical flaws by not making the escape public soon after, any witnesses to the incident would have been rendered useless as few could recollect after a 4 hour lapse....also, the information about his limp came only after 2 days which is also too late as the public is on a look out for a limping man, now we're told it's only obvious when he quickens his pace or running......for all the high salaries they pay themselves, they still make schoolboy errors.....</div>
