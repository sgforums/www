              <p>If he is still in Singapore, he must be hiding in the home of a supporter. Short of a nation-wide door-to-door search, he will remain hidden for some time to come.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It won't be impossible to find him though...the police can simply tap the phone lines of his family, friends and anyone who could have contact with him in the past. Sooner or later, he or his family/friends will want to contact him or let slip something in conversation. The police can then arrest him together with all his contacts...this may yet turn out to be a blessing in disguise. Use Mas Selamat to identify the larger group of sympathizers that are so far hidden from view.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only thing is: once they re-capture him, make sure he is crippled in <strong>BOTH </strong>legs permanently.</p>

              <p>All that could be said has been said. How Mas Selamat escaped is still a mystery to us. All the officials (except MM Lee) are gagged due to "on going investigations". Did Mas Selamat escape in the first place, and if he did, did he tunnel out, pole vaulted, dashed er... limped out, climbed out of windows, walked out, crawled out, hanged beneath vehicles, followed garbage out, vanished spiritually, karate chopped guard and escape, used omega and slide out, erroneously released, escaped like in Jet Li movie, like John Rambo, like Took Leng How.</p>
              <p>COI report akan datang. One month from about a week after the escape.</p>

              <p>Hambali, Azahari, Mohd Top all had encounters with the pollice, and they had escaped, and was not seen or heard of, for months thereafter. Although Hambali has been caught, Azahari shot dead, Mohd Top is still hiding, since his narrow escape months ago. That is their SOP.</p>
              <p>It is very likely that Mas Selamat will do likewise. He is hole up in a sympathesizer's hideout (flat), with absolutely no contact with the outside world, even with families. The sympathesizers are limited to two or three members so as to maintain secrecy. He has the training, and the discipline to endure the life of a prisoner.</p>
              <p>He knows life must go on, and they can't be searching for him for ever.</p>

              <p>During Election 2006, when James Gomez apologise after
              realising that he had wrongly suggested that the Election
              Department officials may have misplacing some papers that
              he claimed he had submitted - LKY slammed him and the Worker's
              Party leaders for not doing more.</p>
              <p>If an apology was not accepted for a wrong statement that
              affected the integrity of the Election Officials - should we
              now accept an apology from the Minister himself for an act of
              complacency in his rank and file for the escape of
              MSK ?</p>
              <p>By the same standard of measure that LKY placed responsibility
              for the actions of subordinates - in holding the WP Leadership
              responsible - should we not similarly hold the leadership of this
              Government to be responsible for the actions of the rank and file
              that led to the escape of a person whom they have recognised to be
              a Category ONE threat to the security of Singapore ?</p>

              <p>The beauty of this leadership is that they will only say things that are beneficial to them. But when a similar situation occurs that require them to act like what they accuse others of not doing, they will just pretend that this is not required.</p>
              <p>Double standards, as always</p>

              <p>pleez lah, mas selamat is a threat in this region, not USA.</p>
              <p>why would the USA place stricter restriction? i think MSK is `small fly' in their opinion. they got bigger worries/targets.</p>
              <p>not easy for MSK to get into US even if he wants to. international border control in US is quite strict. you need to be fingerprinted before you are allowed in.</p>
