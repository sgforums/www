              <p>What I meant was, there are several leaders in JI and Selamat is one of them. JI is also related to Al Qaeda where also several leaders exist.  I used the word 'leader' to mean one of the leaders. Someone who is one of the many leaders can also be called a leader right?</p>

              ======================================================
              http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,...,171686,00.html? 
              DAYS TO PREPARE FOR $1M 'MAS HUNT'
              *Lured by $1 million reward, 3 S'pore men quit private sector jobs for Mas Selamat hunt
              *They'll live on savings for a year while infiltrating local communities
              
              ARE these bounty hunters for real?
              
              Their quarry: Escaped terrorist Mas Selamat Kastari, who now has a $1 million reward on his head.
              
              According to their spokesman, these three Singaporeans have quit their jobs so they can look for their target in Indonesia.
              
              Why? For a million bucks and perhaps a chance to appear as heroes.
              
              But the hunt could lead to injury or even death when terrorists turn into desperados.
              
              And they could get into serious legal problems hunting fugitives on foreign soil, or even spark a diplomatic row.
              
              For all the risk, they could end up with nothing after months of frustration.
              
              But this is not stopping the three men, all in their 20s, who have resigned from their jobs in the private sector this week to try their luck.
              
              COMMANDO TRAINING
              
              The trio, who had undergone commando training during their national service, are heading to Indonesia today.
              
              The three men, who have been volunteers with Crime Library since 2005, contacted its founder, Mr Joseph Tan, on Tuesday to seek his opinion about their plans.
              
              Mr Tan, 42, who is acting as their spokesman and their point of contact in Singapore, said: 'They are not my children, but I feel like a father to them.
              
              'If I were 20 years younger, I would join them. I may also become a part-millionaire in the process.'
              
              Mr Tan declined to reveal details about the men for fear of blowing their cover. They also turned down requests for an interview.
              
              Anti-terrorist professionals spend many months training before they carry out big missions, but the trio are off after barely five days of preparation.
              
              Their aim is to blend into local communities in Indonesia and to seek leads that might pinpoint the hideout of the Jemaah Islamiah (JI) leader.
              
              Anti-terror agencies in the region have failed so far to track down the fugitive after a four-month search.
              
              Yet the bounty hunters believe they stand a chance to strike paydirt.
              
              The call of a million dollars is strong. The bounty, offered by two anonymous businessmen, is Singapore's largest ever.
              
              Mr Tan said their first aim is to try to work out Mas Selamat's escape route. One of their theories is that he could have left Singapore from a fishing port in Jurong.
              
              The men have some savings to tide them over their first year in Indonesia, Mr Tan said.
              
              They plan to gain the trust of the locals who could help them get closer to the JI cells there.
              
              But is there a danger they might get indoctrinated as well?
              
              Mr Tan's reply: 'I'm not worried that they will get converted, because terrorists don't get $1 million as a reward.'
              
              To help the effort, Mr Tan sent out an e-mail with Mas Selamat's picture, to alert people in Malaysia, Indonesia and China to be on the lookout.
              
              Mr Tan has helped solved about 440 missing person cases since he founded Crime Library in 2001.
              
              The former policeman said: 'With the $1 million offer, we can borrow eyes in other countries, turning the people in our network to become bounty hunters too.'
              
              CREATED A BUZZ
              
              The reward has also created a buzz in the security industry, including those in neighbouring countries.
              
              Mr Ponno Kalastree, 61, managing director of security and investigations agency Mainguard International, has mobilised agents in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines to look out for Mas Selamat.
              
              He said: 'The reward will be a real motivation. If they find him, they can live comfortably for the rest of their lives.'
              
              Dr SM Jegan, a director of Kokusai Security, has offered an additional $10,000 from his own pocket if his staff members in Singapore and network in Indonesia are able to give information on Mas Selamat's whereabouts.
              
              'Mas Selamat's escape has affected our reputation as a safe country.
              
              ' I am also concerned for the safety of Singaporeans,' he said.
              
              Some terrorists have been caught after rewards were offered for their capture.
              
              9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured in Pakistan in 2003 after a US$25 million ($34m) bounty was offered.
              
              Last year, four Filipinos were paid US$10 million after Abu Sayyaf leaders Khadaffy Janjalani and Abu Sulaiman were discovered and killed.
              
              The Indonesian-born Mas Selamat escaped from a detention centre here in February.
              
              Officials say they have no information to confirm that he has left Singapore or that he has escaped to Indonesia.
              
              Anyone with information on Mas Selamat may call the Counter Terrorism Centre hotline at 1800-262 6473 or the police at 999.

              <p>$1m is not worth it the effort. these 3 chaps are naive and perhaps blinded by the money. but coming from singapore, it's wierd tt $1m appeals to them. </p>
              <p>you need a lot more $$$. the only way he will get caught is somebody close to him or know his movements intimately rat on him. the person who did that will need to relocate (far away), change his identity and start a new, low profile life. $1m cannot even last that someone 10-15years.</p>

              Well, their training in the SAF Commandos would have made them tough physically and emotionally. I always encourage citizen action rather than wait for garmen NATO.
              
              I believe these guys will be working with at least one local Indonesian contact. So it might be a 4 way split $250k each if they succeed.

              Why do I get the feeling that Oliver North is directing this drama?  Intel received on whereabouts of wanted terrorist.  Because of political and other sensitivities, the government cannot send its troop to capture the terrorist.  Or maybe they don't want to capture the terrorist but want him dead, which they of course cannot disclose to the trusting public.  So first comes the donors, then 3 well-trained army guys to carry out whatever Uncles Lee and Lee wants.
              
              Hollywood drama in the making!

              <p>probably that is the case. how many people actually will believe the CCTV is not working? so no one can confirm he did really escape. the guards that are suppose to guard him can be make up as well. and why the media keep say he is still in singapore? died inside that why say he is in singapore? playing around with words?</p>
