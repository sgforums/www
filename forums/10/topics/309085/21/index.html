              <p>Isn't that the case with Singapore politicians, find a scape goat to shoulder all the blame, while our highly competent continues collecting his few million dollar paycheck.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I doubt he has the balls, honour or responsibility to own up his incompetence in the security breach. Just look at the honour of the Japanese Ministers, if something goes wrong, they will take responsibility for the management of their Ministry and not play football (pass the blame to someone else). I think honour is something really lacking in the attributes of most of our Ministers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I only pray that Mas Selamat Kastari goes into hiding elsewhere and not continue with his terrorism activities, because from hence on all future terrorism deaths will be the result of Singapore's incompetence.</p>

              <p>my question is how come he can escape?</p>
              <p>is it inside job (bribe 1 of the gurkha guard and thus
              escape)?</p>
              <p>also, how come it's gurkha soldiers guarding this important
              prision??!!!!!!! shouldn't it be singapore's own police force? is
              changi prison guarded by gurkhas or some outsourced cisco / private
              security firm as well???!!!</p>
              <p>with immediate effect, we should all avoid:</p>
              <p>1) changi airport (especially T3)</p>
              <p>2) CBD area and gahmen buildings</p>
              <p>anyway, terrorists very likely won't bomb our HDB, so we're
              quite safe.</p>
              <p>i also hope and plead with them not to bomb MRT stations,
              because there's not much people also (i take MRT to work
              everyday).</p>
              <p>want to bomb, bomb elsewhere. maybe some place where there's
              lots of planes or VIPs.</p>

              <p>having gurkha guarding is a good idea. our singapore police majority are malays. they might not be bribed, but they could be symphatetic to the cause. or maybe he brainwashed them with his extremist preaching.</p>
              <p>gurkha firstly, aren't muslim, they're neutral, and they are fiercely loyal to whoever pays them. they're like.. merceneries.</p>
              <p>its a good idea to have them to guard the prison instead of SPF. we all know how useless they are.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Singapore says sorry after terror group leader escapes, massive manhunt launched</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE - The Singapore government apologized Thursday for a rare
              security lapse after an alleged Islamic terror leader escaped from
              jail, triggering a massive manhunt across the island nation for a man
              who walks with a limp.</p>
              <p>Authorities said Mas Selamat Kastari, who once allegedly plotted to
              hijack a plane and crash it into Singapore's international Changi
              airport, slipped away from a detention center Wednesday. Mas Selamat is
              said to be commander of the al-Qaida-linked Jemaah Islamiyah's
              Singapore arm.</p>
              <p>Minister of Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng said Mas
              Selamat escaped after being taken from his cell to go to a room to wait
              for his family who were scheduled for a visit.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat, 47, was granted permission to visit the washroom and then escaped, Wong said in Parliament.</p>
              <p>"This
              should never have happened," said Wong, who is also the deputy prime
              minister. "I am sorry that it had. An independent investigation is
              under way and we should not speculate on what and how it happened."</p>
              <p>Security
              breaches are virtually unheard of in Singapore, a small and densely
              populated island whose sophisticated intelligence system has been
              liberally used to ensure order and safety.</p>
              <p>Among its biggest
              success was pre-empting alleged plots to bomb the U.S. Embassy, the
              American Club and government buildings in 2001 _ schemes in which Mas
              Selamat allegedly had a hand.</p>
              <p>Singapore, a close ally of the
              United States, was named an al-Qaida target in a transcript from
              alleged al-Qaida operative Khalid Sheikh Mohamed's Combatant Status
              Review Tribunal, held last year at the U.S. military detention center
              in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p>
              <p>The Home Affairs Ministry said in a
              statement that Mas Selamat fled the Whitley Road Detention Center in a
              wooded residential area in central Singapore. It said he walks with a
              limp.</p>
              <p>"Extensive police resources have been deployed to track him
              down," the statement said. Mas Selamat was not known to be armed, but
              Wong said he was a security threat.</p>
              <p>A security blockade spread
              out around the detention center. The facility _ guarded by elite
              Nepalese Gurkha guards _ is enclosed by high fences topped with barbed
              wire. It has closed-circuit television surveillance cameras around its
              perimeter.</p>
              <p>Thousands of police officers and military personnel
              set up roadblocks to check passing cars. Dozens of riot police and
              military trucks parked along main roads.</p>
              <p>The Gurkhas fanned out
              in the snake-infested forest nearby, checking vacant bungalows and
              peering down drains and back alleys of private housing estates.</p>
              <p>Students
              arriving for class at a nearby girls' school were ushered through the
              gates by teachers and parents to an assembly hall where a school
              official told them "not to roam around."</p>
              <p>Security was tightened at the city-state's land, air and sea entry ports, Wong said.</p>
              <p>It
              takes less than an hour to drive from one end of Singapore to the
              other. The affluent, highly modernized Southeast Asian country is only
              a short boat ride from Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Indonesian
              security officials said they would work with Singapore to prepare for
              the likelihood that Mas Selamat might attempt to come over.</p>
              <p>Mas
              Selamat "would think Indonesia is the safest place" where it would
              likely be easier to hide, said Nasir Abbas, a former Jemaah Islamiyah
              operative who now works closely with Indonesian police.</p>
              <p>Malaysia's
              police chief Musa Hassan said his forces were on the lookout and have
              informed border authorities, but have made no other special
              arrangements to tighten border security.</p>
              <p>"We have not received any special request from Singapore as yet," Musa said. "We have not sighted him yet."</p>
              <p>Singapore's
              Home Affairs ministry said Mas Selamat's plane hijack plot was in
              retaliation for the country's arrest and detention of some of his
              fellow Jemaah Islamiyah members in a crackdown on the militant group's
              operatives here.</p>
              <p>The alleged schemes were never carried out.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat fled Singapore in December 2001 following the arrests of 13 other suspected Jemaah Islamiyah members.</p>
              <p>The
              ministry's Web site said Indonesian authorities detained him in
              February 2003 on charges related to possession of falsified
              identification documents. They deported him to Singapore in February
              2006, the ministry said.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat, said to be a father of
              four, had since been held in custody under Singapore's Internal
              Security Act that allows indefinite detention without trial.</p>
              <p>Since
              2002, Jemaah Islamiyah has been blamed for a series of terror attacks
              that have killed more than 250 people, most of them in Indonesia.
              Scores of its suspected operatives have been arrested across Southeast
              Asia since 2000.</p>

              <p>JAKARTA: Indonesia has stepped up security along its border with
              Singapore following the escape of Mas Selamat Kastari from Whitley Road
              Detention Centre in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Mr Dino Pattu Djalal, Indonesia’s Presidential Spokesman, said
              Jakarta is coordinating very closely with Singapore’s security and
              intelligence agencies.</p>
              <p>Detik.com an online news portal quoted Mr
              Dino as saying that the two neighbouring countries have always
              cooperated to maintain the border’s security. — CNA/so</p>

              <p>It's not his security and safety at risk here.</p>

              <p>The toilet trick works everytime. Took Leng How used it. I have seen it many times in Holly, Bollywood movies, and even Ch 8 dramas. But it seems our Home Team has not caught on to it yet. It seems prisoners also realise their talents everyday, what do you think they are thinking of, when they <em>bayrak</em>.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat is smart, he just need to hole up and keep still, in some unlikely place. Drain or some secondary forest. The police action in Woodlands, Tuas, and Changi Airport is just wayang for political appearances. Its something the government must do. And Mas Selamat knows it.</p>
              <p>Getting out of Singapore is easy. Indonesians burglars have done it countless of times.</p>

              <p>Isn't that under the purview of our Minister of Home Affairs, I have no privy to such information.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are in a supervisory position, either in a big company or whatever, isn't it your duty to ensure the work of your juniors.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>But being someone in a top position of managing the Ministry of Home Affairs, he is not aware the ongoings of his organisation?</p>
              <p>Surely, a CEO must know how the department functions, where are the organisation's strengths and weaknesses.</p>

              <p>In my humble opinion...</p>
              <p>I would like to suggest to the government to start developing high-security prison<br>s.</p>
              <p><br>Build a high security prison on an island. Like Sentosa is a specialized island for tourism, the government can select and develop an island to build a  specialized military/ security island which <br>contain the high-security prison only.</p>
