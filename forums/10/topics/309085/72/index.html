              <p><br>Well, the truth is, neither you nor anyone in pore can say for sure where abang is. Try to disagree to this statement and convince me otherwise.</p>
              <p>There is no official report as to in which country is abang now. There are only some info that he COULD BE in indonesia.</p>
              <p>'Could be' is not 'IS'.</p>
              <p>but I wonder, does this mean, no one knows for sure where is abang? By this, does it mean that no one can say abang IS in pore?</p>
              <p>If so, could there be an official report informing the public the actual status that no one knows for sure where is abang and that investigations are still on-going? Would this not be more clear report to the public? So many could have, before this week, still assume that Abang IS still probably in the pore based on some info they heard that there is no evidence that abang has left. </p>
              <p>I would like to suggest that there be a report that says, there is no evidence that abang has not left the pore ALSO.</p>
              <p>This is also a form of TRUTH.</p>
              <p>So, its a Truth that there is no evidence abang has left the pore. AT THE SAME TIME, the other TRUTH is that  there is no evidence abang has not left the pore.</p>
              <p>This kind of report would make things clearer as some naive people may not be able to comprehend well, that is, failed in basic news / language comprehension.</p>
              <p>But now, since the news says there is some clues from the captees that abang MAY BE in indonesia, then, I am glad the public is now informed about it. This makes a world of difference.</p>
              <p>don't know does not mean no.</p>
              <p>don't know means don't know. Clueless.</p>

              <p><strong>MHA says no intelligence or info to suggest Mas Selamat is in Indonesia<br>By Lee Foong Ming, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 06 July 2008 2335 </strong></p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: The Home Affairs Ministry says there has been no intelligence or information to date which suggests that Mas Selamat Kastari is in Indonesia.</p>
              <p>However Singapore authorities have been working closely with their Indonesian counterparts and other security and intelligence partners in their on-going security operation to locate and apprehend the Jemaah Islamiyah leader.</p>
              <p>The Ministry's statement came after Indonesian media reported that Indonesian police had received information suggesting that Mas Selamat had slipped into the country following his escape from Singapore's Whitley Road Detention Centre in February this year.</p>
              <p>As to newspaper reports that Indonesian authorities are on the hunt for three Singaporean JI members who had escaped a round-up of JI terrorists in Singapore in 2001, the Ministry said two of the three men identified, "Ishak" and "Rosid" are probably two men who are already under detention in Singapore.</p>
              <p>They are Ishak Mohamed Noohu and Mohamed Rashid Zainal Abidin, both of whom had been arrested overseas.</p>
              <p>Mohamed Rashid was detained in June 2006, at the same time as Mas Selamat Kastari, while Ishak Mohamad Noohu was detained in June 2007. - CNA/de</p>
