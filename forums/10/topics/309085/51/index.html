              <h1 class="clr">S’pore authorities get over 1,100 phone tips for fugitive JI leader</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Singapore authorities have received more than 1,100 tips
              from the public in its manhunt for an alleged terrorist leader who
              escaped jail two weeks ago, police said on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat bin Kastari, the alleged leader of Jemaah Islamiyah (JI)
              which was blamed for deadly attacks including the 2002 Bali bombings,
              vanished on February 27 after asking to use the toilet in the Whitley
              detention centre.</p>
              <p>More than 1,100 phoned—in tips had been
              received from the public as of Monday after police appealed for
              information on Mas Selamat, police director of operations Wong Hong
              Kuan told AFP.</p>
              <p>A number of false alarms have been triggered by
              information that Indonesia—born Mas Selamat walks with a limp. People
              have also sent in tips via e—mail.</p>
              <p>Security forces were still
              conducting searches almost island—wide, with a focus on forested
              tracts, though it was not "neglecting the urban built—up areas," Wong
              told AFP.</p>
              <p>The search involving police, the military and the
              Gurkha soldiers is the biggest manhunt in the history of Singapore.
              Pictures of the wanted man have been plastered across Singapore and
              even sent to mobile phone subscribers.</p>
              <p>Security forces in
              neighbouring Indonesia and Malaysia were also on the lookout for Mas
              Selamat, but Singapore insists that he is unlikely to have fled the
              country.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Sunday that
              Singapore remained optimistic it can capture him. Mr Lee said: "I’ve
              been talking to the ministers responsible and I think we have a pretty
              good chance of catching him, provided he’s still in Singapore."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile,
              Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said Singapore should brace itself for an
              attack if Mas Selamat manages to flee Singapore and rejoin his JI
              comrades.</p>
              <p>47—year—old Mas Selamat was accused of plotting to
              hijack a plane in order to crash it into Changi Airport in 2001, but he
              was never charged in court. He was being held under an internal
              security law that allows for detention without trial.</p>
              <p>Interpol has issued an international red alert for Mas Selamat. — AFP/vm</p>

              <p>There is also an elaborate write up of the experience of Singaporean Catholic Church Social Worker - Miss Tan Fong Har - who was arrested under the ISA, charged by then PM LKY as being a member of an underground Communist cell.</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Fong_Har">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Fong_Har</a></p>
              <p>Her experience described in - { <a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/tfhmemo.htm">http://www.singapore-window.org/tfhmemo.htm</a> } - a synopsis of her experiencewill surely collaborate the writings of Francis Seow - to the happenings inside the Whitley Road Detention Centre operated by the Internal Security Department.</p>
              <p>The omnipotent power that is wielded by this Government will allow the unchecked powers to erase any citizen from the citizen's roll.</p>
              <p>Individual Singaporeans are not safe from this system created by Singapore Inc, that is willing to  manipulate the ISD unashamedly for personal political goals.</p>
              <p>Any Singaporean can become an invisible entity in this Little Red Dot - much like Chia Thye Poh, who was incarcerated for 32 years without trial, despite the claims of evidence against him - resulting in at least three generations of Singaporeans not even knowing what has transpired.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did MSK escape from the Detention Centre, or is he probably being made to pay the ultimate price for refusing to co-operate during interrogation ?</p>
              <p>Has he been erased from the roll of prisoners held by this Government under the Internal Security Act ?</p>
              <p>He is probably held in a perpetual limbo in the Twilight World of the ISD lock-ups - and Singaporeans are being put through the nonsensical inconvenience so as to make the officially sanctioned escape story more credible.</p>

              <p><strong>... this is SO ANNOYING.!</strong></p>
              <p>.. I don't know to believe this news article or not...</p>
              <p>... could well be further attempt to enforce public believes that MSK is still alive...</p>
              <p>... perosnally, I now think MSK's dead - long before February...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>======================</strong></p>
              <p><strong>'I think I saw Mas Selamat'</strong>  <br> <br>A FORTY-YEAR-OLD mother of three was on her way home from work the afternoon Mas Selamat Kastari escaped from the Whitley Road Detention Centre when she spotted a limping man along Thomson Road.</p>
              <p>She was on Mount Pleasant Road, a short distance from the detention centre, when she saw him approach a stranger.</p>
              <p>Although she saw him on Feb 27, it was not until three days later that she realised he might have been the fugitive Jemaah Islamiah leader.</p>
              <p><br>A lecturer in communication skills, she said it was a report in this newspaper that prompted her to call the police. She asked not to be named.</p>
              <p>This is what she told YEO GHIM LAY and CHONG CHEE KIN:</p>
              <p>'I had just finished my work that day and was heading back to my home in Bishan. I work in Stevens Road and usually knock off at about 4.30pm to 4.45pm.</p>
              <p>I was at Mount Pleasant Road and waiting to turn into Thomson Road when I had to stop at the junction. That was about 5pm.</p>
              <p>I saw a Malay man on the other side of Thomson Road, walking on the pavement against the flow of traffic on that side.</p>
              <p>He was walking towards the bus-stop in front of the St Joseph's Institution (SJI) International school.</p>
              <p>He had a limp in his left leg. He was dressed in some sort of brown or beige outfit which looked like a T-shirt. He was a little on the plump side, but not fat, and wasn't very tall. He looked very similar to the description they released later of Mas Selamat.</p>
              <p>He didn't look well dressed - he was very scruffy, like a vagrant.</p>
              <p>There was a Chinese woman dressed all in white walking on the pavement towards him and she was talking on her mobile phone.</p>
              <p>When they came towards each other, he held out his hand, looking like he was asking for money, but she ignored him.</p>
              <p>I stayed to watch because I was worried he might do something to the woman.</p>
              <p>But then he started crossing the road. There wasn't a pedestrian crossing, and he put up his hand to ask the approaching motorists to let him pass.</p>
              <p>He stopped at the middle of the road, where there was a barricade. He was facing me then, and I could see his face from the front.</p>
              <p>He looked very disoriented, very dishevelled, like he was in a daze. He didn't look like he knew where he was going, or like he was looking for someone.</p>
              <p>All this took a few minutes and I had to move off because there was a car behind me.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure where the man went after that.</p>
              <p>It didn't occur to me at the time that this could have been the terrorist who escaped, because the news didn't come out until that evening.</p>
              <p>I only realised that he might have been Mas Selamat on Saturday morning, when I read in The Straits Times about a similar possible sighting near the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped in Toa Payoh Rise, just down the road from where I had been.</p>
              <p>There was a side profile picture in the papers, and it looked like him. He wasn't clean shaven, had a beard, and looked scruffy.</p>
              <p>I called the police. That afternoon an investigating officer met me and took me to the place. I showed the officer where I saw the man.</p>
              <p>If the man I saw was Mas Selamat, it didn't look like it was a planned escape. He didn't look like he was waiting for someone to pick him up.'</p>

              This mother of three is going to be fine or go to jail for the false information?

              <p>Three days later!!!</p>
              <p>A lecturer in communications skills!. There is some major communications breakdown. See, timely information is crucial. She didn't know of the Great Escape that very day ah? Or she knew, but only knew of the clothing three days later?</p>
              <p>If what is reported is correct, then the whole machinery of the police force is looking for MSK in the wrong place.</p>
