              <p>I think abang is damm good at hiding. Even having deployed numerous number of dollars into the operation , no one can smell abang. no dogs too.</p>
              <p>I suspect he is hiding underground. among rotting stuff like roots , very stealth until cannot stealth and not moving much , somehow he is aber to control his heart beat like almost not pumping at all, thus avoiding detection.</p>
              <p>this is a fictitious wild imagination onlys.</p>
              <p>How can someone not be found in the pore?</p>
              <p>Tell me. Suggest a reason.</p>
              <p>I worry. I worry about this case since, i wonder if next time my pet goes missing, will anyone be aber to find it? What do you guys think?</p>

              <p>Sekali caught liao. But want to wait till election times then say. To show how "effective" the Home team is. Then WKS can run for next election because the next batch lackey's training not complete, haven't ORD.</p>

              <p>sorry i din read all the post here, dunno posted or not...</p>
              <p>i kapo this from somewhere.</p>
              <p> Maids - No OFF DAY (U Know why?) <br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&gt; There are several simple reasons why many Singaporean employers are<br>&gt; reluctant to give their maids a day off.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If the maid runs away, the gahmen will fine the employer $5,000.<br>&gt; If the maid commits any crime such as theft, the government will fine<br>&gt; the employer $5,000..<br>&gt; If the maid is caught having sex with someone, the government will fine<br>&gt; the employer $5,000.<br>&gt; If the maid gets pregnant, the gahmen will also fine the employer,<br>&gt; you guessed it right, $5,000.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you didn't know any of the above, then either you do not employ a<br>&gt; maid, or you didn't read the small print of the MOM<br>&gt; work permit conditions.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Many employers are afraid that if their maid has a day off and gets into<br>&gt; trouble, the employer will not only have to solve the trouble, but also<br>&gt; have to fork out $5,000 as a free gift to the government. Pay And Pay.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; There is a ring of gross unfairness somewhere in this The employer gets<br>&gt; punished not for something he did, but for something that somebody else<br>&gt; (the maid) did.<br>&gt; Furthermore, once the maid leaves the employer's residence, the employer<br>&gt; has no way of monitoring where the maid goes and what she does there,<br>&gt; when she takes her panties off to show her Bangla, indian or thai<br>&gt; boyfriends her "inner beauty"<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Compare the situation with MS's escape, and Gahmen's determined<br>&gt; defence of WKanasai.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; MS ran away.. But maids rules don't apply and Gahmen said that<br>&gt; WKanaSai was not at fault and should not be punished in any way.<br>&gt; The<br>&gt; reason being that WKanaSai personally did not do anything which<br>&gt; allowed MS to escape. And the mistakes that were made were<br>&gt; "honest mistakes". Is the employer making a mistake by employing a<br>&gt; maid??<br>&gt; <br>&gt; However, if your maid runs away, honest mistake on your part or not, it<br>&gt; IS your fault and you SHOULD be punished. Even if you did not personally<br>&gt; do anything to let her run away (apart from giving her a day off).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Similarly, if your maid becomes pregnant, it IS your fault (even if you<br>&gt; had given your _____ a day off and thus did not personally do anything<br>&gt; to make her pregnant) and you SHOULD be punished.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What can I say? Maids are not terrorists and are less likely to blow up<br>&gt; airports, etc.. but you get hammered anyway when they put a foot wrong.<br>&gt; Better to be a Gahmen than to be a maid employer huh?<br>&gt; Definitely the pay is better.<br>&gt; <br>What do u think?</p>

              <p>I think if on their day off, maids take away somethings which dun belong to them and run away, I suspect, they may be found only after long time. Altho the Pore is so small, finding a missing person can be as difficult as finding our much missed abang. unless somene can enlightingmen me why he still not found. No  offens to anyone, I shall say that even if any super squad from any country will also not find abang upto now. like this say fair fair right?</p>
              <p>There seems to be a way not to get caught or for a long long time within the PORE.</p>
              <p>I am not able to comprehend why it is said confidently that abang is still in the PORE despite no proof of his whereabouts and nil sightings. No one has smelled abang, at least not reported.</p>
              <p>Then , lo and behold! eureka! I realised what could be the reason.</p>
              <p>Time will tell.</p>

              <p>That's why I've been telling people. We must not give the two-third majority to the Pay And Pay....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the GRC system, they purposely make it harder for the oppositions to win the elections on the pretext that all minorities must be represented in the GEC system.... full of crap I say....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you really believe in this century, that only the malays can fight for the malays, only the indians can fight fopr the indians and only the chinese can fight for the chinese? Bull**** I say.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In our current generation, the country has grown up, as well as its people. Just look at Malaysia.... even Anwar Ibrahim (a malay) is willing to fight for the chinese, indians and the rest of the popultion...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Same goes for our beloved PORE, who says a chinese cannot fight for the malays and indians here, or a malay or indian to fight for the chinese?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is important, is the character and integrity of a person whom we want to represent us as a MP.... and the trust we give him or her..... not based on skin colour, race or religion..... that's what I strongly feel...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just look at our current two elected opposition leaders.... are they only fighting for the sake of the chinese in the their constituents?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't think so.... that's why we must have more people like them to be voted into parliament so that the Pay and Pay can't anything they like without anyone stopping them....... sigh......</p>
