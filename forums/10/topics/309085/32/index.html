              <p>I pity those poor truck drivers from Malaysia, some of them since yesterday have not taken food.</p>

              <p>The government never provide them with some kind of food, really selfish.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the causeway jams continue, I can safely say our import of agricultural products will decrease substantially and prices will go up even further.</p>

              <p><span>PESHAWAR, Pakistan: At least 35 people were killed and 50 wounded
              by a suicide bomber at a funeral in northwest Pakistan Friday for a
              police official killed earlier in the day, officials said.
              <br> <br>Nearly 1,000 people were attending the funeral in the town of
              Mingora in the Swat Valley, where troops are battling Islamic
              militants, when the bomb went off, security officials said.
              <br> <br> "At least 35 people were killed and some 50 others were injured in the suicide blast," a senior security official told AFP.
              <br> <br> "Three police officials and a son and a cousin of the martyred police official were also among the dead," he added.
              <br> <br>"Nobody has claimed the responsibility for the attack, but we
              suspect the involvement of miscreants (militants) against whom the
              military operation was being carried out," the official said.
              <br> <br> Authorities had already imposed a night-time curfew in Swat district since early this year, he said.
              <br> <br>The police official and three policemen were killed earlier Friday
              when a roadside bomb blew up their vehicle in the northwestern town of
              Lakki Marwat.
              <br> <br> President Pervez Musharraf "strongly condemned" the suicide attack.
              <br> <br> "Such cowardly acts of terrorists will not dent the government's resolve to fight terrorism and extremism," Musharraf said.
              <br> <br>North West Frontier Province health minister Syed Kamal Shah
              earlier told AFP the local hospital was struggling to cope with the
              wounded.
              <br> <br>"We are facing difficulty in the relief operation because the blast
              also damaged an electricity transformer in the area," Shah said.
              <br> <br> "We are still retrieving injured and dead from the blast site and taking them to hospital," Shah said.
              <br> <br>The hospital facilities could not cope and there were not enough
              emergency supplies due to the ongoing military operation against
              militants in the area, he said.
              <br> <br>"People coming from the blast site say that human limbs were
              scattered on blood-soaked ground," hospital official Khaleeq Khan told
              AFP.
              <br> <br>Khan said more than 33 bodies had been brought in to the hospital
              and relatives of victims had thronged the facility searching for their
              loved ones and in this chaos they were not able to track and register
              every casualty.
              <br> <br> Pakistani troops have been battling Islamic militants in Swat Valley, a once-popular tourist site.
              <br> <br> Regional commanding officer Major General Nasser Janjua said Monday there were 400 hardcore militants hiding in the valley.
              <br> <br>Troops have been searching for Maulana Fazlullah, a radical cleric
              who has demanded Islamic law in the valley. The army launched a major
              offensive in November to drive his followers out of Swat.
              <br> <br> Fazlullah is known as "Mullah Radio" for broadcasting fiery speeches over his private FM radio station.
              <br> <br>The mountainous, snow-capped Swat region is renowned for its
              ancient Buddhist relics and once attracted large numbers of foreign and
              local tourists, but has been beset by recent violence blamed on
              pro-Taliban militants.
              <br> <br>Hundreds of people have died across northwest Pakistan in recent
              months in clashes between militants and security forces and in a wave
              of suicide attacks blamed on the rebels.
              <br> <br>The army's top medical officer, Lieutenant General Mushtaq Baig,
              was killed Monday in a suicide attack in the garrison city of
              Rawalpindi which the military said was likely in retaliation for
              operations against militants near the Afghan border.
              <br> <br>Pakistan has veered between making peace deals with militants and
              launching major offensives in the five years since full-scale
              operations started in the tribal areas in early 2003.
              <br> <br>Neither policy has worked and the bloodshed last year spread
              further, from the semi-autonomous tribal belt into the country's
              "settled" northwestern regions.
              <br> <br>Last year, about 2,000 people were killed in militant-related
              violence across Pakistan, a frontline state in the US-led "war on
              terrorism." - AFP/ac</span></p>

              <p><strong>JI fugitive Mas Selamat Kastari planning escape to
                  Indonesia</strong><br> <span>Posted: 29 February 2008 1814 hrs</span></p>

              <p><span>Mas Selamat Kastari is hiding in Singapore and planning
                  ways to escape to Indonesia says terrorism expert Rohan
                  Gunaratna.<br> <br> The Singapore-based head of the International Centre for Political
                  Violence and Terrorism Research also told Channel NewsAsia that
                  Kastari doesn't have the capacity to launch any attack right now as
                  he is alone and with one objective, that is to survive and evade
                  capture.<br> <br> "He (Kastari) knows that Singapore is a hostile environment for
                  him" said Dr Rohan. "He knows that if he is in Singapore, he will
                  be captured,someone will inform the authorities."<br> <br> Dr Rohan who has extensively researched the JI, described Kastari
                  as a determined and ruthless terrorist who is an escape
                  artist.<br> <br> "I am shocked by his escape but I am not suprised" said the JI
                  expert, citing a similar attempt made while in custody in
                  Indonesia. He went on to say that Kastari would try to change his
                  appearance and identity although not completely.<br> <br> Singapore officials in their hunt for Kastari have released two
                  photos of the Singapore JI leader both bearded and clean-shaven.
                  They have also been delivering leaflets to homes to inform the
                  public of the wanted man who walks with a limp after being injured
                  while trying to escape in Indonesia.<br> <br> Interpol has been put on alert for Kastari with his photograph and
                  fingerprints sent to 186 countries.<br> <br> According to Dr Rohan, it is hard to be certain if Kastari has any
                  accomplices or whether he had help in escaping from the Whitley
                  Detention Centre. "He does not enjoy public support, even when he
                  planned those attacks in the past, the cells that supported him
                  constituted just a handful of members. Singaporean Muslims are
                  shocked and suprised that a fellow Singaporean wanted to do big
                  attacks like that in Singapore."<br> <br> Kastari had planned to hijack a plane and crash it into Singapore's
                  Changi Airport. According to Dr Rohan, an attack of that scale
                  would have helped elevate Kastari who is now number two in the
                  ranks of the JI.<br> <br> Following his arrest, most of Kastari's known contacts have been
                  arrested or are under close watch. This said the JI expert, will
                  limit Kastari's access to weapons and crimp his capability to plan
                  any attack. - CNA/sf</span></p>

              <p>To me, its more likely that this is a premeditated escape.  And he knows that if he stays on island more than 3 hrs after he breaks out, he'd be manhunted.  Chances are, he also planned to get OUT of Singapore while ISD was quietly searching for him.</p>
              <p> This guy is a terrorist master mind,  a planner of terrorist activities.  Don't tell me he doesn't plan to escape.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Interpol issues global alert for Singapore terror fugitive</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE - Interpol said it has issued a worldwide security alert
              following the escape of an alleged Islamic terror leader from a jail in
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>The international police organization said Friday it put out an
              "Orange Notice" for Mas Selamat Kastari, a suspected commander of the
              al-Qaida-linked Jemaah Islamiyah's Singapore arm.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat,
              47, who is accused of once plotting to hijack a plane and crash it into
              Singapore's international airport, escaped from a detention center
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The Interpol notice was issued to the group's 186 national member bureaus following a request by Singapore, the agency said.</p>
              <p>"When
              it comes to escapes, the first hours are crucial," Interpol's executive
              director of police services, Jean-Michel Louboutin, told The Associated
              Press. "The state of Singapore has put into operation everything that's
              needed to be done. It's a small country, so it's easy to cross and
              leave."</p>
              <p>Louboutin said authorities have "no trail for the
              moment." Mas Selamat is "someone who presents a potential physical
              danger to others, but also a potential danger by organizing future
              bombings," he said.</p>
              <p>The government said Mas Selamat escaped
              because of a "security lapse" at the detention center. He had been
              taken from his cell to a room where he was waiting for his family to
              make a scheduled visit. He escaped after being granted permission to
              visit the washroom, authorities said.</p>
              <p>Singaporean authorities
              have launched a nationwide manhunt for the man they say walks with a
              limp. Police and military personnel set up a blockade around the
              detention center, while security was tightened at land, air and sea
              entry ports.</p>
              <p>Security breaches are virtually unheard of in
              Singapore. Among its security services' biggest successes were
              pre-empting alleged plots to bomb the U.S. Embassy, the American Club
              and government buildings in 2001 _ schemes in which Mas Selamat
              allegedly had a hand.</p>

              <p>There must have been one security lapse arfter another at the Whitley Detention Centre, which allowed Mas  to simply make a sudden decision to break out.</p>
              <p>After the breakout was discovered, it was odd that the Authorities did not consider making the situation public and sought public assistance to watch out for him unitl more then 24 hours later.</p>
              <p>It was sheer stupidity to conduct the manhunt in a limited area12 hours after the escape, and limited the search to an area south of the Whitley Detention Centre.</p>
              <p>How  was a limpining man suppose to cross a busy 8 lane PIE at 4.05 p.m.- from the Police Academy side to the opposite side of the PIE ?</p>
              <p>Thursday news on TV reported the search at the residential area around Chancery Lane  to the Whitley section of the PIE - over a period  of more then 20 hours  since the jail break on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Did no one consulted the Commandos to find out what they will do to survive and evade capture under the same circumstances ?</p>
              <p>The cordon should have gone around the entire area bounded by Thomson Road, Newton Road, Dunearn Road, Lornie-Adam Road - and a simultaneous search of the entire area that will include construction sites and drain culverts.</p>
              <p>The public should have been informed immediately, and not alerted 20 hours later.</p>
              <p>The cocept of ''TOTAL DEFENSE'' failed.</p>

              <p>If he escaped on his own, the likelihood that he is hiding in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve is very high.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If he has other JI accomplices who assisted his escape, most likely he is in some apartment hiding.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But judging from a statement given by the petrol kiosk attendant, most likely he escape on his own, because he was headed to the cemetery.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If he had accomplices, they would have put him in a car and drove off somewhere else to hide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lots of drinkable water in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most likely he would also dig a hole to camouflage and hide.</p>
