              <p>The police a bit stupid, he escaped from Onraet Rd, besides
              heading southwards towards Dunearn Rd, there could be a possibility
              that he had went Eastwards to Thomson Rd, westwards to Bukit Brown
              Cemetery, Northwards to Lornie Rd at MacRitchie Reservoir.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Asumming what the Esso guy said was true and that the guy who
              climbed the hill was Mas Selamat, there is still a possibility that
              he could have taken a bus/took an accomplice car from Whitley Rd at
              CJC. Unless he is hiding inside the woods. Maybe they should check
              specifically, like inside SJI, CJC, SCGS, Barker, Tanglin
              CC too.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Interpol issues alert for Singapore militant escapee</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE (AFP) - - Interpol issued an urgent worldwide alert on Friday
              for an alleged leader of the Jemaah Islamiyah militant network, two
              days after his escape from a detention centre in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat bin Kastari, who was accused of planning to hijack a
              plane and crash it into Singapore's Changi Airport, escaped Wednesday
              from the Whitley Road Detention Centre.</p>
              <p>In a notice on its website, the global police body said it issued the Orange Notice alert following a request by Singapore.</p>
              <p>Orange
              Notices can be issued by Interpol's general secretariat in France for
              any event posing a risk to the safety and security of citizens
              worldwide.</p>
              <p>"Singapore is clearly doing all that it can on a
              national level to locate this fugitive and through issuing an Orange
              Notice, Interpol and all of its member countries can support these
              efforts on an international scale," said Jean-Michel Louboutin,
              Interpol executive director of police services.</p>
              <p>Kastari's photograph and fingerprints will be sent to Interpol's 186 member countries, the agency said.</p>
              <p>Analysts said they believed Kastari would try to flee to Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Sutarman,
              chief of police of Riau Islands province which shares a sea border with
              Singapore, told Indonesia's state-run Antara news agency that the
              city-state "sent us an urgent notice requesting intensified patrols to
              prevent the terrorist from entering Indonesia."</p>
              <p>He said Kastari "possesses good knowledge" about entering the country illegally.</p>
              <p>Indonesian police chief Sutanto told reporters in Jakarta that his force would help Singapore if Kastari makes it to Indonesia.</p>
              <p>"We've taken all important measures," he said, without elaborating.</p>
              <p>Authorities
              have blamed Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) for a string of regional attacks
              including the 2002 bombings on the Indonesian resort island of Bali,
              which killed 202 people, mostly tourists.</p>
              <p>Singapore's Ministry of
              Home Affairs said Friday its manhunt continued with extensive police,
              armed forces and other security resources deployed.</p>
              <p>It said Kastari, a Singaporean who allegedly led JI in the city, walks with a limp and was not known to be armed.</p>
              <p>In
              a refocusing of the search, authorities withdrew the dozens of
              soldiers, special operations police and paramilitary Nepalese Gurkhas
              who had been deployed around the detention centre.</p>
              <p>An AFP
              photographer later saw a group of soldiers and Gurkhas investigating an
              area beneath a highway about three kilometres (two miles) from a bridge
              leading to Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, police arrested another man whom they said made threats after claiming he was the fugitive.</p>
              <p>The
              58-year-old used a public phone to claim he was Kastari and "threatened
              to attack multiple locations," a police statement said.</p>
              <p>Kastari
              fled Singapore in December 2001 following an Internal Security
              Department operation against JI, the home affairs ministry said.</p>
              <p>He
              was arrested on the Indonesian island of Bintan near Singapore in 2003,
              reportedly for carrying false identification, and was jailed for 18
              months.</p>
              <p>He was later released but rearrested in Indonesia in
              January 2006 before being handed over to Singapore, where he was held
              under the Internal Security Act, which allows for detention without
              trial.</p>
              <p>The 2001 security operation in Singapore led to 15 people
              being arrested, 13 of whom were suspected JI members who allegedly
              planned to attack a bus full of Americans.</p>
              <p>Sidney Jones, who has
              extensively studied JI for the International Crisis Group of analysts,
              said Kastari was a hardliner but currently had little power in the
              group, whose Indonesian leadership now rejects "Al-Qaeda tactics"
              targeting foreigners.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Volunteers from Malay/Muslim organisations distribute posters on Mas Selamat</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Grassroots leaders and volunteers from Malay/Muslim
              organisations joined in the search for Mas Selamat Kastari on Friday by
              distributing over 10,000 posters in the eastern part of Singapore.</p>
              <p>They did this in response to Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng’s
              speech in Parliament on Thursday where he urged the public to help find
              the escaped detainee.</p>
              <p>This effort was jointly organised by Taman Bacaan and Khadijah Mosque.</p>
              <p>Volunteers covered various hawker centres and MRT stations, together with over 100 grassroots leaders of all races.</p>
              <p>Organisers said they will continue to monitor the developments before intensifying such efforts. —CNA/vm</p>

              Selamat Kastari was seen limping up a flight of steps leading to a
              wooded park, near the Whitley Road Detention Centre where he bolted
              on Wednesday at about 4.05 pm.</p>
              <p>The manager of a car washing kiosk at the Esso petrol station on
              Whitley Road was reported by Shin Min Daily as having told his
              worker that he saw a short-hair man, whose upper body was bare and
              who was wearing brown shorts with the letters WRC embossed on it,
              struggling up the flight of about 50 steps at about 5 pm, barely an
              hour after his daring escape from the detention centre.</p>
              <p>The wooded park leads to Bukit Brown Chinese cemetery.</p>
              <p>Acting on this lead, about 40 Gurkha guards searched the
              thickly-wooded cemetery on Friday afternoon.</p>
              <p>An extensive manhunt continued on Friday for the leader of the
              Singapore Jemaah Islamiah (JI) terror network, who has been on the
              run for three days now.</p>
              <p>On Friday, posters of of Singapore's most wanted man went up in
              many public places, such as MRT stations, bus interchanges,
              shopping centres and mosques.</p>

              <p><strong>JI fugitive Mas Selamat Kastari planning escape to Indonesia</strong><br> <span class="update">Posted: 29 February 2008 1814 hrs</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/imagegallery/store/phpKmQH0i.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><span>Mas Selamat Kastari is hiding in Singapore and planning ways to escape to Indonesia says terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna.
              <br> <br> The Singapore-based head of the International Centre for Political
              Violence and Terrorism Research also told Channel NewsAsia that Kastari
              doesn't have the capacity to launch any attack right now as he is alone
              and with one objective, that is to survive and evade capture.
              <br> <br>"He (Kastari) knows that Singapore is a hostile environment for
              him" said Dr Rohan. "He knows that if he is in Singapore, he will be
              captured,someone will inform the authorities." <br> <br> Dr Rohan who has extensively researched the JI, described Kastari as a
              determined and ruthless terrorist who is an escape artist. <br> <br> "I am shocked by his escape but I am not suprised" said the JI expert,
              citing a similar attempt made while in custody in Indonesia. He went on
              to say that Kastari would try to change his appearance and identity
              although not completely.
              <br> <br>Singapore officials in their hunt for Kastari have released two
              photos of the Singapore JI leader both bearded and clean-shaven. They
              have also been delivering leaflets to homes to inform the public of the
              wanted man who walks with a limp after being injured while trying to
              escape in Indonesia.
              <br> <br> Interpol has been put on alert for Kastari with his photograph and fingerprints sent to 186 countries.
              <br> <br>According to Dr Rohan, it is hard to be certain if Kastari has any
              accomplices or whether he had help in escaping from the Whitley
              Detention Centre. "He does not enjoy public support, even when he
              planned those attacks in the past, the cells that supported him
              constituted just a handful of members. Singaporean Muslims are shocked
              and suprised that a fellow Singaporean wanted to do big attacks like
              that in Singapore." <br> <br> Kastari had planned to hijack a plane and crash it into Singapore's
              Changi Airport. According to Dr Rohan, an attack of that scale would
              have helped elevate Kastari who is now number two in the ranks of the
              JI. <br> <br> Following his arrest, most of Kastari's known contacts have been
              arrested or are under close watch. This said the JI expert, will limit
              Kastari's access to weapons and crimp his capability to plan any
              attack. - CNA/sf </span></p>
