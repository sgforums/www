              <p>======================================================<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,...,171686,00.html">http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,...,1…</a>?<br> <span>DAYS TO PREPARE FOR</span> $1M ‘MAS <span>HUNT</span>’ *Lured by $1 million reward, 3 S’pore men quit
              private sector jobs for Mas Selamat hunt *They’ll live on savings
              for a year while infiltrating local communities</p>
              <p><span>ARE</span> these bounty hunters for real?</p>
              <p>Their quarry: Escaped terrorist Mas Selamat Kastari, who now has
              a $1 million reward on his head.</p>
              <p>According to their spokesman, these three Singaporeans have quit
              their jobs so they can look for their target in Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Why? For a million bucks and perhaps a chance to appear as
              heroes.</p>
              <p>But the hunt could lead to injury or even death when terrorists
              turn into desperados.</p>
              <p>And they could get into serious legal problems hunting fugitives
              on foreign soil, or even spark a diplomatic row.</p>
              <p>For all the risk, they could end up with nothing after months of
              frustration.</p>
              <p>But this is not stopping the three men, all in their 20s, who
              have resigned from their jobs in the private sector this week to
              try their luck.</p>
              <p><span>COMMANDO TRAINING</span></p>
              <p>The trio, who had undergone commando training during their
              national service, are heading to Indonesia today.</p>
              <p>The three men, who have been volunteers with Crime Library since
              2005, contacted its founder, Mr Joseph Tan, on Tuesday to seek his
              opinion about their plans.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan, 42, who is acting as their spokesman and their point of
              contact in Singapore, said: ‘They are not my children, but I feel
              like a father to them.</p>
              <p>‘If I were 20 years younger, I would join them. I may also
              become a part-millionaire in the process.’</p>
              <p>Mr Tan declined to reveal details about the men for fear of
              blowing their cover. They also turned down requests for an
              interview.</p>
              <p>Anti-terrorist professionals spend many months training before
              they carry out big missions, but the trio are off after barely five
              days of preparation.</p>
              <p>Their aim is to blend into local communities in Indonesia and to
              seek leads that might pinpoint the hideout of the Jemaah Islamiah
              (JI) leader.</p>
              <p>Anti-terror agencies in the region have failed so far to track
              down the fugitive after a four-month search.</p>
              <p>Yet the bounty hunters believe they stand a chance to strike
              paydirt.</p>
              <p>The call of a million dollars is strong. The bounty, offered by
              two anonymous businessmen, is Singapore’s largest ever.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan said their first aim is to try to work out Mas Selamat’s
              escape route. One of their theories is that he could have left
              Singapore from a fishing port in Jurong.</p>
              <p>The men have some savings to tide them over their first year in
              Indonesia, Mr Tan said.</p>
              <p>They plan to gain the trust of the locals who could help them
              get closer to the JI cells there.</p>
              <p>But is there a danger they might get indoctrinated as well?</p>
              <p>Mr Tan’s reply: ‘I’m not worried that they will get converted,
              because terrorists don’t get $1 million as a reward.’</p>
              <p>To help the effort, Mr Tan sent out an e-mail with Mas Selamat’s
              picture, to alert people in Malaysia, Indonesia and China to be on
              the lookout.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan has helped solved about 440 missing person cases since he
              founded Crime Library in 2001.</p>
              <p>The former policeman said: ‘With the $1 million offer, we can
              borrow eyes in other countries, turning the people in our network
              to become bounty hunters too.’</p>
              <p><span>CREATED A BUZZ</span></p>
              <p>The reward has also created a buzz in the security industry,
              including those in neighbouring countries.</p>
              <p>Mr Ponno Kalastree, 61, managing director of security and
              investigations agency Mainguard International, has mobilised agents
              in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines to look out
              for Mas Selamat.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘The reward will be a real motivation. If they find
              him, they can live comfortably for the rest of their lives.’</p>
              <p>Dr SM Jegan, a director of Kokusai Security, has offered an
              additional $10,000 from his own pocket if his staff members in
              Singapore and network in Indonesia are able to give information on
              Mas Selamat’s whereabouts.</p>
              <p>‘Mas Selamat’s escape has affected our reputation as a safe
              country.</p>
              <p>’ I am also concerned for the safety of Singaporeans,’ he
              said.</p>
              <p>Some terrorists have been caught after rewards were offered for
              their capture.</p>
              <p>9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured in Pakistan
              in 2003 after a US$25 million ($34m) bounty was offered.</p>
              <p>Last year, four Filipinos were paid US$10 million after Abu
              Sayyaf leaders Khadaffy Janjalani and Abu Sulaiman were discovered
              and killed.</p>
              <p>The Indonesian-born Mas Selamat escaped from a detention centre
              here in February.</p>
              <p>Officials say they have no information to confirm that he has
              left Singapore or that he has escaped to Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Anyone with information on Mas Selamat may call the Counter
              Terrorism Centre hotline at 1800-262 6473 or the police at 999.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE : Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is confident the country's Internal Security Department (ISD) will prove itself again, especially in light of new security challenges, like those arising from the influx of foreigners into Singapore.</p>

              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>When Singapore’s terrorist leader escaped from high-security detention two months ago, he could not possibly have foreseen the political repercussion that he was leaving behind.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>It has raised doubts on government accountability in Singapore and revisited the unpopular issue of high cabinet pay by raising questions like: -</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>--<strong> How</strong> damaging to the nation must a government mistake be before a cabinet minister – who is paid more than the US president – is held responsible? </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>--<strong> Must</strong> punishment, however serious the mistake, be applicable only to the civil servants or the foot soldiers – but not the political leader who is responsible for overall planning?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>This dilemma began with a government-appointed committee report revealing a list of incredible bungles and neglect by the Home Affairs Ministry, which is in overall charge of the Centre. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>A “confluence of factors” or “lapses” is how the report calls the mistakes that allowed JI leader, Mas Selamat Kastari, to climb out of a toilet window and flee in his underwear. Two months later, he’s still at large.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Mas Selamat is no ordinary criminal, but leader of a terror network who was trained in Afghanistan. He had plotted to crash a commercial plane into Changi Airport as well as blow up foreign embassies.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Minister mentor Lee Kuan Yew has said that if he succeeds in fleeing to Indonesia, he may return to carry out his bombing threats.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>And the Whitley Detention Centre is a tiny version of America’s Guantanamo, which houses all the terrorist suspects in Singapore. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>His escape presented PM Lee with a tough choice: Either ditch the minister responsible as widely demanded by the public – or defend him. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>He chose to support a party colleague, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, and go against public opinion.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>PM Lee stated that ministers should not be automatically removed for lapses down the line. This came as a surprise to a generation of Singaporeans raised under his father’s strict governance.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Pm Lee said his government would not encourage a culture where ministers resign whenever things go wrong on their watch, whether or not they are actually to blame.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>By downgrading ministerial responsibility, he may have established a new principle of governance for Singapore that differs from other countries’. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Many nations in Europe and Asia (from Britain to Japan and South Korea) hold their leaders or cabinet ministers liable for a major blunder, either by sacking or allowing them to resign.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The response of Singaporeans over the Internet has predictably been very negative with some accusing him of double standards – one rule for ministers and another for the civil service.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>An online poll on whether Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng should be sacked showed a 94% ‘yes’ vote, with only six per cent disagreeing.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>But Lee was adamant. “That would be the easy way out. It may temporarily appease an angry public, but it will not fundamentally solve the problem,” he said. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The result has been a transfer of some of the political heat from the Home Affairs Minister to the Prime Minister.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The critics complain that since ministers are paid super-high wages pegged to the top private sector, Lee should also hold them to the same standards of accountability. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Said Workers' Party chief Low Thia Khiang, "In the corporate world, when something goes wrong, heads that roll would include the CEO's. Here, when something goes wrong, we talk about honest mistakes."</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Even government backbencher Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio) drew the same conclusion.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>"We have adopted a reward system that matches that of the private sector, that we pay everyone as high as possible,” he said. “Therefore, people expect that when you make a mistake, you will be appropriately punished."</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The pressure for accountability is so strong and widespread that some observers believe that Lee’s defence of Wong will not stand beyond the next election in three years time. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>“In a one-man-one-vote system, no prime minister is silly enough to stand in front of a tidal electoral wave,” said a newspaper reporter. “Wong is a big political liability and will have to go.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Some observers believe this will happen after a decent interval with Wong being transferred out of Home Affairs before 2011.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>In a cabinet reshuffle on Mar 29, a month after Selamat’s escape, Lee appointed Mr. K. Shanmugam as Law Minister - as well as Second Minister for Home Affairs.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>This was seen as preparation for Wong’s eventual replacement in case Lee decides to make the change. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The public criticism rages on over the websites with newspapers’ letters pages remaining largely silent.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>“Singaporeans with half a brain will know it is less about being different from other countries, but more about protecting their own kind - the tight-knit network of elites who run this country,” Gerald Giam wrote in his blog,</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Kelvin Tong added: “In my view, PM Lee failed to see one point: Singapore ministers are the highest paid in the world.

              <p>So many months.. my Mas poster is now covered and pasted over by F1 poster liao leh..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SO after F1 everybody forget about MAS and celebrate F1 is it ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I calculate liao...</p>
              <p>100,000 pax per day at F1 event.</p>
              <p>3 day event = 300,000</p>
              <p>40% estimated are foreigners = 120,000</p>
              <p>Spending power of each foereigners estimate $300</p>
              <p>Total expenditure income influx into Singapore = $36,000,000</p>
              <p>GST 7% of $36,000,000 = $2,520,000</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>OK.. GST generate over the 3 day F1 event is enough to cover 2 of MAS's head and still have $520,000 to party !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We can let MAS go scot-free lah....</p>
