              <p>Actually, i think he`s still here. He needs help getting out of Singapore. With the girdle SPF/SAF has thrown around the island, it would not be easy. The official exit points are manned with increased security and it is palpable to many people. More importantly, the unofficial exit points are now probably controlled as well.  Not that it was`nt before. Just under watch because it would be easier to track criminals, illegals and fugitives when we know where they will be going. Can you imagine if we are to shut them down? We`ll have to look for new ones all over again.</p>
              <p>Also, Mas Selamat probably knows(by now) that it is not just the police he has to watch out for. But hundreds or perhaps thousands of ex criminal and current criminal informers literally on the pay of the Singapore government. That`s how the security agencies close the gap on information.</p>
              <p>He`s probably jumping from one jungle spot to another. Not easy to find too ler. Illegals in Singapore can survive on fish caught from drains and water from streams and pipes. He can survive for a long time and be out of sight as well. Probably waiting for the security level to go down...</p>

              <p>i think he just might have left sg long ago.</p>
              <p>only a short swim to batam or any unknown islands.</p>
              <p>from there, he can basically go anywhere in the world all the way to south pole.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>can swim or smuggle out in boats or fish boats or in cargo crates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>exactly when was his escape known to public?</p>
              <p>if early, his escape more difficult.</p>
              <p>how long need to drive from sg to jb? 1 hour kao boh? assume break all traffic rules and laws and no wait for greenlight and no need put in erp cash card and smuggle into jb using fake passport? r u sure 100.1 % this is not possible our security tip top?</p>

              <p>I mentioned this previously. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The issue is not whether he limps or not.</span></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The issue is his mobility. How mobile is he?</span></strong> He can walk with his legs facing 360 degrees backwards for all you care but it matters not if he can still walk fast, run,climb and fight. I fear a lot of people are having the impression he is largely disabled with a lot of difficulty in walking and that is what they are looking out for. That may be an unwise impression to make. Have you seen drug abusers who limp around? Try fighting them when they are high and determined to escape. It may take 2-3 persons to bring him down.</p>
              <p>My own feelings are that the procedures are sound. But as always, people take short-cuts. Remember our NS. Who does`nt in NS ? But the problem is that this dude is a hard-core trained crook determined to escape. A small window of complacency is all he needs.</p>
              <p>A friend of mine related to me a story of how a criminal from a police station walked out of the station and escaped a long time ago. how he did it? He did not escape from the lock-up. The investigator brought him to his office for an interview instead of conducting it in the proper and secure interview room. The investigator assumed he was docile enough; a 15 year old kid deeply remorseful for what he has done. Anyway, he assumed that it would be ludicrous that any crook would simply escape from a tightly guarded police station.</p>
              <p>The investigator then left him in the office to get some files. He was gone when the investigator returned. And he walked out of the station just like that. The officers doing sentry saw him but they thought he was just a complainant. Same with the other officers I guess. I guess they all assumed that it would be unthinkable that a crook would be wandering around in the station.</p>
              <p>Wierd. It happens. Anyway, the investigator assumed that no one can escape from the station. He was wrong.</p>
              <p>I think we let our guard down for once and we paid a dear price for it. It was an exceptional incident which would normally never and possibly ever happen. But we were dealing with an extra-ordinary crook and we forgot about that small part.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes, of course, there is the possibility that he did not escape, he just walked (or limped) out throught the front gate. He can't have climbed over the fence, he cannot still be hiding in the toilet ceilling (K9 would have sniffed him out). He walked out. Like Took just walked into Johore. Or  maybe, just maybe, he still could be in the detention centre, holed up in a stinking manhole, and everyone think he has escaped.</p>
              <p>But  Wong Kan Seng has said special investigation are still on going, we should all not speculate, i.e. think too much. If this is a court case, I would agree to that, but this is of public interest, and information is scarce.</p>
              <p>HOW DID HE ESCAPE? IS HE DANGEROUS? WOULD HE HOLD PEOPLE HOSTAGE? IS HE FANATICAL, RATHER DIE THAN SURRENDER? DID ANYONE AID HIM? IS HE NOW HOLDING SOME FAMILY HOSTAGE?</p>

              <p>I refer to to day's ST:</p>
              <p>1) 10000 'wanted ' posters given out by 100 volunteers. Due to the security lapse, the MHA has to print posters by using tax payers money, this created unnecessary spending. They dare to say the slogan "security is our concern". Shame on you, minister in charge.</p>
              <p>2) The other article, front page ST(mar 1, 2008) Title SAF supports Afghan effort with 50 men this year. Defence Minister told parliament that such contributions help to enhance Singapore's security. " Afghan is at the front line in the global fight against terrorism," he said. How to enhance Singapore's security?? I dont see any benefits our SAF can bring about by deploying the staff to a place infested with terrorists. It is a high risks to take, we can't even subdue the most wanted JI terrorist, not to mention to confront Osama's men in Mountainous terrain in Pakistan and Afghan. So again we see the high handedness and arrogance attitude of our Minister in charge.Remember we are a tiny country, we supported the Iraq war blindly... think again million dollar ministers !!!!!!!!!</p>
