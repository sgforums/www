              <p>Yep since we already let him time to focus on finding him - yet he and his team still fail  - maybe it is time - We ask "why" we pay top dollar to him - and start asking about "How" it happen and how he failed to find the man !!!</p>
              <p>If this happen in other countries or company ..... Wong would be so ashame of himself that he should resign on his own.... or he would be ask to step down ...... !!!</p>
              <p>If he cannot do his job right - 1) let dangerous man escape 2) finding him - at least he should do it right 3) resign !!! and let someone clean up his mess !!!</p>

              <p>wtf MHA doing. This so called "incident" really overshadows the recent winning bid of the youth olympics. WKS still hav the cheek to state in paliament that he is not of immediate threat to the public. Dun even dare to reveal the contents of the whole incident. Cause unneccessary panic among citizens.</p>
              <p>Then wat the hussle n trouble to lock him up. Waste of taxpayer's money ar. Now the whole world REALLY knows that singapore really exists in this world for the wrong headlines after INTERPOL release worldwide warrant.</p>
              <p>The posters still dare labeled as "I'll get you". Wat a joke for a limp guy to escape a so-called high tech detention centre. If we dun manage to nab him, the posters will be a laughing stock instead.</p>

                              large police force and yet he's slipped through our fingers...
                              making them red in the face and what's extremly scary is that the
                              media's reporting alot more on Thaksin's return to thailand than a
                              breach in our national security... all to try and bury the
                              seriousness of this matter. and what's really scary is that after
                              all this, some poor lower paid security personnel or his immediate
                              supervisors or officers from the police will be blamed, without any
                              fault falling on the people who command or run the Ministry. so
                              much for accountability and transparency for that matter. We
                              invested alot on our government officials, for them to make sure
                              that we and our families are far from harm and all we get is 'sorry
                              it has happened'... not good enough.</p>

              <p>agreed! you know. i definitely don't support terrorism. i don't like the idea of them killing innocent people, and causing so much pain and suffering for their demented cause.</p>
              <p>but truthfully, part of me will cheer if they blow up some important building and some overpaid fat cats along with it.. then maybe our govt will wake up and really do something about it other than burying it under 6 feet of dirt all the time.</p>
              <p>definitely the best way la.. our govt apparently don't have the foresight for such things. business and money making, yeah they're freaking good at it. but i guess they forgot or even taken for granted things like security, harmony etc..</p>

              <li>gangs are still active in singapore, what is being done to exterminate them? </li>
              <li>are prisons as secure as we think they are?</li>
              <li>are our police forces unfallable and uncorrupted as we'd like them to be? They may not be bribed with money, but they could be fooled by the terrorist's preachings. should mosques be preparing their followers to differentiate between extremist teachings and normal teachings. what are the mosques doing to safeguard their flock?<br></li>
              <li>are our ministers uncorrupted themselves?</li>
              <li>are our ministers taking things for granted?</li>
              <li>are they more interested in the welfare of this nation or their own welfare?<br></li>

              <p>firstly, i feel that we should at least get a reasonable explanation as to HOW this JI leader can actually escape from an <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ISD DETENTION CENTRE</span></strong> when it's supposed to be highly guarded! arghh, this is annoying and exasperating. it's supposed to be top security, but this detainee <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with a limp</span> can actually get out of it.</p>
              <p>i seriously think JI has already infiltrated our defence system, and maybe some guards-on-duty pitied him and let him off or something. seriously, i think that we deserve an explanation <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">at least</span></strong> as to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how</span> this detainee can actually escape. for that, i disagree with MP of HA that we should not concentrate on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how he escaped</span> because it's time we <strong>reflect and review</strong> our current security status and what happens to all the taxes and money we pay to afford this supposedly <em>formidable security system</em>. And i do include the SPF and SAF in this so-called security system.</p>
              <p>secondly, how in the world can 1000-over police-officers and what-nots fail to arrest an escapee <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with a limp</span>? how is it possible he manage to get transport if he just ran out of that ulu detention centre? which means this might all be planned from the start. and all the timing and stuff like that, don't you think that this whole plan is just too intricate and delicate to believe that it's all just his doing? i really feel that there's a JI infiltration into the detention centre, or some idiot guard on duty let him off.</p>
              <p>i think instead of cursing MP Wong Kan Seng to be stripped off his title, i think it'd be more helpful if we learn to be less snobbish and stop boasting of our high security level and safety crap. because one mistake like this is a mistake too much.</p>
              <p>lets just try to look for that escapee whether or not there're any rewards. if it shows that the JI can outwit our armed forces, then i think it will take more than just them to get back at them. so i think it'll be better if we all, as citizens, contribute by paying more attention to the people around us. a wrong tip-off is better than the right tip-off but not told just because the tipper is afraid of a wrong tip.</p>
              <p>hopefully everything ends soon.</p>
              <p>on a lighter note, i'm quite afraid of taking MRT now.</p>

              <p>he definitely got help from the guard. AND the outside.</p>
              <p>which means since hes with his frens alot of things can be planned and carried out by them.</p>
              <p>personally i feel that the statement that hes not an immediate security threat is bullcrap.</p>
              <p>seriously i would consider some1 who had planned to crash a plane into changi airport a grave security threat wherever he is.</p>
              <p>who knows what hes planning now.</p>
