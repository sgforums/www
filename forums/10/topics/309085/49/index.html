              <h1 class="clr">JI leader’s escape underscores importance of trust in community</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The recent escape of Jemaah Islamiyah leader, Mas Selamat
              Kastari, has underscored the importance of community bonding among
              Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>That is why the grassroots cluster of the Community Engagement
              Programme (CEP) is working to strengthen mutual trust among residents.</p>
              <p>This year, about 30 out of 84 constituencies in Singapore will be the first to receive the CEP Ready Certification.</p>
              <p>The
              certification criteria include developing proper constituency emergency
              preparedness plans and having a group of influential community leaders
              who can be mobilised in a crisis.</p>
              <p>The certificate recipients include constituencies and divisions like Paya Lebar, Clementi and Marine Parade.</p>
              <p>Grassroots
              volunteers have been getting together to distribute flyers for the
              wanted fugitive, Mas Selamat. This is a sign of how Singapore rallies
              together as one, regardless of race or religion.</p>
              <p>The programme is
              not just about being prepared for a natural disaster, but also for a
              deliberate act of attack aimed at causing mistrust among Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Lim
              Swee Say, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office and
              Minister—in—Charge of Grassroots Cluster CEP, said: "What’s important
              is for us to make sure that people are coming together, regardless of
              their religious groups, regardless of their racial groups, and working
              together...</p>
              <p>"Over time, we would know one another better, trust
              one another better, and accept one another better. I think this is the
              only way for us to ensure that we can be best prepared."</p>
              <p>Singapore should not wait for a case like the JI leader’s escape to build confidence among the people.</p>
              <p>Halimah
              Yacob, MP for Jurong GRC, said: "For instance, when I attend residents’
              wakes, I make sure I bring other races as well, so in Chinese wakes,
              there’ll be Malays and Indians. In that way, we break the barriers.</p>
              <p>"If
              we’re able to internalise the importance of developing trust and
              community spirit, we’ll build a whole foundation of trust and
              confidence among our residents."</p>
              <p>Madam Halimah added that she is
              planning to develop an email database of all her residents in Bukit
              Batok to allow easy and faster dissemination of information.</p>
              <p>She said: "In the event that we need to be alert, apart from SMSing our core group, we can reach out to the residents."</p>
              <p>Crisis simulation exercises have also proved to be effective.</p>
              <p>Irene
              Ng, MP of Tampines GRC, said: "We inculcate a sense that we have a
              common stake in society, and while we may have different religious
              views and different faith, it doesn’t mean we have to be divided. In
              fact, it means that we have to work even closer."</p>
              <p>Aside from
              visits to places of worship, various constituencies have come up with
              different scenarios to learn how to manage communal tensions among
              their residents.</p>
              <p>It is eventually hoped that some constituencies will be able to share their best practices with others. — CNA/so</p>

              <h1 class="clr">MM Lee says Mas Selamat’s escape is a severe lesson on complacency</h1>
              <p>BAHRAIN: Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew does not believe Mas Selamat Kastari poses a threat if he remains at large in Singapore.</p>
              <p>This is because it is not a planned escape and he does not have the resources to harm Singapore if he remains in the country.</p>
              <p>But
              if he has escaped across the border, Mr Lee warned that Singaporeans
              would have to watch out for a return hit by Mas Selamat.</p>
              <p>The
              minister mentor, who wrapped up his three—nation visit to the Middle
              East on Friday, was speaking to the Singapore media in Bahrain.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Lee said Mas Selamat is a wily person who could persuade his custodians
              and Singapore has learnt an important lesson on complacency from the
              episode.</p>
              <p>"I give him full marks for winning the confidence of his
              custodians that he’s completely docile, completely passive and he’s
              going to remain in captivity. It is... stupid to believe we are
              infallible. We are not infallible. One mistake and we get a big
              explosive in your midst. So let’s not take this lightly. I think it’s a
              very severe lesson of complacency," said Mr Lee.</p>
              <p>Since Mas
              Selamat’s escape, police have received 950 calls and email messages
              about the case. Anyone with information on the fugitive should call the
              police at 999 or email them at spf_police_information@spf.gov.sg. — CNA/so</p>

              <p>There is a marked lacked of details concerning the "escape".  This led to a multitude of theories generated here. We need to know the whole truth. Not only the detail of the actual escape per see. But also Mas Selamat's conduct during  his four years of incarceration.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the complacency message refered to the detention centre's guards and Superiors. They are bluffed by MAS Selamat apparent cooperation and let down their guards and thus may not have followed the SOP from my reasoning. The minister cannot be blamed for this isolated case of prison break as he can't watch over what happen to all the prisons in Singapore everday 24 hours a day. His job is to constantly improved the prison system to keep them more secured through constant updates and reviews  of policies and SOPs in his ministry. There is not a single case of prison break in all our prisons under the charge of Wong Kan Seng all these years. We should wait for the full inquiries to be completed before we speculate on how it happen.Thus all the blame on our good minister should stop here and we should move on to how not to have another such incident.</div>

              case of prison break as he can’t watch over what happen to all the
              prisons in Singapore everday 24 hours a day. His job is to
              constantly improved the prison system to keep them more secured
              through constant updates and reviews of policies and SOPs in his
              ministry. There is not a single case of prison break in all our
              prisons under the charge of Wong Kan Seng all these years. We
              should wait for the full inquiries to be completed before we

              <p>Once, I commented that it is ridiculous for the minister to earn 100 times more than an average Singaporean. My friend tried to defend the minister by saying they have more responsibilities.</p>

              <p>Let's say if one day the terrorist succeeded in bombing Changi Airport, you can also say that this is due to "complacency" of the security there and has absolutely nothing to do with Wong Kah Seng who happened to be the Minister of Home Affairs.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE : Religious leaders and grassroots leaders in Tampines have
              been roped in — in the hunt for fugitive Mas Selamat Kastari.</p>
              <p>And as the Police continues to appeal for information on the Jemaah
              Islamiyah leader, it also warns that it will not tolerate those who
              intentionally provide false information.</p>
              <p>They call themselves the H.O.T team — or Help Our Tampines team.</p>
              <p>And now they want to get their community hot on the trail of JI fugitive Mas Selamat.</p>
              <p>The team is made up of leaders from the churches and Muslim prayer groups, and community leaders from the Tampines constituency.</p>
              <p>It was formed in October last year to respond to emergencies, to help monitor and calm the ground in times of crisis.</p>
              <p>They also want to defuse any rumours or speculation that might divide the community.</p>
              <p>Ms
              Iren Ng, MP for Tampines GRC, said: "We want to have a united front.
              Because we know that there’s a search for Mas Selamat, and at the same
              time we hear some speculation that might divide the community ... here
              in Tampines Changkat there’s a large proportion of Muslim residents and
              we want them to know that we are united. We have no suspicion or no
              speculation about whether Mas Selamat had help from any different
              religious group. As far as we are concerned, Mas Selamat is a
              terrorist, and is a common threat to our community."</p>
              <p>While the
              community has been urged to report any information on Mas Selamat, the
              Police warn that it will not tolerate those who intentionally provide
              false information, as such actions distract resources and compromise
              on—going search efforts.</p>
              <p>Police will charge a 50—year—old bus driver on Monday.</p>
              <p>The man had allegedly given false information to get rewards offered by various parties for Mas Selamat’s arrest.</p>
              <p>On
              1 March, the man allegedly told Police he saw someone resembling Mas
              Selamat boarding his bus along Thomson Road near the Old Police Academy
              and alighting at Lentor Avenue the day the JI detainee escaped.</p>
              <p>Later
              the same night, he said he saw "Mas Selamat" riding pillion on a
              motorcycle, and getting off at a bus stop along Thomson Road near the
              Singapore Polo Club.</p>
              <p>He gave Police the registration plate of the motorcycle.</p>
              <p>Acting on the information, Police combed Lentor Avenue.</p>
              <p>Checks
              were also made on the motorcycle owner, but these showed he had been
              involved in a road rage incident with the bike owner on February 27.</p>
              <p>Still,
              if the public sees any suspicious person or activities, Police says
              they should call 999 immediately — no matter how trivial the
              information might seem.</p>
              <p>All such information provided will be taken seriously.</p>
              <p>And as long as the information is provided in good faith, there is no cause for concern. — CNA/de</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: A 50—year—old bus driver will be charged in court on 10
              March with deliberately giving false information to the police that’s
              related to the manhunt for escaped Jemaah Islamiyah leader, Mas Selamat
              Kastari.</p>
              <p>He is believed to have done so to get the rewards being offered by
              various private organisations and individuals for Mas Selamat’s arrest.</p>
              <p>Police
              said on two occasions on 1 Mar, the suspect had told police he saw
              someone resembling Mas Selamat on the evening of 27 February, the day
              the detainee escaped from the Whitley Road Detention Centre.</p>
              <p>First,
              he alleged that “Mas Selamat" had boarded his bus along Thomson Road
              near the Old Police Academy and alighted at Lentor Avenue.</p>
              <p>Later
              the same night, he said he saw "Mas Selamat" riding pillion on a

              <p>He also gave police the registration plate of the motorcycle.</p>
              <p>Acting on the information, police resources were sent to comb the Lentor Avenue.</p>
              <p>Checks
              were also made on the motorcycle owner but these showed he had been
              involved in a road rage incident with the suspect at 10pm on 27
              February.</p>
              <p>In its statement on Saturday, the Police said it will
              not tolerate those who intentionally provide false information, as such
              actions distract resources and also compromise ongoing search efforts.</p>
              <p>However it assured the public that as long as their information is given in good faith, they have no cause for concern.</p>
              <p>And
              they should call the police immediately if they see any suspicious
              person or activities, no matter how trivial the information might seem.
              Police said all such information are taken seriously.</p>
              <p>Under the
              Penal Code, anyone convicted for providing false information to a
              public servant could be jailed for up to one year, or fined up to

              <p>He gave Police the registration plate of the motorcycle.</p>
              <p>Acting on the information, Police combed Lentor Avenue.</p>
              <p>Checks were also made on the motorcycle owner, but these showed
              he had been involved in a road rage incident with the bike owner on
              February 27.</p>
              <p>Still, if the public sees any suspicious person or activities,
              Police says they should call 999 immediately — no matter how
              trivial the information might seem.</p>
              <p>All such information provided will be taken seriously.</p>
              <p>And as long as the information is provided in good faith, there
              is no cause for concern. — CNA/de</p>

              <p>So if I think I saw him but he got away before the police can find him,
              I will be under suspicious of giving false lead. I must be crazy to put
              myself in such situation for "good faith".</p>

              <p>1.  if he took the bus or taxi, would the drivers not have reported? would the passengers not have seen a man wearing brightly coloured unusual clothing?  How plausible is it that he escaped via PUBLIC transport? use your brain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. if he did not take public transport, how did he get away so well that after over 1 week into the 2nd week, he manage to escape? When he escaped , say after 10 minutes they found out, it would not be difficult to catch him right, if he really just used his 2 legs to escape on his own without help right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. who can comform that he was NOT picked up by his accomplice?</p>
              <p>was there a plan? no plans maybe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. If he had escaped out of town, would he such a high IQ many have obediently, law-abidingly have queued up and used the official exit points ? use the blain, once again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So challenging questions.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>above are purely questions with no answers. thus not implying anything other than your imagination. trying to help. that all.</p>

              <p>lady und gentersman many many,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>is this escape the 1st in sg historic?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if so,</p>
              <p>looking positively at the situation,</p>
              <p>is it fair to say</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that this serves as a indicator of how fast/slow someone in sg can be caught given its small tiny size where there is no caves and mountains and canyons and jungles and volcanoes and everywhere is fully developed? no where to hide?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>next time, if other kinds of criminality runs away, or did something bad to city, and run away can run away how long?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but to be fair, i must admit, our talents are world record and so far managing the crisis quite reasonably well given the rarity of such cases happening.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Casino. When it comes, i hope not too many murderers and money laundering and thefts and robberies . Why ? u dare ask me the Y?</p>
