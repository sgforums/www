              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">February 28, 2008 Thursday<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Escape of JI leader: How can this happen in S'pore?</span></strong></span> <br><br><br>MANY Singaporeans reacted to news of f the escape of JI leader Mas Selamat Kastari from a high-security detention centre with disbelief and incredulity.</p>
              <p>This posting from Jordan Tan in the straitstimes.com aptly summed up the reaction of many others: 'Hello, this is Singapore. How can this happen?'</p>
              <p>Added cc1034: 'How can a highly dangerous person escape from a highly secured prison?'</p>
              <p>Another disbelieving reader, who goes by the monicker howaiyee, said: 'Security at the detention centre is 'tight'. He walks with a limp. Yet he managed to escape. What a shame!'</p>
              <p>'How can we feel safe anymore?' said a worried Lim Boon Hee.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat, 47, who heads the Singapore Jemaahy Islamiah terror network, escaped from the Whitley Road Detention Centre at 4.05 pm on Wednesday, sparking an island-wide manhunt involving thousands of police, SAF, Gurkha and Special Operations Command forces. <br><br>The Straits Times online discussion board has also been buzzing with readers' comments, with postings coming in at 3 am in the morning. As at 2.15 pm, there were 186 postings on this issue, with 16,528 views.</p>
              <p>Many readers expressed concern about the breach of security which allowed the terror leader to slip away.</p>
              <p>Said raymond_lo: 'I feel throughly let down by our security men.'</p>
              <p>A user who signed off as a 'terrified student from SCGS', said she would not be going to school on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Several also urged the authorities to provide more information about the escape.</p>
              <p>Said shean777: 'Please, Home Affairs Minister, say something or more importantly, DO something!'</p>
              <p>Indeed, a user who went by the name lib27 put it bluntly: 'The whole Singapore is waiting for an answer.'</p>
              <p>Many readers also offered tips and advice to catch the JI leader.</p>
              <p>Suggested mr.speakersir: 'Perhaps the authorities might seriously warn Singaporeans and whoever else in Singapore about the cosequences of sheltering him.. and whoever provides leads to his whereabouts and subsequent capture should be rewarded ... Singaporeans just love rewards!' He also suggested plastering his picture island-wide, terming it the 'great Singapore terrorist hunt.'</p>
              <p>A reader readi suggested a CCTV system that could hook up images of all passengers in taxis that could be beamed to a centralised system.</p>
              <p>Many also rallied Singaporeans to pitch in the search for the wanted man.</p>
              <p>Reader jchlee urged 'all to keep a lookout for this damn fella, and help the SPF nab him before he really wreaks havoc in Singapore.'</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Helvetica;">I thank the members who have spoken on the Ministry's Head for their questions, observations and suggestions and also their criticisms. Members have spoken of the escape of the JI detainee, Mas Selamat, yesterday. Let me give an update.<br>There has been a security lapse at the Whitley Road detention centre which allowed Mas Selamat to escape. Mas Selamat at the time was taken out of his individual cell where he was confined to go to the family visit room to wait for the arrival of his family. He asked to go to the toilet where he escaped. This should never have happened. I am sorry that it has. An independent investigation is underway and we should not speculate now as to what and how it happened. Security at the centre has been stepped up.<br>Mas Selamat is a security threat which is why he was placed under preventive detention. However, there is no information that he has any plans that threaten public security at this time. Nevertheless, we are not taking any chances.<br>Mr Teo asked why the public was only informed about four hours later. Our security agencies assessed at the time of Mas Selamat's escape, there was no imminent danger to the public. The plan was to lock down the Whitley Road detention centre and then start a systematic operation to find and arrest him.<br>The priority is to arrest him. No efforts will be spared to track him down. Security at all our land, sea and air checkpoints have been tightened, including areas where there is possibility that he may leave our shores not, from the normal immigration clearance areas.<br>In the meantime, I urge the public to stay calm and to report any suspicious sighting to the police immediately. Anyone who renders assistance to him is committing a grave offence.<br><br>

              <p><strong>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</strong> I just want to check with Minister when will the independent investigation panel finish the investigation and whether the panel will report its findings or recommendations to this House.</p>
              <p><strong>Wong Kan Seng:</strong> Sir, I will have to ask the investigators to do a thorough job, so let us not rush them. And when it is completed, yes, it will, the House will be kept informed as to what took place.</p>

              <p>Anyway... this is very disappointing. No imminent danger - so can release news only after 4 hours? Freaking lame reasoning. If he has his ways, he can and has the ability to flatten Singapore in one hour after escape. With or without any weapons. Since nothing has happened yet... Mr Wong is just damn lucky. It probably means that he couldn't contact any member YET. Or may be just planning. So in the meantime, we are still safe.</p>
