              <h1 class="clr">Key database useful in hunt for Mas Selamat</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Officers searching for escaped Jemaah Islamiyah leader, Mas
              Selamat Kastari, are using a database to make their hunt more effective.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat escaped from Whitley Road Detention Centre some three
              weeks ago. The 47—year—old is alleged to have been the mastermind of a
              plot to crash a hijacked plane into Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>The database
              used in the hunt contains key information such as the location of
              vacant buildings in Singapore and possible hideouts used by illegal
              immigrants.</p>
              <p>These details come under a programme called
              Operations Terrain Mapping, which has been updated over the last three
              years by Home Team officers who registered their observations and
              contact networks on the database to tackle crime and terrorism.</p>
              <p>There
              are also plans to enhance the IT system that centrally stores and
              shares such terrain information to allow the Home Team to share some
              parts of the database with other ministries and possibly grassroots
              organisations in the future.</p>
              <p>This was revealed by Deputy Prime
              Minister and Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng on Tuesday at a
              workshop for some 700 Home Team officers from agencies like the Police
              Force and the Internal Security Department.</p>
              <p>DPM Wong said: "Our
              sector officers were able to identify 121 vacant or abandoned buildings
              within a day and the search operations conducted against these sites
              were mounted expeditiously. This swift response would not have been
              possible had we not already marked these buildings in our terrain maps.
              Another example was the location of cordons and road blocks.</p>
              <p>"As
              the search operations expanded islandwide in response to public calls,
              our officers were able to swiftly set up cordon lines and road blocks
              which were pre—identified in the terrain maps. This enabled us to
              swiftly lock in the search area while other officers commenced the
              searches."</p>
              <p>He added that these officers will face more complex
              tasks in the future, but efforts to build stronger relationships with
              various communities will pay off.</p>
              <p>In fact, the deputy prime
              minister said, such partnerships have already contributed to the fast
              mobilisation of the community in the search for Mas Selamat. Many
              organisations have stepped forward to help distribute over 210,000
              pamphlets on the fugitive.</p>
              <p>With more officers involved in the
              on—going search for Mas Selamat, the attendance at this year’s Home
              Team workshop was lower compared to last year.</p>
              <p>And despite the
              security breach that led to Mas Selamat’s escape, Mr Wong told his
              audience that the Home Team spirit is still very much alive.</p>
              <p>He
              said: "Indeed, without excusing the lapse which led to Mas Selamat’s
              escape, our Home Team officers should not lose heart for they have done
              much to be proud of. The work of the Home Team must go on because life
              goes on in society, whether it is to combat crime, drugs or fire
              hazards or deal with those who break the law."</p>
              <p>On a separate note, seven groups received the Home Team Achievement Awards at the workshop. — CNA/so</p>

              <p>It is unlikely that MSK had any special combat training in the SAF based on the present undeclared sensitivities that the Political Leadership has towards ''special groups'' of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The nearest tough training that MSK would have received that resemble combat training will be with the Fire Department of the Singapore Civil Defence Force - where training is reputed to be very physical.</p>
              <p>Coming back to the search for MSK, it is amazing that the Home Team is depending on its own resources as reported in Wednesday Straits Times, where the Flood Lamps from SCDF were used to light up the thick secondary jungle.</p>
              <p>How deep can the flood lamps penetrate the thick foliage of the secondary jungle, when these flood lamps are designed to light up a limited general area from its tall mast ?</p>
              <p>It will only cast more shadows with these lamps, and alert MSK to the presence of the search team, as well as to give him an early warning to the general direction of the search efforts.</p>
              <p>Are the resources of the SAF and DSTA being tapped ?</p>
              <p>During the SARS crisis, the SAF heat detectors - developed by DSTA - were quickly modified for civilian application that allow large flow of human traffic to be monitored, filtering out those in the crowd with fever.</p>
              <p>Surely, military technologies in the SAF can now be employed to search for MSK in the dark ?</p>
              <p>Night vision goggles for the search parties will help the search in the dark better than the flood lamps.</p>
              <p>Low light and infra-red cameras, heat sensors or detectors can be mounted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles {UAV} - to allow the search over large area to be more systematic, and allow penetration of the thick foliage of the secondary jungle.</p>
              <p>The same equipment can be used to scan the canals and larger monsoon drains that are dry most of the time, and provide a natural axis for MSK to move over long distances away from watchful eyes.</p>
              <p>The leadership tasked to recapture MSK will need to be more imaginative and resourceful as MSK is in avoiding capture.</p>

              <p><br>Are you suggesting that the Malaysian and Indonesian authorities are in cahoots with MSK ?</p>
              <p>Have you forgotten that it was the Indonesians Special Squad that tracked and arrested MSK - and handed him over to Singapore even when there is no extradition treaty signed between them and us ?</p>
              <p>Indonesia could have let him off - after jailing him twice on two separate charges.</p>
              <p>How would you know that Indonesia and Malaysia may not have activated their internal security and intelligence groups to monitor the movements of certain groups of persons in their respective territories ?</p>
              <p>Does it not surprise you that Indonesia was able to track and arrest MSK in a country that has a population size that is 10 times larger than Singapore, and with a land mass 100 time larger that consist of more then 1000 islands of assorted sizes ?</p>
              <p>Yet, with all the boasted 3G military hardware, and a modern police force that Singapore is supposedly to feel safe with, it has been 3 weeks since MSK escaped and we are seeing the Home Team searching at all the wrong places with new reports that MSK was seen in the opposite direction.</p>

              <p>This is damn funny:</p>
              <h2 class="title"><br></h2>
              <h2 class="title"><a title="Oppositions to be blamed for Mas Selamat's escape" href="http://tomorrow.sg/archives/2008/03/02/oppositions_to_be_blamed_for_mas.html">Oppositions to be blamed for Mas Selamat's escape</a></h2>
              <p>I have an important message for those who blame our esteemed Minister
              Wong Kan Seng for this incident. I put the blame squarely on the
              members of the Opposition. Here's why:</p>
              <p>WKS as minister cannot possibly know the detention center that well
              - you expect minister to inspect every toilet there? You expect the
              minister to train every guard? He has already apologised and taken
              responsibility. However, the members of the Opposition are the ones I
              blame for this mess.</p>
              <p>A number Opposition members have been detained under the ISA and
              know this detention center inside out. They probably are familiar with
              the toilet used by Mas Selamat and the security flaws in the detention
              center - the redoctrination that purges them of harmful thoughts can
              temporarily increase the urge to escape. Knowing that the govt was
              detaining terrorist there, why didn't they point out the possible ways
              of escape to the govt? ...I don't think the Opposition has any valid
              reasons for denying responsibility for the escape, many have been
              detained there over the years and they spend more time there than
              almost anyone else.</p>
