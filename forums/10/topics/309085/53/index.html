              <p> Here's something in today's Sunday Times, March 16 2008.</p>
              <p><strong>The Jackal Movie on his must-watch list</strong></p>
              <p>*- Salim Osman<br>INDONESIA CORRESPONDENT IN JAKARTA<br>MAS Selamat Kastari learnt how to escape and survive in tough conditions as part of his rigorous regimen in one of Afghanistan's notori­ous terrorist camps, terror­ism experts say.<br>"It's not a surprise that he has yet to be caught by the Singapore authorities," said former Jemaah Islamiah (JI) leader turned anti-terror ac­tivist Nasir Abas.<br>Security analyst Ken Con-boy agreed. Mas Selamat, who led JI's Singapore branch, would be able to sur­vive because of his experi­ence in enduring the cold weather in Afghanistan, he said.<br>"They had to make do with whatever they had then," said Mr Conboy, who has written a book about JI.<br>He said that the Indone­sian pollce officers who raid­ed JI hideouts had found in­struction manuals that in­cluded a section on escape and evading arrest.<br>"Some of the documents seized by police also con­tained instructions for the re­cruits to watch movies like The Jackal and Saving Pri­vate Ryan, for them to draw lessons from," he said.<br>Mr Nash- told The Sunday Times that, based on Mas Se-lamat's experience in Af­ghanistan and information from a training manual be-<br>lieved to have been taken from the United States ar­my, a training camp was set up by JI in Mindanao, in southern Philippines, in 1997.<br>Known as Camp Hudaibi-yah, its programme was not as tough as the ones in Af­ghanistan, but it did include a small section on "escape and evasion".<br>"The first principle that we taught them was not to be captured by the enemy," said Mr Nasir, who was one of the instructors at the camp.<br>"It was a shame to be cap­tured. But if you were caught, you should find op­portunities to escape."<br>Recruits were put through a simulation exer­cise. They were divided into two armed groups which would fight each other for weeks.<br>One group would take a member of the other group hostage. He then had to use his skills to escape. • "We went through the ex­ercise several times until we were confident that the re­cruits had mastered the skills," said Mr Nasir.<br>Recruits were also taught to survive in the dense jun­gles of the Philippines, Indo­nesia and Malaysia. They learnt to extract water from natural sources as well as from certain plants.<br>Mr Nasir said that re­cruits were trained to eat plant shoots, leaves and small animals such as wild fowl and freshwater fish.</p>

              <p>"<strong>Their roles may have included sabotage, espionage, scouting and assassination
                  missions as a way to destabilize and cause social chaos in enemy
                  territory or against an opposing ruler, perhaps in the service of their

              <h1 class="clr">COI’s hearings on JI leader’s escape cannot be held in public</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng said the Committee of
              Inquiry’s (COI) hearings on Mas Selamat Kastari’s escape cannot be made
              public because it will have unrestricted access to the Internal
              Security Department’s (ISD) classified information.</p>
              <p>However, the government will release full details on how the Jemaah
              Islamiyah leader escaped and the kinds of precaution that have to be
              taken in the future.</p>
              <p>DPM Wong, who is also the Home Affairs
              Minister, was speaking to reporters on Sunday on the sidelines of a
              constituency visit to Shunfu.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, authorities are
              not letting up on the search for Singapore’s most wanted man, Mas
              Selamat, who escaped from Whitley Road Detention Centre on 27 February.</p>
              <p>It
              was announced on 2 March that a three—member Committee of Inquiry had
              been tasked to find out what led to his escape. These three members are
              retired judge Goh Joon Seng, ex—police commissioner Tee Tua Ba, and
              deputy secretary at the Home Affairs Ministry, Choong May Ling.</p>
              <p>Recently,
              the Workers’ Party suggested that President S R Nathan appoint a
              Commission of Inquiry under the Prisons Act instead so that
              investigations can be made public.</p>
              <p>The opposition party added that the president could "direct that certain information not be made public".</p>
              <p>Mr
              Wong explained that regardless of the Committee set up to investigate
              the incident, parts of the report will still have to remain classified.</p>
              <p>He
              said: "The Committee will have to look into the security, the
              detention, the investigation as well as the intelligence gathering of
              the Whitley Road Detention Centre and the ISD officers. These matters
              cannot be made public.</p>
              <p>"If it’s made public, it’ll compromise the
              confidentiality of the investigation as well as the intelligence
              gathered so far. That being the case, it’s therefore important that the
              officers are able to speak their minds. Many of them are also
              classified appointments; this means they are not declared to the
              public."</p>
              <p>Mr Wong noted that what is "more important is to provide
              the Committee with unrestricted access for it to conduct a rigorous,
              thorough and comprehensive inquiry. Conducting the inquiry in closed
              chambers provides for and ensures this. It is not an exercise at
              grand—standing or playing to the gallery".</p>
              <p>"This does not mean
              that the public will not be kept informed of the inquiry and its
              findings. I have already said that when the COI completes its inquiry,
              we will give a full account on how Mas Selamat escaped and what has
              been done to prevent another escape," he said.</p>
              <p>The deputy prime
              minister also added that there is no reason to doubt the independence
              of the Committee as the members are not about to put their own
              considerable achievements and good reputations at risk.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong
              later gave an update on the CID’s investigation as well, saying it is
              in the final stages. Its investigation includes interviews with several
              dozen witnesses and forensic examination of the escape scene.</p>
              <p>The report will be submitted to the Attorney—General’s Chambers, which will decide on appropriate follow—up actions. — CNA/so</p>

This is absurd, as he has planned escaped from Day 1 of is incarceration. This this authorities must know, as they know his profile, and the training he has received. Only the timing is not planned.</p>
              <p>Besides "beating about the bushes". they should consider Mas Selamat being holed up in a flat. This will give him time to procure a burka. The burka is too good an option to give it a miss. And that limp, don't bother to look for it. Right now the Police need to squeeze all their informants, for any leads on suspected sympathisers, and do their surveilence work.</p>

              <p>This Monday Chinese evening Wan Pao reported that a taxi driver spotted MSK emerging from the secondary forest and onto the expressway in the early hours of Saturday morning.</p>
              <p>It took MSK almost three weeks to escape being spotted in a densely populated area, keeping under cover, and managed to move more then 10 clicks from where he was last spotted at Thomson Road on the day of his escape.</p>
              <p>He certainly showed alot of resourcefulness and intelligence.</p>
              <p>To capture him, the leadership tasked to recapture him will need to outsmart his every possible move.</p>
              <p>If the taxi driver's information can be determined to be of any accuracy, the authorities will need to encircle the entire Sembawang-Yishun area, and prevent him from getting into the wetlands along the northern coastline.</p>
              <p>It shows that MSK is attempting to reach the coast, swim across the Straits of Johor, and get through the relatively uninhabitted or sparsely populated areas of Johor State, merge into the largely Malay rural population, slip into the Indonesian Rhio Islands, then onwards to the main Indonesian Archipelago - to rejoin his comrades.</p>
              <p>The authorities should also watch the canals and drains, as it provide MSK a natural route of movement that allow him to move over long distance with relative ease and cover from prying eyes.</p>

              <p>i think we need to give some confidence in them.</p>
              <p>i have lots of it.</p>
              <p>I had already said , 6 months or less.</p>
              <p>by that, please don't be mistaken that i think it will take 6 months. What i mean is 6 months or less and that means can be anytime tomorrow.</p>
              <p>at the same time, i suggest hiring true talents from abroad to help. This does not mean we do not have true talents. We already have based on their market value they receiving. What I meant was we need more. Maybe even need to x2 the current salary to attract even more super talented talents to join. Else, i fear some may not join due to lack of money incentive.</p>
