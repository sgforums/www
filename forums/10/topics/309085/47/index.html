              <p>which is why I say, we are not being told the entire story .... maybe there was an traitor from within (most likely), or something like that ..... now that, I find it much more believeable than the toilet break story ...</p>
              <p>but i don't buy your theory ... if they had wanted the fellows disposed of, it's a lot easier to simply say he died of a heart attack (too much lemak, highly possible), or a multitude of other reasons, than to come up with something like that, loosing face internationally, wasting tons of money every day getting hundreds of officer to go strolling through the jungles, causing massive disruptions everywhere, right ? ....</p>

              <p>My cousin's maid's boyfriend saw Mas Selamat around the forest near
              Republic Poly. He called the police and they did search the forest. He
              managed to escape though. He's spotted in ladies wear. I heard that he was spotted around Woodlands a few days ago.</p>
              <p>Maybe that's the reason for the big jam?</p>

              <p>nah, like i said, there are easier ways to deal with this, like a "heart attack" .... put that way, a one sentence news bite on the 9,30 news and the fellow will just fade away forever .... why slap themselves like this .... and it's not cheap to move gurkhas like this around either ...</p>
