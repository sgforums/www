              <p>... For farks sake, cut with the crap, bump up the reward amount, and get it rolling!!</p>
              <p>... they farking think people will spend days hunting for such a fugitive and not incur costs?? Who's paying their domestic utility bills while they go out and do this??? Who pays the petrol? And all other costs of such an effort???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... our "govt" still refuses to wake up their farking ideas...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>===========================================</p>
              <p><strong>Yes, rewards help, says group considering $12,000 bounty  <br>But others say it will send wrong message <br>By Desmond Ng <br> <br>March 05, 2008       <br> <br>FIND us Mas Selamat Kastari and we'll pay you.</strong> <br>  <br>The New Paper on Sunday, 2 Mar.  <br>Security firm Metropolis Security Systems offered $1,000 to its officers to help track down the terrorist yesterday.</p>
              <p>Voluntary group Crime Library also told The New Paper yesterday that it is discussing a $12,000 bounty for the Jemaah Islamiah (JI) detainee.</p>
              <p>But is it necessary to place a reward for the capture of this terrorist, some have asked.</p>
              <p>Have we become so mercenary that we will only react if there's money involved?</p>
              <p>Lawyer Amolat Singh said: 'If you look at it from a purely nationalist point of view, this thing should not be done with money.</p>
              <p>'Some people may also take the high moral ground and say that catching Mas Selamat is our duty. Money should not be involved.'</p>
              <p>A grassroots leader who declined to be named said that putting out a reward could send out the wrong message.</p>
              <p>He said: 'It monetises the whole affair and suggests that Singaporeans will only act if there's money involved. This should be a national effort.'</p>
              <p>Metropolis Security Systems, which employs more than 250 guards, put up the bounty in an internal circular to all its employees yesterday, reported The Straits Times.</p>
              <p>Metropolis operations manager Mutaza Sarbini told The Straits Times: 'With over 250 officers deployed island-wide, we hope to cover some grounds and hopefully mobilise our resources to help the authorities.<br>  <br>Since Mas Selamat's escape, officers from the Singapore Police Force, Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority and the Gurkhas have searched these areas in Singapore.  <br>'We also believe that collective effort by security associations and other private security agencies in Singapore to consolidate effort and resources could bring about synergy and joint-effort with the police in addressing the security issue at hand.'</p>
              <p>Crime Library founder Joseph Tan rationalised that while it is everyone's duty to do his or her part as a citizen, the reward is just an extra motivation.</p>
              <p>'People will offer help and information without being paid. But there are some who won't mind the extra money. If you have an incentive, it will increase the chances of finding him as people become more aware,' he explained.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan said the idea of a reward was suggested by some volunteers during a board meeting last Saturday.</p>
              <p>The group has about 270 volunteers. Based on a less than $50 contribution from each volunteer, the reward should work out to at least $12,000, he said.</p>
              <p>He added: 'No concrete decision has been made yet. The idea is that whoever finds him or has information leading to him will be rewarded.</p>
              <p>'Once we have confirmation, we'll go ahead with placing the reward. At least, that will increase the chances of success.</p>
              <p>'If there's a US$25 million ($35m) reward for Osama bin Laden, why not Mas Selamat?'</p>
              <p>Mr Tan said that in his experience, the reward system does help.</p>
              <p>He cited Crime Library's $50 rewards for information leading to missing persons as examples.</p>
              <p>He said: 'So far, the scheme has been quite successful. We have had about eight payouts so far, with good leads to missing persons. It works.'</p>
              <p>'WONDERFUL'</p>
              <p>Retired police officer Lionel de Souza also thinks the reward system is a wonderful incentive.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I think it's a civil-minded act and there's nothing wrong unless that person offering the reward has a hidden agenda.</p>
              <p>'With that reward, a person may go that extra mile to find Mas Selamat. They may go around asking friends or become more alert.'</p>
              <p>Mr Amolat Singh said it's a fact of life that some monetary benefit will help that cause.</p>
              <p>Also, just because there's a reward, it doesn't mean that the person who helps in the capture of Mas Selamat will take the money.</p>
              <p>He said: 'What's a $10,000 reward for Mas Selamat? If he had succeeded in his threat to bomb Changi Airport, innocent lives will be lost and the economic impact will be terrible.</p>
              <p>'If that happens, even $10,000 may be too little.'</p>
              <p>Some people have questioned if the police should step up and offer a reward too.</p>
              <p>Security officer J Singh said he is surprised there has been no official bounty for Mas Selamat yet.</p>
              <p>The 47-year-old said if he sees the terrorist, he will call the police even if there's no reward.</p>
              <p>But he added: 'Just imagine if someone was harbouring him. If we put a million dollars on his head, the person may give him up for the money.</p>
              <p>'Money can change a lot of things, the person may just think, 'I can go off to Hawaii on a holiday, why should I keep you?'</p>
              <p>When asked if the Government would offer a reward for the arrest of the JI fugitive, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng said on Sunday that 'this is not the practice of the police'.</p>

              <p>... when I further entertain the notion that MSK was murdered under ISD custody, I find the following scenario rather plausible...:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; MSK was already dead, somehow killed during under the custody of ISD</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; his family came and wanted to see him</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; the detention center panics, made his family wait for hours &amp; finally informs them that he escaped when he went to the toilet</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; hence the 4 hours delay in informing the police &amp; public in general</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... It looks VERY plausible that this is what truly happened, because it is very lame to allege that MSK can actually escape through the toilet, and then walk or creep out of the premises...</p>
              <p>... the curiousity is that how come, and only till now, do we hear what the family has to say or anything about his family?</p>
              <p>... I smell a dead rat somewhere...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... furthermore, MSK was ACCUSED of intending or planning to crash an airline into Changi Airport, but up till now since 2006, has this ever been proven and was he ever trialed...??</p>
              <p>... there are simply too many loose ends, and everything that is known, were purported by the "govt" and relevant authorities...</p>
