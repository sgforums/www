              <p>This is proof of how good and efficient our security system is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hong Kan Seng better go pray to his god that this JI leader doesn't go about carrying terrorizing activities, either in Singapore or anywhere else in the world.</p>
              <p>The blood would be on his hands because of his incompetence. The whole world is going to blame Singapore for letting a crippled escape detention.</p>

              <p><br>Mr Wong Kan Seng doesnt not just take charge of the detention centre right? he is the Minister of Home Affair, not the Minister of the Whitley detention centre. Get it right.</p>
              <p>If he resign, who will take the job? Right now, it is to find a solution on how to deal with the situation, not just pointing fingers and asking Minister to resign when the most wanted terrorist is still away.</p>

              <p>Stop blaming executives 20 levels up the hierarchy lar. That`s your emotions talking. It`s not Kan Seng`s fault. I am apathetic towards all political parties but this is exactly how it is. If there is a security lapse, then it is a process issue which means that security procedures/processes are not being followed or they have been discovered to be insufficient. The ones answerable are the ones manning the facility as it is thier job to execute these SOPs and uncover weaknesses and address these concerns. Not CEOs 20 levels up who hardly step into the place and depend and leverage on the good judgements of the people who man the facility. Think straight. Do not compare this with North East Asian countries where personal honour(cultural issue)comes into play. We are far more practical.</p>
              <p>Anyway, operations has stood down apparently. Heard it on the news. 2 things;</p>
              <p>1) already captured..woohoo  :)</p>
              <p>2) New strategy. Let him go and sniff him out?  Come to think of it. It might be even better if he runs. Think about it. They caught him once before. They can certainly catch him again. And maybe with the remnants of the remaining JI force; ending it once and for all finally.</p>
              <p>Accept it and move on. Even gold standard countries like UK, Israel, US, etc have had break-outs and even riots in max security prisons. This is our first time. Learn and move on. We are still the most security conscious in the region(if not the world)and this is really an exception to the norm; albeit a sore thumb for the security establishment. </p>
