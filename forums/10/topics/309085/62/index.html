              <h1 class="clr">PM Lee says ministers shouldn’t be automatically removed for lapses down the line</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said that public
              officers, including ministers, should not be automatically removed or
              punished just because a lapse has occurred down the line.</p>
              <p>He said that while the government must admit its mistakes openly and
              honestly, Singapore should not encourage a culture where officials
              resign whenever something goes wrong on their watch, or encourage
              witch—hunts.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee made his remarks in Parliament, just a day
              after Home Affairs Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng
              gave a detailed account on the escape of Jemaah Islamiyah leader Mas
              Selamat Kastari.</p>
              <p>Since Mas Selamat’s escape some two months ago
              from the Whitley Road Detention Centre, some Singaporeans have made
              calls for the Home Affairs Minister to take responsibility for the
              security lapse and step down.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee said that when things go
              wrong, the government has to deal with it decisively and effectively,
              identify shortcomings and put them right and take steps to prevent
              recurrences.</p>
              <p>But he said Singaporeans should not do this in a manner which would damage and demoralise the security agencies.</p>
              <p>He
              acknowledged that the minister is ultimately accountable for the
              policies and operations of his ministry, but said a rationale approach
              to establish who is responsible for lapses has to be taken.</p>
              <p>These include finding out who failed in their duties and whether there was negligence or incompetence.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Lee made clear though that if there are questions over the integrity of
              the people involved, they would be removed, no matter how minor the
              incident.</p>
              <p>He said the government’s aim is to try and do things
              right the first time and urged Singaporeans not to over—react to one
              bad incident, as it could lead to going overboard in trying to solve a
              problem.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee is satisfied that the Home Affairs Ministry has
              taken the correct remedial and disciplinary action in light of the
              escape.</p>
              <p>And he has thrown his full support behind DPM Wong and
              the Internal Security Department director for the good work done by
              them in the fight against terror.</p>
              <p>PM Lee recognises that
              Singaporeans demand and expect high standards of integrity and
              performance from every public servant, including ministers.</p>
              <p>He assured the House that this is what the government will continually strive to achieve. — CNA/ir</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Three critical factors led to Mas Selamat’s escape</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A confluence of three critical factors led to security
              lapses that resulted in Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) detainee Mas Selamat
              Kastari’s escape from detention in February.</p>
              <p>This was the conclusion of the Committee of Inquiry (COI) on Mas
              Selamat’s escape from the Whitley Road Detention Centre on 27 February
              this year.</p>
              <p>The findings of the three—member panel were presented
              by Deputy Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng in
              Parliament on Monday afternoon in a Ministerial Statement.</p>
              <p>First,
              there was a physical security breach as the ventilation window in the
              toilet — from which Mas Selamat made his escape — did not have grilles.</p>
              <p>Second, the guards watching Mas Selamat allowed him to close the door of the urinal cubicle when they should not have done so.</p>
              <p>And
              third, there was a physical weakness in the perimeter fencing outside
              the Family Visitation Block, where the toilet was located, which made
              it easier for Mas Selamat to get out of the detention centre’s premises.</p>
              <p>On
              the day of his escape, Mas Selamat was escorted by two Gurkha guards
              and a Special Duty Operative — who is an Internal Security Department
              (ISD) officer — from his cell to a locker room to change into civilian
              clothes for his family’s visit.</p>
              <p>At the locker room, the guards
              lost sight of him when he stood behind a column of lockers to change.
              He was then escorted to the Family Visitation Block, where he used a
              toilet, renovated in 2007, to shave and comb his hair before meeting
              his family members.</p>
              <p>He then entered a urinal cubicle, closed the
              door and turned on a water tap inside the cubicle. One guard stood
              outside the cubicle door, while the other was outside the main toilet
              door.</p>
              <p>After a while, the guard outside the cubicle felt Mas
              Selamat was taking too long. But instead of checking, he alerted the
              second guard outside the toilet, who alerted the female Duty Operative.</p>
              <p>The
              Duty Operative then alerted a male Assistant Case Officer, who ran in,
              kicked open the door and found Mas Selamat gone. The ventilation window
              in the cubicle was left open.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong said the delay by the
              guards and their failure to keep Mas Selamat in sight was the second
              most critical security failure which led to the terrorist’s escape. By
              this time, 11 minutes had lapsed since he first entered the toilet.</p>
              <p>The
              COI found that during renovations in 2007, grilles had not been fixed
              to that particular toilet window due to a misunderstanding between the
              ISD and the contractor.</p>
              <p>The superintendent of the centre, who was
              alerted to this weakness in May 2007, asked the contractor to saw off
              the window handle as a security measure instead, which Mr Wong said was
              a bad judgement on the superintendent’s part.</p>
              <p>In addition, the CCTV coverage of the area was being upgraded to add motion—detectors, but the cameras were not yet operational.</p>
              <p>While
              there is no conclusive evidence as to how he had escaped from the
              centre after that, the COI believes Mas Selamat may have climbed onto
              the roof of an enclosed staircase which converges with the perimeter
              fencing. He could then have jumped over the fencing out of the centre.</p>
              <p>The COI also believes that the JI leader had planned his escape over time.</p>
              <p>DPM
              Wong said: "Prior to his escape, during previous family visits, Mas
              Selamat had partially closed the urinal cubicle door on some occasions.</p>
              <p>"On
              5 February 2008, he had closed the urinal cubicle door completely and
              turned on the water tap. The COI believes that these actions by Mas
              Selamat could have been done to test how the guards would react. This
              could also have helped him prepare for his actual escape attempt.</p>
              <p>"This
              planning had not been noted by the guards, possibly because the guards
              are frequently rotated to avoid over familiarisation or fraternisation
              with detainees."</p>
              <p>The COI — comprising Mr Goh Joon Seng, a retired
              High Court Judge; Mr Tee Tua Ba, a retired Commissioner of Police; and
              Dr Choong May Ling, Deputy Secretary of Security at the Home Affairs
              Ministry — was given full access to all information in its
              investigations of Mas Selamat’s escape.</p>
              <p>This included highly
              classified and sensitive information on operational systems and
              processes, as well as access to interviews with ISD intelligence and
              field personnel.</p>
              <p>The committee submitted its report on 10 April
              and Mr Wong said he is "satisfied" that it has "held nothing back" in
              its conclusions and recommendations.</p>
              <p>He added that in view of the
              keen and valid interest of MPs and the public, an Executive Summary has
              been released on the COI’s findings.</p>
              <p>In response to a question
              from opposition non—constituency MP Sylvia Lim, Mr Wong said Prime
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong is expected to make a ministerial statement in
              Parliament on Tuesday on government responsibility for Mas Selamat’s
              escape. — CNA/so</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Singapore PM says top home ministry officials not responsible for terror escape</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE - Singapore's prime minister Tuesday voiced support for the
              city-state's top Home Ministry officials following a government probe
              that showed several security lapses allowed a top terror suspect to
              escape a prison.</p>
              <p>Speaking in Parliament, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong acknowledged
              that Muslim terror suspect Mas Selamat Kastari's escape from a
              detention center should never have happened.</p>
              <p>"We must admit our mistakes openly and honestly, put them right, and act against those who have been culpable," Lee said.</p>
              <p>But
              Lee said he remained confident in Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng,
              as well as the top management of Wong's ministry, whom the leader said
              were not to blame. Wong is also a deputy prime minister.</p>
              <p>"I am
              satisfied that the ministry has taken the correct remedial and
              disciplinary action, and that the minister and top management were not
              to blame for what has happened," Lee said.</p>
              <p>The Home Ministry
              oversees the Internal Security Department, which runs the Whitley Road
              Detention Center where Mas Selamat, like other terror suspects, was
              being detained without trial.</p>
              <p>Wong had reported Monday the
              results of a government probe into the Feb. 27 jailbreak of Mas
              Selamat, who once allegedly plotted to hijack an airplane and crash it
              into Singapore's international airport.</p>
              <p>The probe showed that Mas
              Selamat had slipped out through an unsecured bathroom window when
              surveillance cameras were turned off.</p>
              <p>The escape triggered a
              monthlong nationwide manhunt in which police, special operations
              officers, elite Gurkha guards and soldiers combed the island nation's
              forests. Border security was tightened. Authorities believe Mas Selamat
              is still in the country.</p>
              <p>Lee said he understood that the
              government had to be accountable to its citizens for mistakes that
              happen, but urged the public against overreacting.</p>
              <p>"I think it's
              true that Singaporeans have very high expectations of their government
              and therefore whenever there's a lapse, they take it very seriously,"
              he said. "But the last thing we need is a witch hunt which would damage
              and demoralize our intelligence and security agencies."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Why we need to recruit foreign nationals to Team Singapore.  Mas Selamat can escape from a toilet, climb down pipes, fence, cross a field without making any sound and without being seen.  And in just a matter of minutes.  Wat the hell was the other bleedy minister Mahbok Tan doing all this time?  If he recruited Mas Selamat to our national sporting team, he would not have become involved in JI activites!!!</p>

                                          would damage and demoralise the security agencies.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Albeit a fair statement for the security agencies, it is unfair to expect Singaporeans citizens, civilians, to not feel discouraged &amp; demoralised over the what has transpired. </p>
              <p>No, we should not expect the Minister of Home Affairs to resign over what has happened.  However, what happened will also invite criticism about pay increases for ministers.  One cannot help observe that high salary does not seem to have direct co-relation to a ministry's effectiveness.</p>
              <p>A cynical "Congratulations" to Mas Selamat, for being the "Sam Fisher" of Singapore.  He has beat the entire ministry of home affairs with 7 rolls of toilet paper in his escape from a supposedly "high-security" detention facility. </p>
              <p>I hope our security agencies will be on high alert now.  Its almost impossible to believe MSK is still in Singapore, and we should do as MM Lee says, "Brace for retaliation."</p>

              <p>since security is reportedly poor, maybe it is time to look into the security leaderships and men's wages. It is said that paying millions will bring in the talented talents.</p>
              <p>So, in this  respect, you may have suggested a solution never tried before for security. If i were security and paid just 1.5 million a year, i pledge to do whatever my boss tell me to say, do and write. I will serve with 100% best. if this does not work, plug in another 1.5 million to make it nice and round figure of 3 million a year. CPF and Bonus and perks and allowances not yet included somemore.</p>
              <p>good idea!  but who pays?</p>

              <h1 class="clr">MPs focus on accountability of ministers in case of serious lapses</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The questions and answers which followed Prime Minister Lee
              Hsien Loong’s ministerial statement on Tuesday still focused on
              accountability and responsibility for the escape of Jemaah Islamiyah
              (JI) detainee Mas Selamat Kastari.</p>
              <p>Some MPs even broached the idea — whether ministers should resign,
              as CEOs do in the private sector, when there are serious lapses.</p>
              <p>But the prime minister said calls for public officers to resign should be rejected.</p>
              <p>"If
              you take this to the logical conclusion, it should go all the way up to
              the prime minister. And every time something happens in the government,
              you change (the) prime minister. This is not how this government
              works," said Mr Lee.</p>
              <p>MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC Inderjit Singh
              expressed confidence in the deputy prime minister and the Internal
              Security Department (ISD), but also raised the issue of punishment.</p>
              <p>"We
              have adopted a reward system that matches that of the private sector
              that we pay everyone as high as possible. And therefore people expect
              that — when you make a mistake, you (should) be appropriately
              punished," he said.</p>
              <p>The prime minister reiterated that punishments must depend on the results of investigations.</p>
              <p>"If
              you generate the culture that nobody wants to make mistakes and (is)
              afraid to do something for fear of making mistakes, that — as Dr Goh
              Keng Swee used to say — would be the biggest mistake of all," said Mr
              Lee. — CNA/ac</p>

              <p>We are all complacent.</p>
              <p>1. why din we audit the DC?</p>
              <p>2. why din we keep watch of abang?</p>
              <p>3. why din we go into the forests and under rain and catch abang ?</p>
              <p>4. why did we focus on our work and not on the abang?</p>
              <p>you see, we have sinned. But this is an honest mistake. So, we are pardoned. not our fault.</p>
              <p>the pore has shown the world and all intellectuals what our leadership is all about.  they so great and integrity.</p>
              <p>if no change in future, i resign from the inc. I swear.</p>
