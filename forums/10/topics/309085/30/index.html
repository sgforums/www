              From this escape i can guess:
              
              1. No razor barbs/electric fence covering the parameter of the center
              2. Toilet have grill-less windows, poorly designed
              3. Kastari was not GPS tagged
              4. Kastari was not bound properly
              5. No moat was dug around the centre
              6. Was not dress in properly bright orange jumpsuit

              8. Toilet is around 1st or 2nd storey 
              9. Responsible personnel/staff did not attend seminars in Guantanamo Bay

              <p> ESCAPED terrorist Mas Selamat Kastari was seen limping up a flight of
              steps leading to a wooded park, near the Whitley Road Detention Centre
              where he bolted on Wednesday at about 4.05 pm.</p>
              <p>The manager of a car washing kiosk at the Esso petrol station on
              Whitley Road was reported by Shin Min Daily as having told his worker
              that he saw a short-hair man, whose upper body was bare and who was
              wearing brown shorts with the letters WRC embossed on it, struggling up
              the flight of about 50 steps at about 5 pm, barely an hour after his
              daring escape from the detention centre.</p>
              <p>The wooded park leads to Bukit Brown Chinese cemetery.</p>
              <p>Acting on this lead, about 40 Gurkha guards searched the thickly-wooded cemetery on Friday afternoon.</p>
              <p>An extensive manhunt continued on Friday for the leader of the
              Singapore Jemaah Islamiah (JI) terror network, who has been on the run
              for three days now.</p>
              <p>On Friday, posters of of Singapore's most wanted man went up
              in many public places, such as MRT stations, bus interchanges, shopping
              centres and mosques.</p>
              <p> Leaflets were also pushed into letter-boxes of residents living in
              landed property, seeking their help to look out for the fugitive, who
              once plotted to crash a hijacked plane onto Changi Airport and bomb
              several American establishments in Singapore.</p>

              <p>to be fair, it's not 100% wank king seng's fault also....</p>
              <p>he's in charge of the Internal Security Department but he also dunno what's happening all the time.</p>
              <p>like bill gates like that, run big company.....how will he know whether that no-name Microsoft assistant project supervisor in singapore bullies newcomers?</p>
              <p>it's like you're working in a super big organization......if something happens to you, will the big boss know?</p>
              <p>same goes to wank king seng.</p>
              <p>the problem is that the ministers here are holding too much portfolios, thus WKS's title as head of the ISD is merely a ceremonial role,......his feet is not on the ground.</p>
              <p>seems that every ministers is holding at least 2 major portfolios and several countless minor ones....most of them are also holding MP titles as well....haiz....</p>
              <p>now the main thing is to catch that b**tard and hang him, and put the death video on youtube to taunt the rest of the terrorists.</p>
              <p>i wonder if 1 month later still catch no man, will the gahmen eventually loosen the operations and let their guard down and pretend nothing has ever taken place.</p>
              <p>like Bush vs. Osama like that.</p>
              <p>8 years liao still catch no Osama, now nobody care also once the flame has died down.</p>
              <p>if US army + entire world cannot catch Osama, u think our flawless SAF can catch Mas Selamat "The-one-who-shamed-WKS" Kestari?</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Thorough search for JI leader leads to massive congestion at land checkpoints</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Singapore’s authorities are not letting up in their efforts
              to nab Jemaah Islamiyah leader Mas Selamat Kastari, who escaped from
              Whitley Road Detention Centre on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Officers are working round the clock to man possible exit points.</p>
              <p>However, enhanced security checks have also led to massive congestion at Singapore’s main land checkpoints.</p>
              <p>In
              a departure from the norm at Woodlands Checkpoint, officers were clad
              in bulletproof vests and every vehicle headed for Malaysia is
              thoroughly checked.</p>
              <p>And one thing the new system did yield,
              underscoring the thoroughness of the checks, was an illegal immigrant
              and possible overstayer in the luggage compartment of this tour bus.</p>
              <p>Tan
              Kong Hui, Dy Commander of Counter—Terrorism &amp; Security at Woodlands
              Checkpoint, said: "We have increased our checks for all modes of
              transport, be it bus, lorries, buses, motorcycles. We have conducted
              very thorough checks on travellers, their luggage and all vehicles. We
              have also increased our manpower to enhance security checks."</p>
              <p>But the enhanced security also led to massive traffic congestion.</p>
              <p>Truck
              drivers who do regular Singapore—Malaysia trips said they had been
              stuck since the previous evening, with some taking up to 15 hours to
              get cleared.</p>
              <p>A lot of the truck drivers said that they have been in their vehicles from Thursday and were unable to get cleared.</p>
              <p>In fact, many of them said they haven’t had a chance to sleep, shower or even get some food.</p>
              <p>The congestion had a domino effect on workers in the area and many opted to walk instead.</p>
              <p>Security
              was also enhanced along Singapore’s shoreline, where people have been
              known to bypass official immigration channels. —CNA/vm</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Search for JI leader continues with posters put up island—wide</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The search for Jemaah Islamiah leader Mas Selamat Kastari, who escaped from detention has gone global.</p>
              <p>Interpol, the world’s largest police organisation has issued an
              urgent security alert on the fugitive who escaped from the Whitley Road
              Detention Centre on 27 February.</p>
              <p>He’d been detained since 2006, under the Internal Security Act.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat is the alleged JI leader of Singapore, who had plotted to crash a hijacked aeroplane into Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>The face and information about the wanted JI leader has been shown to law enforcement officers worldwide.</p>
              <p>Interpol has put the profile of Mas Selamat on its website, to allow officers to identify and track him down.</p>
              <p>Posters of the fugitive have also been placed in the Indonesian provinces of Solo and Riau.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, the search continues.</p>
              <p>Over 20 Gurkhas conducted a sweep at the Bukit Brown Cemetery, off Lornie Road.</p>
              <p>Police officers also distributed posters of Mas Selamat to private estates nearby.</p>
              <p>Another avenue to extend the search was to rope in the public transport companies.</p>
              <p>Taxi companies flashed information on the fugitive on their mobile data terminals.</p>
              <p>One cabbie said: "We pick up many passengers and there’re so many taxis in Singapore so it’s a good lookout for it."</p>
              <p>From taxis to buses and bus interchanges, the authorities are giving out information on the JI leader Mas Selamat.</p>
              <p>Posters
              can also be seen in many bus interchanges and even inside MRT trains.
              All these reflect a concerted effort to capture the man on the run.</p>
              <p>The posters have also been strategically placed at bus interchanges — where there’s heavy human traffic.</p>
              <p>Even inside the bus drivers’ lounge, the mug shots hang prominently on the notice board.</p>
              <p>It’s hoped such efforts would heighten awareness and everyone will play their part. —CNA/vm</p>

              <p>The police a bit stupid, he escaped from Onraet Rd, besides heading southwards towards Dunearn Rd, there could be a possibility that he had went Eastwards to Thomson Rd, westwards to Bukit Brown Cemetery, Northwards to Lornie Rd at MacRitchie Reservoir.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Asumming what the Esso guy said was true and that the guy who climbed the hill was Mas Selamat, there is still a possibility that he could have taken a bus/took an accomplice car from Whitley Rd at CJC. Unless he is hiding inside the woods. Maybe they should check specifically, like inside SJI, CJC, SCGS, Barker, Tanglin CC too.</p>
