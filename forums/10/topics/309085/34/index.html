              <p>I think current sg has not have experience with street riots, city level violence , bombs and natural disasters .</p>
              <p>yes on paper we have home team and many teams.</p>
              <p>but this incidents serves to show that sg needs to be more on high alert than it is reported to be or impressed upon to be or is thought to be. dun be mistaken by me. i think sg is very very secure but then how to exprain this escape? not a 7-11 thief escape but a TERRORism related kinda escape.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think some clear expranationes need to be released by the press and live interviews on national tv need to be aired for all to see, question and demand for answers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we need to give foreigners and investors an impression that it is safe and that ours highly renumerated leaders of the world record calibre need to show what they are made of to stand the test of 'fire' that is this incident and they need to again re-create to the world the impression that this tiny little single city  country is safe and not like other terror-infested regions. and all citizens expect nothing than the best at world class level the handling of this shocking and terrorizing incident. and rightly so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all our interests is at stake and  I like to see some world record effort put to repair the damage (commerce, stocks, shares, investments, sentiments, business, tourism etc) that is done not just to the leaders but also most important of all the PEOPLE. our reputation is at stake. when we go over the seas, how to face the foreigners ? i for now will not say where I come from.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I URGE. I ENCOURAGE. I HOPE. the people responsible for sg security and image and terrorism do your due diligence and repair this damage pronto. the cost may be too great!  act now!  </p>

              <p>There must have been one security lapse arfter another at the
              Whitley Detention Centre, which allowed Mas  to simply make a
              sudden decision to break out.</p>
              <p>After the breakout was discovered, it was odd that the
              Authorities did not consider making the situation public and sought
              public assistance to watch out for him unitl more then 24 hours
              later.</p>
              <p>It was sheer stupidity to conduct the manhunt in a limited
              area12 hours after the escape, and limited the search to an
              area south of the Whitley Detention Centre.</p>
              <p>How  was a limpining man suppose to cross a busy 8 lane PIE
              at 4.05 p.m.- from the Police Academy side to the opposite side of
              the PIE ?</p>
              <p>Thursday news on TV reported the search at the residential
              area around Chancery Lane  to the Whitley section of the PIE -
              over a period  of more then 20 hours  since the jail
              break on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Did no one consulted the Commandos to find out what they will do
              to survive and evade capture under the same
              circumstances ?</p>
              <p>The cordon should have gone around the entire area bounded by
              Thomson Road, Newton Road, Dunearn Road, Lornie-Adam Road - and a
              simultaneous search of the entire area that will include
              construction sites and drain culverts.</p>
              <p>The public should have been informed immediately, and not
              alerted 20 hours later.</p>
              <p>The cocept of ''TOTAL DEFENSE'' failed.</p>

              <p>i think mas didn't "simply make a
              sudden decision to break out". he must have been observing the security procedure and found the lapses then later made his escape.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it is not more than 24 hours or 12 hours later but 4 hours later that public was informed and the search conducted. i was travelling along malcom park when i heard the news over radio and saw police along the road.</p>

              <p>Mas Selamat has fled to Indonesia: The Star</p>
              <p>KUALA LUMPUR - SINGAPORE'S most wanted terror fugitive, Mas Selamat
              Kestari, who had worked with Malaysian Jemaah Islamiah members to carry
              out terrorist activities at one time, is believed to have fled for
              Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Regional security sources believe Mas Selamat, who escaped from
              the Whitley Road Detention Centre in Singapore on Wednesday, had
              already made his way to a cluster of Indonesian islands, some 45
              minutes by speedboat from Singapore.</p>
              <p>'Mas Selamat knows the backdoor to Bintan and other
              Indonesian islands by heart. He was a frequent traveller when he was
              allegedly heading the JI network in the republic,' said a source.</p>

              <p>Mas Selamat has fled to Indonesia: The Star</p>
              <p>KUALA LUMPUR - SINGAPORE'S most wanted terror fugitive, Mas Selamat Kestari, who had worked with Malaysian Jemaah Islamiah members to carry out terrorist activities at one time, is believed to have fled for Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Regional security sources believe Mas Selamat, who escaped from the Whitley Road Detention Centre in Singapore on Wednesday, had already made his way to a cluster of Indonesian islands, some 45 minutes by speedboat from Singapore.</p>
              <p>'Mas Selamat knows the backdoor to Bintan and other Indonesian islands by heart. He was a frequent traveller when he was allegedly heading the JI network in the republic,' said a source.</p>

              <p><strong> No trail of S'pore terror fugitive: Interpol chief</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20080301/sg-checkpts.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="220"></p>
              <p>INTERPOL, which has issued a worldwide security following the escape of
              the Islamic terror leader from a Singapore detention centre, said
              authorities have 'no trail for the moment' on the fugitive who has been
              on the run for almost four days.</p>
              <p>Interpol's executive director of police services, Mr Jean-Michel
              Louboutin, told The Associated Press that the escaped Mas Selamat
              Kastari, 47, who headed the Singapore Jemaah Islamiah (JI) militant
              network, is 'someone who presents a potential physical danger to
              others, but also a potential danger by organising future bombings'.</p>
              <p>The international police organisation on Friday put out an
              'Orange Notice' for the JI terrorist, who has been linked to Al-Qaeda
              and a sensational plot to hijack a plane and crash it into Singapore's
              Changi airport.</p>
              <p>The Interpol notice, together with Mas Selamat's photograph
              and fingerprints, were issued to the group's 186 national member
              bureaus following a request by Singapore on Thursday, the agency said.</p>
              <p>'When it comes to escapes, the first hours are crucial,' said Mr Louboutin.</p>
              <p>'The state of Singapore has put into operation everything
              that's needed to be done. It's a small country, so it's easy to cross
              and leave.'</p>
              <p> Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng told Parliament on
              Thursday that Mas Selamat escaped because of a 'security lapse' at the
              detention centre. He had been taken from his cell to a visitors room
              where he was waiting for his family to make a scheduled visit. He
              escaped after being granted permission to visit the washroom,
              authorities said.</p>
              <p>Singaporean authorities have launched a nationwide manhunt
              for the man they say walks with a limp. Police and military personnel
              set up a blockade around the detention centre, while security was
              tightened at land, air and sea entry ports.</p>
              <p>Analysts said Mas Selamat, who is 1.6m tall and weighs 63 kg, would try to flee to Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Mr Sutarman, chief of police of Riau Islands province, which
              shares a sea border with Singapore, told Indonesia's state-run Antara
              news agency on Thursday that Singapore 'sent us an urgent notice
              requesting intensified patrols to prevent the terrorist from entering
              Indonesia'.</p>
              <p>He said Mas Selamat 'possesses good knowledge' about entering Indonesia illegally.</p>
              <p>Indonesian police chief Sutanto told reporters in Jakarta that
              his force would help Singapore if the JI militant makes it to
              Indonesia.</p>
              <p>'It's our common obligation, as terrorism is a threat to any
              country,' he said, adding: 'We've taken all important measures,'
              without elaborating.</p>
              <p>Authorities have blamed JI for a string of regional attacks
              including the 2002 bombings on the Indonesian resort island of Bali,
              which killed 202 people, mostly tourists.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Security breaches are virtually unheard of in Singapore.
              Among its security services' biggest successes were foiling alleged
              plots to bomb the US Embassy, the American Club and government
              buildings in 2001 - schemes in which Mas Selamat allegedly had a hand.</span></p>
              <p>Mas Selamat fled Singapore in December 2001 following an Internal Security Department operation against JI.</p>
              <p>He was arrested on the Indonesian island of Bintan near
              Singapore in 2003, reportedly for carrying false identification, and
              was jailed for 18 months.</p>
              <p>He was later released but rearrested in Indonesia in January
              2006 before being handed over to Singapore, where he was held under the
              Internal Security Act, which allows for detention without trial.</p>
              <p>The 2001 security operation in Singapore led to 15 people
              being arrested, 13 of whom were suspected JI members who allegedly
              planned to attack a bus full of Americans.</p>
              <p>Mr Sidney Jones, who has extensively studied JI for the
              International Crisis Group of analysts, said Mas Selamat was a
              hardliner but now had little power in the group, whose Indonesian
              leadership now rejects 'Al-Qaeda tactics' targeting foreigners. -- AP,
              AFP.</p>
