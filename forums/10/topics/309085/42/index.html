              <p>Come to think of it.......you think it is easy to escape from Internal Affairs custody?  It could be a æ”¾é•¿çº¿é’“å¤§é±¼(literally lay down a long line to catch bigger fish).  In English it means using Mas as a bait to nab the ultimate leader of JL in neighbouring country.</p>
              <p>So if any JL member read this, please don't help Mas. Unless you cut open his stomach and remove that casio GPS that IA implanted in his body.</p>
              <p>If within weeks, Indonesian police announced that they managed to nab the key person of JL together with Mas, then my theory is correct. Indonesian police will be more than happy for this deal because they got the credit although it is our sniper that fire the shot on the fugitive left leg three toe.</p>

              <p>Im not suggesting to you that they can sniff you out and pick out your trail. Im telling you. And yes, I have worked with them before. Im also telling you that you can get a group and let them do a demonstration for you. They do not need to do it at thier base. They can show you at Woodlands Checkpoint. Do you know how many kernels they have there? A lot. It`s huge. There`s an entire pit for training. The K-9 has moved from Ulu Pandan which is the current site for Police Kins Unit(basically a police variant of the People`s defence forces dedicated to the protection of key installations who are also trained in Fibua). They use the apartments facing Ulu Pandan Road to do Fibua. (There`s another camp in Mandai where they train together with SOC and Star) The ones behind the old basketball court are used as barracks. I am aware that the kernels are in front of the cookhouse. It is currently adjacent to the Camp Commander`s office. There`s a small shrine stuck in a tree along the road leading up to the hill and in front of the kernels. There is a small path from the mess which leads to the buildings behind facing the old bastketball court.</p>
              <p>The dogs are good but they are not perfect especially in the moist tropical jungle where the detention centre is located. Especially when there is a time lag of several hours. If tracker dogs are so good, not a single criminal will still be free.</p>

              <p>The police and the SAF each have their own dog units. I have the luxury to work at provost dog unit but i only work with guard dogs like malinois and german shepherds. They also have labradors and dogs that can sniff out explosives, metal or drugs.</p>

              <p>They(police force and saf) are not trying to trick. I think reporters are the one trying to con pple. The reporters always exaggerate stuff. A recent example would be edison chen's case. Edison only said he will be away from hk entertainment. Reporters goes on to exaggerate he will be RETIRING SHOWBIZ instead. walao edison can go hollywood lor.</p>

              <p>Dead in the middle of the night, hawker center/wet market got food and water.</p>
              <p>Some stall hang their food in such a way that people can <em>churi</em> if they want to. e.g the bananas of goreng pisang stalls. Wash basins water can drink straight from the tap. If he is in the catchment area forest, the kampong boy can live off rain water and fruits. He only need to keep still during the day, and the searchers must prod every bush, hole, and thicket they come across.</p>
              <p>Furthermore he maybe in someone's home holding the occupant hostage with a cleaver.</p>
              <p>Or he already met up with undiscovered members of JI in Singapore. His wife and family knows of his activities, and could be the contact, passing coded contingency plans to his accomplices.</p>
