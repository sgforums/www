              <p>MSK dead?</p>
              <p>ya lor rumour has it long ago .  in many kopishops.</p>
              <p>i was wondering....what would the friendly terrorists gang think if MSK is really dead? of course, there is no evidence he is already. intellectually rebuting , what exactly is the legal evidence that he IS INSIDE the pore? But hypothetically, what would be the backlash if any?</p>
              <p>;)</p>
              <p>agree that for such a tiny city that is called a country also, where every where is fully developed already and man-maid, and fully populated, there is very tiny excuse for not being able to capture a limping man for 2 months.</p>

              <p>I wonder why Mas Selamat is not found until now....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is anyone helping and sheltering him?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is he dead, or living in the Singapore forest by eating the forests' fruits as food?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Noody knows...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My guess is his family members must be giving him food without the knowledge of the authorities...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or he must have esaped out of Singapore, somewhere safe and keeping a very low profile, until everything cools down... years later I reckon.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you really believe he is still in Singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The security officers who were supposed to guard him had just made a total unimaginable blunder....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the minister-in-charge of Home Affair, who is very highly paid (higher than a company's CEO I guess), is not held responsible for this blunder...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And now you think our Immigration Officers are Supermen and Wonder Women who could detect Mas Selamat from the thousands of people who are leaving Singapore everyday? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nobody's perfect and so are the Immigration Officers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you really think that Mas Selamat didn't really plan his escape from detention, and next out of Singapore? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He might have changed his identity totally and only God knows where he is now.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I was in the Government, I would be be very shameful for such a thing to happen.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The first thing everyone knows now the detention barrack wasn't really prepared to detain this kind of people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, with this shortcoming, guards should be placed in and out of the building to ensure 100% that no convict disappears without anyone knowing...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Questions:</p>
              <p>Who is responsible to make sure that the barrack is fool-proof so that no convict can escape that easily?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who is in charge of deploying the guards to ensure 100% surveillance on convicts?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who is in charge of the system to ensure that a double security features are implemented before this blunder happens?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, when it had already happened, the government is saying that this is one lesson we must learn and ensure that it doesn't happen again.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Haven't we heard that before???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I say the governement is now fire-fighting to rectify their shortcomings, instead of planning earlier to ensure the security of our country a formidable one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck to catching Mas Selamat...</p>

              <p>What do you guys understand by the phrase 'lets move on' on the abang case?</p>
              <p>Why move on now?</p>
              <p>He is still at large in the PORE according to people who give me the impression they are honest , accountable and talented CEO level.</p>
              <p>I think we can move on WHEN abang found, dead or alive.</p>
              <p>Sounds a bit strange to me when they suggest we move on when the case is still WIDE OPEN.</p>
              <p>POREans lives are at risk now more than ever before toilet break. What happens if abang does something shocking to the pore?</p>
              <p>What does it mean by 'move on'?</p>
              <p>Would not Complacency set in if our mentality is to 'move on' ?</p>
              <p>I normally would use the term 'move on' when there is closure.</p>
              <p>Btw, Is THERE ANYONE HUMANOID in this PLANET caLLED the EarTH being responsible for the search and recapture of abang ? Who is responsible if he is not captured forever?  I for 1 hold myself responsible for not capturing him. I am not sure who else is responsible. Tell me.</p>
