              <p>what I find thats irritating is the media reports - notice they only report positive reactions of the police still having public faith etc and not the part that many people, from the ones I spoke to, are really angered at how something like this can happen in the first place, who's to blame? during coffee breaks, many have said that  the minister should take repsonsibilty. what's the point in paying someone so much money? and we're talking 2 million by the way. if singapore is a corporate company (they have compared singapore to one - espeically when it comes to their salaries and how their pays have been benchmarked to CEOs and COOs) the company would have fired the guy already - most of us would know that!</p>
              <p>looks like its another case of - 'lets sweep this under the carpet and hope for the best and speak to media to ask to report only positive reports and no gorvernment criticism of any sorts'. this is rather scary. the shit hits the fan - let just say 'sorry it has happened' and get on with our money making. we are talking about a terrorist here, not just some loan shark or drug abuser that got away!

              <p><strong>Hoax caller who claims to be escaped JI terror leader arrested</strong></p>
              <p>POLICE have arrested a 58-year-old man who made a hoax call from a public phone, claiming that he is the escaped Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) detainee Mas Selamat Kastari.</p>
              <p>The man, who called from a phone booth at Block 10 Haig Road on Thursday at about 5.10 pm, also threatened to attack multiple locations, said a police statement on Friday.</p>
              <p>Police investigations are on-going.</p>
              <p>Police also warned the public that that they will not 'hesitate to take firm action against persons committing such offences.'</p>
              <p>A massive land, sea and air search is continuing to hunt down Mas Selamat, 47, leader of the Singapore JI terror network, who fled from Whitley Road Detention Centre on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
              <p>Posters of the wanted fugitive - one showing him with a moustache and goatee and the other, clean-shaven - have been put up at many public places and immigration checkpoints to urge people to call 999 immediately if they spot him.</p>
