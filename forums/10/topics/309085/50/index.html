              <p>Searching for an intelligent operative such as MSK, will require the searchers to think like him, live like him under similar circumstances, and review all the various options open to him.</p>
              <p>He is stretching the resources and patience of the authorities, with time in in his favor and his only trump card to escape Singapore.</p>
              <p>The longer the days passed, he will surely believe that he can wear down the Home Team personnel involve - as all it need is another slip in recognising ''the face''.</p>
              <p>How long can the image of his face remain etched in the minds of everyone ?</p>
              <p>He will probably grow a beard by now, and there is no update of his photofit.</p>
              <p>Thanks to the efforts at greening Singapore, there exist a thick foliage under every overpass of vehicle and pedestrain traffic, and along major highways, as well as beneath bridges.</p>
              <p>By now, D+11, MSK can be in so many different places - waiting out in the nature reserves of middle Singapore, or he can be in our midst - living in the crooks and crannies of abandon construction sites or warehouses or buildings, or under bridges.</p>
              <p>In the past, illegal immigrants were able to find a hideout and escaped detection for months in Singapore - under the nose of our supposed super intelligence service and Home Team.</p>
              <p>It was not until some news reporter known to snoop around for local buzz that the hideout was exposed, and the Home Team conducted a sweep.</p>
              <p>At D+11, looking for MSK will be similar to the proverbial term of ''looking for a needle in the haystack''.</p>

              <p>Considering the entire episode from D+0 to D+11, this whole exercise resemble a 'black &amp; white' keystone cop caper from the 1910s.</p>
              <p>It sounds almost incredible that the escape from a toilet will lead MSK out into the wide world of this Little Red Dot.</p>
              <p>Why should the toilet escape not result in MSK landing within the protected and fenced ground of the Detention Centre ?</p>
              <p>How did he get through the multi-layered perimeter security, and get past the Gurkha guards that are on duty even at Drug Detention Centres, and even medium security prisons ?</p>
              <p>The multiple different release of the clothes that MSK was supposed to be wearing leads to the confusion.</p>
              <p>The ultimate and incredible truth would be that somehow MSK is now made to disappear from the surface of this earth - on purpose.</p>
              <p>He is now a nameless and faceless person within the Prison System, and is either truly physically and spiritually dead, or ''made to be dead'' for some ultimate political or security purpose.</p>
              <p>The entire system is now activated to reinforce an officially sanctioned line projected to the public.</p>
              <p>Complacency from a political system that is arrogant about the necessity to be disciplined in being the best and most efficient.in the World ?</p>
              <p>It is too convenient and simplistic to believe that the system has been complacent when reconsidering the entire episode of how MSK escape from a Detention Centre through the toilet.</p>

              <p>if that MSK guy did sent a message, u can bet it will not be a `hello, i am safely out of sinkapore" message on you tube, it may be a devastating reminder. i shudder to even say in what form.</p>
              <p>he must be caught at all costs. his mere escapes raised hopes to the other JI jokers on the prowl outside of sinkapore and whats to prevent them from taking part in a sting operation or pot shot on sinkapore just to prove a point?</p>
              <p>never underestimate these jokers. WKS and LHL should sweat buckets. LKY too. when he says that there is no imminent danger to sinkapore, it's just his cocky self again. must sinkapore suffers a costly lesson to know tt it is in imminent danger?</p>
              <p>you lose a terrorist cell leader and u try to make light of it. b4 that, all the talk about how sinkapore needs to be at its vigilant best and stay alert 24/7 bullshit, and when one of the terrorists escape, suddenly siinkapore is not in that much danger after all.</p>
              <p>the MIW can just say what they like....but the fact remains they cocked up big time. and that swell in their pants is getting bigger as days go by.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">MHA responds to queries on Committee of Inquiry into Mas Selamat’s escape</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Home Affairs has responded to queries from
              the Workers’ Party, regarding the Committee of Inquiry into Mas Selamat
              Kastari’s escape from detention.</p>
              <p>According to the ministry, Deputy Prime Minister and Home Affairs
              Minister Wong Kan Seng has said that after the inquiry is completed,
              the public will get a full account of how Mas Selamat escaped and what
              has been done to tighten security to prevent a repeat of such incident.</p>
              <p>In
              a statement to the media, the chairman of the Workers’ Party Sylvia Lim
              had asked if the public will be given full information as the committee
              is convened under the Prisons Act.</p>
              <p>She said under the Act, such
              inquiries are not open to the public and that no part of the
              proceedings may be released to anyone without the minister’s written
              permission. — CNA/ac</p>

              <p>Why can't they accept and assume that selamat is now overseas?  All the focus have been on home ground and that is embarassing with all resources deployed to locate him in small country.  We are telling the world how incompetent we are.</p>
              <p>What are the efforts made so far to track him overseas? Is it as full fledged as it is on home ground?</p>
              <p>If I were him, I weren't even remained in Indonesia.  I am on my way to meet or already dinning with Bin Laden.  The AQ will keep him at their quarters and will not deploy him on battle-ground for the next 10 years.  But they will make use of his knowledge and information.  He is a highly prized intel to the terrorists and he poses more danger to singapore with the information he holds.</p>
              <p>He might not care if his family is still in singapore.  What motivates a terrorist to sacrifice his life is the belief that his soul will go direct to heaven if he died in the name of allah.</p>
              <p>As the saying goes, "what didn't kill you, make you stronger".  So, singapore embraced yourself together and be prepared for the worst.  There is one more reason to kick the ruling party out if anything happens to Singapore.</p>

              This could go down in Singapore history as the biggest and longest Saikang law enforcement/Security operation.Just wondering how many people still believe that Mas Selamat is on his own ?

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Minster Mentor Lee names complacency and Mas Selamat’s cleverness in deceptively winning the trust of his captors as factors in his escape.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Michael Crichton, in the introduction to his book “The Great Train Robbery”, cites studies of prison populations that show that inmates equal the general public in intelligence tests – and yet they are only that fraction of lawbreakers who are caught. Needless to say, those who manage to stay free are of superior minds. Crichton then tells the true story of one such mastermind at work.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Being the leader of a criminal organisation, Mas Selamat would have intelligence above average. The likelihood then is that he would have been able to outsmart his immediate guards. For people of matching or higher intelligence would not have been assigned routine-type guard duties in the first place.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So some safeguards are needed. The guards’ supervisors, and their superiors, must have the ability to see through the tricks and guises of their captives; and they must make it a point to regularly monitor the interactions between captor and captive. Also, there have to be constant rotation of the guards for each captive to prevent any captive from gaining the slightest psychological control over his captor. A further measure is to deliberately disrupt every routine once in a while in random to prevent set patterns.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Whether these measures were already in place, or are indeed necessary, we would have to wait for the commissioner of inquiry’s report to be out.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Generally, people who succeed against high odds are not just intelligent; they are also highly determined and disciplined. In a criminal mind, these three traits are a lethal combination.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In the fight against terrorism, authorities worldwide seem to be forever chasing the lizard’s tail – banning steel cutlery after September 11, requiring young and old to remove their shoes after the shoe-bomber, throwing barricades around bars after Bali, heavily-armed guards conspicuously strolling through train stations after London, and forbidding mothers with babies from carrying bottled water aboard after learning of liquid-bomb plots. Authorities just do not seem to be getting ahead in the game in anticipating new scenarios.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Short of complacency, Mas Selamat’s escape, September 11 and so on, could be a case of underestimating the enemy – a case of not giving enough regard to top criminals’ intelligence, their will, their guts, and their imagination.</span></p>
