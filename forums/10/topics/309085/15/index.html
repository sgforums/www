              <p>You'll have to wonder why one of the most dangerous minds is kept in one of the weakest detention facility in Singapore and ask who makes that decision. He is held under ISA and if that prevents him from being held in a facility with better security, who makes that decision ? Why is security in the detention centre lacking in the first place ?</p>
              <p>That said, those who oppose the ISA should be happy as technically he is innocent and yet to be found guilty in court. Those human rights preachers in speakers corner and those who abhors the ISA should be happy that he is a free man.</p>

              <p>it would be because bill gate's system was lousy to begin with. and he was the one who birthed it and made the initial designs and was only concerned with making marketable software and making a pretty profit.</p>
              <p>he may not be directly at fault, but he's indirectly responsible. just like the minister.</p>
              <p>just taking measures like regular spot checks, and having drills, would have improved the situation. agree or not, muhamed?</p>

              <p>and i don't like it either, when blame is pushed down because the upper management makes a fatal judgement call. sure it's always someone else's fault. the top management is never to blame. why? because he didn't know that his men aren't doing their job. why? because he fucking didn't do his own job to make sure they did their job!</p>

              <p>i'm saying they should take responsibility for their roles. they demanded a higher pay, they get higher responsibility. there's no such thing as you get all the bread and butter but when things screw up, you're in the clear.</p>
              <p>it works the same way in the fire safety officer line. you're in charge of making sure the building you're in charge of, stays fire-proof. you make sure that there's preventive measures, and reactive measures.</p>
              <p>if you're unlucky and there is a fire, you'll be questioned. for information during fire rescue, and how did it happen. will people only fire the security guard and leave you alone? no, you are in charge of the team. you are responsible to make sure everything goes smoothly. that's your job, that's what you're paid for. sure, you have a team to help you, and its your job to make sure they do their job to make sure the security guard does his job.</p>
              <p>you slack, and your team will slack too, and then the security guard sees it and wonders why should he be so alert when his bosses don't seem to give a hoot, and they're paid so much more too. then he slacks and someone dies in a fire. and that's what happened yesterday.</p>
              <p>the head probably slacked, then his team slacked, and everyone down the organizational flowchart slacks, and an window of opportunity appears and a JI member takes off.</p>
              <p>lesson here is: if you can't do the job properly, don't ask for such a high pay which you don't deserve.</p>
              <p>and yes. the minister still has some responsibility for this. he is not in the clear.</p>

              <p>You'll have to wonder why one of the most dangerous minds is kept in one of the weakest detention facility in Singapore and ask who makes that decision. He is held under ISA and if that prevents him from being held in a facility with better security, who makes that decision ? Why is security in the detention centre lacking in the first place ?</p>
              <p>That said, those who oppose the ISA should be happy as technically he is innocent and yet to be found guilty in court. Those human rights preachers in speakers corner and those who abhors the ISA should be happy that he is a free man.</p>

              <p><br>That's true.  I feel they compound the LAPSE with making stupid comments of no immediate danger, not armed, not important how he escaped, etc.  He had better still be in Singapore because it would be easier to find him here.  If he has escaped the country, the Singapore government had better pray hard every day till he is found. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it a lapse or was it planned?  Someone must have taken him in as presumbably he walked out without any identification and money. </p>
