              <p>pleez lah, mas selamat is a threat in this region, not USA.</p>
              <p>why would the USA place stricter restriction? i think MSK is `small fly' in their opinion. they got bigger worries/targets.</p>
              <p>not easy for MSK to get into US even if he wants to. international border control in US is quite strict. you need to be fingerprinted before you are allowed in.</p>

              <p>i said you are `implying'. when you question a perceived action on the other side, isn't it because there is a perceived implication you assume? or that you are just `babbling' for fun?</p>
              <p>the whole world is a tangled web. you worry about what impacts you directly and what's manageable. otherwise, you don't even have time to pee worrying all that you do.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Escape of militant diminished Singapore's reputation: minister</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE (AFP) - - The escape almost two months ago of an alleged
              leader of the Jemaah Islamiyah militant network was a major setback
              that diminished Singapore's reputation, a security minister said Monday.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat bin Kastari escaped on February 27 from a detention
              centre in the country, which prides itself on rigorous anti-terrorist
              measures. A massive security dragnet has failed to catch Kastari.</p>
              <p>"It
              is a blot on the security agencies' copybook, a dent in Singapore's
              reputation and a reverse in keeping Singapore secure from terrorist
              attack," the coordinating minister for national security, S. Jayakumar,
              said in a speech to open a regional meeting of security experts.</p>
              <p>Jayakumar
              said criticism of security officials was justified because "there must
              have been a serious security lapse at the detention centre."</p>
              <p>He
              said that although the Internal Security Department (ISD) suffered a
              "major setback" when Kastari fled their custody, the ISD has a long
              history of successes. It broke up the local JI network with a series of
              arrests beginning in December 2001, he said.</p>
              <p>Kastari had fled Singapore following that ISD operation, the home affairs ministry has said.</p>
              <p>Born
              in 1961 in Singapore, Kastari was arrested on the Indonesian island of
              Bintan near the city-state in 2003 and sentenced by a court there to 18
              months in jail.</p>
              <p>He was later released but arrested again by Indonesian authorities in January 2006 before being handed over to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Kastari
              was accused of plotting to hijack a plane in order to crash it into
              Singapore's Changi Airport in 2001 but was never charged. He was being
              held in the city-state under a law that allows for detention without
              trial.</p>
              <p>Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng earlier told
              parliament that Kastari escaped from the ISD facility after he asked to
              go to the toilet ahead of a visit from his relatives.</p>
              <p>The escape
              is being "thoroughly investigated" by a committee of inquiry and the
              police criminal investigation department, Jayakumar said.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">DPM Jayakumar urges S’poreans to keep perspective on Mas Selamat’s escape</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: It’s been more than six weeks since Mas Selamat escaped. But
              even as Singaporeans criticise the lapse by the country’s security
              agencies, Deputy Prime Minister S Jayakumar called on them not to
              overlook the other good work done by the agencies.</p>
              <p>Professor Jayakumar was speaking at the opening of the Second
              Asia—Pacific Programme for Senior National Security Officers (APPSNO)
              on Monday, also attended by speakers like Pulitzer—winning author
              Laurie Garrett.</p>
              <p>Some 24 years ago, the Irish Republican Army
              (IRA) launched an attack on then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. She
              survived the attack but five others were killed in the bomb blast.</p>
              <p>After
              the attack, the IRA claimed responsibility for the attacks and issued a
              warning saying they only had to be lucky once whereas security agencies
              had to be lucky all of the time.</p>
              <p>Recalling that incident,
              Professor Jayakumar who is also Co—ordinating Minister for National
              Security said that is something security agencies have to always bear
              in mind.</p>
              <p>This warning reminded Professor Jayakumar of the Mas Selamat escape.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Jayakumar said he understood Singaporeans’ reaction of shock and alarm
              because there must have been a serious security lapse at the detention
              centre for the escape to happen.</p>
              <p>He said: "Internal Security
              Department (ISD) officers who have been working on the JI case must
              feel keenly, even more so than the public, what a serious setback Mas
              Selamat’s escape has been.</p>
              <p>“It is a blot on the security agencies
              copybook, a dent in Singapore’s reputation, and a reverse in keeping
              Singapore secure from (a) terrorist attack. But the ISD officers have
              not been paralysed or demoralised."</p>
              <p>The search and investigations into the escape have been ongoing.</p>
              <p>While
              Professor Jayakumar had no conclusions yet from the inquiries taking
              place, he commended the thousands of officers involved in the efforts
              to locate the fugitive.</p>
              <p>He added that he was heartened by
              Singaporeans’ efforts in coming together for the search. And other
              conference speakers also spoke on this aspect of community involvement.</p>
              <p>Rachel
              Griggs, Head, Identity Programme, Demos, said: "This is not a
              phenomenon that can be generalised globally — different in each place,
              in each town, in each part of town. And I think what’s critical to
              imagining we have a long—term solution to the current terror threat is
              really embedding our responses, not in national and international
              responses but really working very closely on the ground."</p>
              <p>And
              with the world facing other major threats like a possible avian flu
              pandemic, the emphasis on community is just as important.</p>
              <p>Laurie
              Garrett, Senior Fellow for Global Health, Council on Foreign Relations,
              said: "There is no government on earth that will have enough money,
              enough personnel, enough organisational capacity to take care of
              everybody. It will literally come down to "Do you know your neighbours?
              Do you know who’s needy? Are you there to help them? Do you know how to
              take care of your family?” And then when the dust is settled, we will
              see what’s left of government."</p>
              <p>18 countries are participating in this conference. — CNA/vm</p>

              <p><br>After hearing from the news and what is impressed upon me,</p>
              <p>I still am left wondering</p>
              <p>is the gubbymen not in anyway whatsoever responsible for this fiasco in any manner ? not even in manner the size of an atom ? yes or no?  no 'maybe' , please.</p>
              <p>You think and I think. Maybe not saying the answer is safer? preservation ?</p>
              <p>seems like it is not the ISD that is not perfect?</p>
              <p>who is responsible for the world class standard of the isd? World class based on the market value.</p>
              <p>On behalf of my friends, I like to ask on behalf of the People, what is the measures to be implemented to ENSURE that there will never be another TERRORIST able to escape from a singapore Detention Center toilet ?</p>
              <p>I hope the people gets to hear about it from our very very responsible and world class leaders. </p>
              <p>Terrorism and National Security involves all human lives in this tiny city.  This matter must be dealth with in an unbiased and honest and serious manner, favoring no one and covering no one. Not that anyone has commited any of these sins.</p>

              <p>He never even survive the waterboarding technique practiced in the detention center.</p>

              <p>1 - Did anyone see him during or after his supposed escape? (No)</p>
              <p>2 - His supposed escape only happen when his family was due to visit him, so the officials need to give an excuse as to why he is missing (Died).</p>
              <p>3 - Why footage of his supposed escape was never released when the detention center is covered with cameras (He died, not escape)</p>
