              <p>I just read this interesting article. What if Mas Selamat is
              like Lincoln Burrows from Prison Break? He was detained for 1 yr
              and no charges given out to imprison him in Changi? What if he was
              setup?</p>
              <p>Condemn him if he is plotting to hurt innocent people!!!!!!! I

              <p>This is damn funny:</p>
              <h2><br></h2>
              <h2><a title="Oppositions to be blamed for Mas Selamat's escape" rel="nofollow" href="http://tomorrow.sg/archives/2008/03/02/oppositions_to_be_blamed_for_mas.html">Oppositions to be blamed for Mas Selamat's
              escape</a></h2>
              <p>I have an important message for those who blame our esteemed
              Minister Wong Kan Seng for this incident. I put the blame squarely
              on the members of the Opposition. Here's why:</p>
              <p>WKS as minister cannot possibly know the detention center that
              well - you expect minister to inspect every toilet there? You
              expect the minister to train every guard? He has already apologised
              and taken responsibility. However, the members of the Opposition
              are the ones I blame for this mess.</p>
              <p>A number Opposition members have been detained under the ISA and
              know this detention center inside out. They probably are familiar
              with the toilet used by Mas Selamat and the security flaws in the
              detention center - the redoctrination that purges them of harmful
              thoughts can temporarily increase the urge to escape. Knowing that
              the govt was detaining terrorist there, why didn't they point out
              the possible ways of escape to the govt? ...I don't think the
              Opposition has any valid reasons for denying responsibility for the
              escape, many have been detained there over the years and they spend
              more time there than almost anyone else.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Why blame the opposition member? He didn't escape from the detention center either, so how to claim he is familiar with the security flaws in the detention center?</p>

              New speculation in addition to the death,special training, spiritual powers, and ninja theories.
              
              Maybe Mas Selamat reformed and sang like a canary. He is rewarded by being released. But if he is released officially, and at the same time coincidentally new JI operatives are being arrested, suspicion will be arroused among the JI members. So he simply escaped. And now has a new identity. Kind of like under the Witness Protection Programme, of the FBI or CIA.

              <h1 class="clr">Man who made false reports about spotting Mas Selamat jailed</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The bus driver who made false police reports claiming he had
              spotted a man resembling escaped JI leader of Singapore Mas Selamat
              Kastari has been sentenced to 21 months in jail.</p>
              <p>The 49—year—old SMRT bus driver, Ng Hang Hai, made his first false report on 1 March shortly before 8pm.</p>
              <p>He dialled 999 on a phone from his flat at Block 124 Bedok Reservoir Road.</p>
              <p>Ng
              claimed he spotted a man resembling Mas Selamat on 27th February —— the
              same day the terrorist leader fled from the authorities.</p>
              <p>Ng said he was driving bus service number 851 near the Old Police Academy at around 8pm when the man boarded the vehicle.</p>
              <p>Ng
              told police the man had no money and requested for a free ride. Ng said
              he allowed the man to move in and he alighted along Lentor Avenue
              opposite the Seletar satellite station.</p>
              <p>Because of this, officers were deployed to search the area.</p>
              <p>Ng admitted in court that he concocted the story as he hoped to receive monetary reward should Mas Selamat be apprehended.</p>
              <p>Later that night, Ng went to Bedok police station to give another report.</p>
              <p>This
              time, he claimed, before boarding the bus, the man was riding pillion
              on a motorcycle bearing registration number SR 1657 H.</p>
              <p>Ng said the man got off the motorcycle along Thomson Road and made his way to a bus stop where he boarded Ng’s bus.</p>
              <p>Police traced down the owner of the motorcycle, a delivery man called Hong Bok Leng.</p>
              <p>Mr Hong was called in for questioning for an offence he did not commit.</p>
              <p>Ng
              wanted to get Mr Hong into trouble as he claimed the motorcyclist had
              flashed him an obscene sign as Ng was driving along Victoria Street in
              late February.</p>
              <p>Ng only admitted to his lies on 4 March when he was called in for further questioning at Ang Mo Kio police station.</p>
              <p>For these offences, the deputy public prosecutor Wendy Yap said Ng has seriously jeopardised the search for Mas Selamat.</p>
              <p>She said Ng had caused a waste of precious man hours that could have been better utilised.</p>
              <p>The judge, Hoo Sheau Pheng, said Ng’s crimes were fuelled by greed and malice.</p>
              <p>In
              passing the sentence, Judge Hoo said she wanted to send a clear message
              to others that Ng’s reprehensible and malicious conduct will not be
              tolerated.</p>
              <p>On the search for Mas Selamat, Judge Hoo urged the
              public to remain vigilant and not hesitate to come forward with genuine
              information that could aid in his capture. — 938LIVE/ac</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>Which day of the week did our abang escaped our dc?</p>
              <p>I mean, I am getting more and more puzzled and concerned why he cannot be found in a tiny little dot called a city when so much resources have been put in , like the whole country is looking for him and still cannot locate.</p>
              <p>Am i right to say that its coming to 1 MONTH already?</p>
              <p>I calm myself each night not to worry about security, that in 6 MONTHs or less, our abang will be caught, again. U can see the amount of confidence i have in our undisputed talented talents of the world.</p>

              <p>Hi, me again.</p>
              <p>If abang's method of going undetectable, aka STEALTH mode, is made known to other bad characters like other terrorists and criminals , would this method be used again the pore?</p>
              <p>will this cause damage to our security status and standing in the world ?</p>
              <p>I hope our highly regarded talented talents of the world put their brains together and make the pore save.</p>
              <p>If the pore is not the same  level of safe as before, we need to seriously ask ourselves why. Why given we have so much resources and brains, can he go undetected in a small place where there is no wilderness, no caves, no canyons, no mountains, no difficult terrains.  How can it be that he is undetected for coming to 1 MONTH and still counting as we speak ?</p>
              <p>I wish to hear our talented talent MPs give a speech as to the why.</p>

A total of 19 people were taken to hospital after breathing in an ‘unknown substance’ sprayed by the assailants. Of the 19, two women are still warded at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and are in a stable condition.

              <p>stop posting about your confidence of him being caught in 6 months or less. who are you to convey this message? unless you are a top ranking govt official making a public statement. no one cares about YOUR confidence. your 6 months can allow for many things to happen. 6 months to plan for
              retaliation and deaths a single individual to that of thousands are
              eminent.</p>
              <p>the issue is that he should not have been able to escape in the first place. YOUR govt has made a huge screw up and all actions following the day of escape, the late notification of escape, the description of him limping while walking, the late notification to locate his prison attire........ only shows their incompetence.</p>
              <p>a major cover up is underway and the citizens of this nation will nvr know the truth of what happened.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">DPM says hunt for Mas Selamat to focus on specific intelligence</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The search for alleged JI leader of Singapore Mas Selamat
              Kastari will now become more targeted — based on specific intelligence
              on where he might be hiding.</p>
              <p>Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng on Wednesday said information showed the wanted man is still in Singapore.</p>
              <p>He gave this update on the manhunt efforts after meeting some 80 Gurkha soldiers involved in the search.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat escaped from the Whitley Road Detention Centre one month ago.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Wong said the police and the Singapore Armed Forces have been
              conducting a systematic search of forested areas and unoccupied
              buildings.</p>
              <p>This general search will be completed in about a week.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong added that large ground forces deployment will be scaled down, but ground forces will remain ready to be activated.</p>
              <p>Other operations such as security inspections at land checkpoints and sea patrol surveillance will continue.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong said if necessary, Singapore will amend its laws to strengthen policing within its territorial waters.</p>
              <p>He emphasised that the manhunt will continue for as long as it takes until Mas Selamat is captured. — CNA/ac</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Singapore to scale down manhunt for terror fugitive who escaped from prison last month</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE - Singapore's security forces will scale back a nationwide
              ground search for a top Muslim terror suspect who made a stunning
              escape from a high-security prison one month ago, the deputy prime
              minister said Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Troops hunting for Mas Selamat Kastari, who allegedly once plotted
              to hijack an airplane and crash it into the city-state's international
              airport, will start "targeted and focused searches based on specific
              intelligence and leads," said Wong Kan Seng.</p>
              <p>He gave no reason
              for the change in tactics. But efforts to track down Mas Selamat have
              no doubt been costly. Police, special operations officers, elite Gurkha
              guards and soldiers have been combing the island nation's forests since
              his embarrassing Feb. 27 jail break. Security also has been tightened
              at land, air and sea checkpoints.</p>
              <p>Wong said that while the
              deployment of large ground forces would be scaled down, "they remain
              operationally ready for immediate deployment when needed," according to
              a statement posted on the Home Affairs Ministry's Web site.</p>
              <p>Security
              breaches are rare in tightly controlled Singapore, an island nation of
              4.5 million people that is a 45-minute boat ride from Indonesia where
              Mas Selamat is alleged to have links with the Jemaah Islamiyah terror
              network, blamed for a series of attacks that have killed more than 250
              people since 2002.</p>
              <p>Wong said authorities believed Mas Selamat was
              still in the city-state and have set up coastal observation points to
              make sure he does not flee.</p>
              <p>The nation's leaders have described Mas Selamat's jailbreak as a setback to the reputation of the usually well-policed country.</p>
              <p>Mas
              Selamat had been held in Singapore custody since February 2006 under
              the Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite detention without
              trial.</p>

              <p>technically speaking,</p>
              <p>could there be any part of the shoreline or part along the perimeter of the pore where it is possible to escape without any guard knowing on THAT day when security was not at the same high level as now?</p>
              <p>Would anyone think that every inch of the small city is guarded already before he escaped?</p>
              <p>If not, then technically speaking, it seems plausible that a plan could had been made to pick him up at that spot using something as simple as a water scooter or small boat or even a paddle small fishing boat. From there, this boat meets a speedboat and abang then hops on and sleep there till they speed their way to indonesia or malaysia or hey, the easiest and safest is to no-man's land - no check point! so many islands lying around without a name! and then from there into the open waters and from thereon its Has talasvista Baby! </p>
