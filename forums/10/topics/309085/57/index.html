              <p>With this Government giving scant regard to local sensitivities and little respect to anyone's rights when it comes to political security - they could very easily comb through the homes of every 'Malay' homes in the HDB heartlands {as the most likely home that will harbor MSK will be from his own ethnic group}.</p>
              <p>The Government HDB policy has only allowed a limited number of this ethnic group to reside per HDB block - when even in a resale situation, the same unit can only be sold to another Malay or minority ethnic group.</p>
              <p>However, this action will risk antagonising the entire Singaporean Malays, who are already embarrassed by the spotlight from the actions of these religious extremists in their midst, and the Government do not need this ethnic group to add to the troubles already filling up their plate.</p>

              <p>1. Is the great Toilet Escape of the Century blamed on the Guards  or the PEOPLE?  Not any leading men is it? In whatever ways? In all ways?</p>
              <p>2. poreans are said to be Complacent when they believe the gubbymen will take care of all security.</p>
              <p>But is this a normal security issue or the mudder of all security issue at the highest level of concern? Who is responsible for such Security? Uncle lee who kbkb in kopi shop or our leading men?</p>
              <p>So what is the Solution to rid complacency? Have another set of leading men to ensure no complacency?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Is it wrong for people to Expect reasonable security for World Record Market Value?  Is anything in life free? Free income ? How wrong is it to demand high  expection? The expectation for such a high security issue should be very high. If its for petty theft or farting in public issues, expectation would then not be so high.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Since its reported that our dear Abang had escaped before , and he is Terrorist, did the responsible leading man have ensured that extra security attention was put on this escaped-before TERRORIST?  If Operationally, this aspect was taken cared of properly, would the limper have walked out of the DC? Did the leading responsible man personally put emphasis and keep close attention to the securing of our dear abang given the highest level of security threat he can possess? Was it left to the hands of a Guard for National Security of the highest of all mudder of orders?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5.  The Pore takes pride in giving impression that it is very safe and well controlled place.  Why is it left to a Guard to ensure this level of impression is well maintained? Would it be unwise? Who is responsible? Oh I see, a guard. National Security. of the highest of all mudders of all levels. Oh, I c.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6.  Now that a guard is found to be complacent, lets focus on the re-capture operation planned, managed by our leading men. lets look this as a separate issue. So far, its been 5 weeks and counting.  Is the Pore too big to locate a limper?  Next time, is someone needs to be captured for other crimes, any crime, how long would our leading men and women take , require, need, for a capture?  What if there are 10 such criminals on the loose? Would it take 10 times the amount of time or effort or resources? This aspect, would it be a complacent guard to be responsible?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ginahs and Chabohs and Unkers, there you have it, your leading man have said it. The Guard was Complacent.  Your future is in safe hands. doon worry. doon compracent. you have leading men of world's highest market value to ensure smooth and proper running even for national security issues. Well done.</p>
              <p>So, overall, seems to you, who is to be blamed based on the articulation by SUE-ANN Chia and GOH CHIN LIAN of the most unbiased and world class and believable news media of the century? The reporters as unbiased as the Press.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have not stopped my 'escape' plan, if u knoe wtf i mean. (pun intended).</p>

              <p>First upon the breaking of news about Mas Selamat's toilet break escape
              from terrorist prison MM Lee was quick to tell the international
              audience that the fault lies in complacency of the government to lessen
              the impact of such low-class prison security on his Arab investors.<br> <br> Now he says the fault lies in the negligence of the prison guard. One
              wonders why in this case we still needs a captain or manager and pay
              him millions to become world class? He is obviously sending a loud
              message to his civil servant inquiry panel to stay complacent - as
              complacent as they can get.</p>

Anyone not obedient or breaking any rule will have their brace exploded resulting in blood gushing out from their throat . Perhaps singapore should use that idea on highly dangerouse pple like mas selamat . So that they don't have to be so troublesome n can also save their own face by just detonating it to let him die then to have to explain to public and throwing their own face cos untill now they still can't find him despite giving so many excuses .

              <p><span class="postbody">What is the purpose of MM Lee making the announcement through the media that the guard is negligent.</span></p>
              <p>The answer is very simple.</p>
              <p><span class="postbody">If he rings up someone in the Inquiry Panel directly or through his secretary it can be traced back to him that that could amount to wrong doing like abuse of power and politically dangerous.</span></p>
              <p>He is not that stupid as <span class="postbody">he could be exposed by whistle blower one day.
              <br> <br> So the safest is to do it is to use the media way which he has always seemed to
              be able to use in the past with similar announcements even before inquiries carried out their jobs.</span></p>
              <p>His methodology appears to be to use the media <span class="postbody">to send subtle messages for someone higher than panel to pick up. </span></p>
              <p><span class="postbody">That higher someone may be a senior civil servant who will catch the message and will be too afraid to
              ignore it because he is under the thumb of such power in terms of keeping his job or
              promotion or bonuses so he will have to one-way-or-another work subtly
              within to get the panel to take the cue and decide the guard is to be
              the fall guy.
              <br> <br> Authoritarian rule is dangerous for a country because of such insider working to serve the power that be's own interest.
              <br> <br>If we follow the full fledged democracy in the original Westminster
              model parliamentary MPs would be all ready to question and take up from
              there but in our case MPs dare not interfere and will leave alone such
              hidden power control from behind. That is why we have NKF problems
              persisted for so many years until the change of dynasty to allow a
              once-in-a-blue-moon chance to open up the wrong doings for internal
              power ascendancy purpose.</span></p>
