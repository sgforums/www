              <p>4sgie,</p>
              <p>Cool now lah, i haven't tell you about the second part, why you make an issue out of me. On further investigation at Universal studio, I manage to talk to some of those U grad there, in fact they are saying, because Universal Studio needs apprentices to start up and they prefer U grad who will be future managers or stage organiser once the current experience American's managers and supervisors had finished their contract of service here, Universal studio is expected to run fully by Singaporeans. And because singapore wants to protray a good english speaking society,they get the U grads, not china prc or indian...it will mess up the languages, just like you go jap or hk disneyland, mickey can speak jap or cantonese to you...some more can scold you (they thot tourist mostly dunno jap and cantonese). And even when they speak english in mickey suit, the western also cannot understand them.</p>
              <p>These group of graduates are fresh graduate from communication and art..they are cheerful and most importantly, Singaporeans.</p>

              <p><br>Basically, we dun wan our undergraduates to think that when they are graduated, they can have ten of thousands to earn per month, condos and bungalow to stay in, luxury cars to sit on and a handsome rich hunk or beau to go along. You got to be realistic, you must the base up wage system, then you truly understand the ground and able to manage it better. Organisation in Jap and USA put/attach their grads on the ground to gain experience. Many organisation in Singapore do the reverse, straight away gives the graduate a manager post leading to him/her thinking big and forget about thinking for the lower people and therefore managed without a ethical mindset on human. They can be good in strategy, but without understanding of the human factor, they can fail miserably.</p>
              <p>There is no much different in grad pay and a mid level work pay, the only different is that a grad will move up faster and quickly in term of both pay structure and corporate ladder. UNDERSTAND!!</p>

              proposed changes to the Constitution and two other related bills which
              will pave the way for the next General Election.
              <br> <br> The other two bills are the Parliamentary Elections and Presidential Elections Bills.
              <br> <br>The changes proposed include increasing the number of
              Non-Constituency MPs that Parliament can legislate from six to nine,
              and making the Nominated MP system a permanent one.
              <br> <br> They will also allow for a one-day cooling off period before Polling Day.
              <br> <br> Besides the second reading of the amendment bills, six new government bills will be tabled.
              <br> <br> They include a Land Titles (Strata) Amendment Bill and the Criminal Procedure Code Bill.
              <br> <br> For question time, MPs have filed questions on housing, foreign affairs and transport. 
              <br> <br>They want to know if flats will remain affordable for first-time
              homebuyers, and whether charges will be brought against former Romanian
              diplomat Silviu Ionescu. - CNA/ms</span></p>

              <p><br>it is part of the Consitutional Rules and Regulation to have debate, but frankly, for Singapore, you are right, everything is actually pre planned, confirmed and chopped.</p>
              <p>PAP MPs also a data base to answer questions from the public and oppositions, they are indeed very well prepared. Things can be done over a golf or dinner with prc gals.</p>

              <p>LHL: Are u mad, then how to collect tax and get their CPF monies? Let move on to the next hole.</p>
              <p>Mah: Just like i thought, let them go and grumble, as long as money flow in, careless if they hv to struggle with foreigners or PRs. Ok, let increase prices.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 2.5in 10pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The budget debates, especially during the Committee of Supply stage, <span> </span>is not about money! MPs do not seem interested in how the<span> </span> govt spend the money.<span> </span> Of course, PAP MPs have trust in the govt in spending its money. But it is still their responsibility to approve it and so they should be interested.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 2.5in 10pt 0in;"><span style="color: #339966; font-family: Calibri;">During the debates, instead of commenting on how the money is spent, they discuss mostly about policies. <span> </span>Usually, an MP raised a motion to cut the budget by $10, then he discussed about policy matter.<span> </span> The minister also took the opportunity to announce new policies.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 2.5in 10pt 0in;"><span style="color: #339966; font-family: Calibri;">I believe they misuse the procedure to discuss other matters.<span> </span> <span> </span>This is how the 80+ elites do thing improperly. I’ve commented this in another forum but they still do the same way.<span> </span> They don’t think they were wrong or they don’t know how to change.</span></p>
