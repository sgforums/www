            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore walks away from P&amp;O<br><br>By Alistair Osborne, Business Editor (Filed: 11/02/2006)<br><br>The Port of Singapore Authority is expected to turn its attentions to US terminals operator Stevedoring Services of America after yesterday pulling out of the Â£3.92 billion bid battle for Britain's P&amp;O.<br><br>The withdrawal of the PSA, which is owned by the Singaporean government's investment arm Temasek, left the way clear for Dubai's DP World to land P&amp;O with its 520p-a-share bid. P&amp;O shares fell 20Â¾ to 516Â¾p.<br><br>The PSA pulled out arguing that its 470p-a-share offer on January 26 - trumped within hours by DP World - "represented a full and fair value".<br><br>It declined to comment on rumours that the PSA's ambitious boss Eddie Teh was blocked from making a higher bid by Temasek chief Ho Ching, the wife of Singapore's prime minister Lee Hsien Loong. Mr Lee said last week that there was "a right price" for any deal.<br><br>Mr Teh is now expected to take a serious look at Stevedoring Services, which has container terminals along the US West Coast and is one of the last remaining big players in the industry. Analysts value it at around Â£1.5 billion. The PSA twice looked at Stevedoring Services before Mr Teh took over.<br><br>The PSA's withdrawal, which came on the eve of Monday's shareholder meeting to vote on the DP World bid, was cushioned by its 4.1pc stake in P&amp;O.<br><br>It acquired about half of this last May when it first considered a tilt at P&amp;O and stands to make Â£45m-Â£50m profit.<br><br>Three hedge funds which had been buying shares above DP World's 520p offer saw their profits trimmed. Even so, Eton Park has made about Â£15m, while Tisbury Capital is thought to have made at least Â£3.5m, with Sandell Asset Management making more than Â£2.5m.<br><br>Sultan Ahmen Bin Sulayem, the DP World chairman, said: "We're pleased with this development and remain encouraged by the board's unanimous recommendation to its shareholders of our offer."<br><br><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/02/11/cnpno11.xml&amp;menuId=242&amp;sSheet=/portal/2006/02/11/ixportal.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/02/11/cnpno11.xml&amp;menuId=242&amp;sSheet=/portal/2006/02/11/ixportal.html</a></div>

However, it must be noted that a successful business deal outweighs the cost. What if PSA had gotten P&amp;O at the 470 pence price? And besides, PSA stands to gain from their 4% stake in P&amp;O.

It seem that no matter whether goverment owned companies buy over any companies in oversea you are not happy and if they pull out of a bid for an oversea company you are also unhappy? So what you really want them to do?<br><br>Also we need to understand that buying over a company will always result in paying a much higher value that the company is worth and be it a successful or unsuccessful bid there will be bound to have cost involve and this also happen when a private company trying to buy over another company.</div>
