P&amp;O shares fell 20Â¾ to 516Â¾p.<br><br>The PSA pulled out arguing that its 470p-a-share offer on January 26 - trumped within hours by DP World - "represented a full and fair value".<br><br>It declined to comment on rumours that the PSA's ambitious boss Eddie Teh was blocked from making a higher bid by Temasek chief Ho Ching, the wife of Singapore's prime minister Lee Hsien Loong. Mr Lee said last week that there was "a right price" for any deal.<br><br>Mr Teh is now expected to take a serious look at Stevedoring Services, which has container terminals along the US West Coast and is one of the last remaining big players in the industry. Analysts value it at around Â£1.5 billion. The PSA twice looked at Stevedoring Services before Mr Teh took over.<br><br>The PSA's withdrawal, which came on the eve of Monday's shareholder meeting to vote on the DP World bid, was cushioned by its 4.1pc stake in P&amp;O.<br><br>It acquired about half of this last May when it first considered a tilt at P&amp;O and stands to make Â£45m-Â£50m profit.<br><br>Three hedge funds which had been buying shares above DP World's 520p offer saw their profits trimmed. Even so, Eton Park has made about Â£15m, while Tisbury Capital is thought to have made at least Â£3.5m, with Sandell Asset Management making more than Â£2.5m.<br><br>Sultan Ahmen Bin Sulayem, the DP World chairman, said: "We're pleased with this development and remain encouraged by the board's unanimous recommendation to its shareholders of our offer."<br><br><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/02/11/cnpno11.xml&amp;menuId=242&amp;sSheet=/portal/2006/02/11/ixportal.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/02/11/cnpno11.xml&amp;menuId=242&amp;sSheet=/portal/2006/02/11/ixportal.html</a></div></blockquote>Good that PSA withdrewed.

Temasek/PSA took a couple of weeks of due dillegence thus the time spent on the work undertaken by the investment bankers in london will be billed to temasek. chances are it would be a couple of millions Â£ judging from the size of the acquisition. nothing comes free in life my dear friend.</div>
