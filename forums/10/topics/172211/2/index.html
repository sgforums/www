I thought should be at home counting money until hand cramps... Anyway, I think it's not good to be arrogant like this prick who boast about wanting to be a millionaire, it's fine to have dreams but I hate people who are arrogant. More often than not, when I see such people, I will not help them succeed. I believe I belong to the average Joe category, and most people do, so if the majority of people don't like you, you just missed out on a heck lot of opportunities in life. For example if there are some good opportunities to make money, I will not give it to them. If this arrogant chap is in trouble, I won't give a damn. And you know, in this society, you need good friends around. Otherwise, when you're in trouble, you will be, oh so lonely. For example I argued with my dad 3 months back and moved out immediately that night, lol, less than an hour of the argument, without my friends I would have to stay at hotel every night, or budget budget sleep in the streets, lol. I don't even have any belongings, just took my laptop and go out, luckily I always have some spare cash and good friends to count on.</div>

Seriously, I beg to differ because I do have alot of wealthy friends and they ARE multi millionaires by the age of 23. I also know older people in their sixties who are also multi millionaires. Overall, I must surprise you to say, based on the experience I have had, the rich people sometimes are much nicer and friendier than you expect. In contrast, this friend of yours, is being really arrogant and I can't see that much of such trait in the wealthy people. I won't say he shouldn't have such a dream, but the average joes like me sure won't like to have such a friend really. And one last thing I would like to say... Being the best students in SMU doesn't mean you'll be best at making money in real life. Oh yeah, in fact, have you heard of this saying that goes something like... It's more important who you know, than what you know. Hope that helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While I do agree with you on some of the things you said, but I don't believe arrogance and success comes together. I don't think it's particularly fair to associate people who is successful and brand them as arrogant. I mean, you don't even know them, so how can you possibly judge my friends without sufficient knowledge or facts. I'm not implying that all rich people are nice, no way, I have met a few who ain't nice but because of a few black sheeps, people may associate wealth/success with arrogance. It's just like associating Africans with AIDS just because they have among the world's highest AIDS ratio, it's totally unfair to that african if you see one and condemn him/her with AIDS.<br><br>Furthermore, I believe even the average Joe can be really mean when you become their opponent, so the statement's slightly unfair once again to target only the wealthy people.<br><br>Besides that, it's always good to have dreams. Being laughed at is not a big issue unless you take things personally. Throughout my life, I have been a clown too, everyone have their moments of being laughed at until they achieve something. So don't sweat the small stuff.
