              <p><strong>The Star Online, 23 May 2009. Seah Chiang Nee<br> </strong><br> <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Irked by ping-pong controversy</span></strong><br> <br> <strong><em>As recession spreads hardship, more MPs are on the receiving end of public wrath.</em></strong><br> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">SINGAPOREANS who want to see a quicker reduction
              of government influence in society now have another reason to do so in
              the wake of the ping-pong controversy.</span></strong><br> <br> It was sparked off by the way the Table Tennis Association (STTA) had
              acted over a dispute that led to the loss of its talented Chinese
              trainer.<br> <br> One of the most successful sports trainers here, Liu Guodong, had
              helped Singapore to win its first Olympic medal in 48 years. He had
              shaped the women’s paddlers to rank among the world’s best, as well as
              win the silver medal in last year’s Beijing Olympics, losing to China
              in the final.<br> <br> Instead of receiving state accolade, Liu left for Beijing in a huff on
              Sunday after his second run-in with Lee Bee Wah, the STTA President,
              who is also MP in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s group constituency.<br> <br> To Singaporeans, that connection spells political backing. Liu’s exit
              followed an accusation from the free-talking politician that the
              Chinese coach lacked “professionalism and integrity”, without giving
              any clarification.<br> <br> Her organisation had earlier refused to nominate the popular Liu for
              the National Coach of the Year award as widely expected and supported
              by the National Sports Council.<br> <br> This infuriated the Chinese trainer, the brother of China’s national
              table tennis coach. Liu felt humiliated, saying that it had impugned
              his integrity.<br> <br> He asked her to justify the charge or apologise, failing which he may return to seek legal recourse to clear his name.<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">The way that Lee, a Malaysian-born politician, had
              handled — or mishandled — a talented table tennis coach caused
              resentment among Singaporeans and some mainland Chinese netizens.</span></strong><br> <br> It has led to Singapore being accused — rather unfairly — of
              ungratefulness, implying that his importance was downgraded after the
              Olympics feat.<strong><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Some Singaporeans questioned the need to have a government person
              manage a sports body — as well as numerous others — instead of people
              with long relevant experience.</span></span></strong><br> <br> Lee is the latest of a number of MPs who have been on the receiving end of public wrath.<br> <br> As the recession spreads hardship, the number of people who seek help
              from their MPs has sharply increased, some of them desperately.<br> <br> Threats against MPs have been on the rise. In a recent case a woman MP was threatened by a rag-and-bone man.<br> <br> Then an angry youth slammed a chair on a glass door when he felt another MP had talked down to his mother.<br> <br> The worst case happened in January when MP Seng Han Tong was set on
              fire by an attacker, sending him to hospital with severe burns. He has
              just resumed duty.<br> <br> Although this violence has raised public concern, one blogger said, “I
              am not sure whether the constituents are solely to be blamed.”<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Many of the MPs hail from rich
              homes with little understanding of how the deprived class suffers, he
              added. “Until they join politics, some have never stepped into a public
              flat in their lives.”</span></span></strong><br> <br> <strong><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The ping-pong flap has
              highlighted a growing unhappiness with the ruling party’s extensive
              role — and influence — in matters that have nothing to do with
              government.</span></span></strong><br> <br> <strong><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“The government should just
              stick to running the country and keep its nose away from private
              business, running the media or sports,”</span></span></strong> said a returning graduate from Australia.<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“Why is a PAP MP managing the game of ping-pong when there are more experienced people around?”</span></span></strong> he asked.<br> <br> Scholars: how effective?<br> <br> One of the pillars of this generally well-run city is its scholar system.<br> <br> Over the decades, thousands of the brightest students have been given
              university scholarships and slotted back into society to run the
              country. This was expanded to include bright foreigners.<br> <br> This was believed to have been adopted by Lee Kuan Yew from 1,300 years
              of Chinese Imperial exams, from which the emperors picked out the best
              to help them run China.<br> <br> For Singapore, this had largely worked well in producing efficient
              civil servants and managers at a time when the world was a lot less
              complex.<br> <br> Going forward, however, they face two problems.<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">The first is that while they are good at implementing policies, few actually shine at anticipating problems and creativity.</span></strong><br> <br> <strong><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Visionary abilities often come from ordinary people, even drop-outs — not just scholars.<br> </span></span></strong><br> <strong><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secondly, too many “scholar” politicians lack the human touch or a social skill to connect with the masses.</span></span></strong> Today, Singaporeans want to see leaders and MPs who can relate with them.<br> <br> Online writer, Robert Teh said <strong><span style="color: red;">the Singapore
              system that is based on assembling of a few scholars to come up with
              ideas, schemes and policies for the whole country would no longer work.</span></strong><br> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">The conceptual assumptions about leadership and
              talents have failed to work for modern Singapore since 1970s and should
              be revised,</span></strong> he said, noting that <strong><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“A leader is chosen because, among other reasons, he or she has shared certain common objectives with the people.”<br> </span></span></strong><br> <strong><span style="color: red;">When Singapore does well, the scholars were given
              the bulk of the credits, but when things go so badly as now, the big
              blame, too, goes to them.<br> </span></strong><br> <br> -----------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Latest updates at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.

              <p><strong>Translated from Lianhe Wanbao</strong></p>
              <p>Liu Guodong said he hasn’t decided if he will take legal action against STTA now that there is a middleman mediating the matter between them.</p>
              <p>Upon arrival in Beijing, he told the Chinese reporters that he will surely bring the matter to the court the next time he visits Singapore. However, he sounds more conciliatory now.</p>
              <p>“During the last two days, there were some changes to the situation which I am unable to elaborate more,” Liu said, without revealing the identity of the mediator. He is currently focusing on a national tournament in China and will deliberate on sending the lawyer’s letter at the end of the month.</p>
              <p><strong>STTA President Lee Bee Wah told reporters this morning that she will not comment further on the matter.</strong></p>
              <p>Liu Guodong said that many Chinese lawyers are willing to fight the case for him as the chances of winning is very high. He told the Chinese media that he is not afraid of the lawsuit as he has done nothing wrong.</p>
              <p><strong>EDITORS’ NOTE:</strong></p>
              <p>Who did STTA send as a mediator to resolve the issue with Liu Guodong? Obviously Lee Bee Wah is not prepared to retract her statements and issue a public apology which would have solved the problem immediately.</p>
              <p>According to unconfirmed sources, Lee Bee Wah has consulted a lawyer and the draft document which she asked her subordinates to pass to Liu to sign was drafted by her lawyer. That’s why she has now refrained from commenting further on the matter.</p>
              <p>Will Liu be offered attractive “terms” to dissuade him from suing Lee Bee Wah? Surely that is the result which both Lee Bee Wah and PAP do not want to see.</p>
              <p>Dragging the matter to the court will open a can of worms and cause irreversible damage to Lee Bee Wah’s reputation thereby sounding the death knell to her fledging political career.</p>
              <p>The ideal solution will be to gag Liu Guodong’s mouth while saving the “face” of Lee Bee Wah at the same time.</p>
              <p>Regardless of whether Liu decides to sue Lee Bee Wah in the end, we will persist in our efforts to force Lee Bee Wah to resign as STTA President. Enough is enough! It is time she learnt her lesson!</p>
