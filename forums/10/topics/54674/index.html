In such a complex and mature system, such Â‘politicsÂ’ as practiced, is a system of fine balance where the majority does not oppress the liberties of the minorities.<br><br>Freedom of individual actions allowing for creativity is largely tolerated within the Â‘politicsÂ’ accepted by the community.<br><br>The majority does not force their principles onto the minority.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Politics</span> is not exclusive to anyone individual or group.<br><br>If one person has a hold on <span style="font-style: italic;">politics</span>, it will be tyranny; and when practiced for the benefit of a single group, it will be an oligarchy.

As the country has suffered from low growth and two economic recessions since the Asian financial crisis, Singaporeans are getting used to the idea that they will not enjoy another decade of 9% growth like the one leading up to 1997. The question for the future is to what extent the city state needs to change the institutions which served it well during the high-growth era, in order to find the new productivity gains which will further improve its standard of living.<br>For nearly 40 years, the government micromanaged the city state and turned it into one of the economic dynamos of Asia. And ample credit is due: Singapore is an oasis of stability and prosperity in Southeast Asia. But today, government intervention in every facet of society is exacerbating an economic malaise that has both global and domestic causes. State-directed capitalism is losing its luster, and Singaporeans are recognizing the need for risk-taking and entrepreneurship. Moreover, the government has always claimed that a high degree of control over the media and public debate is necessary to maintain law and order. But four decades on, excessive state controls have created a climate of fear and stymied the kind of policy debate and creative thinking essential for competing in a global economy.<br><br>Singaporeans are well aware of this. The Economic Review Committee, established in 2001 and chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, raised high hopes when it promised to "leave no stone unturned" in formulating a new economic blueprint last year. There was disappointment later, however, when Mr. Lee admitted that while he had examined every stone carefully, he had then put many of them right back in their original places.<br><br>Nevertheless, the ERC did do valuable work by examining bolder reforms which might be taken up again in the future. These include loosening restrictions on the capital sequestered in the Central Provident Fund. Singaporeans currently are forced by the government to contribute around 36% of their salaries to a state-run retirement fund which earns paltry returns. Although the government does offer Singaporeans occasional opportunities to dip into these funds, for the most part the money sits around in savings accounts. This is unfortunate, as many new businesses could be started with this stock of seed capital.<br><br>Ultimately, in the case of CPF, the system was deemed to be "not broken," and thus not worthy of major overhaul. Advocates of tight CPF policy claim that Singaporeans can't be trusted to make the right financial decisions. In today's competitive economy, however, Singaporeans can not afford to be treated like children. Another stone that was carefully "put back" was the ERC's policy on government-linked company divestment. Through its investment arm, Temasek Holdings, the government holds major stakes in almost every business sector. Heavy state ownership in the economy discourages entrepreneurship and stifles the private sector, as private businessmen feel little incentive.<br><br>Yet the problems are more than economic, and even the leaders admit that Singapore needs a new way of thinking. The government-backed "Remaking Singapore" committee was set up for this reason. The committee claims to complement the ERC's work of reviewing strategies for a new Singapore. The committee's report explains: "Singaporeans must develop the values, attitudes, skills, innovativeness and entrepreneurship necessary for an increasingly competitive and complex world. . . . If we fail, we risk losing our economic relevance, and our livelihood."<br><br>Some critics say that Remaking Singapore is little more than an updated version of the Singapore 21 consultative process of the 1990s. Remaking Singapore does offer hope of culling sacred cows, and some progress has been made. Nevertheless, a recent Straits Times article lists the sacred cows that have returned to graze by the stones that were carefully replaced by the ERC. The real meat of the proposals -- such as changes to defamation laws, increases in freedom of information, liberalization in mass-media ownership and an increased role for media in political discourse -- have yet to materialize.<br><br>Many Singaporeans would agree that globalization, technological revolution and an atmosphere of fierce competition means that Singapore needs a spirit of innovation. But it can't do that in a climate of fear. Singapore's atmosphere needs to change in order to introduce real political freedom. For example, the media isn't supposed to participate in politics, but the "out of bounds" markers are unclear, which leads to a veiled legal threat that discourages the media from rocking the boat.<br><br>And the public can hardly blame the press for being timid, because even if journalists threw caution to the wind, they would have a pretty hard time finding Singaporeans who are willing to be quoted. In a recent survey published in the Straits Times, only 15% of young Singaporeans surveyed had no qualms about publicly expressing views that differed from the government. Apathy was cited at the main reason, along with fear, although the article stated that "what they feared was not clear."<br><br>This ill-defined fear discourages healthy policy and political debate. Singapore's capacity for growth is diminishing, so the government can no longer promote development from the top down and point to this performance for its legitimacy. Nor can the ruling People's Action Party simply tell Singaporeans to "be creative," and expect such a change to happen while society otherwise stays the same. Rather, one prerequisite for creativity is an atmosphere where people aren't afraid to express themselves.<br><br>The PAP prides itself on being a democratically elected government, but it hasn't allowed for the growth of a viable opposition. It's true that a majority of Singaporeans support the PAP and would continue to vote to keep it in power. Many Singaporeans feel deeply indebted to their government for the high quality of life that they continue to enjoy. But now may be time for the government to reciprocate that trust. Reform doesn't need to be a zero-sum game: Few would like to see a breakdown in the orderly society that Singapore has worked so hard to achieve. But Singaporeans are undoubtedly capable of deciding important issues for themselves under a government that is more accountable to its citizens.<br><br>The ERC and Remaking Singapore show that there are some truly progressive ideas out there -- but what's missing is the impetus to bring them to life. There is a bit of a "if it ain't broke, don't fix it," attitude -- so the system keeps plodding along. Thirty-eight years after independence, many in Singapore seem to understand that change is necessary and inevitable. But they may have to wait a bit longer for a new generation of leaders to take the stage.</div>

Since the initial rethink started in 1996, the Singapore authorities have accelerated deregulation in the financial and telecommunications sectors. The deregulation was bold -- breaking long-held policy taboos for instance regarding the role of Singapore-owned banks -- and succeeded in dramatically altering the landscape in the banking sector.<br>However, when the comprehensive study of the economy by the government's Economic Review Committee was announced earlier this year, many Singaporeans expressed disappointment that the government had not extended this radical transformation to other sectors. A major reason for this disappointment was the feeling that the critical changes necessary for Singapore to adjust to a tougher economic environment had not been made. The Singapore economy has been subject to a number of shocks in recent years which have depressed the dynamism of its economy -- the regional hinterland that its financial and trading hubs service has lost vigor after the Asian crisis; and the global economy has become much more competitive. A number of issues stand out in particular:<br><br>Â• The high-cost structure in Singapore hurts returns to investors and produces a weak domestic private sector. Data from the US Department of Commerce on returns to US.companies shows that, compared to the Asian average, Singapore no longer provides the superior rate of return that it once did. Once a premium economy charging premium prices, it is now a less-than-premium economy -- but is still charging premium prices.<br><br>To address this problem, the government is now working hard to create a more flexible wage structure. However, such wage-centered strategies may not suffice. The key is to address costs which have deviated from market levels because of some distortion. Since wages as a percentage of gross domestic product is actually quite low in Singapore compared to most economies, high wages are probably not the most critical reason for a high-cost structure.<br><br>The more likely areas for distortions will be in land prices (and its effects on wages and rentals), high transportation costs resulting from the government's forceful anticongestion policies (which drive up the cost of distribution and logistics) and high regulatory costs. But without adequate measures to bring costs down, the economy will restructure with companies laying workers off, cutting wages, squeezing subcontractors' margins, forcing landlords to cut rentals, etc. This will produce deflationary headwinds in the Singapore economy.<br><br>This challenging domestic-cost environment probably accounts for the relatively weak private-sector companies in Singapore. The government has acknowledged that entrepreneurial vigor is lacking in Singapore. Returns on capital to locally-owned businesses tend to be lower than returns in foreign-owned corporations. Singapore has produced few privately-owned global success stories compared to the other city-state economy, Hong Kong -- where the government's role in the economy is much more muted.<br><br>Â• The all-pervasive role of the government in economic decision making potentially reduces the flexibility of adjustment to such external challenges. The prices of major inputs -- land, labor and capital -- in Singapore are substantially influenced by government. The government owns most of the land, effectively becoming the monopoly supplier. The incremental supply of labor is controlled by the government through its controls on foreign-worker inflows. And Singapore's financial capital is also heavily influenced by government. The government owns a substantial proportion of domestically-owned corporations, and a huge chunk of national savings flows through government channels rather than market channels. This means that key prices in the economy -- wages, interest rates and rents -- are inordinately influenced by government rather than market forces. Since prices play a major role in signalling and incentivizing businesses on where to allocate capital, it is critically important that such prices not be distorted by government.<br><br>One issue of particular concern is how this economic structure leads to correlated errors. In a normal economy, errors by some businesses or individuals tend to cancel out, but in an economy where one player -- the government -- dominates, the risk of errors reinforcing each other increases. The overallocation of the nation's capital to real estate is one example of how such behavior has been evident in Singapore.<br><br>Â• Singapore has a savings regime which produces the highest savings rate in the world, but does not appear to benefit from this much. Singapore savings rates have averaged more than 50% of GDP in recent years. Only part of this can be accounted for by the Central Provident Fund, Singapore's forced-savings scheme. Actually, much of it is due to massive government surpluses that have only recently started to recede. The result is that a large percentage of savings is channelled through the government budget mechanism or through the CPF rather than through financial markets.<br><br>High savings in Singapore did not, therefore, nourish the growth of its stock market or bond market -- nor did it generate the growth of dynamic and competitive broking, investment-banking and fund-management industries. Thus, the country with the highest savings rate in the world does not have a domestic-savings industry to match. There is also another anomaly. Despite having the highest savings rate in the world, separate studies by economists at two universities in Singapore suggest that a good number of Singaporeans will retire with less-than-adequate cash flows to sustain a high standard of living. This is a result of poor returns to Singaporean savers.<br><br>This brief analysis shows why it is so difficult for even the boldest reformers to reinvent the Singapore economy. The problems are not as straightforward as overvalued exchange rates or a banking sector burdened with bad assets. The problems in Singapore are deeply embedded in the economic structure. Removing one distortion could have significant adverse effects for some groups, or even pose systemic risks for the entire economy. For instance, if land costs are allowed to fall to levels which allow Singapore's cost structure to adequately improve, property owners, including virtually all households in Singapore, could see a major decline in wealth.<br><br>So, what should we expect in the future? A global cyclical recovery could well take some of the pressure off Singapore for a year or so, but the structural headwinds remain strong. In fact, some of the challenges facing Singapore are growing -- neighboring Malaysia is now aggressively expanding its services sector and in some cases competing directly with Singapore -- with a substantially lower cost base.<br><br>The good news is that these competitive challenges will encourage further policy reforms. Businesses with interests in Singapore can expect the following: (a) more cuts in income taxes; (b) a more cautious exchange-rate policy, meaning that the Singapore dollar is unlikely to see the secular trade-weighted appreciation it saw in the past three decades; (c) intensifying efforts to pare down costs in Singapore through deregulation and cuts in government-related charges; (d) a substantial change in the role of key government institutions such as the Housing and Development Board, to reduce government intervention in the housing market; and (e) further liberalization of the savings regime in Singapore.<br><br>Economic restructuring in Singapore is thus a work-in-progress. If further policy changes are made, there is no reason why the Singapore economy could not leverage off its substantial advantages -- for instance critical mass as a regional center and competitive advantage in high-value manufacturing -- and resume its role as an economic dynamo in Asia.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Mr Bhaskaran is partner and head of economic research for the Centennial Group</strong></span><br><br></div>
