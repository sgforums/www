            <div class='col-md body'>Liked your attention here.<br><br>ONE by one, it became clear yesterday that the junior college students at the annual Pre-University Seminar did not care to speak to the press.<br><br>'No comment', said seven of them in rapid succession when asked what they thought of Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's dialogue with them.<br><br>Slowly it emerged that they dared not speak because of a rule printed in the programme kit distributed to all of the 510 participants at the annual seminar, held jointly by the Education Ministry and Victoria Junior College this year.<br><br>While some students scuttled off, a few others opened their files and pointed to a paragraph that read: 'If at any time you are independently approached by a member of the press... give a listening ear to the request but politely decline to be interviewed.'<br><br>The students were also told in the kit to refer members of the media to the organisers.<br><br>When asked, the organisers replied in a statement that the rule was 'to allow organisers to balance the need to ensure that the activities at the event and interviewees' schedule are not unduly disrupted with the need to facilitate the media in covering the event and interviewing participants'.<br><br>They also said they would have been happy to have a press officer escort reporters if they wanted to approach participants directly.<br><br>And that 'rule'? It was merely 'advice', the organisers said.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok sheesh, you organise something to educate the public and tell them NOT to make any comments, anyone find this ridiculous ?<br>-_-a<br><br>The idea of interviewing the students that joined the seminar is to hear the STUDENTs' view on what DPM said, how could you "advise" them not to say anything to the press? How are we supposed to be entreprenurs if you don't even feel safe enough to let us say what we think of it.<br><br>The moment the students see an reporter approaching with a press officer they would have ran instead of giving their comments.</div>

The intention was to allow participants who were not comfortable with being interviewed the option of declining the media's request for interviews.<br><br>We regret that the advice has caused some students who were approached by The Straits Times to decline interview requests. We will remove the advice from the folders in future.<br><br>The media, including The Straits Times, were able to speak to some students on the day of the Opening Ceremony to get their views on the keynote address by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.<br><br>Notwithstanding this, the Ministry of Education facilitated another round of interviews by The Straits Times with the participants for them to share their comments and insights into DPM's keynote address. This was carried in The Straits Times on June 7.<br><br>CHAN JEE KUN (MRS)<br>Director<br>Curriculum Planning and Development<br>Ministry of Education<br></span><br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>What a load of horsecrap!!! The media kit says and I quote "If at any time you are independently approached by a member of the press... give a listening ear to the request but politely decline to be interviewed."<br><br>That sure sounds like an instruction not advice. Or can't our vaunted Ministry of Education, who constantly produces world class students, tell the difference?</div>

If we dun start to shape up now and embrace Education with a global perspective, we'll only end up strangling ourselves eventually.</div>

But this is the 21st century, what kind of "chaos and over-shadowing neighbours" are we facing now? Malaysia? Please. Not looking down on them, but they know as much as we do not to rock the boat. The communists are long gone. Or do you mean the chaos sowed by bankrupt oppositionists who sell books at MRT stations or the ones who live in 3-room flats in Toa Payoh and drive a van around? The same old line has been hashed over and over again by the government, but its wearing thin and no longer making sense.<br><br><strong>i may sound pro-gov here but i believe its because most ppl here are anti-govern.. anyway thats just a feeling i have.. </strong><br><br>Anti government? I take it you never visit sammyboys forum or places like sintercom's forums. IMO the opinions here are quite fair and balanced here compared to other forums I've seen. You'd think from the views there the PAP was the Devil incarnate.<br><br>FYI I'm not pro- or anti-government. I just think there are a lot of improvements can be made in governing and running Singapore, but I do give credit where its due as well.<br><br><strong>and so how long has it been since we declared independency??<br>i wud say not long enough....</strong><br><br>So whats long enough? 100 years? 200 years? A thousand?<br><br><strong>the prob here is we are getting alot of exposure to other countries.<br>countries like america, the european countries<br>these countries enjoy great freedom and naturally we are affected<br>now we want it too...<br>but our country is realli different from them</strong><br><br>I don't know about the others but I do not want us to emulate the UK and US. This is another myth that the ruling party's propaganda machine has perpatuated among those who do not understand the nature of the changes that the younger set here are clamouring for.<br><br>What we want is the relaxation of the draconian rules regarding people speaking out and promoting discourse and exchanging ideas. Key to this is the removing of the "Politics for politicians" mindset that seems to have a stranglehold on the ruling party and the majority of the people in Singapore. We're Singaporeans all of us, we pay our taxes, the men have served their time defending the country, and the policies that shape Singapore have a direct and very real impact on all of us whehter they succeed or fail, so why can't we have more say in it?<br><br><strong>for one we have no natural resources not even land<br>had we had land like malaysia imagine what a hub we can become<br>but even now malaysia is undercutting us because land is cheap<br>this is the peril that singapore faces<br>so relate this to the topic. if so singapore onli has its population as a form of resource.. which explains why the education system is geared as such<br>engineers were required in the last 2 decades<br>so... the universities had engineering courses now bio-eng is the point<br>the point here is singapore is realli struggling to survive in this biting world and the government needs to plan for the future<br>how did we get this far?</strong><br><br>Yes but that is exactly why the authorities need to step back and let market forces dictate the supply and demand of grduates. The problem with our version of social engineering is that such beureaucratic (sp?)intervention, while having good intentions is almost always not nimble enough to cope with the changes in market forces. More so in todays dynamic global economy, where market forces shift on the drop of a hat. Just look at the population policy as another example of social engineering gone haywire.<br><br><strong>creativity definitely has its merits and should never be ignored<br>but how much is the question....<br>unity may be what we need isnt it? or diversity?</strong><br><br>Suppressing our opinions and thoughts about doesn't promote unity and understanding of our diversity. It provides a semblance of it by keeping people quiet through a culture of fear. Only if we are allowed proper discourse will true unity and understanding be promoted through a frank (but rational) exchange of ideas and opinions<br><br><strong>isnt that going to be a risk?<br>a risk for the future of singapore? </strong><br><br>Like I said, the old system has served us well in the past. But in recent years it has become rather glaringly obvious that the system is becoming an anachronism that has no place in the modern world and we run a very real risk of being left behind.<br><br>As it is, the government is reluctant even to fine-tune the system, not the mention the "Leave no stones unturned" and "No cow is too sacred to be slaughtered" the various wayang-committees trumpeted when they were first announced.<br><br>Isn't being stuck in the comfort zone of our own past success and refusing to change for the future to make adjustments for a new world more risky?<br><br>THe misunderstanding here is that we're not calling for a total shake up or removing all the controls, what we call for is a greater space for the people to particpate and contribute in national issues</div>
