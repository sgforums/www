              <p>By 
              																				Elena Chong</p>
              <p>A FORMER television actor and model agency owner was fined $6,000 on 
              Thursday for molesting a former pub operations manager three years ago.</p>
              <p>Mark Chow Yee Sze, 30, a 1994 Mr Teenage Singapore, had been
               found guilty earlier of touching the then 25-year-old woman all over, 
              including her breast, while she was resting in the office of the 
              downtown pub on Jan 10, 2007.</p>
              <p>The woman was unwell and had taken some medication before 
              she reported for work at the pub on the evening of Jan 9 that year. 
              Subsequently, she went to her office to rest.</p>
              <p>Chow was captured on the pub's CCTV doing various things to 
              the woman, such as tickling her palm, stroking her cheek and patting her
               butt, while she was lying on the sofa. In his defence, he denied 
              molesting her and told the court that he was merely trying to wake her 
              up.</p>
              <p>District Judge Sarjit Singh agreed with defence counsel 
              Subhas Anandan that the touch of the chest was a fleeting one, and a 
              stiff fine would do.</p>
              <p>Chow still has four molestation charges involving one woman 
              and three criminal intimidation charges, which will be mentioned in the 
              same court on April 21. He could have been jailed for up to two years or
               fined or caned or received any two such punishments for the offence.</p>

              <p><strong>Chow was captured on the pub’s CCTV tickling the woman’s palm, stroking

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Molest until like that fine only. Singapore is practicing one country, two system policy.<br></span></p>
              <p><strong>Last year, a Kovan grassroots leader was let off with only a $2,000
                              fine for molesting a 14 year old girl in a hotel lobby. He was the Vice
                              Chairman of Paya Lebar Kovan Community Club Youth Executive Committee.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Pleading for leniency, his lawyer, Mr Chung Ping Shen, told District
                              Judge Roy Neighbour that the incident was not planned, and the solitary
                              act was minor.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"> Is there a special technique to molest women or young girls so that there is fine only? Or is it a technique exclusive to the elite? maybe next time they will pay first then molest...<br></span></p>
