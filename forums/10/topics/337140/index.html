              <p>well, its industry standard meaning that what u are studying is exactly what u are supposed to know in the workplace.And FYI, the Australian workplace is world industry standard. I would suggest studying Business, finance, psychology and social related fields in OZ.</p>
              <p>Like eg. If u are studying a marketing  module, U are taught about the marketing field with knowledge of current times, directed to external data sources, and u have to draw up a marketing plan. Though your professor or lecturer may show u some guidance, he is like your "boss" The same exact thing as in the workplace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Knowledge based training" unlike our local polytechnics which only teach u on the concepts and not giving importance to practical work. Practical at most ends up as a farce with no real value or relation to the workplace.Theory is one thing, but applying it is another.</p>
              <p>I am sure some of u who have first hand expereince will agree with me. When u return to s'pore , u feel how backwards and silly everyone is especially when someone from NTU/NUS  talks cork that he's a scholar, u just feeling like laughing in your heart.Scholars are not judged by paper qualifications, they are judged by the amount of knowledge they know.</p>
              <p>NUS/NTU scholar have not seen the world. But i have seen.</p>

              <p>Hrm...it does make sense, i tend to dislike that i don't know what the industry is actually doing back in polytechnic. I'm fed with a lot of data and information but it's normally up to me if i want to explore more.</p>
              <p>In defense though, what i feel is that Singapore at independence was primarily filled with low educated workforce and the industry was mainly labour intensive not knowledge intensive.</p>
              <p>We've progressed pretty quickly since then, but it's still not quite enough to cultivate enough competent and experienced people that are willing to go back to educational insitutions to bring the students up to speed.</p>
              <p>In terms of what you stated, yes i believe we're still not really up to industry standards. But i feel what you pointed out is not as simple as a disfunctional system but rather the lack of enough experienced personnel to man it.</p>
              <p>Producing these personnel requires time, i believe the government is attempting to hothouse them. It's effective to some extent but it's still going to take a decade or 2 to actually have an world class workforce.</p>

              <p>But in spore, your real bosses and Ceos  are  mostly foreign with the labourers being local.U act under their direction when they appoint a "local subsidary" as a supervisor or boss. But they are still under the direction of their foreign masters.</p>
              <p>Countries like Australia, UK, Switzerland are world class workforce.</p>

              <p>Actually i would dispute this. You are basing that since the CEOs of the MNC are expats then automatically the expats' educational system is naturally better.</p>
              <p>But you do realise that these MNCs are based in their country and they naturally would prefer their local to take the helm. And since it's their money that sustains the MNC, they would want someone who can communicate in their language and understand their mentality.</p>
              <p>Are their workforce naturally better?</p>
              <p>You do understand that those who are here are the cream of their crop? What we see are the elites of their country, it can't be reasonable to assume that their entire country's workforce are better based off the top 10% yes?</p>

              <p>I thought the point of this whole post was how much better the western educational system is to ours. And now you say academic grades don't prove a person? That's a bit of a contradiction.</p>
              <p>But Bill Gates dropped out of high school, and Warren Buffet got rejected from Harvard Business School. They aren't exactly a prime example of the Western Educational System either. </p>
              <p>I'm not a believer that a student from RI/ RV/ Hwa Chong is automatically going to be good at whatever job he choses. But he/she still needs to work hard to be the best in a school that gathers the best. So saying the best student is automatically a paper warrior is a pretty unfair statement.</p>
              <p>Right now we're still progressing from a production based educational system to a knowledge based educational system.</p>
              <p>I don't believe the western countries ever had to make such a transition in so short a time and they've had a lot more time and mistakes to work out the problems.</p>
              <p>There needs to be time for more industrial personnel to go back to the schools to teach and to improve on the system. The Western Education System itself isn't neccesary better, it just had more experienced personnel manning it</p>
