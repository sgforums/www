Very often i have seen people complaining.But how many people actually worked in the government and see how the working life is like within the government before making their comments?And how many more bothered to go forth and make good solutions to their complaints?<br><br>Let me pick an example.Many people are complaining about the lack of freedom of speech<br>in Singapore.But how many of them actually realised that by actually complaining on the internet forum like this , they are actually exercising a form of freedom of speech.The very fact that many of you are not caught through ip tracking proves that we are actually exercising a form of freedom.The very fact that this website was not blocked proves that we are free to express our views.So what else do you want?Think of it, is the freedom of speech that important?with or without it life still goes on.<br><br>As i have said it many times, our society is just a young immatured nation Think we are as refined or as matured as the europeans? Wrong.Think we are as polite and humble as the Japenese or even the Shanghainese?Wrong.What we have are only a bunch of self centered haughty group of people who live in their own cocoon of rules. With 3 million different demands going through your ears everyday, it would make it extremely difficult to please everyone.The truth is, i never liked full democracy. In fact i don't see anything wrong with living within an iron fist.Because ultimately, everybody's rights will infringe into each other's rights.<br><br>So does the article above which i wrote caused me look as though as i have lost my guts and marbles? i don't know, maybe to you.But it certainly took me courage to write this because the people who i am addressing now may have out done me in experience.Right now i write this to defend my beliefs.So does that make me a coward just because i don't follow your views? I don't think so.<br><br>Anyway, it has been a pleasure staying up this late to talk to my fellow forum users. Thank you and merry christmas.<br><br></div>

And for peek's sake, you avoid double-counting with cookies - how many out there has more than one Yahoo or Hotmail account? All you can say is that majority of those opinions from yahoo members who claimed that they are singaporeans (not majority of members because you cannot guarantee no double counts and not majority of singaporeans because you probably did not validate their claimed nationality and check for similar demographic distribution against the that of the censes) towards that particular question yaba yaba yaba...</div>

Its very difficult for anyone to believe that anything will really change if he sticks around. Singapore urgently needs real drastic changes, paradigm shifts!</strong><br><br>Sociology Professor Chua Beng Huat was reported by the Straits Times to have said, at a seminar organized by the Institute of Policy Studies earlier this month,<br><strong>"He should just go." </strong> <strong>"He" was Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew. </strong><br><br>No one else picked it up. No follow-up commentary in the press. Yet I am sure Chua spoke for a great majority of Singaporeans.<br><br>Without detracting from his great achievement when he was Prime Minister for three decades 1959 Â­ 1990, today, Lee has become a liability.<br><br>Two gaffes last September were widely noticed by the public, though once again, the media were too restrained to call them gaffes.<br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">Nearly a diplomatic incident</span> </strong><br>His wife, Mrs Lee, had a stroke while in London. She was rushed to hospital, but was put in a queue for a brain scan. Lee phoned Tony Blair to ask for his assistance, and later, on his return to Singapore, publicly expressed thanks to the British PM for helping her jump the queue.<br><br>Blair's office was aghast. They denied that he or his staff did any such thing. There would have been uproar from the British public if they thought their Prime Minister participated in an act that could be described as an abuse of power.<br><br>The thought never seemed to have occurred to our Senior Minister.<br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">Nearly a domestic incident </span></strong><br>The Singapore doctors who rushed to London to attend to Mrs Lee had some disagreement with the British doctors. (The Straits Times was later to quote the Singapore doctors casting aspersions on the competence and professionalism of the UK team). They decided to fly her back to Singapore as soon as she was stabilised.<br><br>A Singapore Airlines flight was chosen, and all its first class and business class passengers were asked to take another flight [1]. The plane was then converted into a flying hospital to take her back.<br><br>On his return, Lee publicly praised Singapore Airlines for being so prompt and efficient in converting the aircraft and responding to an urgent need. The mainstream press duly carried his praises and once more cheered the flag carrier.<br><br>On the bulletin boards, some upstart asked, well who's going to pay for that flight? Why should Singapore Airlines, a publicly-listed company with quite a few private shareholders, bear the cost?<br><br>After a few days, the Senior Minister's Office said that Lee would pay for the flight. Payment had been offered before the talk appeared on the bulletin board, it claimed. True or not, we don't know. Believed or not, is another matter.<br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">Blind spots</span> </strong><br>Both instances were serious blind spots, easily attributable to being in power, and having his way, for too long. The perks of rank, which would be unacceptable in other democracies, are quietly allowed to slip through. This is what happens when a towering figure dominates the political scene, when opposition parties are nearly snuffed out, and worse, when he has neutered the media.<br><br>We came close to a diplomatic accident with Britain. We nearly stepped onto a landmine exploding in the face of the entire government for abuse of priviledge, and this, at a time when the government's credibility was already stretched thin by the continuing economic gloom.<br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">Undermining the institutional legacy </span></strong><br>In September too, Lee suddenly announced that even after his son Lee Hsien Loong became Prime Minister, and after Goh Chok Tong had retired, he would still remain as Senior Minister.<br><br>At one stroke he damaged a political institution Â­ that of cabinet government. The right thing to say would have been, "whether I stay in the cabinet or not is not for me to say, but for the future Prime Minister to decide if I can be of help."<br><br>Diplomatic politesse it certainly is, but it at least preserves the figleaf of the primacy of the PM's position. But, no. Lee decided he would stay and said it out loud.<br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">Reminding all of the impossibility of change </span></strong><br>The style of the announcement aside, the fact that he stays on is the grosser liability. It is very difficult for anyone to believe that anything will really change in Singapore if he sticks around.<br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">Perceptions and sentiment are very important</span>.</strong><br>For example, look at Thailand. Thaksin's program is far from complete. Hindsight might even judge his fiscal policies reckless. But through style alone, he has turned economic pessimism to hope. And there's a buoyancy that is giving that country a rare, rare thing Â­ a virtuous cycle.<br><br>Singapore? Most observers think we need some really drastic changes, some paradigm shifts, if you'd forgive an overused term. But most observers also think, it's not happening. Nothing is going to change down here, except most grudgingly, always too little, too late, because nothing changes up there.<br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">Adding value </span></strong><br>Once in a while, the press reports of some intervention by Lee in important matters of state. One is supposed to get the impression, that if not for him, such matters would not be well handled.<br><br>A few years ago, the Singapore government was getting the short end of the stick in the Suzhou Industrial Park venture, beaten at its own game by the Suzhou municipal authorities. At the height of the impasse, there was much trumpeting that Lee communicated directly with Jiang Zemin, and got Jiang's commitment to rein the municipal brats in.<br><br>As far was we, the public, can tell, nothing resulted. And are we to be surprised? Jiang was running a country of 1.5 billion people poised precariously between economic boom and social catastrophe! He had his own mountain of a problem to deal with: his own succession. What was Suzhou Industrial Park compared to all that? Who was Lee compared to all that?<br><br>Then there was Malaysia, Mahathir and the water supply problem. Lee wrote notes to Mahathir. Mahathir wrote back, and then changed his mind. The problem was the personality of Mahathir, and there was nothing that Lee could have done about that.<br><br>Now we have Lee saying he is personally taking on the Singapore Airlines pilots, to make sure they don't stand in the way of needed restructuring by the airline, in the face of low-cost competitors. Don't we have another cabinet minister whose portfolio includes air transport? Are we saying the other ministers are incapable of handling the situation? If they are, then what's with all the boasting about getting the best and brightest to serve as the PAP team?<br><br>I am looking hard to see where Lee adds valueÂ­ today, not yesterday. <strong>I can't find it.</strong> I hardly need to look where he subtracts value.<br><br><strong>How to add value then? There is more dignity in going than hanging on. </strong><br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------<br>Sources and Relevant Links:<br>Yawning Bread Adding value January 2004<br>Sg-Review Adding value 26 January 2004<br>yawning_bread 'Asian' means we have to live with hypocrisy and paralysis January 2004<br><br>The Singapore government is still attached to an outmoded model of a paternalistic family, just as it is still attached to the rather racist idea that people should be defined by their racial origins.<br><br>Do we believe citizens should be treated equally regardless of race, sex, language, religion?
