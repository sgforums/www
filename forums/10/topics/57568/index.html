I can feel it when I am no longer making a contribution, " Lee said.<br><br>But many Singaporeans, who live under a political system that has allowed<br>the People's Action Party to rule since independence, want him to retire, according to the poll by Internet portal Yahoo Singapore.<br><br>By 5:30 pm (0930 GMT) on Friday, 44 percent of 6,383 respondents said they<br>wanted Lee to retire from politics immediately while another nine percent said he should retire "soon".<br><br>Forty-three percent said he should continue in politics.<br><br>Despite the poll results, Lee's efforts in making Singapore a First World<br>nation are recognised in the city-state with another Yahoo poll this year<br>choosing him as Singaporean of the Year.<br><br>The Internet is a popular avenue for political debate in technologically<br>advanced Singapore, where free speech has long taken a back seat to Lee's<br>famous "Asian values" system that puts society ahead of the individual.<br><br>Yahoo Southeast Asia marketing and research head Miguel Bernas told AFP<br>there was a lot of interest in the poll on Lee, which began on Wednesday and<br>was due to close later Friday.<br><br>He said Yahoo Singapore conducts polls twice a week, with the more than 6,300 people who responded to the Lee question well above the average of about 4,000.<br><br>Bernas said cookies and checks to see if respondents were Yahoo members ensured people could vote only once.<br></div>

Sometimes looking at the current standard of living, we are still eating bread and butter, its more expensive that's all....or so it looks expensive....<br><br>Some of SM Lee's policies reflected his lack of hindsight. The family planning policy where two is enough had worked so well that we do not have enough young people to protect our nation let alone support the future economy. Now the present government is firefighting to resolve the mistake made so long ago. An aging population is not so easily resolved. No amount of effort can be done for the aging population. Even if they were sucessful in salvaging this problem, a great deal of effort is required from them 'woo' investors back to Singapore after a span of 30 years recovery. Which foreign investor will continue to set up operations with a bunch of old people? Reality is that years of mistake from the 70's is not something you can resolve within 2 mins, months or 2 years. Without the youths, the key to the new economy will be halted for numerous years thus resulting the loss in our economy. Without natural resources and land, we need youthful manpower.<br><br>The anti-corruption policies is just another redirecting cover to look nice. There are still much corruption in public or private sector. Its just how well you justify it. You can always find little loop-holes in every rules and gift-wrap it to make it look wonderful. javascript:emoticon('<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">')<br><br>The housing plan to give every Singaporean to OWN a roof over your head is another of the government's magical illusion. You don't actually own it (after having paid $200 000 to $300 000 for it). You are leasing from HDB. With that money, I could actually own a landed freehold property in our neighbouring country. Isn't it not surprising that we have to pay legal fees to LEE &amp; LEE before even leasing the HDB property? (Hmmm...wonder who owns LEE &amp; LEE??? Let me guess! Aiyah! So obvious right?!)<br><br>So much for the negative! At lease now we can afford breadtalk right?

            <div class='col-md body'>SM Lee Kuan Yew can help to maintain a more firm ground on the PAP goverment if he will stays on and not retires. In what i know, i think current PM Goh Chok Tong might also be staying on in the goverment which in term help to have a better secure to the desicion being made by the next PM. By having the previous PM to remain in the parliment, the ex PMs will be able to contribute to the PM and thus having a more stable government.</div>

What is the cost of a state funderal- not to mention that Mr Lee is an important person in the creation of modern Singapore.<br><br>Mr Lee- please let us remember your glory and significance- surely you would not want us to remember you as a person who refuses to let go even to the end. One thing that you have never shown us is generosity and magnimity. Its time to show it before its too late.<br><br>Save us a hafty state funeral. Thanks.

            <div class='col-md body'>The whole trouble with the majority of Singaporeans is that without LKY Singapore would not be what it is today. Oh Pleeeeezzzzeeee! The US has partizan politics since time immemorial, today it is the world's largest economy and the only super power left! Singapore without LKY would have developed into a full democracy with some other, we would not need to suffer under such stiffling conditions today!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The other reason why LKY will not retire is because there are too many skeletons in his closets. BG Lee is up there also to protect him. If PAP loses power, all the dirt will come out and he will end up like Suharto!</div>
