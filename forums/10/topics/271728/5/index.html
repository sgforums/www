For the sniffing was a real thing that people can immediately pin on him as something extremely silly that he has done while the whining label was an artifical, and largely unsucessful attempt to attract attention to his cause.<br><br>One just needs to look and realize how naturally the jokes and humour from his sniffing incident flows out and causes immediate laughter and responses while his attempt at trying to parody his opponents as whining birds can't even move beyond the first act, eventually being used as a feeble security blanket by him to have some presence here... but the thing is, even his attempts to answer actually help us.<br><br>This is because at the end of the day you must admit when given the choice, most people prefer to be whining birds then sniffing Gazelle, and that will never change.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> The more Gazelle replies with his "whining birds" tack the more he's is actually driving this point home and helping his opponents, not him.<br><br>Actually I don't mind him keeping this thread alive by posting one-liners, anybody reading this thread will notice his sniffing habits and the various hilarious pictures that illustrate his most unsavoury habits more then his repeated posting of the same picture.<br><br>So by all means Gazelle, keep bumping this thread up  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Are you that open?<br><br>It would be interesting to see how your family and your friends (especially the one your betrayed) react to your little adventures...<br><br>LOL, that pretty much ranks you up with the bunch of perverts who are open and happy about their lifestyle, but being open about it hardly changes the fact that at the end of the day, you are really quite a sad excuse of a man who does not know how to honour the modesty of a lady.<br><br>As I said, you can live your life anyway you want, but don't be too surprised that hardly anyone reacts to it the way you want.<br><br>At the end of the day, you'll still be pwned for it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
