I am not even affected by his feeble attacks, which are baseless. That's why most of the time I ignore him, instead of escalating to calling his parents names too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>He is quite affected by the labelling as panty sniffer by forumnites, as can be seen by the egregious verbal responses from him. The issue of panty sniffing strikes his cord, therefore he sings back verbal abuses.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>First of all, his act of panty sniffing is extremely distasteful, but he has the stupidity to make it public. This doesn't reflect on his credibility only, it also reflects on his sanity and intelligence. Therefore, I would strongly advise that you take Gazelle's statements with alot of discretion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
