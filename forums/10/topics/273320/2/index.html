            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ngejay:</div><div class="quote_body">The reason why citizens of any country pay taxes is so that the govt can use the tax revenue to build infrastructure, and create and maintain essential services like security and defence for the people. That is the purpose of taxation.<br><br>In Singapore, essential services that the govt is actually supposed to provide are increasingly being privatized or corporatized in some form or other. Now instead of the govt using taxpayer's money to provide essential services for the people, it is pushed to the private corporations and GLCs which are increasingly becoming autonomous.<br><br>These private corporations will naturally care about profits and the bottom line. Hence the provision of essential infrastructure and services now becomes a transaction between customer and company, rather than an alliance between citizen and government. That is why the cost of living is rising to much, why these companies providing essential services can push costs to consumers on the pretext of rising raw materials costs.<br><br>E-Jay</div></blockquote>All that before you consider the fact such a scenario is actually the brainchild of this regime, whose brand of state-orchaestrated tyranny would dictate that they regulate these essential services and restrict the operators to firms in which the regime has a stake.<br><br>If a free market economy had indeed been adopted when it comes to determining who should be given the licence(s) to run your public transport services, telecom services or gaming-related businesses, you'd hardly encounter the scenario you described.<br><br>So is the plight of the average joe simply a result of the regime delegating these essential services to organisations run by the minions, relatives and allies of the despots? Or should we extrapolate further and regard the regime as being the mastermind orchaestrating an economic model out for exploitation, instead of simply being a player succumbing to the flow of a flawed economic system?</div>

The whole banking system will crash, because in mortgage crisis, there will be alot of bad loans, all these loans will be written off by the banks, causing heavy losses for banks. This might even initiated a run on the bank, because depositors having received information that the government no longer supports the bank, fear for the recovery of their hard earned savings. If you know nuts, don't even start babbling because it will show your stupidity.<br><br>This goes to show the intelligence of the pro PAP supporters, how they have been constantly manipulated, hoodwinked and shod shackled by the ruling elites.<br><br>If you don't have any intelligence to think for yourself, you will be constantly fooled by others smarter than you.<br><br>Suggest you take an online course in <strong><a href="http://william-king.www.drexel.edu/top/prin/txt/EcoToC.html" rel="nofollow">"Economics 101"</a></strong> first before you continue blabbing bollocks.</div>

If you should be in doubt, I too have attended school here. It would be nice if you'd judge the quality of my comments for what it is without making inferences and assumptions as to my background for ultimately, that's what truly matters.<br><br>That said, my education and work too have taken me to places as diverse as the US, Scandinavia, UK, Switzerland, Germany, Hong Kong and China to name a few. My vacations have also taken me from places that span the globe from Latin America to North Korea.<br><br>As to your points, let's put it this way : have you really seen what some other countries offer their citizens? Look at the Nordic countries and the UK - developed first-world countries with a population not substantially bigger (well, at least for the Nordic countries) than Singapore's. Are you aware education and healthcare are virtually free in these countries? Surely, given the fact that the life expectancies of these countries would match Singapore's at a canter and that their economies would easily put Singapore's to shame, you wouldn't doubt these countries too have quality teachers and an advanced healthcare system which is actually more comprehensive than Singapore's? Or are you telling me you're actually getting a better deal having a staggered income tax system that's capped at 21% (for the highest tier) without actually having any tangible benefits available to you? Mind, the Nordic countries are no more dangerous than Singapore.<br><br>That said, and as I have already mentioned in some other thread, if security is of utmost concern to you, why not consider North Korea as the model to follow? After all, along with Switzerland and the Nordic countries, it's just about as safe as I have experienced. <strong>So how much of your civil liberties and personal freedom are you prepared to trade for your so-called security? More importantly, are civil liberties and security as mutually exclusive as this regime would have you believe?</strong> The bottomline is, contrary to the propaganda this regime has a knack of churning out, not everyone is obssessed with security at the expense of individual rights and freedoms - to many, civil liberties, labour rights and personal freedoms are no less important.<br><br>After all, I'm not sure if many would actually prefer living somewhere with a low crime-rate but needing to worry about collecting cans and cardboards in their <strong>twilight years</strong> just to make ends meet (and that might not even be sufficient) for day-to-day survival without the slightest social safety net to fall back on.</div>

That's effectively a buffer deployed by this regime to safeguard any speculative "attacks" (no prizes for guessing where the extension of such a measure stems from, given the xenophobic despot's obstinate worries) or any external volatility that might affect the currency. Should such precautionary measures be insufficient, that's where the second line of defence comes in with the bulk of the reserves providing the basis to restore the imbalance for this regime knows the intrinsic implications between having a sustainable economy and its very survival.<br><br>Should you not understand what I've been harping about above, I'm sure <span style="font-style: italic;">maurizio13</span> will have no problems enlightening you on that.</div>

I really cannot follow what you are trying to say.  By saying I am un-intelligent, you are double shooting yourself.  what a joke you are.<br><br>I repeat what i wrote.  Open your eyes widely and read again BELOW.   Honestly, do you want me to teach you about what is being written by myself?<br><br>Take the sub prime mortgage problem in the US as example, ECB and US Fed Reserve can pump in money as much as they want to rescue the banks. The impact on their currencies Euro and US dollar is almost nothing. If there is a mortgage crisis in Singapore and if MAS were to pump in money, Singapore dollar would most likely crash, during which the country's reserve will need to be used to "defend" its currency. that is why, i guess, the govt of singapore is very focused on accumulating reserve because the country needs it to survive, to support the singapore dollar. if this is a good guess, we can also see that US and Europe are much bigger powers and that they can have choices which include choosing liberal democracy without fears.<br><br></div>
