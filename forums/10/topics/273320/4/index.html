Do me a favour, go read up on economics 101 before talking to me about economics again.<br><br></div></blockquote>M13, since when did i say MAS wont inject money into the system at the time when there is a banking crisis?<br><br>Take the sub prime mortgage problem in the US as example, ECB and US Fed Reserve can pump in money as much as they want to rescue the banks. The impact on their currencies Euro and US dollar is almost nothing. If there is a mortgage crisis in Singapore and if MAS were to pump in money, Singapore dollar would most likely crash, during which the country's reserve will need to be used to "defend" its currency. that is why, i guess, the govt of singapore is very focused on accumulating reserve because the country needs it to survive, to support the singapore dollar. if this is a good guess, we can also see that US and Europe are much bigger powers and that they can have choices which include choosing liberal democracy without fears.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ngejay:</div><div class="quote_body">This was a personal writing on mine which I posted on my blog a couple of months back.<br><br>Singapore may have one of the lowest personal income tax rate and corporate tax rate in the world, but in reality the PAP employs various schemes of hidden taxation which makes Singaporeans one of the highest taxed citizens in the world.<br><br>For a start, those who live in HDB flats don't really own them. They are practically leased from the government for 99 years. The current market rate is sky-high. Many Singaporeans end up ploughing a large part of their life savings into their HDB flat, and they cannot always sell to realize capital gains as people need a roof over their heads. The only way to extract capital gains is to downgrade, which in effect is just transferring one lease to another. You never truly own your HDB flat at all.<br><br>GST is creeping up. It may still be much lower than those so-called Value Added Tax in european countries, but the way I see it the gap will continue to close. The reason is that the PAP govt wants a more recession-proof tax base, never mind that it is a tax base that hurts the poor and small businesses the most, compared to the rich and large businesses which tends to have higher profit margins are more insulated against rise of costs at the margin.<br><br>GST results in the poor spending a much larger PERCENTAGE of their net income on household items and basic necessities compared to the rich. Even though the rich pay a much higher percentage of their income as direct tax, the fact remains that direct taxes have been kept low or even reduced over the years, while indirect taxes like GST have risen and hurt the poor proportionally more.<br><br>Last but not least, medical costs are escalating and rising much greater than the overall rate of inflation. Given that we do not have a comprehensive medical welfare system apart from the flawed Medisave and various Medishield schemes, once again Singaporeans lose out compared to citizens of other countries that have more comprehensive medical welfare policies. Escalating medical costs are therefore increasingly become another major source of "unreported" taxation on ordinary Singaporeans due to the PAP's anti-welfare policies.<br><br>The PAP govt likes to flout our low direct tax rates and claim this keeps us competitive.<br><br>In reality the economy is made uncompetitive because the PAP power structure entrenches itself in the GLCs and major corporations like Singtel. These bureaucrats lack good business skills and are not wordly-wise, having been sitting behind their desks in their own political ivory towers. Hence, when these PAP bureaucrats and stalwarts entrench themselves as directors, chairpersons and CEOs of these GLCs, they make them uncompetitive, and being monopolistic, they deprive other businesses of the opportunity to compete, innovate, and thrive.<br><br>And so the points mentioned above are the reasons why although Singaporeans have the lowest personal income taxes in the world, in reality they are one of the most heavily taxed through indirect means.</div></blockquote>Before getting ahead of ourselves, i believe the statement should be: <span style="color: red;"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Are Singaporeans getting good value for the taxes they pay</span></strong></span>? - As opposed to <strong><span style="color: darkblue;">'Singaporeans are the most heavily taxed'</span></strong>.<br><br>Our taxes, including relief, insurance and other family-related deductions, are still relatively managable, as compared to the 40-50% taxes in other developed countries.<br><br>However, instead of simply resting on their laurels, the govt can introduce more public amenities that benefit the people, rather than remain conservative.<br><br>Escalators for overhead bridges, lift upgrading for HDB flats and handicap-friendly features on transportation, buildings and parking space are examples of areas to work on and these certainly benefit the elderly and wheelchair bound.<br><br>Other options such as improving medicare in govt sectors, rebates to offset rising medical costs and subsidies for the needy with regards to basic educational requirements can also be reviewed.<br><br>I would like to see my taxes well spent on these sections, instead of higher and higher ministerial and cabinet staff salaries, which i find totally unjustified.</div>

It should be laughter at first sentence and it should be " HA HA HA !!"<br><br>so why are you and walesa (who sound like foreigners) 100% + 100% against singapore's current government, PAP party ?  Lots of free time, Fingolfin_Noldor ?<br><br>Another thing about you and walesa is that both of you like anti-PAP forumers ONLY.  Trying to form a choir here with everyone singing the same anti-PAP song?  "What are you doing in SINGAPORE's online discussion forum? "  Your mom and dad must be asking you, Fingolfin_Noldor.<br><br>as i expected, your english response is so good and powerful.  You should start an English Language learning center.  I am sure you will be very successful.  Cannot find a sponsor?  Dont worry, we can co-operate, i give you 30% of the net profits.<br><br>"wriggle your way out" is only your assumption about me, Fingolfin_Noldor.<br><br>"You have been, as all good pro-PAP people like to do"  is another assumption you make about me, Fingolfin_Noldor.<br><br>I wonder what else you are going to throw out from your superb english speaking mouth.<br><br></div>
