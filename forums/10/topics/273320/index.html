            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>This was a personal writing on mine which I posted on my blog a couple of months back.<br><br>Singapore may have one of the lowest personal income tax rate and corporate tax rate in the world, but in reality the PAP employs various schemes of hidden taxation which makes Singaporeans one of the highest taxed citizens in the world.<br><br>For a start, those who live in HDB flats don't really own them. They are practically leased from the government for 99 years. The current market rate is sky-high. Many Singaporeans end up ploughing a large part of their life savings into their HDB flat, and they cannot always sell to realize capital gains as people need a roof over their heads. The only way to extract capital gains is to downgrade, which in effect is just transferring one lease to another. You never truly own your HDB flat at all.<br><br>GST is creeping up. It may still be much lower than those so-called Value Added Tax in european countries, but the way I see it the gap will continue to close. The reason is that the PAP govt wants a more recession-proof tax base, never mind that it is a tax base that hurts the poor and small businesses the most, compared to the rich and large businesses which tends to have higher profit margins are more insulated against rise of costs at the margin.<br><br>GST results in the poor spending a much larger PERCENTAGE of their net income on household items and basic necessities compared to the rich. Even though the rich pay a much higher percentage of their income as direct tax, the fact remains that direct taxes have been kept low or even reduced over the years, while indirect taxes like GST have risen and hurt the poor proportionally more.<br><br>Last but not least, medical costs are escalating and rising much greater than the overall rate of inflation. Given that we do not have a comprehensive medical welfare system apart from the flawed Medisave and various Medishield schemes, once again Singaporeans lose out compared to citizens of other countries that have more comprehensive medical welfare policies. Escalating medical costs are therefore increasingly become another major source of "unreported" taxation on ordinary Singaporeans due to the PAP's anti-welfare policies.<br><br>The PAP govt likes to flout our low direct tax rates and claim this keeps us competitive.<br><br>In reality the economy is made uncompetitive because the PAP power structure entrenches itself in the GLCs and major corporations like Singtel. These bureaucrats lack good business skills and are not wordly-wise, having been sitting behind their desks in their own political ivory towers. Hence, when these PAP bureaucrats and stalwarts entrench themselves as directors, chairpersons and CEOs of these GLCs, they make them uncompetitive, and being monopolistic, they deprive other businesses of the opportunity to compete, innovate, and thrive.<br><br>And so the points mentioned above are the reasons why although Singaporeans have the lowest personal income taxes in the world, in reality they are one of the most heavily taxed through indirect means.</div>

These are the real powers in control of the world.<br><br>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank injected another $83.8 billion into the banking system Friday amid signs that bad U.S. mortgages were digging deeper into the world economy.<br><br>But investors did not seem appeased, with major indexes plunging in London, Frankfurt, Paris and Tokyo.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br>The 61 billion-euro move by the ECB, which had provided 95 billion euros ($130.7 billion) in funds to banks on Thursday, came after Japan's central bank injected 1 trillion yen ($8.4 billion) into money markets. Early Friday, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a three-day addition of liquidity. The Fed had already intervened Thursday, injecting a larger-than-normal $24 billion in temporary reserves to the U.S. banking system.<br><br>It was the first time the U.S., European and Japanese central banks had taken such action together since the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The Australian, Hong Kong and Canadian central banks also joined in.</div>

Previously the super rich have income taxes of 33%, while the poor don't need to pay income tax. But nowadays, the rich gets their income tax reduced to 20% which more than covers them for the 7% GST, while the poor already not paying income taxes has to end up paying 7% GST.<br><br>There is no doubt that through this redistribution of income, there will be more rich people, but there are also going to be more poor people.<br></div>

It's much worse when you see these government controlled monopolies charging above worldwide equilibrium rates. That's why you see the profits of Temasek keeps rising, through their cross ownerships of the few dominant corporations, they can prevent competition from eroding their profit line.</div>
