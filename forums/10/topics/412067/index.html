              <h1 class="story-header"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11388628">Profile: Kim Jong-un</a></h1>
              <p class="introduction">Kim Jong-un is expected to be appointed the next leader of North Korea, succeeding his father, the "Dear Leader" Kim Jong-il.</p>
              <div class="caption body-narrow-width"><img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/49197000/jpg/_49197775_009997528-1.jpg" alt="This undated file picture is believed to show Kim Jong-Un in the Swiss city of Berne" width="304" height="405"> <span style="width: 304px;">Kim Jong-un is said to be the "spitting image of his father in terms of face, body shape and personality"</span></div>
              <div class="caption body-narrow-width">Kim Jong-un is the youngest son of Kim Jong-il and his late third wife Ko Yong-hui.</div>
              <p>Born in 1983 or early 1984, the young man was initially not thought to be in the frame to take up his father's mantle.</p>
              <p>Analysts focused their attention on his half-brother Kim Jong-nam and older full brother Kim Jong-chol.</p>
              <p>But speculation that he was being groomed to succeed his father picked up in January 2009, after a report from South Korea's Yonhap news agency suggested that Kim Jong-il had picked him as heir.</p>
              <p>North Korea watchers also took his reported appointment to the powerful National Defence Commission as a possible signal that he was being moved into a leadership position.</p>
              <p>The defence commission is North Korea's most important government body, and Kim Jong-il rules the country in his capacity as the commission's chairman.</p>
              <p>On 2 June 2009, South Korea's intelligence agency reportedly briefed legislators that North Korean officials had been ordered to support the choice of Kim Jong-un as the next leader.</p>
              <p id="story_continues_1">There have already been poems and a song, Footsteps, composed, to promote the young man's virtues as a leader.</p>
              <p>Some 10 million portraits are being readied for distribution by the authorities to hang alongside those of his father and grandfather, according to reports.</p>
              <p>At the same time, there has also been much speculation that the man being lined up as the "power behind the throne" is Chang Song-taek - the husband of Kim Jong-il's sister and director of the administrative department of the North Korean Workers Party.</p>
              <p>Some analysts see him acting as a "regent" to Kim Jong-un until he is ready to rule on his own.</p>
              <p class="introduction"><span class="cross-head">'Morning Star King'</span></p>
              <p>Very little is known about the man himself. His mother was thought to be Kim Jong-il's favourite wife, and she clearly doted on her son, reportedly calling him the "Morning Star King".</p>
              <p>In his 2003 book, I Was Kim Jong-il's Chef, a Japanese man writing under the pseudonym Kenji Fujimoto also claimed that Jong-un was his father's favourite.</p>
              <div class="caption body-narrow-width"><img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/49197000/jpg/_49197778_jong_afp.jpg" alt="Image of Kim Jong-un shows him as a young boy aged about 11" width="304" height="304"> <span style="width: 304px;">This image of Kim Jong-un shows him as a boy aged about 11</span></div>
              <p>But the death of Ko Yong-hui in 2004, reportedly from breast cancer, appeared to put the younger Kim firmly behind his half-brother in the leadership stakes.</p>
              <p>However Kim Jong-nam's deportation from Japan in May 2001, and middle brother Kim Jong-chol's apparent "unmanliness" subsequently improved his chances.</p>
              <p>Swiss-educated like his brothers, Kim Jong-un avoided Western influences, returning home when not in school and dining out with the North Korean ambassador.</p>
              <p>Since his return to Pyongyang, he is known to have attended the Kim Il-sung Military University.</p>
              <p>But little has been made public about his character.</p>
              <p>In August 2010 Kim Jong-il visited China. One South Korean TV station cited a South Korean official as saying Kim Jong-un had accompanied his father on the trip.</p>
              <p class="introduction"><span class="cross-head">In his father's image</span></p>
              <p>Said by Kim Jong-il's chef, Mr Fujimoto, to be the "spitting image of his father in terms of face, body shape and personality", the young Kim has never been photographed by the Western media.</p>
              <p>The main photograph of him circulating in the public domain is one taken when he was 11, which Mr Fujimoto said he was given by Kim Jong-un before he left North Korea.</p>
              <p>There is one other which is purported to have been taken at his Swiss secondary school.</p>
              <p>Kim Jong-un also shares some of his father's health problems, and is reported already to have diabetes and heart disease due to a lack of exercise.</p>
              <p>He is reported to be a fan of NBA basketball.</p>
              <p>But these details, as with many others in secretive North Korea, are impossible to confirm.</p>

              <p>u can forget about it. Since it was mentioned that , Kim Jong Un is same in every aspects with his father esp. personality and character which will determine how will he rule North Korea.</p>

              <p>You know why democracy is better than Autocracy or communism?Becoz in autocracy or communist state,a dictator has absolute rights.This not only endanger the state,but it also cause danger to the dictator himself.</p>
              <p>Since once a person obtain the dictator's post,he can do whatever he want n free from critics.That why on the preface,North Korean dictator seems at the top n worry free.But the truth is,every single person around him was eyeing his post n wanted him die.This explain why Kim appearance was bizzare n seem much older n unhealthy from most common ppl.</p>
              <p>Usually the first generation of dictator still can uphold his power due to his/her experience as he work from bottom as a nobody.But even so,as he choose to be a dictator,he will has to sustain tremendous pressure n challenges that his subordinates n his countrymen gave him due to he has absolute rights n privileges.Everyone is eyeing on his post or detesting his ways.These will further divide into 2 grp of ppl,those who want democracy so that it would be more fair to everyone.And those who want to grab absolute power from the dictators n replace them.Either way,both grp wanted the dictator dead.</p>
              <p>When this dictator passs on his "seats" to his son,like Kim in this case or Lee Kuan Yew,they indirectly n selfishly putting their sons in a difficult n dangerous position also.As their inexperience son would be even more fragile n even more ppl wanted their post.So when LHL,LKY,Kim n his son look at the eye of their subordinates like GCT,Tony T,Mah BT or North Korea general or politicians,do they see those "scheming n vicious" looks on their subornates face?Hehe...</p>

              <p>Kim Jong il put his sister and brother-in-law (ie Kim Jong un's aunt and uncle) to be regent over the young Kim.</p>
              <p>I suspect their roles are more than regency but to keep contester-at-bay away and to ensure the young Kim toll the line, else..... They are the real power behind the throne.</p>
              <p>My take is that Kim Jong il arranged Kim Jong un's rise such that Jong un has no choice but to keep his father's legacy.</p>
              <p>Looking at past history on dynastic rule, and if the past is anything but a glimpse into the future.</p>
              <p>For young Kim to consolidate his power (many years after the demise of the father) and for him to be a ruler of his own right, he eventually has to get rid of his eldest half-brother, Kim Jong nam, and maybe, to turn his sissy real elder brother Kim Jon chui into real woman.</p>
