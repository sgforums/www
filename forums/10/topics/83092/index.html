Singapore cannot afford to do so espcially wif the NS thingy tat takes away 2 yrs of our lives..... . I'm sure u know that in the USA the system is such tat it is very broad based but often many graduate without knowing indepth in their relevant fields(esp Engin and Sciences) until they pursue their masters(in their 4th yr) and beyond.... do you think singapore can afford everyone to spend so much time and resources to find their interest....<br>But nontheless u would be surprised by the level of competitiveness in some of the top tier universities.... Like MIT, Stanford etc the competition can be so intense that they engage in "politics" to oudo each other..........<br>Finally i would like to say tat having a good piece of paper is not tat bad as at least if u fail in ur business ventures or whatever endeavour u have something to fall back on coz how many of us can be a Bill Gates or Warren Buffet? after all hasent bringing our education level to such high standard that singapore managed to achieved a first world status?
