Perfect timing. You expect anything that will remotely make the govt look bad? Those Singaporeans who do not link one event to another can be easily led by the various news from various sources into believing the official line.</blockquote>The donations by PM Lee and Dr. Lily Neo are only a symbolic gesture for him to be excused of a major setback to the strong policy of his government.<br><br>Such a gesture is somewhat a reprieve intended to pacify the people without abandoning the policy.<br><br>Think carefully it was PM Lee who pushed perhaps reluctantly the "Pay top talents (undefined) top salaries" policy for he has to toe the party line of which he plays a part all these years which is incidentally also the brainchild idea controlled by someone else.<br><br>So it will not be PM Lee to shoot his own foot by asking or expecting the ministers to follow suit and donate generously. To do so would undermine that policy and admit a fiasco or major defeat of one of PAP major policies.<br><br>If PM Lee really and sincerely feels committed to donating his extra monies he is entitled to receive he could have easily given a hint and many of them will just take the cue and follow suit.<br><br>It is clear that PM Lee just does the little act he has to to save his face by symbolically donating his own salary increases.<br><br>It is not a real intention to give or acknowledge policy setback. If he allows MPs and ministers to donate away the pay increases it does not help him or his party or the someone who directs the show.<br><br>It would be a giveaway of his policy and that will backfire on the whole PAP and hurt the supreme leader's feeling.</div>
