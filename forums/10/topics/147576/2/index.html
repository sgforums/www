No i think the distinction here is our ability to look at things in a more liberal manner.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why are we grumbling?<br><br>Perhaps the more pertinent question is: why arent we doing anything about it?<br><br>It pains me to see students/professionals/teachers professing to want to contribute to Singapore (in their scholarship interviews, CVs) and yet not understand simple political issues and realities. It is understandable that most tow the government line; but it is most unfortunate that most do so not out of agreement with government policy, but out of pure indifference.<br><br>Chinese have been known to be politically apathetic; an old saying goes " he does not concern himself with who the ruler is, but whether the ruler is just (competent)". China, for example, faces the same problem, no matter how nationalistic the PRCs may be. Taiwan and Hongkong, though, ruled by a military junta and a moneythestic colonial government respectively for most of their histories, have shown that they could break out of this mould and develop politically active societies.<br><br>However, if a country has to come up tops in this aspect, it must surely be Singapore - presidential walkovers, MPs who've never fought an election, can attest to this. It is not enough to heap blame solely on the government, though they might seem contradictory at times when encouraging a civil society; the people in Singapore must bear responsibility. Ã†Ã›Ã‰Ã†Ã…Ã‚Â¶Ã± (lit. bully the kind and afraid of the evil) will be an apt term here. Superiors rant and rave at their subordinates, experienced forumers insult less astute ones etc. Yet, self interest prevails when the government threatens them with upgrading, with poor economies etc.  Hence, it is tenable to argue that most singaporeans care not of the government, its polices, or other people, but care only about themselves.<br><br>(this post is getting too long)<br><br>Enough of the finger-pointing-behind-the-back and whining-to-your-spouse. Stand up, and if enough do, a difference can be made.</div>
