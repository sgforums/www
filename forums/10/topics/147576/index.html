            <div class='col-md body'>I think ndsef does have a point.<br><br>My view is that the ruling party has effectively disenfranchised the population in more ways than one through the re-drawing of electoral boundaries, persistent use of defamation suits against opposition party members and its paternalistic approach over the years.

But I beg to differ from the view that discontent coming from the heart is bad. I think, in fact, that it is better than the govt's content or discontent, which indubitably comes from the mind, to transmutate your expression. Discontent that is merely based on the mind results in the pursuit of the 3 'C's: Copiousness, Comfort,  Crown; which, btw, are the bases behind the traditional 5 'C's. Since that is the base which statistics can tell you. On the other hand, if you feel discontent based on the heart, there is certainly the presence of empathy for some others eg maids, the poor singapore students, "the tortured Singaporeans". Note: when you ahve statistics, you can <span style="font-style: italic;">symnpathise</span> with others, but <span style="font-style: italic;">sympathy</span> differs to a significant extent from <span style="font-style: italic;">empathy</span>. Sympathy derives from the pursuit of the Crown ie. when you sympathise, you are elevating yourself to a position of greater superiority than the person whom you are sympathising with eg. Kipling's <span style="font-style: italic;">the White Man's Burden</span>.<br><br>But havign said that, I don't really think it's desirable to wait until the point where some Singaporean (p'raps CSJ?) leads a full-blown popular insurrection. We definitely need change before then. ANd I concure whole-heartedly with Ms Lim's thesis in <span style="font-style: italic;">the Affective Divide</span>.<br><br>2) Change will definitely come as a surprise to everyone, possibly even us estranged Singaporeans down here in the Speakers' Corner.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> The difference will be the attitude/response toward it: the PAP, no doubt, will feel threatened and refuse to accept the expiry of its shelf-life, this despite whatever may be present in govt rhetoric; the opposition may well obtain a pleasant surprise, but they may with-hold some reservations as the opposition parties, even the SDP, have archaic motivations (- n this pt holds true internationally... y else is there increasing voter apathy?-) . Although the opposition's final goal may be universal, nonetheless their itnermediate goals are archaic, which is why they may oppose the actual changes which might occur. The same attitude of the opposition might be found in the people.<br><br>At such a juncture, the liberal-traditionalist divide isn't sufficient as a dichotomy. Some progressive changes may alienate the liberals, whilst others might alienate the traditionalists. For eg, say if one of the arriving changes was to re-introduce trade and student unions; this would be opposed by the traditionalists, who assert the importance of higher authority. on the other hand, if on eof the changes were to include religious input in the decision-making process, which is actually pretty progressive, this would rile the liberals, even those in this forum, who would make accusations of theocratic manipulation, since there is a great number among the liberals who are fanatic anti-clerics. as a note, the second change is progressive once you consider the decadence of the IR decision, unless of course you are already in pursuit of Copiousness.<br><br>regards,<br>the (progressive &amp; religious) pikamaster<br><br>P.S.: Conversion from 5 Cs to 3 Cs<br><br>C from 5 C              C(s) from 3Cs<br>Cash                      Copiousness<br>Credit Card            Copiousness, Crown<br>Club membership   Crown<br>Car                         Comfort, Crown<br>Condo                    Comfort<br><br>P.P.S.: Copiousness = abundance</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i read this from somewhere... London though a place of high fashion... recently one spokeman revealed that even with many talents who flocked to study in st. martin's, they actually dont have have many well-known UK fashion brands around in the market. what happened to pepe jeans?? anyone in spore still remember this brand?? they dont claimed themselves as one of the leading fashion industry.<br>but our government keeps planting different ideas and even claimed ten years from now, we will be one leading capital of high fashion with home-grown, well-known international brands. what have they done and will be doing for our students to achieve that sort of recognition? even song+kelly has to travel out and then back to spore to get its fame!<br>i think the nation lacks support. even so, they restrict too much for creativity and start-ups.<br>the recent presidential election?? what issued certificate in order to run for president?? i think we all know too much and this is just a place to let out. it doesnt matter whether we have a solution but whether all the hassle of submission to authority will be even replied or read before it hit the 'trash' button.<br>if we are not even given room and space to voice... this forum is useless. LKY would have long traced all our residential addressess though our internet connection and jailed us or probably because our country is so small that all the IP addresses is the same and he cant do that.<br>what is freedom of speech then? deflamatory?? all of us will be emailed by the forums manager or probably be banned.<br>whoever get offended here, read, take in into your stride, treat it as a reference and move on. life is bigger than what u think.</div>
