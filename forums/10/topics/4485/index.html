In modern high-tech warfare, most kills are scorked by air power(i think). Comparing the Royal Malaysian Air Force(RMAF), Indonesian Air Force(TNI-AU) and the Republic of Singapore Air Force(RSAF). The RSAF emerges the winner over the two Air Forces, in terms of technology, numbers of fighters, tactics and weapons. These are the information i know.<br><br>1) The best the RMAF can offer is the 8 F/A18D,the 20 MIG29 fighters and the fleet of out-dated F5E tigers. For the RSAF, is the 42 F16C/D,the fleet of upgraded 30 F5S and 40(i think so) A4SU attack aircraft. This incredible amount of high-tech fighters, i admit, is too much for a small country, but the Singapore govern ment is preparing a war not only with one country, but with at least two. You can see from the number of fighters we own.<br><br>2)In the Army, we have the right amount of soldiers to fight in a war with Malaysia.<br><br>3)Singapore operates about 340 AMX13 SM1 light tanks but the Malaysian Army only operates about 26 Scorpion light Recce Tank.<br><br>4)Singapore Army operates about 500 IFV25 and IFV 40/50 IFVs. The best malaysia can offer to be compared with the Bionix is the KIFVs that they own. Malaysia operates about 62 KIFVs.<br><br>5)Singapore operates about 350 upgraded M113A2 APCs, 44 AMX10PAC90 amphibious APC and about 200 V-200 APCs while the Malaysian Army operates about 450 Condor APCs, 150 old Sibmas APCs and 25 Stormer APCs.<br><br>Hope some Singaporeans would have more confidence in the Singapore Armed Forces after seeing some of these information i had gathered here. I know little about Naval aviation, anyone can tell me more about the Navy of the two countries?<br><br></div>
