Many of our best graduates in computer science and robotics and automation who did not have all the connections with the public sector could not even land suitable jobs in Singapore. But they are more important than all the top graduates and top scholars as these graduates could produce economic upgrading whereas all the scholars could only ask for top jobs without contributing to the upgrading of the economy.<br><br>Facts are always different from policy assumptions. Assumptions are not facts and people are easily taken in by all the make-belief and assumptions and rhetorics.</div>
