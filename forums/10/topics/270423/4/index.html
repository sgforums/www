And against HP and Dell who have streamlined their operations to the extent they can make profits out of it, they figured they would make more money selling it off and focus on consulting work which includes processor design, system analysis etc. Processor design is interesting given that all the game consoles use IBM  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
