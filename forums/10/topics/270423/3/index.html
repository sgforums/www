For eg. You are a local architect with a local U degree. U are easily replaceable with a PRC holding a Beijing Uni degree who demand a lower pay. The architect with a local degree lost his job easily. If a uni degree cant help him find a job what for does he need it especially since a degree will land him in debts.</div>
