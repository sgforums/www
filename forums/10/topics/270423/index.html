Sad to say the existing education system is too academic emphasising on passing of prescribed examination without any direction or targeting at practical knowledge applications.<br><br>If only the education is more practical oriented to prepare a student to apply existing knowledge and develop practical skill instead of over-emphasising on the academic or paper chase, many people would probably have mastered a practical skill or vocation by the time he finishes his secondary or ITE or Poly.<br><br>Which route a person takes depends on how he is being taught in schools but chances are he is being too academic and wanting to go to university to secure a job neglecting to apply what he has learned practical from early schooling.<br><br>I for one has posted many feedbacks on the critical importance of applying existing practical knowledge application to the Feedback Unit for years.

The amount I needed to pay back by the end of 10 years is probably larger than me, literally.<br><br>Costs of education aside, the other costs are rising as well. Cost of living, GST, transport fees, insurance, exams, tests, miscellaneous fees, whatever that can be charged will be charged.<br><br>If poly education is enough, I don't see the need for university education. In fact, given what I study (info tech), is it even worth to pursue higher education?<br><br>Frankly, I don't think so. I'm not of the opinion that a university graduate will know more info tech stuffs if they can't bother to keep up with the pace of technology.<br><br>The same goes for all the other fields.

Now people study Finance, funds management, but in a booming economy and a bull market, the ah soh also make big money from stock markets, the ah peh also become millionnaire from the en block sales. There is no guarantee that biomed, or life science, will give you better salaries in the future.<br><br>Education is an investment for the future, but the return is not in monetary term, it gives you the basic tools to pick up new knowledge, the analytical mind to manage information overflow, the skills for judgement and decisions making. It used to give us also the values to be a better person, but without moral education now, many highly educated people are also the most uncivilized people around.<br><br>Many think they have to go overseas for uni studies, but a much cheaper way is to study in local universities. I have many friends who work for few years a do post graduate degree part time, one of them actually did a degree through correspondence course, only spend the last semester in Australia to complete the degree.<br><br>Chinese says, "huo dao lao, xue dao lao." There is never ending to learning to improve oneself. You can borrow to study for a degree or you can just learn a skill after PSLE to make money. You alone decide what is good for life, your life.

            <div class='col-md body'>Any education is better than no education - so it is worthwhile. However, there shouldn't be an over-emphasis on paper qualifications when it comes to employment.<br>A qualification is nothing but a statement that one has met the minimum requirement to pass the exams. It is not a statement of one's ability to perform at work!<br><br>However, I think the MBA is hived. People spend so much money on a programme that teaches you nothing like rocket science but ROJAK! What so difficult to manage business? The difficult part is <strong>GETTING BUSINESS</strong> !!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that education should only be a means to an end, not an end in itself. Thus it's pointless going deep into debt to study if you still don't land a well-paying job after graduation........  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The ideal is to study for knowledge but the way the world is moving, that's only an ideal and remains as such. These days, it's the rat race - People just study as fast as thry can to pass their exams, graduate and find a job. Who cares whether they remember anything they have studied?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div>

I think it is easier to score in uni than in JC, comparing GP with the arts and humanities subjects.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Sorry to say, those who believe a uni is a place to build up your knowledge and thinking ability are losers. They say this because they couldn't list out anything noteworthy, hence the motherhood statement.<br><br>IMHO, a uni is a place for opportunities. Screw the modules; most of them will not make an impact on your life. What will make an impact on your life are<br><br>1. Friends. Some of the best friendships are forged during uni days.<br><br>2. Pool of talents. Uni is a place where smart people congregate. The top talents mostly go to the top unis, where they learn under world-class faculty.<br><br>3. Internship Programme. For example, NUS Overseas College. Students work full time in a silicon valley startup and study part time, for a year.<br><br>4. Incubation. Good if you want to start your own business.<br><br>5. Networking. Similar to 1, but whereas 1 is 'personal', this one is 'business'. Your networks might not be your good friends, but they can hyperlink you to further opportunities.<br><br>With these points in mind, it is not hard to imagine why Sergy and Brian, Gates, Jobs and all the uni dropouts can succeed in life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
