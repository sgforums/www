He wanted to know how these trends affected Singapore's media policy.<br><br>Mr Lee replied by noting that there had been 'a gradual opening up of porosity' that was inevitable with modern technology.<br><br>'The problem now is credibility,' he said.<br><br>'You can have any information you want, right or wrong, sound ones, some crazy otherwise on the Internet.<br><br>'So at the end of the day, each individual has to decide, who does he believe? Therefore if our media is to have any impact, they must remain credible.'<br><br>Remarking that he believed the media here to be credible, he added that judging from the hits on the Internet for Lianhe Zaobao, the Chinese daily, and The Straits Times, it was obvious that 'when people want to read about the region and Singapore', they read these sites.<br><br>This was why he was 'not unduly upset when people say, oh, we are a closed society'.<br><br>'How can we be a closed society? There is no magazine which you want to buy which you cannot have.<br><br>'We do not block any access to any website, nor do we trace you on Yahoo or Google,' he said, to laughter.<br><br>Source: ST</span><br>--------------------------------------------------------<br><br>shameless MM self-praise! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore News // Friday, October 5, 2007<br><br><strong>MM: No S'poreans want to ask a question?</strong><br><br>THE issue of homosexuality cropped up again during a question-and-answer session (picture) with Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew at the Nanyang Technological University's Ministerial Forum last night.<br><br>An English language undergraduate asked Mr Lee this question: Whether there was a "mutual contradiction" between Singapore's censorship laws and artistic expression, specifically on homosexuality and politics.<br><br>Mr Lee replied: "I cannot answer you on that. I just find it unbelievable that your artistic expression, or the desire and impulse in you, is suppressed because of the censorship laws. It cannot be.<br><br>"We are in a stage of transition ... I see no profits in having gay parades. If you are born homosexual, so be it. But must you parade it, or go out of your way to antagonise, embarrass or defy the more conventional view?"<br><br>During the one-hour session, he addressed issues such as press freedom and censorship. But when the session came close to an end, Mr Lee was concerned that only two out of the nine questions were asked by Singaporeans. He said: "Are there no Singaporeans who want to ask a question?"<br><br>Two Singaporean undergraduates then stood up to ask whether he was concerned with the high turnover rate of the teaching profession and what Singapore can do in the fight against global warming.<br><br>Mr Lee replied that the teaching profession is "unglamorous" but the Government's efforts to attract talents has paid off. He also revealed that the Cabinet is studying a paper on climate change.
