              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier;">And yet there are surprising similarities. The
              newly industrializing countries of Asia, like the Soviet Union of the 1950s,
              have achieved rapid growth in large part through an astonishing mobilization
              of resources. Once one accounts for the role of rapidly growing inputs
              in these countries' growth, one finds little left to explain, Asian growth,
              like that of the Soviet Union in its high-growth era, seems to be driven
              by extraordinary growth in inputs like labor and capital rather than by
              gains in efficiency.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier;">Consider, in particular, the case of Singapore.
              Between 1966 and 1990, the Singaporean economy grew a remarkable 8.5 percent
              per annum, three times as fast as the United States; per capita income
              grew at a 6.6 percent rate, roughly doubling every decade. This achievement
              seems to be a kind of economic miracle. But the miracle turns out to have
              been based on perspiration rather than inspiration: Singapore grew through
              a mobilization of resources that would have done Stalin proud. The employed
              share of the population surged from 27 to 51 percent. The educational standards
              of that work force were dramatically upgraded: while in 1966 more than
              half the workers had no formal education at all, by 1990 two-thirds had
              completed secondary education. Above all, the country had made an awesome
              investment in physical capital: investment as a share of output rose from
              11 to more than 40<em> </em>percent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier;">Even without going through the formal exercise
              of growth accounting, these numbers should make it obvious that Singapore's
              growth has been based largely on<strong> </strong>one-time changes in<strong> </strong>behavior
              that cannot be repeated. Over the past generation the percentage of people
              employed has almost<strong> </strong>doubled; it cannot double again. A half-educated
              work force has been replaced<em> </em>by one in<strong> </strong>which the bulk of
              workers has high school diplomas; it is unlikely that a generation from
              now most Singaporeans will have Ph.D's. And<strong> </strong>an investment share
              of 40 percent is amazingly high by any standard; a share of 7O percent
              would be ridiculous. So one can immediately conclude that Singapore is
              unlikely to achieve future growth rates comparable to those of the past.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier;">But it is only when one actually does the quantitative
              accounting that the astonishing result emerges: all of Singapore's growth
              can be explained by increases in measured inputs. There is no sign at all
              of increased efficiency. In this sense, the growth of Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore
              is an economic twin of the growth of Stalin's Soviet Union growth achieved
              purely through mobilization of resources. Of course, Singapore today is
              far more prosperous than the U.S.S.R. ever was--even at its peak in the
              Brezhnev years--because Singapore is closer to, though still below, the
              efficiency of Western economies. The point, however, is that Singapore's
              economy has always been relatively efficient; it just used to be starved
              of capital and educated workers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier;">Singapore's case is admittedly, the most extreme<em>. </em>Other rapidly<em> </em>growing East Asian economics have not increased
              their labor force participation as much, made such dramatic improvements
              in educational levels, or raised investment rates quite as far. Nonetheless,
              the basic conclusion is the same: there is startlingly little evidence
              of improvements in efficiency. Kim and Lau conclude of the four Asian "tigers"
              that "the hypothesis that there has been no technical progress during
              the postwar period cannot be rejected for the four East Asian newly industrialized
              countries." Young, more poetically, notes that once one allows for
              their rapid growth of inputs, the productivity performance of the "Tigers"
              falls "from the heights of Olympus to the plains of Thessaly.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier;">This conclusion runs so counter to conventional
              wisdom that it is extremely difficult for the economists who have reached
              it to get a hearing. As early as 1982 a Harvard graduate student, Yuan
              Tsao.) found little evidence of efficiency growth in her dissertation on
              Singapore, but her work was, as Young puts it, "ignored or dismissed
              as unbelievable." When Kim and Lau presented their work at a 1992<strong> </strong>conference in Taipei, it received a more respectful hearing, but had
              little immediate impact But when Young tried to make the case for input-driven
              Asian growth at the 1993 meetings of the European Economic Association,
              he was met with a stone wall of disbelief.</span></p>

              <p>Right after 1965,we just get local and foreign investors from HK</p>
              <p>etc to create jobs to tackle the abt 14% unemployment rate.</p>
              <p>Our grand/parents just went to make noodle,incense papers,mosquito</p>
              <p>coils etc to feed the families.If u dig history,u will know that we faced</p>

              <p>lionnoisy obvious does not understand what he is talking about that why he ask for graphs. this is because graphs are graphical and does not contain english which he might find hard to understand despite the fact that he abuses english to make his posts in here but if he does not understand english then how can he understand his posts to make his point? it is not logical. if the mighty us fall like he says then how can he use english to make his point?</p>
              <p>of course singapore is experiencing diminishing returns based on its growth model... diminishing is spelt like dim sum and dim sum in singapore has obviously reached a threshold because you dun see any more significant expansion in dim sum outlets in singapore so now you must go ding tai fung or bao qing tian to eat. have you seen lionnoisy in ding tai fung or bao qing tian? no because he only understand graphs but not dim sum that's why he cannot understand dimishing returns.</p>
              <p>by the way have you seen the raise in CPF age? the money in CPF to Singaporeans is like energon to transformers did you see what happen to jetfire when he never get enought energon in his old age? he starts breaking down.</p>

              <p>Krugman is an eminent economist and even won a nobel prize to boot, so who am I, a mere nobody to challenge his precious assumptions, publish in both best seller books and even had articles reproduced in respected newspapers.</p>
              <p>HOWEVER, he made one blatant and obvious fallacy to support his hypothesis and spittle upon our beloved motherland.</p>
              <p>He FAILED  to realize that education and technology is NEVER STAGNANT. It evolves at astonishing rapid rates, not even on a yearly basis, but almost on a daily basis, and such advances can be effectively and efficiently translated INTO PRODUCTIViTY, EVEN ON DAILY BASIS!</p>
              <p>So how can our people be deemed to have met the limit of our productivity? There is so much more yet to be discovered, improvised and create and it will be technology that will lead our evolution on productivity, as it will also charge our social evolution into greater heights, overtaking ancient societies. These are facts that cannot be denied!...unless one is as blind as him, caught up in his nobel prize hubris to sniff his nose at other nations.</p>
              <p>Alfred Nobel would turn in his grave if he ever saw krugman's article! But hell, I aint gonna wait for kruggie's stamp of approval. We have  a good thing going on and to hell with him I say.</p>
