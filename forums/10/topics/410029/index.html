              <p>Since it is an obvious fact that candidates from Opposition parties are not good enough to challenge and bring about any real change to the political scene in Singapore, I would like to make a suggestion to fix it.</p>
              <p>REPLACE THE CANDIDATES FROM THE OPPOSITION PARTIES WITH MORE CAPABLE AND CHARISMATIC CANDIDATES AND LEADERS</p>
              <p>Especially when there are many rebels and traitors who are dying to witness any form of revolutionary change within their pathetic lifespan, they can start by preparing their favorite parties with capable and charismatic candidates and vote out or rid the useless and incapable candidates and leaders to form a strong opposition body that is worthy of gathering real votes from the people. (NOT DONATION VOTES GIVEN OUT OF SYMPATHY)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>VOTES MUST BE EARNED THROUGH MERITS, AND SO FAR THE OPPOSITION PARTIES HAVE FALLEN EXTREMELY SHORT OF THE CURRENT RULING PARTY.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are people out there who believes that the Government serves the People, and if that is what they are after, then certainly the Government must be MORE CAPABLE than the People.</p>
              <p>And it's only natural for the Government to listen to the People who have proven themselves to be MORE CAPABLE than the Government.</p>
              <p>For bitter people who have been complaining and threatening the Government like some attention-deficit patients, PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU ARE MORE CAPABLE THAN YOUR GOVERNMENT!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Otherwise, you will only bring down your country and be regarded as traitors/trouble-makers/rebels with your nonsense propaganda. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Parn, thanks for sharing.</p>
              <p>Had the same opinion about the opposition, when it comes to voting, I will always prefer to adopt the rational vote instead of the emotional vote.</p>

              <p>The rational vote quite simply is one that votes for the long term survival of Singapore.</p>
              <p>To keep voting out of fear all this talk about the "lack of a viable" alternative is basically putting all your political eggs in one basket. If the ruling party falls, then it's GG Singapore. Political and intellectual inbreeding is never a good thing, unless you want to replicate China's "great leap forward" or the "cultural revolution". And unlike China we have no population or space to bleed out such mistakes.</p>
              <p>Quite simply it's not about voting the Opposition in to take over, that will not happen for a while, but quite simply to give them more support that they might have a fighting chance in a GRC. Winning a GRC will be a true litmus test of if Singapore can have a viable and vibrant political system, as opposed to what we are having now.</p>
              <p>In the long run it's also better for the PAP. The original PAP, the one that grew up in the roots of much turmoil and opposition was vibrant and strong and had a group of people who believed in what they were doing... nowadays I am not so sure about the people who are winged in without any difficulty, high up in their ivory towers and never really experienced any true difficulties before making policies from afar.</p>
