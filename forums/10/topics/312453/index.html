              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This was the comments from one HDB resident:</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I read with interest recent complaints about HDB carparks. Let me narrate an encounter with an officer from HDB regarding a request to reserve car parks for residents. I stay at Serangoon North Ave 1 and I almost always have problem finding a parking lot near my block during 'peak' hours of after work. I usually end up having to park a distance away from my block. I have requested my HDB area office officer-in-charge to consider converting half of the parking lots at my block for residents' use only, if not for the whole day then at least from 6 pm. However his response was that the general public is entitled to use the car park.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree with his view, however I requested him to consider the needs of residents who use the parking lots on a daily basis and the proximity of parking their cars nearer to their block is extremely useful during bad weather or when they have bags of groceries etc. He responded with a 'hmmm", followed a "No" and then he hung up. My email request for an appeal by his supervisor was met with silence as I have not received any response from HDB. I surmise from the above encounter, the officer is just there to do his job, which is to look after HDB's affairs. I do not fault the officer for not being helpful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is clear to me that my problem is not his problem as his key performance indicator appears to be to take care of HDB's property and not to serve and satisfy the residents' requests. After all that, I come to realise I should not expect much from HDB.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am but one of the masses and unless I am exceptional (in which I probably will not be residing in a HDB flat) I should not be expecting anyone to pay attention to my needs.</p>

              <p>After all the issues with rising costs of flats and their lack of availability plaguing the system, Ms Maya Lim is correct to believe that nothing will come from her email request.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are talking about a government agency which to this day has not yet given a response to the previous open question of discounted flats as opposed to HDB's claim that flats sold are at a subsidy to the people.</p>

              <p>For post 2...the issue would more be towards the service level provided by the town council rather than the season parking issue per se...cos I have personally encountered some very helpful town council ppl who helped me with season parking issues.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yes the law of nature will apply...it would be pretty naive for the IMM management not to realise that before they implemented free parking....likewise for Jurong Point now...parking at its free carpark is quite horrible....packed like sardines...ppl anyhow park...etc...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>At our estate there are four MSC. Each MSC serving a batch of blocks.  The one at my block always fill up fast because it is the first MSC as they enter the estate. Those living a little further inside would rather park there and walk to their block than drive on and park at the MSC near their block. The season parking at our estate entitles one to park any of the four MSC. This creates an unbalanced demand for (prime) space at the first MSC. There is sufficient space, but late comers would have to drive to higher levels to park. This irritates residents living just next to that MSC.</p></div>
