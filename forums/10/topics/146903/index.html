If we do, then we must say categorically, without qualification, that no restraint from any democratic process, other than by ordinary law of the land, should be allowed. <strong>If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally</strong>. If you believe that men should be free, then they should have <strong>the right of free association, of free speech, of free publication. Then no law should permit those democratic processes to be set at naught</strong>. . .Â” </span> </span><br><br>In our 40th Birthday, despite these 'Freedom' being enshrined in the Singapore Constitution, there are newer legislations passed by the Ruling Party - during their long period of grip on power - in which amendments to the Constitution now make it illegal to gather in public in groups of more then 5 persons, publication licenses are subject to Government a.k.a Ruling Party's review and consideration, if you are labeled as a Communist (even if no evidence is produced) your freedom to associate and political freedom as a Human is strictly and severely restricted.<br><br>In a subsequent speech made by LKY, when Singapore was part of the Malaysian federation, Lee articulated his feelings about <strong><span style="color: red;">freedom of the press and media</span></strong>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">Â”Let us get down to fundamentals. <strong>Is this an open or a closed society?</strong> Is it a society where men can preach ideasÂ—the novel, unorthodox, heresies. . . where there is a constant contest for menÂ’s hearts and minds on the basis of what is right, of what is just, or what is in the national interest? <strong>Or is it a closed society where the mass mediaÂ—the newspapers, journals, publications, TV, radio. . . feed menÂ’s minds with a constant drone of sycophantic support for a particular orthodox philosophy?</strong> Â”</span></span><br><br>How ironical that MM LKY could demand - from the Malaysian Federal Government - such liberties to be exercised when Singapore was part of Malaysia, and now with INDEPENDENCE for the last 40 years, our mass media is shackled and tightly controlled by the political machinery created by LKY.<br><br>With 40 years of Pragmatic rule based on Meritocracy, it is unfortunate that Fairness and Transparency have been lost - as these last two principles are less pragmatic and do not merit any consideration as it undermines the first principle.<br><br>Do you get it ?<br><br>It explains the reason for the Ruling Party a.k.a the present Singapore Government has been less keen about being totally transparent with its policies, and fair about its practises.<br><br></div>

Whatever evidence quoted here, how can you be sure the forumites are not lying? The same applies to what you learnt in school and read on the newspaper. You are never sure.<br><br>Best is to see with your own eyes whether your parents, siblings, relatives, friends, even strangers on the mrt and buses, are smiling more as time passes by.<br><br>Feel with your pocket, how much money are you getting now. Is it getting more or losing more?<br><br>Feel with your heart, esp if you just went to watch the national day fireworks. Did you watch the fire work because you are KS or is it because you sincerely are thinking of celebrating with the nation and scream your heart out that you love Singapore?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Only after NS did i realise what i learn in pri. and sec school were all brainwash. The education system could be made to make u dumb. It doesnt encourage creativity or critical thinking. But all is not lost yet. What they tried to do could be all undone in NS where u become disillusioned. I say NS is good in this aspect. The whole plan backfires<br><br>It is only now that they are adopting a western styled education system when they knew they had a creativity drain with their style of fkced up education system. If u seen in other countries, children are made to learn creatively and not just memorising facts and figures.<br><br>But all is not lost because of the internet where u get to read thngs from other countries. Times have changed. it is no longer our  parents' time where "I say , u do" kind of thing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's keep a open mind on the subject of education.<br><br>Certainly, any other country in the world will 'brainwash' their children about the glorious history befitting national education. Our social studies taught us about the founding of Modern Singapore and our heritage. However, it neglected to mention the Trashy work William Farquhar was given and prefered to heap praise on Raffles despite having minimal knowledge or administration. (In fact he pretty much screwed up the early stages of government)<br><br>This is something only age will educate, the knowledge you gain from your early years is just basic background with a warped sense of information.<br><br></div>

You do have an enquiring mind and do not accept what you are told without questioning.<br><br>Keep reading, and read from various sources and with an open mind. As we don't live in a black and white world no one view is absolutely accurate. Also, if we are open to multiple viewpoints we could make more intelligent choices and become more creative in problem-solving.</div>
