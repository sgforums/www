              <p>Seriously, they have far more generous deductions compared to Singapore and they have better social benefits compared to Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In US, UK and Nordic countries, money is tax from the rich belonging to the higher tax brackets to redistribute amongst the poor, at least there is some form of social justice. In Singapore, it is never the case, the poor are left to survive on their own while the rich gets richer.</p>

              <p>Governments use different kinds of taxes and vary the tax rates. This is done to distribute the tax burden among individuals or classes of the population involved in taxable activities, such as <a title="Business" href="/wiki/Business"><span style="color: #0645ad;">business</span></a>, or to <strong>redistribute resources between individuals or classes in the population</strong>. Historically, the <a title="Nobility" href="/wiki/Nobility"><span style="color: #0645ad;">nobility</span></a> were supported by taxes on the poor; modern <a title="Social security" href="/wiki/Social_security"><span style="color: #0645ad;">social security</span></a> systems are intended to support the poor, the disabled, or the retired by taxes on those who are still working.
