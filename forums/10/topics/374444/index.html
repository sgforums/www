              <p>============================================</p>
              <p>Ong Eng Guan was the mayor of Singapore. He was also in charged of housing the masses. He wanted to build HDB flats in the Istana where the British governor used to live to prove Singapore's independence from ther Brits.</p>
              <p>He nearly became Singapore's Prime Minister when the PAP voted amongst themselves who should be PM. The vote was Lee Kuan Yew 6 votes, Ong Eng Guan 6 votes</p>
              <p>Toh Chin Chye being party chairman cast the vote to LKY. If he voted for Ong, them there will be no LKY as Prime minister</p>
              <p><img src="http://app1-stg.mica.gov.sg/Data/0/19980001960img0015.jpg" alt="" width="637" height="512"></p>
              <p>Ong Eng Guan is second from left. Lee Kuan yew is at extreme right.</p>
              <p>By one vote, we lost having Ong Eng Guan as PM but got stuck with LKY instead.</p>

              <p>For a moment, I thought that the book was not selling well, and need a boost of controversy so as to get sales numbers flying.</p>
              <p>Then again, surely LKY would have read the book before agreeing to endorse it.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times had reported on Saturday's edition that the comments were said to be from both Dr Toh Chin Chye and Mr Ong Pang Boon.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, nothing was said if the comments were printed inside the covers of the book as part of the recorded history, or were their comments given after reading the book and then informing the error in factual details to the 3 stooges writing this book ?</p>

              <p><br>what is there to read about if you all already know that it is a state media? the purpose is clear, stay out of thing you dun like, it will only cloud your imagination and query further, of course you can go on and comment on it, but to me, me only hor, it sound so absurd that when one said that it is a state media, full of Propaganda and yet go on reading it. Naturally, you sure to have full of comments and critics over it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If i think of eating ice cream, i really go and buy it, just my expression, and hope that you guys too will move away from the situation for a while and enjoy a tea or ice cream yourself, just like teabreak. If you find it stupidity, sorry, that is my trademarks, same, i find you very stupidity too, argueing and posting length words for a wrong cause, so may i ask you, what is your objective of coming here, if you think you can change or psycho some peoples into your kind of thot and thereby changed the political landscape of singapore, i think it must be a joke of the century. But that is your trademark, everyone of us got a unique trademark of ourselves, LHL will speaks in a way, LKY will speaks in a way, you will speaks in a way, so do i, just that peoples like to listen to them is not going to say that they are good, but because they got the skill and more importantly the power behind them, so whatever they said, carry weight, whatever you and me said here, is nothing ya.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if you count the people here, especially the young gal like me, i guess there is only 1 or 2, and the not so young like you, maybe about the most, only 20 of them arugeing over the govt policies and taking side. How then is opposition going to win with 20 of them here? given that all oppose the PAP. So, be realistic</p>
