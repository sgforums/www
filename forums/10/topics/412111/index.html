              <p>Do you think TR is trying to incite disunity within the country? They
                  will spin stories without looking at the actual content and to the
                  point that it is out of context? Why the government did not do anything
                  to stop them?<br> <br> An example would be the below article by TR. They took a few sentences
                  from 2 different interviews, disregarded the context of why the issue
                  was discussed and put it together. They spin it to indicate as if
                  Malays are not regarded as part of the country. This would cause a lot
                  of unhappiness amongst the Malay.<br> <br> This is irresponsible news reporting.</p>

              <p>Lee Kuan Yew: We are largely Chinese and Indians<br> September 29th, 2010 | Author: Your Correspondent<br> <br> In a sign that age is catching up on him, PAP strongman Lee Kuan Yew
                  made an unusual gaffe when he appeared to forget about the existence of
                  the Malay community in Singapore in a remark made at the
                  Russia-Singapore Business Forum yesterday.<br> <br> Speaking in response to a question on Russia’s growth over the next
                  decade, Lee claimed that Russia’s challenge was to develop its own
                  entrepreneurs like Singapore.<br> <br> He then shocked the audience with a comment which is completely off tangent:<br> <br> “<strong><span style="color: red;">We’re trying to do that. But we are
                  hampered by culture. We’re largely Chinese and Indians. And both
                  Chinese and Indians, the best go into government, (they) don’t go into
                  enterprise</span></strong>.”<br> <br> Singapore is not just largely Chinese and Indians. Ethnic Malays form
                  about 15 percent of Singapore’s population though it has decreased
                  slightly in recent years due to the relentless influx of immigrants
                  from China and India with the result that Indians now form 9 percent of
                  Singapore’s popuation, up from 7 percent 10 years ago.<br> <br> This is not the first time that Lee has made a controversial remark about the ethnic minorities in Singapore.<br> <br> In an interview with National Geographic magazine this year, he said:<br> <br> “<span style="color: red;"><strong>Well, we make them say the national pledge
                  and sing the national anthem but suppose we have a famine, will your
                  Malay neighbour give you the last few grains of rice or will she share
                  it with her family or fellow Muslim or vice versa?</strong></span>”.<br> <br> He also added that it is a “good thing” that Singapore is accepting so
                  many Chinese immigrants (from mainland China) as they are more
                  “hard-striving” and “hard-driving” than locals.<br> <br> At 87 years of age, Lee is probably the oldest living minister and MP
                  in the world. Though he admitted himself he is not doing much work
                  lately except “forecasting”, he is paid more than $3 million dollars a
                  year by Singapore taxpayers.<br> <br> Lee has been dropping subtle hints in the media lately that he is not
                  quite ready to retire in the next general election, leaving
                  Singaporeans with little choice but to continue to put up with his
                  freudian slips in the near future.<br> <br> <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/09/29/lee-kuan-yew-we-are-largely-chinese-and-indians/">http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/09...e-and-indians/</a></p>

              <p>Challenge for Singapore is to grow pool of entrepreneurs: MM Lee<br> by Hoe Yeen Nie<br> 05:55 AM Sep 29, 2010<br> SINGAPORE - The challenge for Singapore and Russia is to grow their pool of entrepreneurs, said Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.<br> <br> "We're trying to do that. But we are hampered by culture. We're largely
                  Chinese and Indians. And both Chinese and Indians, the best go into
                  Government, don't go into enterprise," said Mr Lee at a dialogue
                  organised by the Russia-Singapore Business Forum yesterday evening.<br> <br> "The economy can be structured to allow enterprise but enterprise
                  itself must be done by entrepreneurs - people who say: 'Ah yes, I will
                  make that into a money-making venture'."<br> <br> MM Lee arrived for the dialogue about an hour late as he had gone for a check-up.<br> <br> Moderator Michael Tay, executive director of the Russia-Singapore
                  Business Forum Organising Council, explained that Mr Lee had suffered a
                  fall the day before.<br> <br> Mr Lee looked well and he took questions from the floor.<br> <br> When asked about his most important lesson as a leader of Singapore, Mr
                  Lee said for Singapore to work, the system must be kept incorruptible,
                  meritocratic and efficient. It was these traits, he added, that moved
                  the country from being a purely Asian one in the two, three decades
                  after independence, to an increasingly cosmopolitan one.<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">The hour-long session also saw questions on
                  Sino-Japan relations, as well as the future growth of countries like
                  Brazil, China, India and Russia.</span></strong><br> <br> There were some lighter moments too.<br> <br> "MM, are you happy?" Mr Tay asked.<br> <br> "Sometimes, not all the time. A person who's happy all the time, I
                  think won't make much progress," Mr Lee replied, to laughter from the
                  audience.<br> <br> The annual forum marks growing economic ties between Russia and Singapore.<br> <br> Political relations are getting warmer too.<br> <br> Yesterday afternoon, the Russian Deputy Chairman Sergey Sobyanin met Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the Istana.<br> <br> Mr Sobyanin is in Singapore for the inaugural meeting of the
                  Russia-Singapore Inter-Governmental Commission, a high-level grouping
                  whose objective is to foster bilateral trade and investment.<br> <br> Mr Sobyanin co-chairs the commission with Senior Minister Goh Chok
                  Tong. The next meeting will take place in Moscow next year. HOE YEEN NIE<br> <br> <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC100929-0000099/Challenge-for-Singapore-is-to-grow-pool-of-entrepreneurs--MM-Lee">http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore...eneurs--MM-Lee</a></p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Q: “So when, don’t take this the wrong way, but when you decided to
                  close the Chinese stream education and the college, what was the
                  rationale behind that and do you ever regret doing that?”<br> <br> Mr Lee: “No, I regret not doing it faster because politically, if
                  there’d been a violent electoral protest in the next elections because
                  they’re so wedded to the idea that language means, culture means, life
                  means everything. But I’m a pragmatist and you can’t make a living with
                  the Chinese language in Singapore. The first duty of the government is
                  to be able to feed its people, to feed its people in a little island.
                  There’s no hinterland and no farming, you have got to trade and you
                  have got to do something to get people buy your goods or services or
                  get people to come here and manufacture themselves, export, ready-made
                  markets and multinationals which I stumbled on when I went to Harvard
                  for a term in 1968 and I said oh, this could solve my unemployment
                  problem. So we brought the semiconductors factories here and one
                  started, the whole herd came and we became a vast centre for production
                  of computers and computer peripherals. But they all speak English,
                  multinationals from Japan, Europe, whatever European country they come
                  from, they speak English. So Chinese-educated were losing out and they
                  were disgruntled because they got the poorer jobs and lesser pay. So
                  eventually our own Members of Parliament were Chinese-educated and
                  graduates from the Chinese university said okay, we have got do
                  something. We’re ruining these people’s careers. By that time, the
                  university was also losing its good students and getting bum students.
                  Because they took in poor students, they graduated them on lower marks
                  and so the degree became valueless. So when you apply for a job with a
                  Chinese university degree, you hide your degree and produce your school
                  certificate. So I tried to change it from within, the Education
                  Minister was Chinese-educated and English-educated to convert it from
                  within because most of the teachers have American PhDs. So they did
                  their thesis in English but they’ve forgotten their English as they’ve
                  been teaching in Chinese, so it couldn’t be done. So I merged them with
                  the English speaking university. Great unhappiness and dislocation for
                  the first few years but when they graduated, we put it to them do you
                  want your old university degree or you want English university degree?
                  All opted for the English university degree. That settled it.”<br> <br> Q:  “In recent events as China begins to ascend, I mean, would you?”<br> <br> Mr Lee: “No, no. It makes no difference. We are not going to tie
                  ourselves to China to the extent it makes us hostage. I mean, we have
                  many investments there because the older generation are
                  Chinese-educated, they feel comfortable but the younger generation,
                  they have enough Chinese who want to go there and do business and they
                  can ramp it up if you want because once you are able to listen and
                  speak and read without writing, you can pick it up. And not everybody
                  wants to go there and we’ve been offering scholarships to their top
                  universities, Beijing, Qinghua, Hudan, very few takers. They say nah, I
                  want to go to America or Britain because they know they’re coming back
                  here and competing in English.”<br> <br> Q: “Do you think that, I mean, one question I wanted to ask you was
                  building a country from scratch is obviously an enormous achievement,
                  accomplishment.”<br> <br> Mr lee:  “No, it’s not a nation. It’s a society in transition. You need a few hundred years to build a nation.”<br> <br> Q:  “Oh really?”<br> <br> Mr Lee:  “Yes.”<br> <br> Q:  “You have a lot of countries running around claiming they’re nations. You don’t think they really are nations?”<br> <br> Mr Lee:  “<span style="color: red;"><strong>Well, we make them say the
                  national pledge and sing the national anthem but suppose we have a
                  famine, will your Malay neighbour give you the last few grains of rice
                  or will she share it with her family or fellow Muslim or vice versa?</strong></span>”<br> <br> Q:  “Depends on the person, doesn’t it? No, it doesn’t?”<br> <br> Mr Lee:  “No, I think there comes a time, I read a book by Edward Wilson who was Harvard.”<br> <br> Q:  “I know who he is.”<br> <br> Mr Lee:  “And he wrote about human beings.”<br> <br> Q:  “Actual past ones.”<br> <br> Mr Lee: “And he described the Maoris. So when two tribes were fighting,
                  the third tribe will come and see which tribe is more our side, more
                  genes like us and they joined that side. So it’s an instinct. Can you
                  overcome that instinct? Edward Wilson says culture can overcome because
                  he’s American, he knows a mix of Europeans and others. But it takes
                  many, many years. Yes, they all do the military service, equal
                  treatment, equal pay, equal hardship, job opportunities but we live in
                  concentric circles. Cross marriages, yes a few, usually the parents are
                  most unhappy. Then where do you belong, the children of the cross
                  marriages? Sometimes they get reabsorbed in their father ethnic group
                  and they carry the father’s surname. Sometimes, if you become a Muslim
                  then whether you’re male or female, you join the other side. But it has
                  happened to the margins more and more. But I think the instinct, the
                  human instinct is still there. I mean, it’s in America.”<br> <br> Q: “I live in New York which is similar to Singapore in a way.”<br> <br> Mr Lee: “No, I mean, I used to talk to an Indian. He was the
                  administrator of Agra and we were driving back to Delhi. This was in
                  the late 1970s. So he was telling me he was writing a thesis on
                  Shakespeare, a highly-educated man. At that time, English-educated,
                  that generation. So I said, supposing I pretend as a caste, supposing I
                  pretend I’m a Brahmin, high caste and I invite you to dinner, he said
                  yeah I’ll come. You give me a good dinner, I’ll come. Now supposing I
                  want to marry your daughter? He says that’s different. The most
                  thorough inquiries will be made. So I said supposing I tell you I came
                  from Calcutta and how you’re going to find me. He says no, you’ve got
                  to live somewhere in Calcutta, you must have your family, your
                  neighbours, your friends in Calcutta, we’ll find out. Then we’ll know
                  what caste you belong to.”<br> <br> Q:  “So as long as you have enough human trail people will figure out who you are.”<br> <br> Mr Lee: “Yes, and in Japan, they do it a different way. They exclude
                  the Chinese and the Koreans who have been there for generations.
                  They’re still not Japanese citizens. Some had become since the West
                  started criticizing them because you may have a Japanese name and you
                  speak perfect Japanese, but for promotions, where is your home village?
                  Never mind, I come from Tokyo, Osaka or Kobe. No where is your home
                  domicile and they will trace you there.”<br> <br> Q: “So what you’re saying now is this somewhat contradictory to the
                  programme that you have here where you have the quotas? It’s really
                  human nature, the people hang out with their own kind. Can you
                  legislate that? Can you do anything about that?”<br> <br> <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/12/mm-lees-interview-with-natgeo-transcript/">http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/12/...eo-transcript/</a> (See here for the full transcript to understand why this was mentioned)</p>

              <p>During the Russia - Singapore forum, they were talking about the potiental of Indian and China market. So of course, MM only mentioned these 2.</p>

              <p>Don't spread such stuff online.</p>
              <p>It will lead to people being afraid to criticise PAP and Lee Kuan Yew.</p>

              <p>This article has described in detail the character of Lee Kuan Yew's racial views </p>
              <p>substantially using his own words as evidence. After a lifetime of being circumspect </p>
              <p>on the question of race,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Lee has finally spoken openly, revealing himself as </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">doctrinaire racist.</span></span></strong> Yet it would be a mistake to condemn Lee as a hard line racist in </p>
              <p>every sense of the word. Such a characterisation of his views would be a distortion of </p>
              <p>both his logic and his natural disposition. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">There can be no doubt that Lee is a racist in </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the sense that he believes that some races and some ethnically-based cultures are </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">inherently superior to others. </span></span></strong>His <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">own words leave no doubt about this assertion, </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>though it should be recognised that this in itself hardly makes him remarkable in Asia. </p>
              <p>He is<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> also a racist </span></span></strong>in the sense that he has integrated his racial views into his political </p>
              <p>agenda and he has created a regime which accentuates racial categorisation.</p>
