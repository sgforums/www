              <p>To be honest, I like the anglicized Singapore. I don't want to be living in Kampungs without Internet Access.

              <p>Singapore's done well so far, especially economically, so let all the restrictions stay. Look at Hong Kong, so many people disagreeing with everything, even ERP cannot be implemented, which is a proven way to reduce congestion in the CBD. I can vouch for that.</p>
              <p>And wasn't MM Lee detained by the Kempatai and was going to be executed at Changi Beach or something but he escaped? He didn't help the Japanese in any way, and why would he?</p>

              <p>Why is T.R the one who is inciting hatred in Singapore? Isnt it LKY himself who said all this and Tr is merely quoting him... He is the leader of Sg and he ought to be more tackful when he speaks. The general public(whom pays his salary) should know what he says $3MILLION we pay him...The goverment works for us not the other way round.</p>

To being saying this, Your are either a small kid who doesnt know shit about politics or you are just a stupid nigger who has been brainwash by reading too much local newspaper and watching the news.</p>
              <p>Singapore founding father will always be Sir stamford Raffles not LKY..</p>

              <p>Go to Changi beach at 2am and see the amount of homeless people there. I live 15mins drive from there, so changi village is my everyday hang out place.

              <p>There are so many homeless people now in Singapore whom are living in poverty. Open your eyes and take a look around. Look at all the old people selling tissue paper and the people living under void decks. Stop and think... Why this is so....</p>
              <p>Dont think that there is no such thing like this in Singapore. If your eyes are blind or you have been told that there is no such thing like this in Singapore, You are either ignorant or just dont care enough or maybe you are just a young school going kid.</p>
              <p>There was also a video made recently by Al jazeera English about the homeless in Singapore, Which didnt sit well with our PAP.
