            <div class='col-md body'>How many magnanimous world leader really change the behaviours of their people to forgive and forget after a major war or conflicts?<br><br>The Japanese vowed  not to go to war again eventhough there were no apology for its second world war atrocities. There were more innocent people died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the atomic bomb attack.<br><br>More innocent people were slaughtered in the name of democracy in the Korean Peninsula, in Vietnam, in Germany.....<br><br>And even more in the war of aggression, such as the Kuwait-Iraq war......<br><br>Yet there were more innocent people sacrified in the war of vengeances in Israel-Palestine conflicts, in the Kosova Conflicts, in Indonesia, in Sri Lanka......<br><br>Looking back to history, if there was no vengeance, the conflict might just end there like that of the second world war.<br><br>Is the word "VENGEANCE" greatly emphasized in the modern version of the Bible, Quran or other religious literatures? Are the modern day Christians or Muslims gathered their strength in Churches or Mosques to take revenge to kill the innocent people????</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So touchy..<br><br>The examples are the posts above you...those wars that are fought in the name of democracy. Those people who fought for democracy are 'freedom-fighters'. Its a fight for freedom for them but a terror for the other party.<br><br>According to your wise definition of freedom-fighters, the 'terrorists' in the Middle East can be considered a freedom-fighter since they are fighting for independence against Israeli and US oppresion but they are considered terrorists in Israel. Get it now?<br><br>As for my lack of knowledge:<br>Adding to the above examples..<br>ETA in Spain and there's those in Northern Ireland. Plus some people thought Milosevic was a freedom fighter.<br><br>I'm not saying that I support these groups. In fact, I dun since they resort to violence. I'd just like to point out that theres really very little difference between them. Like what ex-president Ronald Reagan said: one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bla bla... watever.<br><br>People like you only serve to smudge the fine line between freedom fighters and terrorists.<br><br>As of now, I state clearly, my view of freedom fighters and terrorists stand from the view of an international community.  To a pro-IRA irish, IRA maybe freedom fighters.  BUT to people like me, I consider them to be terrorists worthy to be exterminated like the roaches they are.  The use of Bombs, traps and shootings against innoncent civillians have condemned their cause.<br><br>I do not consider Palestinians as terrorists, as it would be as wrong as calling all arabs terrorists.  They do have armed groups, that have carried out terrorist attacks against Israel.  I consider the situation between the Palestinians and Israel to be deadlock and VERY fuckin irritating.  But when you think about it another way, its just nature.  The 2 can never co-exist generally.  Just like cats and dogs.  They fight whenever they can.<br><br>Milosevic a freedom fighteR?  He couldn't even free willy if he wanted to.  What he did was oppress ethnic Albanians, and in recent cases slaughtering them.  According to the United Nations, its called a CRIME AGAINST humanity.<br><br>If you really want an example of a freedom fighter, I will name you one.  Robin Hood. Fairy tale or did he ever exist, he sets the example of a Freedom Fighter.  He slew no innoncent, and fought oppressive soldiers.  He gave money to the poor.<br><br>Osama Bin Laden, hmm lets see.  WTC bombing of 1993, killed 6, injuring thousands. OOPS, no Robin Hood there.  Bombed US embassies in kenya and tanzania, aww dammed.  Bombed USS cole, okay from a "freedom fighter" point of view, he just ripped off a few "imperialist" guards.  And of course, now he's implicated with this tragic incident.  Is he a freedom fighter?<br><br>My point, there used to be a clear line between freedom fighters and "terrorists" or watever it could have been called.  The lines have only been smudged by the terrorists themselves as well as people  *ahem* who claim these terrorists to be freedom fighters.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not saying that terrorists are good as they can be freedom fighters. I'm saying that they are both the same and are both equally bad. You might not view for example Milosevic as freedom fighter but some other people do. The reason why? Who cares? Thats not my point. My point is there is no clear line between freedom fighters and terrorists.<br>I already pointed out why he is considered a freedom fighter according to YOUR own definition. So why are you arguing? You never even specify what differentiates a freedom-fighter and a terrorists. They both fought for a cause they believe, resort to violence and take the law into their own hands. So I ask you now..what is the difference?<br><br>As for Robin Hood, he's not even a real character in a real world. We're discussing reality here. Anyway to me, stealing from the rich and giving it to the poor is morally wrong. Reminds me of the tragic event of the poor Indonesians stealing from the rich Indonesian Chinese.<br><br></div>

BUT THERE IS LINE BETWEEN freedom fighters and terrorist...<br><br>Freedom fighters like the chinese communist fighting the KMT in CHINA during its civil war, targets ONLY military establishment....<br><br>they NEVER NEVER take civilian life indiscriminantly and with so little respect for the sanctity of human life......<br><br>Terrorist on the other hand.... primarily targets enemy CIVILIANS while at the same time, avoiding the enemy's military establishment..... they have taken many civilian lifes with not a care over the innocence of those towards their cause ..<br><br>In fact.... terrorism targets defenceless civilians caught in a situation where they can neither defend themselves nor escape...<br><br>Terrorist kills even yound childrens and infants intentionally.... to achieve the aim of striking fear... freedom fighters dont do that...<br><br>Another difference is that:<br><br>Freedom fighters.... always avoid hitting civilians as such killings will weaken their cause within their own country....  so their actions is usually in house.... they do not normally carry out attacks beyond the borders of the land they wish to free...<br><br>Terrorist on the other hand.... usually hits beyond its border against another state.... and in the case of the muslim extremist.... IF you happened to be born an american or jews....... YOU DESERVE TO BE KILLED... irrespective of your innocence or political affliation, or profession.<br><br>lastly..... muslim extremist dont fight for freedom.... they are already free in their islamic state or land..... they are fighting in the name of their ALLAH... they call it a holy war... a war based on religion....<br><br>MANY muslims... of cause deny the legitimacy of the holy war.... but that is not so in the minds of the terrorist, talibans and many other supporters of OSAMA....<br><br>in the eyes of OSAMA... GOD is just a tool for him to exploit... the use of religion helps to galvanise support for him.... since god isnt gonna appear and challenge OSAMA's claim.... and as far as OSAMA sees... HE is GOD... with the power and the right to declare jihad and takes the lives of many people whom GOD has created....<br><br>GOD never forgets anyone... he created and give life to every living things on the earth... rest assure... GOD will see him pay dearly for his crimes.... OSAMA can lie to his followers .... but does he think he can fool GOD as well??</div>

True, the attack on New York does not deserve to go unpunished. True, suicide bombers in an Israeli marketplace are also horrendous acts...but equally bad is the deportation of tens of thousands of Palestinians from their native homes, the murder of scores of Muslim youths in Palestine and Jerusalem.

He said, "Yes." I said, 'Will there be any good after that evil?" He replied, "Yes, but it will be tainted (not pure.)'' I asked, "What will be its taint?" He replied, "(There will be) some people who will guide others not according to my tradition? You will approve of some of their deeds and disapprove of some others." I asked, "Will there be any evil after that good?" He replied, "Yes, (there will be) some people calling at the gates of the (Hell) Fire, and whoever will respond to their call, will be thrown by them into the (Hell) Fire." I said, "O Allah s Apostle! Will you describe them to us?" He said, &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;"They will be from our own people and will speak our language."&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I said, "What do you order me to do if such a state should take place in my life?" He said, "Stick to the group of Muslims and their Imam (ruler)." I said, "If there is neither a group of Muslims nor an Imam (ruler)?"

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi tripwire,<br><br>I don't know whether you are aware of what you quoted in the above text. But if you would indulge me a little.<br><br>The Islamic religion derives its teachings from 2 sources. One is from the Holy Quran, which is what Muslims believe is directly inspired by God. And the other is from the hadiths, which when translated means: "traditions of the prophet".<br><br>In the hadiths, the prophet's acts and his sayings are recorded down.<br><br>You quoted a hadith that was reported by Hudhaifa bin al-Yaman. He was one of Muhammad's companions. From the quote above, it is quite easy to say that no matter what crimes Osama comitted, Muslims should stick together.<br><br>I have to point out an omission however. The hadith does not only comprise of Hudhaifa bin al-Yaman's words. To reiterate, I would have to reproduce the whole hadith:<br><br>Hudhaifa bin al-Yaman narrated: "The Prophet said, 'there will be after me leaders who do not follow my guidance and do not follow my sunna, and there will be among them men whose hearts are like those of satan in the body of a human being.' And I asked the Prophet, 'What I should do at that time if I reach it?' He said, 'listen and obey the ruler, even if he lashed your back and took your money, listen and obey.'"<br><br>The hadith continues with this narration from Auf bin Malik: "O Prophet of Allah, do you recommend that we fight them (the Muslim wrongdoers)?" He said, "No, don't fight them as long as they do not prevent you from your prayers. And if you see from them something that you dislike, dislike their acts, do not dislike them. And do not take your hand out from obedience to them."<br><br>And the hadith continues with Abdullah ibn al-Abbas's narration: "if someone dislikes his ruler, he must be patient, because if he comes against the ruler in a rebellious or destructive manner by only a handspan and dies, he dies in a state of pre-Islamic ignorance (jahiliyyah) and sin."<br><br>These source texts are clear evidence that whoever lives under a particular government must obey the ruler and live peacefully. They are prohibited from taking up arms against him. Uprising or violence by any group against the ruler is completely rejected in Islam, and was prohibited by the Prophet. Thus Islam considers rebellion against the ruler a great iniquity. These hadith affirm that one must be patient with one's ruler, even if he commits oppression. It must be understood however that these hadith refer to the LEADER of a nation, not the leader of a small group (like Osama). Therefore groups that take up violent struggle against their regimes are prohibited in Islam and are by default illegal and blameworthy.<br><br>This is because Islam is a religion of peace as stated in the Quran:<br><br>"Religion with God means a committment to live in peace." (Holy Quran 3:19)<br><br>Peace in all forms must always be perpetuated by Muslims, uprisings and rebellion is distasteful to Islam because it promotes chaos and anarchy and may result in the persecution of specific minorities like what happened in East Timor where Christians were massacred by Muslim rebels, and in Ambon where the Chinese minority was driven out of the island.<br><br>Even David Kimche, the former president of the Israel Council for Foreign Relations said:<br><br>"We have to live in peace together with Islam. Islam is a religion of peace-absolutely no question about it."<br><br>The Quran constantly exhorts Muslims to mainatin peace and never initiate hostilities:<br><br>"Fight those who fight against you along God's way, yet do not initiate hostilities; God does not love aggressors." (Holy Quran 2:190)<br><br>"If they stop, let there be no more hostility except towards wrongdoers." (Holy Quran 2:193)<br><br>So as I mentioned in my earlier threads, Osama has gone against every grain of the Islamic faith. His actions does not represent the views of the whole community. I don't think that Islam will be the fastest growing religion in the U.S today if it really promoted so much hostility, hatred and bigotry. Hehe, maybe all the new converts were brainwashed or something... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hope I clarified for you some doubts.<br><br>[This message has been edited by salivateforme (edited 21 September 2001).]</div>
