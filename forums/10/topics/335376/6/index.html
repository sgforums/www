              <p>i don't think the gambler cares about the casinos rental or whatever... they care about better odds, and high entry cost. casino is definitely a high end place for entertainment,for people with money to burn</p>

              <p>You are right. Gambler don't cares about the casino rental or whatever. Why should they, right? <br><br>While illegal gaming has bigger prize money, the chance of seeing the money confiscated by the authority and being fined by the authority are also there. Hardcore gamblers would have encountered this type of situation before.<br><br>There is such thing as higher odds, lower prize and lower odds, higher prize. Else, all gambling operator will has to close shop.</p>

              <p>its bad for me but i actually know of a couple who used to open a food stall, they didn't like it cos it took up too much of their time no off days or money to accompany their children. for some skewed reason they took up gambling as a job, just go casino or cruise to gamble only. and right now they're actually better off since they "earn" more from this "job" and there's more time to spend with children also.</p>

              <p><br>Just look at how much money those investors poured in..billions n billions..and imagine to recover back the principle including high interest, it will takes years of cheating and exploiting people just to break even before profits start to pour in. And the question now is, how are they going to break even with the state of economy on the downhill.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The problem with our Govt is the elite mentality, everything singapore do must be good and the best, top class. Failure is not acceptable. That is one of the flaw in their governing, and today, they proceed with the IRs which can turn out to be the biggest flop in their implementation that may make heads roll.</p>

              <p><strong>Xtreyier:</strong>  To eradicate gambling is to eradicate (one aspect of) human nature, something that will be impossible if not unnatural.  Thus the only realistic answer is to regulate it, make it safe, &amp; get rid of the more brutal &amp; greedy elements.</p>
              <p>The 1st sentence sounds rational, logical &amp; reasonable but the 2nd sentence is a little complicated for a 'realistic answer' to the problem of gambling in that how do you quantify &amp; qualify the parameters with the right configurations to 'make it safe'.  In other words gambling &amp; its ramifications are bad but what are the ways, means &amp; measures to make it not too bad.</p>

              <p>Young lady, i hate to sound condescending, but it's time to wake up to reality, sadly to be serious and remove your rose color tinted glasses and take a hard closer look at the world and humans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's take the easiest game as a comparison, for it symbolizes what gambling is all about - Big or Small, played since and perhaps even before the great wall of China had been built till today.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are only 2 possible outcomes - big or small with the roll of the dice. You place your money on either one and hope for the best, for you cannot fortell the future. This is gambling.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>YOu study hard,aim to become an engineer, got a degree. You place your efforts and money into engineering courses. There could only be 2 possible outcome. You become an engineer, or the worst you don't get employed if the labour market is poor. Poof! the market collapse. You become a taxi driver instead, as with grads during '97. This is gamble.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You wake up at 8am. Slept a few minutes more, even know you will be late. There can be 2 possible outcomes. You get scolded or you escape scolding if boss not in. This is gamble.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You take the bus. You assume it will come on time. It doesnt.</p>
              <p>You drive a car to meet your clients. The oil meter shows empty. But you think there is enough for you to get there without topping up petrol. This is gamble.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lunchtime. You need to eat. There is a stall that has not many customers. You do not how it taste like. You order. It turn out sucks. You had just gambled. And lost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can go on and on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ultimately, gambling becomes evil when we know it is not possible to predict the outcome, and yet continue to do. This is hardcore. Many attempt to avoid it, but there are only too many unknowns in our daily life, on outcomes of which we can never predict.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Life itself is thus a gamble. Manage all risk as we possibly can. Roll of the dice and once the result is shown, we must live as best as we can with that roll.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's human nature to gamble.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let him who has no sin cast the first stone to kill the sinner. So goes a famous saying.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In order to stop hardcore gambling, first we must acknowledge our own faults, and without hypocrisy, try to help others and prevent them from hardcore gambling, not by using a chopper knife, but by a carving knife, slowly slicing part by part the tumour.</p>

              <p>Even if u order bowl of mee that is not up to yr expection, at least u still got the bowl of mee mah, but in gambling, u place yr bet, if u lose, it gone, if u win, u get paid, if it is a draw, same same.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if u study and failed to land on a job you studied, at least you accumlated the knowledge mah, and at least you got a certificate too, but gambling is different, as per above, win, loose or draw.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Life is not a gamble, u control it, unlike gambling, the banker, rule of the game and luck controlled you.</p>

              <p>If I go to a casino and gamble, I know in the long run I will definitely lose. Because I am playing against the house dealer, and the way the game is designed such that the odds are  always against me.</p>
              <p>For people thinking that they will make money through gambling in the long run, I will say good luck to them.</p>
              <p>In life, I gamble by making different choices. But I do not know whether in those instances, the odds will be always against me. I try to be more optimistic about those chances by making, hopefully, wise decisions. However, I do believe that based on my choices, there will be outcome, so I must be ready to accept the outcome, whether good or bad.</p>

              <p>The media reported that the IR will be opened in stages.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I guess they will open the casinos with its increased number of tables first to try recoup as much money as they can before they open the rest of the attractions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Looks like Singaporeans will be contributing to the growth of the IRs, not tourists. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
