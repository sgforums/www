              jeopardy of missing certain financial covenant requirements and needs
              to raise more capital.</p>
              <p>Shares of Las Vegas Sands plunged $3.63, or 31.1 percent, to $8.03
              in morning trading. Over the past year, the stock has traded between
              $4.32 and $122.96.</p>
              <p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Las Vegas
              Sands said it does not expect to comply with its maximum leverage ratio
              covenant for the fourth quarter which ends on Dec. 31, and potentially
              afterward. If it defaults, lenders would be able to exercise their
              rights under the agreements, including bringing financing maturity
              dates forward.</p>
              <p>The defaults would "raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern," the filing stated.</p>

              <p>Las Vegas Sands is going bankrupt. Simply this means big trouble for the Singaporean casino project. No more 20k jobs for Singaporeans.. Looks like the casino is going to be a bankrupted white elephant. One has to wonder how the multi-million dollar paid government officials managed to choose one of the few casino operators that will go bankrupt by 2009. By right casinos are recession proof businesses and it takes extraordinary management skills to bankrupt it.  I assume the high paying government officials used the same investment picking skills as Temasek and GIC when they bought into the finance sector last year. So why the need to pay high salaries for such poor acumen? It's just the same as paying million dollar salaries to top banking executives to bankrupt the very banks they run..</p>
              <p>But I'm sure the SG government will have to fund the casino construction with taxpayers' money to resume the project. Happy days are here indeed... Let's see how the national media report this in the next few days! </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aws07wpBjjZI&amp;refer=home">http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aws07wpBjjZI&amp;refer=home</a></p>
              <p>Nov. 6 (Bloomberg) -- <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=LVS%3AUS"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Las Vegas Sands Corp.</span></span></a>, billionaire <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Sheldon+Adelson%26%2339%3Bs&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sheldon Adelson's</span></span></a> casino company, fell the most in New York trading since went public after saying it may default on debt and face bankruptcy.</p>
              <p>The casino owner, which had $8.8 billion in long-term debt at the end of June, said in a regulatory filing today that it probably won't meet the requirements of loans arranged by Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. unless it cuts spending on developments, boosts earnings at its Las Vegas Strip casinos and raises more capital.</p>
              <p>The reversal of fortune is a black eye for the 75-year-old Adelson, who was once America's third-richest man on the strength of his Las Vegas Sands holdings. The Las Vegas-based company's dwindling cash flow is threatening $16 billion worth of developments in Macau, China, and Singapore, where Las Vegas Sands is building resorts to cater to wealthy Asian gamblers.</p>
              <p>``They need to raise money,'' said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Keith+Foley&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Keith Foley</span></span></a>, a New York- based analyst at Moody's Investors Service Inc. ``It's getting to the point where they need to do something now.''</p>
              <p>The shares dropped $3.81, or 33 percent, to $7.85 at 4:04 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=LVS%3AUS"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">trading</span></span></a>, the biggest decline since its initial share sale in December 2004. Las Vegas Sands had tumbled 91 percent before today this year as investors dumped the stock, worried that falling casino winnings and the global financial meltdown would leave the company without enough cash.</p>
              <p>More Capital</p>
              <p>Spending declines on the Vegas Strip and restrictions on visas in Macau have stemmed the flow of cash into Las Vegas Sands. Today's admission comes after Adelson, who holds a stake of more than 64 percent, invested an additional $475 million in September to avoid violating the terms of a loan, and hired an unidentified investment bank to raise more capital with his help.</p>
              <p>Las Vegas Sands' rush to raise capital ``points to the deterioration of fundamentals, not just for the company, the fundamentals of Las Vegas,'' said Dennis Farrell, a debt analyst with Wachovia Capital Markets LLC in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
              <p>The casino owner said it doesn't expect to meet a maximum leverage ratio covenant in the fourth quarter. That would trigger defaults that might force it to suspend development projects and ``raise a substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.''</p>
              <p>``Sheldon still has considerable resources, and we doubt he will sit on the sidelines and watch LVS go bankrupt,'' <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Robert%0ALaFleur&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Robert LaFleur</span></span></a> at Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP, said today in a client note he titled ``Scary Post-Halloween 8-K Filing.'' ``The question is how much dry powder does he have, and what can he do?''</p>
              <p>Deep Pockets</p>
              <p>In a July conference call, Adelson suggested he would step in to help the company with any financing it might need, saying a friend described him as ``the tallest person I know when you stand on your wallet.''</p>
              <p>``And I'm saying right now, the company will not have liquidity problems,'' he said at the time.</p>
              <p>Ron Reese, a spokesman for Adelson, didn't return an e-mail seeking an interview.</p>
              <p>Las Vegas Sands made a filing with regulators today to allow it to quickly sell stocks or bonds if it finds investors.</p>
              <p>``The offering shows what their intent is, but it doesn't mean they'll be successful,'' said Foley. ``How and when is uncertain, and their ability to successfully do that is uncertain.''</p>
              <p>Adelson founded the Comdex computer expo in 1979, later selling the business and using the proceeds to build the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas.</p>
              <p>U.S. Projects</p>
              <p>He is also building a $600 million condominium in Vegas and a $600 million casino resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The risk of default applies to some of Sands' U.S. unit loans.</p>
              <p>``It would be prohibitively expensive to raise outside debt capital at this time,'' said Farrell. The company will probably sell more stock, which would hurt existing shareholders including Adelson.</p>
              <p>Other alternatives might be another investment from Adelson, an injection of cash from an outside investor or a loan from foreign banks, said Farrell.</p>
              <p>The filing, which affects its U.S. unit's debt, sparked new concerns that Las Vegas Sands won't finish Singapore's first casino or a 20,000-room complex of hotels and casinos in Macau. The Chinese territory overtook the Vegas Strip as the world's biggest gambling market in 2006.</p>
              <p>`Other Alternatives'</p>
              <p>Should Sands fail to raise capital, ``we would need to immediately suspend portions, if not all, of our ongoing global development projects and consider other alternatives,'' the company said in the filing.</p>
              <p>Las Vegas Sands owns the Venetian and Palazzo casino resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, plus the Macau Venetian, Sands and Four Seasons, and had expected sufficient earnings from the properties to fund its expansion and pay loans.</p>
              <p>Las Vegas Strip casino gambling revenue slid 6.7 percent this year through August, on track for its biggest annual decline on record, as airlines cut back capacity and consumers, battling declining home values, job losses and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, spent less.</p>
              <p>China increased visa restrictions on some mainland residents traveling to Macau, causing casino gambling revenue in the former Portuguese colony to fall to 26 billion patacas ($3.28 billion) in the third quarter from 28.9 billion patacas in the second.</p>
              <p>Adelson plans to sell Sands' Four Seasons apartment hotel in Macau as a co-operative and wants to sell the attached mall space.</p>

              <p>Nice, adding up to one of those major screw ups in the history books of Singapore. I don't know if my future children will read it in their economics textbooks though.</p>
              <p>Singapore Tourism Board have lots of money 1, use Tax Payer's money support the Casino only mah. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>If LVS can default loans from Citigroup, Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs, what is the probability of them defaulting on DBS, OCBC and UOB?</p>

              <p>If STB pump in more money, they also need to pay for loans from other banks right? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Well, unless they reach an agreement that those capital from STB will only refinance the IR loans and construction. My estimate is at least 6.5 Billion will be required.</p>
