              <p>You hit right on the point. Gambling is evil - robber a 100 to benefit 1. <br><br>Some people said that it an unstoppable revenue that it may succeed to help our economy and help curb underground gambling addiction. <br><br>The fact is that it remains to be seen if the IR will spur the growth of underground gambling or help to curb it.</p>

              <p>No one needs to be encouraged to try to get lucky. They will do it themselves on their own free will.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no way underground gambling can be eradicated. But by giving soft and hardcore gamblers a legal avenue to gamble, these people will rather pick the legal one than the illegal ones where gangsters and brutality rule, where conmen gathers to pick on the foolish ones.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We all know gambling is evil. But had there been any real solutions to eradicate it? We all hypocritically denounce it but later quietly queue up to buy a $1 toto ticket.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We start work on a company, free for the 1st 30 days - as we get paid only at the end of the month - that itself is a gamble, that we will be paid but if not, then? We would have gambled away 30 days of our sweat and toil.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We save in banks, and think that we will always be able to access such money, and be assured of intrests. Is this true?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We vote and some try to influence others to vote for the opposition, isnt that gambling too? - a gamble on the opposition that it can turn Singapore into each and everyone's fantasy paradise?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end, you will realize, life is all a gamble. Freedom of choice comes with a price to pay and it is call risk. It's how much you are prepared to lose in order to gain, if ever.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the face of reality, our society can only regulate gambling, so as not to hide from this social evil, but to protect innocent lives by getting rid of the coarser elements, and hopefully, can profit from it and use such profits to educate our next generation on applying 'risk management' than depend on 'a game of chance' to succeed in life.</p>

              <p>And with 7 FW to1 Sg? Better to move such industry to where it is economically viable, isn'it? and retrain the 1 Sg, right? </p>
              <p><em>But if a govt can harbour a self interest attitude for the betterment of the citizens, why not? <br><br></em>Sorry but this is simplisitic view of how a govt function. Which govt does not harbour a self interest attitude for the betterment of the citizens? Your view is not wrong. From logical point of view - yes it is sound but from a function of a democracy point of view and for the long term health of a nation - it is not. <br><br>And I feel that more and more young people have this view - trust and leave everything to the govt. </p>
