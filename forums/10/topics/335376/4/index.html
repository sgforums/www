              <p>I have to agree, see so many foreign workers here with so much problems, most working in heavy industrial. And as an aging population here goes on, which singaporean guys can take such jobs, in time to come, companies of such industrial will move out, even the GLC will do the same.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a student, I had visited India and China and even America for for school exchange programmes, today i see my niece going to more places in China and India, and their student visited our home in Singapore too, I think there is already an understanding btw Singapore, China and India. Today, it certainly helped me when i deal with my Indian and Chinese staffs, clients and suppliers. Such cross cultural mix give me an upper hand against our surrounding neighbours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, at times, i hv to salute to our govt good foresight, you may find is hard to accept the seed in the first place, but when it sow and ripe, you can feel what they implemented was for a good cause.</p>

              <p><br>At least i know they come from places that i hv been there, so it is easy to do networking with them, share the same topics and they are delighted to know someone visit their town too..knew their culture and understand abit of their languages.</p>

              <p>When you want to know "who you know" you need to do homework hor, cos you may know many people, but most dun click up with you. Understand.</p>

              <p>Politics is not, first and foremost, not about foresight. It is about consolidating and exercising power. I have no problem with this. <br><br>But many times, an political entity (any) has to exercises power such that it advantages its sole, selfish agenda. PAP is no exception. Time for our people to understand this, time for the PAP to acknowledge this.   <br><br>My point about the sunset industries that are still within us, is a reflection of status quo that need to be chance - urgently.<br> </p>

              <p>Man are born to be greedy, it is only in certain issue that i saluted the PAP govt, not all, humans are born with mistakes, most are just trying to systemise and align it to near perfection.</p>

              <p>Self interest is a norm in everyone mindset. But if a govt can harbour a self interest attitude for the betterment of the citizens, why not? Govt also understand that happy citizens reflect a good and happy govt, but certainly, they also know that they cannot make everybody happy.</p>
