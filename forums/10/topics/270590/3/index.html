I think they're likely to get what they want...<br><br>I mean consider this; what if, the flasgs defaced were of other countries, or even perhaps of Finland?<br><br>I mean, hey America is one heck of a Liberal Country... why aren't many people posting up Re-designed Flags of America?<br><br>Sure I mean there are disfigured flags all over the Net here and there...<br>but do we truly know how many were caught for their handy work?<br><br>I feel that we can all have our Negative Opinions and or Sentiments about SG's government, but please draw a line somewhere....<br><br>Before somebody or someone, gets "hurt"....<br><br>we are afterall talking about a very egotistic government....<br>Don't let your guards down...<br><br></div>
