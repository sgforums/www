              <p>Are we building the kind of society we want to live in? Just imagine government openly calling their own citizens liars. Even on overseas trips were frequently denigrading their own citizens complacent or lacking the competitive spirit.</p>
              <p>Should we allow our government ministers to behave in this manner? This sort of conduct or behavior amounts to "Chih Li Bah Wai" or "Getting fed at home but crawling out to serve others" or "Biting the finger that feed them food".<br> <br> Yet it is sad that with this sort of name calling of citizens people still do not care. They only mind their own business and do not care too much the bullying going on in high places. So leaders could practically anything to serve their own selfish interest or agenda.<br> <br> It took 8 years for outrageous misdeeds and malpractices in NKF even though issues have been debated in parliament to be exposed as unacceptable and wronful because the citizens simply do not care about such happening in the first place. Do they have the capacity to tell rights from wrongs.</p>
              <p>Now the suing of political oppositions for questioning the NKF wrong
              doings is similarly wrongful, evil and immoral yet the citizens do not seem to care too much about the bullying and only mind their own business.<br> <br> Citizens are being fed with mass propagandas conducted through the
              controlled media with teams of so-called counter-insurgency agents
              intercepting critics even pressurising them calling them slanderers and
              liars with some educated citizens joining them to cheer them along.<br> <br> Just imagine people are paying ministers or civil servants to do their duties to look after problems and issues like creating jobs or lowering costs of living but they spend time to do this sort of evil deeds against their own fellow citizens ?<br> <br> What insurgency are our leaders crying to contain ? Are the critics anti-government or communists who resort to violence to overthrow government&gt;</p>
              <p>What lies are the leaders trying to fix. Who determine lies or truths or whether NKF is a serious problem ?<br> <br> Friends and loyal
              citizens I applaud those who are spending their valuable time here to contribute ideas to improve governance. Please persevere to educate the apathetic citizens to take an interest
              in nation building by pointing out what are wrong without fear or favor even to the face of their MPs or Ministers and get them to do their jobs.</p>
              <p>Only when they show they have such courage will they help to solve our many problems and expose wrong doings and bring about a more
              accountable government and vibrant political situation for all and their own children and children's children.<br> <br> Finally when all play their part will the wrongful government respect them as citizens and stop calling them names like slanderers or liars and prevent problems as seen happening in NKF.</p>

              <p>Erm, correction, he likened the entire government to the NKF scandal.</p>
              <p>There are many areas where our government does not seem to be entirely transparent according to these reports, so I'm really not sure what to think.</p>
