            <div class='col-md body'>What has been happening in recent events as seen happening in parliament proves one undeniable fact with human nature - no matter how talented a person is almost always affected by power, greed, hypocrisy and self-centredness.<br><br>So soon after the Asian Financial crisis leaders have forgotten that self-centredness was found to be the root cause of all the wrong doings and malpractices as exposed by the crisis. All the pretences and hypocrisy about the virtue of Asian societies due to practice of Asian or Family values were merely shams cooked up to assume leaders' legitimacy or outward success.<br><br>Again no matter how talented is an individual, he was put to the test during the recent last two recession when they were seen to be denying problems and responsibilities for unemployments or loss of economic competitiveness.<br><br>So history has proven that at the end it will be self-centredness which eventually cause downfalls of empires.<br><br>Now the same helpless people who could not solve problems suddenly try to ride on a wave of world recovery and claim credit for every thing and try to squeeze more taxes for self-centredness and hypocrisy. There is no sign that surpluses or taxes if collected will be put to good use but everything is up to them like the estate upgrading decisions. Judging from past experiences of surpluses being splashed on Souzhou or seven wonders how to trust leaders that increased GST this time will really go towards helping the people to tie over people in crisis.<br><br>If the leaders do not keep increasing rentals through creative accounting next year citizens will be more than grateful already. So forget about more promises like helping the people to overcome problems.<br><br>Citizens will be wise in expecting more fee increases and salary increases for ministers after this round of GST increases. Look at their promises, and the way various schemes are actually implemented one has practically be obliged to vote the MPs before one can get any assistance. Otherwise Mr. Tan would not have jumped the MRT track on being told that "sorry your family income exceeds the limit so we could not help you".<br><br>Many people jumped the MRT tracks not because of the lack of efforts or choosiness about jobs but because of uncaring government who keeps taxing and recovering all costs against them until they have to jump.<br><br>Today, bus fares and utilities in a lower income family can take up 40-60% of the take home pay. How can the leaders keep one eye closed on such fee increases which only resulted in more million-dollar pays and 6-month bonuses and share options to directors of public transport companies who are actually doing nothing much except in sitting pretty to collect fees.<br><br>By all these real-life experienes all can see that leaders cannot be trusted to be free from corruption and self-centredness. They should be checked by a more objective and powerful Ombudsman and be continuously subjected to accountability or due process.<br><br>After 41 years, sad to say one thing is proven - leadership and talent is a make-belief concept or theory. Singapore today has witnessed leadership as consisting of only showmanship, hypocrisy, greed and self-interest.<br><br></div>
