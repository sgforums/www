Let the PAP have Potong Pasir and Hougang back if they desperately want to upgrade the estates.

Tax payers money is being used to pay for upgradings.

You can have different parties controlling states BUT it doesnt mean the American people collectively are denid equal benefits for voting in a representative from the opposing party</span>.</span></div></blockquote>The constituents in all Opposition Wards can take up a Test Case against the Government for withholding tax payers' monies to upgrade their estates, and for imposing politics on HDB in their day to day management of HDB estates.<br><br>The Test Case can be a Class Action against the discriminatory policies of the Ruling Political Party aka the Government in their actions against the Opposition wards, and if the Singapore ideals exist for Singaporeans or is it for propaganda only :<br><blockquote><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">To build a <span style="color: red;">democratic society </span><br>Based on <span style="color: red;">justice and equality</span><br>So as to achieve <span style="color: red;">happiness, prosperity &amp; progress for our nation</span></span></strong></blockquote>The Test Case can be delivered to the World Court for judgment in view of the predominance of the POWER OF ONE in the Singapore environment.<br><br></div>
