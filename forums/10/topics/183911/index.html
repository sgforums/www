            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">SINGAPORE : Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong has expressed concern that Hougang and Potong Pasir residents will lose out on upgrading if they do not vote for the People's Action Party.<br><br>He has also suggested that the party whip be lifted in Parliament for the PAP MPs if they are elected in these wards.<br><br>Mr Goh has been tasked by the Prime Minister to help win back the two opposition seats in the upcoming General Election.<br><br>Mr Goh says: "To my right, I see across the estates of the 1990s and to my left, we have the estates of the 1950s. How can I come out of the 50s' zone?"<br><br>Upgrading and rejuvenating Hougang constituency were some of the key issues raised by some 500 residents and grassroots leaders at a dialogue.<br><br>Mr Goh says he is not there to offer residents upgrading but to hear what they want.<br><br>He is worried that the opposition wards of Hougang and Potong Pasir would be left behind.<br><br>Mr Goh says: "I do not want the two constituencies to be left behind, especially Potong Pasir, an old estate. Five years down the road, assuming Chiam do win, there will be no upgrading.<br><br>"After that, we got to ask ourselves whether the estate is worthwhile upgrading. I'm talking about Lorong 8. By then, the estate would be around 35 years old and the lease is only 99 years, so economically, is it worthwhile?<br><br>"My own view is Hougang should be upgraded, otherwise another five years, another 10 years, it would become rather derelict compared to other estates in Singapore."<br><br>To address concerns by Hougang residents for an opposition voice in Parliament, Mr Goh says he will push for the party whip to be lifted so that PAP's candidate Eric Low can speak up, if elected.<br><br>Mr Goh says: "You have a choice - if having opposition is more important, then vote opposition - but if there is a way to get my views put to parliament to somebody, then vote for your interests, vote for upgrading - and your views can be put across in Parliament and if you vote for Eric Low, I can tell PM to let him be the opposition in Parliament."<br><br>The Party whip ensures there are sufficient party members in Parliament to support the party's position and that MPs vote on party lines.<br><br>The Whip was lifted in 2002 for all PAP MPs on matters of conscience and certain other issues, except those affecting the Budget, the Constitution, no confidence motions and issues of national security.<br><br>Residents had mixed feelings about upgrading.<br><br>"It's 50-50, because if you upgrade, then our rentals will go up as well."<br><br>"I hope they can give this place a new lease of life and add more facilities, to attract more people to come here and shop."<br><br>One market-cum-hawker centre at Hougang Avenue 7 has not been upgraded for some 30 years, and Mr Goh has urged residents and stallholders to take a long-term view.<br><br>While rent may go up, businesses will also increase and customers too will welcome the move - all part of Mr Goh's hope to make Hougang look as beautiful as his own ward in Marine Parade. - CNA/de</span> </strong><br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>What rubbish is SM Goh talking?<br>If I really want to be a pragmatic Singaporean, then I will vote with money.<br>Why buy a hdb flat when you can get a bungalow for the same price across the Causeway?<br><br>What Singapore needs is not hardware, but heartware.<br>The way to build heartware is to engage Singaporeans into making a commitment to the nation, if you compete on hardware, Singapore is going to lose more in the long run.<br>And the time to start is now, not 20 years later when the problem becomes even more acute.<br><br>Anyway, HDB flats are on a 99 year lease.<br>Once it falls below 60 leasehold years, no bank will loan money to finance the purchase of the flat.<br>More upgrading only means:<br>(1) More inconveinence during the process<br>(2) More property tax after<br>(3) Higher prices of goods due to hgher rentals<br>(4) Paying more for the flat which eventually falls in price<br><br></div>

How can I come out of the 50s' zone?"<br><br>Upgrading and rejuvenating Hougang constituency were some of the key issues raised by some 500 residents and grassroots leaders at a dialogue.<br><br>Mr Goh says he is not there to offer residents upgrading but to hear what they want.<br><br>He is worried that the opposition wards of Hougang and Potong Pasir would be left behind.<br><br>Mr Goh says: "I do not want the two constituencies to be left behind, especially Potong Pasir, an old estate. Five years down the road, assuming Chiam do win, there will be no upgrading.<br><br>"After that, we got to ask ourselves whether the estate is worthwhile upgrading. I'm talking about Lorong 8. By then, the estate would be around 35 years old and the lease is only 99 years, so economically, is it worthwhile?<br><br>"My own view is Hougang should be upgraded, otherwise another five years, another 10 years, it would become rather derelict compared to other estates in Singapore."<br><br>To address concerns by Hougang residents for an opposition voice in Parliament, Mr Goh says he will push for the party whip to be lifted so that PAP's candidate Eric Low can speak up, if elected.<br><br>Mr Goh says: "You have a choice - if having opposition is more important, then vote opposition - but if there is a way to get my views put to parliament to somebody, then vote for your interests, vote for upgrading - and your views can be put across in Parliament and if you vote for Eric Low, I can tell PM to let him be the opposition in Parliament."<br><br>The Party whip ensures there are sufficient party members in Parliament to support the party's position and that MPs vote on party lines.<br><br>The Whip was lifted in 2002 for all PAP MPs on matters of conscience and certain other issues, except those affecting the Budget, the Constitution, no confidence motions and issues of national security.<br><br>Residents had mixed feelings about upgrading.<br><br>"It's 50-50, because if you upgrade, then our rentals will go up as well."<br><br>"I hope they can give this place a new lease of life and add more facilities, to attract more people to come here and shop."<br><br>One market-cum-hawker centre at Hougang Avenue 7 has not been upgraded for some 30 years, and Mr Goh has urged residents and stallholders to take a long-term view.<br><br>While rent may go up, businesses will also increase and customers too will welcome the move - all part of Mr Goh's hope to make Hougang look as beautiful as his own ward in Marine Parade. - CNA/de</span> </strong><br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Can someone tell me what the fu*k is he trying to say?
