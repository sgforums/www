First of all PP and Hougang are not independent states or another world altogether. These are suburbs right here in singapore. Its residents are entitled to all the rights and benefits enshrined in the contituition and laws of singapore just like any other singaporean. For the government to deny their estates upgrades clearly goes against the constituition. Just because the MP is an opposition member does not mean they are not entitled to the benefits of being a singapore citizen. residents of PP and hougang pay taxes to the same government at the end of the day. where does it state in the constituition that it is illegal to have an opposition member as an MP?<br><br>i'm no lawyer but if there is a collective lawsuit by the residents of PP and Hougang in the high court, i am confident the residents would win against the government. if the case is thrown out take it to the international court of justice. It will make the government sit up and listen!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>While writing my piece - on 26 March 2006 1.08pm - that suggest Singaporeans taking up a "Class Action" against the Ruling Political Party aka the Government, another thought came into my mind as to how the "fork tongue" will defend the "skewed mind".<br><br>The defense to such a charge is quite simple in that the Ruling Political Party can claim that the National Budget is limited, that not all Wards can be upgraded at the same time in one Year, that there are no plans NOT to upgrade the Opposition Wards but that the plans are merely roster to the bottom of the program, and that during their Five Year Term as a Government some of the Wards in their care are not even upgraded - which will need confirmation.<br><br>The question now is prioritisation - since there are only TWO CONSTITUENCIES belonging to the Opposition Parties - surely it is incumbent on the Government of the day to deal with these matters first, and not favor those Constituencies that are controlled by their own Ruling Political Party ?<br><br>Leave it to those crooked minds that can twist the flimsiest of excuse to fabricate a big web of issues to justify and reinforce their own positions - where " A LIE " repeated often enough will morph into " THE TRUTH " .<br><br></div>
