If Ministers only serve certain people what recourse do we have other than refusing to elect them.<br><br>Are the scholars all like this - presented to the people as good and full of talents and abilities and people supposedly of high calibre but they call turn out to be selfish ? It is such a shame that high-calibre people are like this type?<br><br>If Lee Hsien Loong has invited people to debate them with robust arguments then he should check on such false fronts and hypocrisy and debate all these latest points presented in blogs and internets instead of asking for parliament power to clamp down on the views stated in the blogs and net.<br><br>With all these sorts of hypocrisy happening to our scholars one by one how can people be asked to vote for more scholars and to trust their judgments in looking after bigger matters like  our reserve or creating jobs...</div>
