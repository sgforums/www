On the other hand, there is the opposition ward that, in the first place did not offer it, in the second place did not vote for it. I think the decision is quite obvious."<br><br>He was responding to questions on whether he expects upgrading to be an issue raised in this General Election and if it is fair to link votes to upgrading.<br><br>Mr Mah says that it is only fair that the people who vote for the PAP should get the upgrading first, and even among them, they have to wait for their tFair that HDB residents who vote for PAP should get upgrading first: Mah<br>urns.<br><br>He said: "We will look at the location and, everything else being equal, we will decide that between the PAP and the opposition ward which one will go first, and the answer is pretty obvious - we will choose the PAP ward first." - CNA/ch<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Such a funny comments..

Well the bill will still be  passed eventually since the PAP has the largerest number of votes in the parliament. Wouldn't it be causing more social drifts between fellow singaporeans??? --&gt;  where something of a national interest are used to divide the people apart.<br><br>Again - upgrading should be a national interest and not a blackmailing tool for political agenda.<br><br>Why are we paying millions to someone especially to create a social drift between singaporeans.. such a shame.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>

There should be no artful split of the government into two camps as the ruling party MPs and one opposition MPs once election is over even though opposition MPs may speak up against ruling party's policies.<br><br>Leaders should diffentiate themselves from their party once they form the government in parliament and focus from that day onwards on achieving their collective needs and aspirations of the people. It should be made an offence or contempt of parliament for PM or ministers or anyone to try to split the parliament into ruling party MPs and opposition MPs thereby dividing them into two different camps.<br><br>Both ruling party members and opposition members are paid their salaries by the people from the people's taxes and surpluses. The PM or secretary general of ruling power do not have their own monies to pay them these salaries.<br><br>With every election, there should be growing maturity and do not engage any more in such conflicts or divisions. Leaders must serve with dedication and distinction to people's cause for upgrading themselves socially and economically. They should strive for first-world standard and not continue to treat themselves as bestowers of favour or pay master to their own MPs or supporters as paymasters as they are not.</div>
