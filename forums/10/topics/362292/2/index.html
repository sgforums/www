              <p>Saturday's edition of the Straits Times was a surreal one.<br><br>Pages
              2 and 3 of the main section was devoted to the paper's own defence
              against allegations of unfair coverage of the recent AWARE controversy.
              Its chief editor Han Fook Kwang wrote<br><br></p>
              <blockquote>I
              stand by the professionalism of our reporters. The personal attacks
              against the integrity of our journalists sadden me because they show
              the vindictiveness of our critics and the length to which they are
              prepared to go to attack our professionalism. In fact, there appears to
              be an organised campaign to discredit the media, with mass e-mail being
              sent, including to Reach, the government feedback portal.<br>
              <p>The
              Straits Times has no hidden agenda to push this line or that, or to
              favour one group against another. On this story, as with others, we
              were driven by our desire to provide as much information to our readers
              as possible, in as timely a manner. That remains our primary objective.</p>

              date of the day's edition also happens to coincide with the 50th
              anniversary of People's Action Party's first electoral victory in 1959.
              So true to its role as a nation building press, the paper devoted a
              supplementary section, consisting of some 7 to 8 full pages, to the
              historic occasion. Nothing wrong with that per se, but the overall
              thrust of the writing is clear - to attribute the success of a
              half-century of economic transformation to the policies of the PAP. And
              to ensure that the messages hit home, pictures of a young Lee Kuan Yew
              spring-cleaning on the streets in the 1960s are juxtaposed with modern
              highrise public housing.<br><br>Harder to swallow, however, are just
              how the paper conveniently whitewashed certain political truths to
              paint a simplistic triumph of the PAP over communists, such as<br><br>Two
              mentions of Lim Chin Siong are prefixed with labels of "pro-Communist"
              and "hardliner". That new evidence unearthed from the record office in
              London casting doubts on the accusations of Lim and his Barisan
              comrades as communists gets no mention.

              party Barisan Sosialis were detained without trial, some for as long as

              that this same standard of "professionalism" should extend itself to
              coverage of ALL issues, including our political history.<br><br>He
              should take good note of what his predecessor Leslie Hoffman said 50
              years ago in an editorial entitled 'Threat to Freedom', written during
              the general elections when the PAP, led by Lee Kuan Yew, was lambasting
              the Straits Times for unfair coverage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote><br>
              <p>Not
              for a hundred years has the freedom of the press in Singapore been in
              such danger as it is today. If the People's Action Party is in a
              position to form agovernment, one of its first concerns will be to
              bring the newspapers to heel. This is the only construction that can be
              placed on the statements of PAP leaders, includingits chairman [Dr Toh
              Chin Chye] and secretary general [Lee Kuan Yew]. If this conclusion is
              wrong, it is easy for PAP to say so. Its leaders need only affirm their
              respect for freedom of the press, their respect for the right to
              criticize, their respect indeed for the rights of all political
              opposition. they must not, however, qualify their affirmation with
              "buts". Like the individual, the press is either free or not free. It
              can comment and criticize, subject to the laws of defamation and libel,
              or it has no soul to<br>call its own.</p>
              <br>
              <p>A censored press
              remains bad even when it produces good things. A free press remains
              good even when it produces bad things... a eunuch remains a mutilated
              being even if he possesses a fine voice. A great Socialist said that -
              Karl Marx. It may be that PAP's spokesmen do not mean all they say, or
              that they intend to do all that they threaten. They have said some
              quite monstrous things, not only about the press, and are likely to go
              on saying them, partly no doubt because they believe threats sometimes
              work but also because a strong section of their following expect it of
              them. There is occasionally a conscious "bold bad boy" pose about PAP
              leaders, as noticeable as their undress uniform of tieless white shirt
              and trousers. It would be foolish and reckless, however, not to pay
              PAP's leaders the compliment of believing that their threats,
              particularly against the press, are meant to be taken seriously.</p>
              <br>
              <p>It
              is ominous when the press is told, in an orgy of false witness by party
              leaders, that PAP believes in "objective reporting and the accurate
              dissemination of news." This has been the classic introduction to the
              repression of the press everywhere. Dictatorships, whether of the Left
              or the Right, begin their suppression of the truth by confining the
              press to what they call "the accurate dissemination of news." The
              papers then disseminate news as the party and its leaders instruct, or
              the press does not publish at all. It may seem fantastic that such a
              threat to freedom and liberty should confront Singapore in this day and
              age of political advance, but PAP's leaders have made it quite clear
              that they do not understand the fundamental principles of the freedom
              of the press. It follows that they do not understand the first
              principles of the liberty of the people.</p>

              <p>Saturday's edition of the Straits Times was a surreal one.<br> <br> Pages 2 and 3 of the main section was devoted to the paper's own
                      defence against allegations of unfair coverage of the recent AWARE
                      controversy. Its chief editor Han Fook Kwang wrote</p>

                      50th anniversary of People's Action Party's first electoral victory
                      in 1959. So true to its role as a nation building press, the paper
                      devoted a supplementary section, consisting of some 7 to 8 full
                      pages, to the historic occasion. Nothing wrong with that per se,
                      but the overall thrust of the writing is clear - to attribute the
                      success of a half-century of economic transformation to the
                      policies of the PAP. And to ensure that the messages hit home,
                      pictures of a young Lee Kuan Yew spring-cleaning on the streets in
                      the 1960s are juxtaposed with modern highrise public housing.<br> <br> Harder to swallow, however, are just how the paper conveniently
                      whitewashed certain political truths to paint a simplistic triumph
                      of the PAP over communists, such as<br> <br> Two mentions of Lim Chin Siong are prefixed with labels of
                      "pro-Communist" and "hardliner". That new evidence unearthed from
                      the record office in London casting doubts on the accusations of
                      Lim and his Barisan comrades as communists gets no mention. See

              <p>Fact: There are less and less newspaper in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">world as a whole.</span></p>
              <p>Fact: People are turning to the internet as a news source more and more as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">whole</span></p>
              <p>Conclusion: The report you cut and paste about the lack of newspaper is not that sound in concept.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, i saw the pic you posted showing some guy with a poster about Burma. Do singapore have the right to interfere with the politics of Burma?</p>
