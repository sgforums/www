            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sir Alex upsets Manchester United fans</strong><br><br>Old Trafford is like a 'police state' which leaves supporters paralysed by fear, a spokesman from the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association claimed on Wednesday.<br><br>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson compared the atmosphere at Tuesday's Premier League win over Birmingham to a funeral, urging fans to back the team more vocally.<br><br>Those comments have upset the IMUSA's Colin Hendrie, who accused Ferguson of 'a lack of understanding' of the plight supporters face.<br><br>'I think he could benefit from sitting in the ground,' said Hendrie, who believes Old Trafford stewards come down too hard on fans who stand at moments of excitement.<br><br><strong>'You can't stand up to make a noise. If you try to stand up, you've got stewards who are ejecting you, they're taking your season ticket away from you.<br><br>'It's almost like a police state in a football ground now and if you do stand up, people will take your arm, put it behind the back of your neck and throw you out of the ground.<br><br>'Under those circumstances, what atmosphere does he (Ferguson) want?<br><br>'The only atmosphere we've got is one where we're a little bit frightened of losing Â£1,000 for the season ticket we've paid for.' </strong><br><br>The noise level in the stadium as United laboured to a 1-0 win over Alex McLeish's strugglers yesterday was non-existent at times, a fact gleefully pointed out by the visiting fans.<br><br>Sitting in the directors' box as he completed a two-match touchline ban, the lack of atmosphere was even more noticeable to Ferguson.<br><br>So, just over seven years after former captain Roy Keane laid into United's 'prawn sandwich brigade', Ferguson had his say.<br><br>'The crowd were dead,' complained the Scot. 'It was like a funeral it was so quiet.'<br><br>Hendrie revealed Ferguson's comments had not gone down well with his fellow fans.<br><br>'A lot of people are pretty upset, because it shows a lack of understanding about what it's like to be a football fan in 2008,' he said on Sky Sports News.<br><br>'Fergie's going back to the days 10 years ago where it was absolutely fantastic, you could stand.<br><br>'But you can't do that now and the football authorities need to make up their minds whether they want to have fans sitting neatly in a row not being able to do anything or if they want an atmosphere in the football grounds again.'<br><br>Hendrie pointed to the example of United's neighbours Manchester City, where he claims stewards are far more tolerant.<br><br>'It's actually not against the law to stand up. It's to do with the terms and conditions on the ticket,' he explained.<br><br>'The interpretation of that rule is different at different grounds.<br><br>'For example, at City, they've actually got a singing area.<br><br>'Because you're allowed to stand in moments of excitement, what they say at City is, 'If you're standing up singing, you're obviously excited, so carry on singing'.<br><br>'That doesn't happen at Old Trafford.'<br><br>The club have, however, rejected any notion that stewards have been asked to adopt a heavy-handed approach.<br><br>In the four games prior to Christmas - against Everton, Derby, Fulham and Sporting Lisbon - it is claimed that just three fans were ejected from Old Trafford in total.<br><br>A United spokesman said: 'Any suggestion of an ejection policy for persistent standing is simply not borne out by the facts.'<br><br>The club have also denied that the atmosphere at the 'Theatre of Dreams' is being muted by a high proportion of corporate fans - the assumed target of Keane's prawn sandwich jibe.<br><br>Of the 76,000 fans who can pack into the stadium, 86%, United claim, are fans paying the normal ticket price.<br><br><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=495015&amp;cc=4716" rel="nofollow">http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=495015&amp;cc=4716</a></div>
