              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>WASHINGTON: The 
              United States and China have diametrically opposing views on the 
              International Monetary Fund's financial resources.<br><br>Washington sees adequate firepower, whereas Beijing says it may be insufficient in the face of the eurozone debt crisis.<br><br>"As
               the European sovereign debt crisis unfolds, demand for IMF financing 
              from its members has increased dramatically," China's central bank 
              chief, Zhou Xiaochuan, said in a speech Saturday to the IMF steering 
              committee.<br><br>"However, its available financial resources may not be adequate to meet the potential needs of the crisis-hit countries."<br><br>The United States is on the opposite track.<br><br>"The IMF has adequate resources," a US Treasury official who asked not to be identified said Wednesday.<br><br>The official pointed to a November 2010 agreement to double the permanent contributions, or quotas, of its member states.<br><br>But
               before the quota reform can take effect, a sufficient number of 
              national parliaments must ratify it. About 40 have done so, of the 113 
              needed.<br><br>The subject is delicate for the United States, the biggest contributor to the Fund's resources.<br><br>Republican
               lawmakers, who control the US House of Representatives, routinely voice
               opposition to international institutions like the Washington-based IMF.<br><br>The IMF today has $630 billion available to help middle- and high-income countries.<br><br>Paring
               off the financing already promised to Greece and to other countries, 
              and excluding its reserves cushion, the IMF has the capacity to lend 
              $383 billion over the next 12 months.<br><br>For the IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde, that may not be enough.<br><br>"The
               Fund's credibility, and hence effectiveness, rests on its perceived 
              capacity to cope with worst-case scenarios. Our lending capacity of 
              almost $400 billion looks comfortable today but pales in comparison with
               the potential financing needs of vulnerable countries and crisis 
              bystanders," she said in an IMF action plan released Saturday.<br><br>"It will be useful to discuss, soon, the needs and contingency options."<br><br>Since taking the IMF helm in July, Lagarde has made increasing its resources one of her battle cries.<br><br>Japan is on board, and is prepared to put more money into the coffers of the international emergency lender.<br><br>"It might be worthwhile to consider enhancing the Fund's financial resources," said Jun Azumi, the Japanese finance minister.<br><br>He
               suggested that the 187-nation institution "establish a facility capable
               of swiftly providing the necessary liquidity to member countries that 
              are good performers" to prevent contagion from crises.<br><br>Speaking 
              on behalf of six south American countries, the governor of Chile's 
              central bank, Jose De Gregorio, called for "higher priority" to be given
               to the financing question.<br><br>There was no dearth of ideas for how to use any new resources.<br><br>It
               was "worth considering the creation of a multilateral facility where 
              the Fund and central banks work together to provide liquidity to member 
              countries facing financing pressure," Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi 
              Okonjo-Iweala said, representing 21 Sub-Saharan African countries.<br><br>-AFP/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>It is true, that if Americans did not live beyond their means for so long, the world would not have developed so rapidly.</p>
              <p>In addition, I doubt Jim Rogers is right. The present Americans are beginning to worry, which is a good thing. At the present state, I highly doubt they are not able to repay their debt. 3 factors that I see:</p>
              <p>1) The US, on paper, has the biggest amount of gold in the world. I remember it was 3000+ tonnes, but let's just say we take a simple number of 3000 tonnes</p>
              <p>2) The US has the largest estimated untapped oil reserves in the world. Estimates put that at 2.3 trillion barrels of oil.</p>
              <p>3) Taxes can still be played around with. If they stop this bickering, and move to have a better tax structure (read simplified), it will help them immensely in better tax collection, hence removing the need to increase taxes and just focus on better tax collection.</p>
              <p>If you assume that US sells its gold of 1500 tonnes, at today's prices of US$1700.00 per oz, US has a total of 50,000,000 oz (1500 tonnes x 1000 kg x 1000g / 30g where 30g = 1 oz) = US$85,000,000,000. That's $85 billion.</p>
              <p>If the US drills half of its oil reserves out, for simple estimates, let's say 1 trillion barrels of oil, where 1 barrel of oil is for simplicity factor = US$80, the US can generate $80 trillion. Removing the estimated cost of drilling, labor, selling, etc, let's put it at 50% cost, it's still $40 trillion.</p>
              <p>Increased efficiency in tax collection will help them to better handle their annual budget, thus leaving their natural reserves to pay off their debts. The current US debt is $17.3 trillion. Given its natural reserves, it can pay back its debt.</p>
              <p>It's the right thing to do though, to manage its debt, because the dumb presidents add &gt; $1 trillion debt to the total debt every year.</p>
              <p>At the rate they are going, in 20 years, if the US does not rein in its debt, it will indeed become a really serious situation. That's when Jim Rogers may be right.</p>
