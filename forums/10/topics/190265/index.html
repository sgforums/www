            <div class='col-md body'>Do you think the following proposal will be published by Today or the Straits Times?<br><br>Dear Editor, TODAY,<br><br>I hope you will publish my proposal to review the current constitution of Singapore in order to make it more relevant to our changed circumstances :-<br><br>"The Constitution of a country usually sets out the basic rights of citizens and defines the role of government and its component branches.<br><br>In the new era of fast changing technologies, is there a need to review its relevance to keep up with changes?<br><br>Is the role of government still valid as defined in the existing constitution or should it be updated to reflect the needs and aspirations of the people. Should the government be more dynamic or should it be static and reactionary merely be concerned with legalistic control of the population to maintain law and order?<br><br>Should there be processes of government, to ensure accountability and transparency in administration, justice, election processes and empower the citizens to contribute to overall social, cultural and economic competitiveness.<br><br>Specifically should the constitution help to ensure greater accountability and transparency of governance, efficient and effective functioning of the three branches of government, namely the executive, legislature, judiciary supported by a non-aligned civil service in the interest of all citizens.<br><br>Finally, should the executive provide leadership which is open and accountable in arriving at policies, decisions and administration so as to win over the participation by the citizens as human resources?<br><br>A review of the constitution can be made to help bring about the necessary changes to the way the branches of government are conducting the administration of the country beyond accomplishing their own immediate tasks.<br><br>There is a need to recognise that the top priority is more than mere election and making laws or decisions affecting the citizens. Therr is obviously a much arger scope of government one that is empowering the collective talents, coordination, knowledge applications and innovation in every field in collective nation building, the key to the people's vibrancy and competitiveness.<br><br>It is critical to look at the larger picture of motivating all citizens in making collective efforts with coordination of different branches of the government, to go about their respective tasks among the legislature, executive, and judiciary. There should above all be accountability and transparency and yet attaining of unity of purpose.<br><br>It is therefore proposed to review the constitution in the context of attaining the larger perspective of nation building. Only when the constitution is open and able to involve citizens in contributing to accountability, transparency, coordination and unity of purpose that there could be collective leadership which will empower growths in social, cultural and economic vibrancy as a way of life essential to eliciting their contribution in diverse aspects of nation buidling.<br><br>With this above-stated objective in mind, it is proposed to upgrade the constitution as follows:-<br><br>(1) To unify the citizens by setting up the constitution as a compact between the state and the citizens.<br><br>(2) To set up and safeguard the basic right of citizen including freedom to speak up or air their views or suggestions on any aspect of governing of the country.<br><br>(3) To safeguard the welfare and wellbeing of citizens and protect them against any threats or exploitation from any external or internal sources.<br><br>(4) To guarantee the right of citizens to elect the best representatives based on the One-Man-One-Vote election process without any hindrance.<br><br>(5) To provide for equitable multi-racial representation by permitting for election of minority-race candidates receiving the highest percentage of votes to be elected into parliament to represent their minority race's interest in government of the country.<br><br>(6) To ensure that any changes made to the constitution boundaries or election processes or procedure will be prejudice the constitutional right of citizens elect their choice of candidates based on one-man-one-vote election system.<br><br>(7) To establish clearly defined hierarchy of government comprising the collective body of elected representatives sitting as legislature or parliament, as the supreme arbiter of government with authority and power of censor and penalty over three branches of government namely the executive, legislature, judiary collectively supported by an overall civil service.<br><br>The government of the country should be higher than the ruling party or the executive, legislature or judiciary and should have the largest role of government to form committees and other bodies to oversee any particular issue or problem. Citizens should be encouraged to come forward to play their complementary role to check on any errors or oversights or mistakes in the government and play a pivotal role in diverse areas.<br><br>It is of primary importance to review the roles of the executive to encourage overall growth involving participation by all component branches and citizens.<br><br>Such review will then bring about changes in initiation and formulation of more effective pro-people and pro-growth policies and decision but to embrace the economic, social and cultural aspects to involve the citizens in sustaining vibrancy and competitiveness.<br><br>So to that extent, law making and enforcements should be the lowest domination of government. The higher perspective should be to encourage and empower the people in active participation in every aspect of nation building and not to be restricted to laws and enforcements by the executive.<br><br>Therefore, it is essential to define the role of government and various component parties of government as follows:-<br><br>(a) Parliament (Legislature) - to debate and deliberate and give approval to recommendations of the executive on policies, decisions, proposals relating to administration of the government.<br><br>(b) Executive - to initiate and formulate policies and laws for approval of parliament and to implement policies and decisions passed by parliament.<br><br>(c ) Judiciary - to administer justice over enforcement of laws and adjudication of disputes and problems affecting the citizens.<br><br>It shall be the function of the civil service to carry out the policies and decisions and implement the laws and their enforcements passed by parliament.<br><br>(<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Establish Rule of law, justice, fairness and equity in conduct of laws.<br><br>(9) Establish low-cost independent panels with neutrality of status and relevant expertise to administer all situations of conflicts or potential conflict of interests, in election processes, administration of government, approval of salaries and rewards of government ministers, MPs and executives and adjudication of justice and establishment of accountability and transparency in administration of government.<br><br>The primary objective of the review should be clear - to build an inclusive cosmopolitan society and increase the overall participaton in all aspects of nation building. Secondarily the review will help to correct or clarify any grey areas that might lead to erosion of rights of citizens thereby undermining the eventual evolvement of greater social, cultural and economic vibrancy of the citizens.<br><br>By guaranteeing the citizens of basic rights of citizens, and delineate the roles of the three branches of government, we will be able to lay a strong foundation for the country one which will lead to better collective leadership and shared responsibility and one which will motivate citizens to contribute to larger aspects of nation building.<br><br>Such a constitution will then help to lessen conflicts within society, the surest and most certain way to prevent concentration of power in any individuals or groups of individuals which might lead to long-term instability.<br><br>It is envisaged that a pro-people and pro-growth constitution, will fuel the growth of people creativity, entrepreneurship in all aspects of nation building in the interest of all citizens irrespective of belief, cult, race, religion or political views or inclinations.</div>

For some, they are contended with three meals a day, and will probably be satisfied with what they get. For others, what they see happening for the last many years is not right or progressive. What the latter want is able government which is able to compete with better government and better systems elsewhere and not compared with the worse off countries. What they want are greater opportunities and doing better than what the government has done in recent years. The also want greater accountability and not some dictatorial system which only benefit certain people at the top or the rich.<br><br>Standard of living has in recent years dropped whereas costs of living continue to get pushed up by an administration that runs out of ideas and solutions.<br><br>Which one is the perspective will determine your stand whether government is doing well or not.</div>
