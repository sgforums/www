              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>Senior Counsel Mr Philip Jeyaretnam had written to the Straits Times Forum to clarify a mis-reporting in an interview published yesterday under the “Insight” column.</p>
              <p>Mr Philip Jeyaretnam is the younger son of the late opposition leader J.B. Jeyaretnam who was at one time a one-man fighting machine against the PAP juggernaut. His elder brother Kenneth Jeyaretnam is the Secretary-General of the Reform Party founded by their father last year.</p>
              <p>The lengthy interview, conducted by Straits Times Senior Correspondent Sue-Ann Chia was supposedly on Philip’s thoughts about his recent appointment to the Public Service Commission (PSC), but turned out to be about his father and brother.</p>
              <p>Sue-Ann Chia portrayed Philip as having reservations about his brother entering politics and taking over the Reform Party in her article in the paragraph below:</p>
              <p><em>“After all, his elder brother Kenneth took over the reins from his father and is now heading the Reform Party.</em></p>
              <p><em>Asked how he feels about this, he pauses and <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">seems to struggle for an answer.</span></strong></em></p>
              <p><em>‘We have always respected each other’s choices in life and <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">we have made slightly different choices</span></strong>,’ he says.”</em></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: Straits Times Insight, 4 November 2009]</strong></p>
              <p>According to Mr Philip Jeyaretnam, his exact words were omitted from the interview:</p>
              <p><em>“Unfortunately, what I said about my brother, Kenneth, in answer to the question on what I thought about his taking over the leadership of the Reform Party, was omitted. </em></p>
              <p><em>I told the interviewer that <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kenneth has ‘embarked on a serious project, and I am sure he will do a good job, knowing his capability’</span></strong>.”</em></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: Straits Times Forum, 5 November 2009]</strong></p>
              <p>As we can see from the above, there is a wide gulf in the meaning between the two passages which would have generated contrasting perceptions in the readers.</p>
              <p>Mr Philip Jeyaretnam had stated explicitly in no uncertain terms that he supported his brother’s political endeavors fully and he is confident that he will do a good job instead of the ambiguous stance reported initially in the interview.</p>
              <p>He must be surprised that the interview turned out to be quite different from what he thought about when he was first approached for it by Straits Times:</p>
              <p><em>“It is a pity that an interview about my appointment to the Public Service Commission, subsequently billed as being about my father and brother, omitted my actual response, and jumped to the very different subject of choices in life.”</em></p>
              <p>It is a common tactic employed by SPH journalists to deliberately omit, distort and twist the words of their interviewees to create a desired impression in the minds of the unsuspecting readers in order to pursue the agenda of their political masters.</p>
              <p><em>(In all the interviews conducted by the Temasek Review, we always publish the interviewee’s words as they actually are without any editing. Whenever we make any changes which may change the impression and perception of the content, we will email the interviewee the draft and seek his/her approval first before publishing the interview)</em></p>
              <p>In this case, it is obvious that the article is trying to play up a non-existent division between the two brothers by highlighting Philip’s ambivalence towards Kenneth’s foray into politics.</p>
              <p>Actually Philip shouldn’t be surprised as this is not the first time that the Straits Times has deliberately twisted and distorted the picture of his family.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times often demonized his father J.B. Jeyaretnam as a “radical” and “dangerous” “maniac” out to subvert the PAP’s political system during his frequent altercations with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in the 1980s.</p>
              <p>When J.B. Jeyaretnam passed away last year, there was a complete media blackout on his political career, his funeral and the candle-light vigil held in remembrance of him at Hong Lim Park by a group of young Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Soon after Kenneth Jeyaretnam announced his decision to enter politics, the Straits Times again tried to paint him as a “foreigner” who spent a large number of years away in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The opposition leaders as well as bloggers must think twice before agreeing to interviews by SPH journalists next time. They will not give you free publicity for nothing.</p>
              <p>With the new media emerging as an alternative to the mainstream media, there is no need to rely on the latter anymore to get one’s message across.</p>
              <p>

              <p>Hey, where's the law minister? Just recently he was going around complaining about the low Press Freedom Index that they got. Where is he now? There's one nice piece of evidence for his further reading here.</p>
              <p>I've always wondered why did we accept being called the alternative media.</p>
              <p>When enough young people abandon the story-churning newspapers for reliable accounts of Singapore news online, the new media <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>IS</strong></span> the mainstream media.</p>
              <p>As for the current newspapers, their standards do not even match up to be an "alternative". They are at best suitable for mindless Singaporeans who accept "stories" at face value and declare them to be true.</p>
              <p>As the years go by, we shall see a shift from the nonsenencial and propagandistic news to a reliable, valid and independent source of news online.</p>
              <p>There was never any explanation for the rise in Press Freedom from 144th to 133rd. I suspect websites like TheOnlineCitizen, TemasekReview or the SingaporeNewsAlternative are the main reasons for the rise.</p>
              <p>The current standards of journalism has been dropping over the years and its impossible for the Press Freedom to rise because of that.</p>
              <p>I look foward to the day whereby Singaporeans treat newspapers as nothing more than a tool to wrap your vegetables and fruits with. Or maybe for fast food restaurants to clean their windows with.</p>

              <p>I believe a more proper choice of words is that we <strong>might </strong>have become a more vibrant country.Or we <strong>might </strong>have been relegated to a political/economical position weaker than we are now.</p>
              <p>If your argument is that Singapore would have surely undergo a golden age but that it is the mutation that is LKY that stunted that growth, i'm not buying that view. It's just too simple an answer and only possible with hindsight.</p>
              <p>For all intents and purposes, we're not going to turn back the clock. I fail to see the reasoning for trying to insist that we could have been better off if LKY didn't exist. </p>
              <p>I would think Singaporean voters would be more interested in what we should be heading towards, then reminiscing about what could have happened.</p>

              <p>I don't think that is correct. Before 1959, Singapore was politically and culturally vibrant.</p>

              <p>I believe a more proper choice of words is that we <strong>might</strong> have become a more vibrant country.Or we <strong>might</strong> have been relegated to a political/economical position weaker than we are now.</p>
              <p>If your argument is that Singapore would have surely undergo a golden age but that it is the mutation that is LKY that stunted that growth, i'm not buying that view. It's just too simple an answer and only possible with hindsight.</p>
              <p>For all intents and purposes, we're not going to turn back the clock. I fail to see the reasoning for trying to insist that we could have been better off if LKY didn't exist. </p>
              <p>I would think Singaporean voters would be more interested in what we should be heading towards, then reminiscing about what could have happened.</p>

              <p><br>The answer lies in this single paragraph that you have made -</p>
              <p>" <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">If your argument is that Singapore would have surely undergo a golden age but that it is the mutation that is LKY that stunted that growth, i'm not buying that view. It's just too simple an answer and only possible with hindsight. </span></em>"</p>
              <p>Firstly, given the situation that Singapore is what it is today - is due largely to the deliberate authoritarian rulings - over the last 52 years - by a Stalinist-Autocrat, who had '<strong>mutated</strong>' a pseudo-Capitalist system with the best features of Communist State command economy with monopolistic controls to tweak market forces to benefit the politcal and economic goals of the State.</p>
              <p>For 52 years, the brain drain have been bleeding the best from Singapore, would it not serve Singapore if the cause for the brain drain had been surgically removed ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, the answer cannot be simpler as it is, why do you need it to be more complex to have it become more palatable ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thirdly, if after half-a-century of monotonous rule, we have no ability to review with some degree of '<strong>hindsight</strong>' - surely you will not want to be politely accused to be suffering from "myopia", or at worst to be insulted to be lacking in "intelligence" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The difference between your <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/might-have-been">‘<strong>might have been’</strong> (*1) </a>- which means that "<em>an event that could have occurred but never did</em>" - (period ??); and my <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hf.uio.no/ilos/forskning/konferanser/SuB12/SuB12_0084.pdf">‘<strong>would have been’</strong> (*2) </a>is that my phrase refer to events in the past perfect tense with the future in perspective.</p>
              <p>It simply meant to review the past and considering all the events that had occurred and if it had been corrected - the future <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">can be</span></strong> differently better with a hope, when one considers that despite the present cancer there already exist a stunted growth.</p>
              <p>Then '<strong>would have been</strong>' remains correct as stated.</p>

              <p>If only the X-rated Fraud had paid attention to its history lessons, it would have known that the act of its "Master's Tail in wagging the dog" - cannot be an oddity.</p>

              <p>Even LKY had appointed the late David Marshall to be the Singapore Ambassador to France, despite the late David Marshall being LKY's erstwhile political debater - with a keen mind that rivalled and competed with LKY.</p>

              <p>Such are the petty politics that can only exist in Third World Countries, and when the innocent individuals are used for their talent - with political mileage being extracted to polish the image of the PAP.</p>

              <p>It is not a surprise that the X-rated Fraud - who has repeatedly claim itself to be "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">an insignificant nobody</span></em>" - will be so immodest as to venture confidently that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is no more than a curiousity that the reporter thought would be of an interest to readers</span></em>".</p>
              <p>How did the X-rated Fraud come to such a position ?</p>
              <p>Was it entirely due to the thinking capabilities of an "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">insignificant nobody</span></em>" with obvious habit at being a pseudo-intellect ?</p>
              <p>Or has it access to some privileged information that it will not venture to divulge, but will promote this "naked attempt at a repair job" - even when there is another thread that put right what had been deliberately done wrong - as had been featured in this Thread ?</p>

              <p>Is the X-rated Fraud attempting to make it the fault of Philip Jeyaretnam - in agreeing to give the ST reporter an opportunity to interview him; and it is not the fault of the ST reporter for skewing the interview with a hidden political agenda that needed Philip Jeyaretanm to demand clarification to be published ?</p>

              <p>What possibly could the resident X-rated pseudo-intellect intend to mean with its dubious words in the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">authoritarian request</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Was it due to the newspaper behaving "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">graciously</span></em>" to allow a correction to be made, or was it due to the status of Philip Jeyaretnam ? </p>
              <p>Had it been any other "insignificant nobody" as an ordinary Singapore Citizen - it is doubtful even the X-rated Fraud or anyone will get the same width of respect that had been given to Philip Jeyaretnam for the corrections made.</p>

              <p>While the X-rated Fraud read the post as "<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>no more than a curiousity that the reporter thought would be of an interest to readers, and thus the focus was on this famous son, on his thoughts and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not about his father</span></span> </em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">or his</span></span> up and comming politician</em> <em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">brother</span></span> </em></span></span>"</p>
              <p>- its 'angelic' Taiwanese 'hum' had intepreted it as - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">not interested in his position, that wouldn't bring much news and front page sensational in the media, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">his brother and late father is the ultimate news the reporters wanted</span></span></em>".</p>

              <p>If only the X-rated Fraud with its insufferable pseudo-intellect will take the advise of its 'angel' with a capital 'A' - to simply <strong>'<span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHUT UP</span>'</strong> if it has nothing to say.</p>
