            <div class='col-md body'><br>I find that it is very apparent that MOST people in Singapore, are only interested in and are fairly good in, the ART of making MONEY - or a LIVING.<br><br>Art. How can anyone devote that kind of TIME into any form of art when academics are of the UTMOST of everyone's concern right from DAY ONE of their lives???<br><br>When I say TIME, I meant that in whatever art-form, be it in music as in playing of an instrument or singing and even dancing, requires MUCH practice and the time required for much practice.<br><br>People here cannot get by, by basking in the streets and then practice some more at home or in a studio. IN the USA, musicians in the streets can blow anyone away in our region - not just in Singapore. They practice 8 hours every day, play their music when any opportunity comes along, and simply live the art they are into.<br><br>Here, we are first chasing academics, then if you're a guy you have NS to contend with, afterwhich, its money making all the way.<br><br>What ART? What time is there for ARTS?<br><br>People are so high strung, I can't see how any creative juice can possibly flow...<br><br>But perhaps I make some exceptions for ARTS like painting, or graphic designing, other than these, I don't see how the others can surely put food on dinner tables...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's put it this way. The shows hardly get advertising, and people hardly know what is coming to town.<br><br>Then couple that to the fact that the bulk of the population work like nuts for a decent wage (if one can even call it decent), with little time for other things, does anyone honestly think there will be great attendance for shows?<br><br>In actual truth, the Esplanade should be largely driven by donations from corporate sponsors. Do we have a statistic?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some idiots suggested using the Esplanade as a venue to stage rock concerts, which I think is totally stupid. I guess he was using his @rse to think. He probably hasn't seen any performance at any of the halls. Moreover the halls wasn't made with the anticipation of use as a pop/rock concert hall, wonder what damages might occur with kids jumping on chairs and climbing atop ledges.<br><br>Pop concerts held at Singapore Indoor Stadium has a capacity of 13,000, each of the big halls at Esplanade can only hold 2,000 maximum. You can sell tickets for a minimum of $150, the popstars can perform for 10 days and you still won't recuperate your initial capital layout.<br><br>This shows the credibility of the moron's post.<br><br></div>
