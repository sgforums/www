            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the arts in Singapore is pretty much alive... just go to DeviantArt and you will see a lot of local artists displaying their stuff there, and they are pretty good.<br><br>The irony is that I don't think there is a lack of artists in Singapore, just that what is officially reconized "channels" pratically misses out this vibrant art counterculture entirely. Not to mention a lot of our artists find it difficult to be accepted in the Singaporean mindset, where art is seen as an oddity and a waste to our "pragmatic" style of life. Hence while there is a lot of talent in our nation, a lot of it is squandered as many people with the heart and calling of an artists find themselves fighting an uphill battle to do art for life. More likely then not they have to make a living in something non-art related.<br><br>Art and artists in Singapore are everywhere... the tragedy is that they are mostly unseen. I just find that many of our offical art-drives are half-assed, because they are often throwing cash and slogans at the problem without really making the effort to introduce art into the hearts and minds of Singaporeans.<br><br>If you really want to turn Singapore into an arts hub? Time to lift many OB markers, realize that creativity often means asking uncomfortable questions, destroy this Singaporean mindset that anything not bread and butter is not worth our consideration, encourage self-expression... in short, a lot of things that I suspect the top brass are unwilling to really do in our nation.<br><br>In the meantime, they just keep setting up "official" art drives and hypes that try to keep everything safe and artsy, so sterile that it never really raises any real questions that Singaporean would ask and ponder.<br><br>Is it any surprise that the arts seem dead?</div>
