Then he instituted the PSLE exam, you dont score more than 260 also cannot get into RI, then the O level exam copied from Cambridge, only those who score a perfect 8 A1s can get into RJC....woa lao...No wonder why so many Chinese cannot get into civil service lah, they went to the wrong schools, only ended up as Chinese helicopters <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Now I know why there are so many ministers from RI. Remember the little girl, Wee Shu Ming, who claimed to be elite, also from RJC. Chinese Mandarin System was long gone, it is now RI, the very elite institute "which only served to curtail mass participation and practical knowledge application and innovation among the general population."
