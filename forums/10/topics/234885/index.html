            <div class='col-md body'>I am not trying to instill fear but I want you to hear the truth. I hope my post can change the view of many Singaporeans about global warming.<br><br>I have just watched the documentary called <a href="http://http://www.climatecrisis.net" rel="nofollow">The Inconvenient Truth </a> by Al Gore. It is about global warming and how it is rapidly changing our environment and climate. It is a wake-up call for me.  I think most Singapore citizens are not very well-informed of the impact of global warming. Without the wake-up call, Singaporeans would just think that global warming is just a baseless notion and that its effects are purely exaggerated.<br><br>This needs to be changed. Every Singaporean need to know the reason behind the unusual temperature change in many countries - global warming. Some parts of poor countries like China, India and South Africa are getting hotter in summer and having droughts as their rivers are dried up, drought results in famine and starvation. The damages of the Tsunami in Asia in 2004 will be dwarfed by what global warming will do to the coastlines. The Tsunami might not have effected Singapore greatly. But the effects of global warming will, over the time, be more obvious in Singapore, since so much of our country is only a few meters above the sea level.<br><br>More Singaporeans need to take action and responsibilty to end the global warming crisis. I know that there has been enormous efforts of recycling in Singapore. Recycling waste and garbage is not a mean to end all the environment problems. We Singaporeans are just so spoilt. We need to change the old habits of consuming energy and resources. We need to cut down the fuel consumption and cut down the CO2 in our environment and commute less on private cars, use fuel-efficient public transport instead of driving a car from Jurong to Changi, to get to work. The air-conditioning is always at full blast in the shopping mall. I always need to bring a sweater or jacket to go shopping in Taskimaya or Golden Village Cinema.<br><br>Singaporeans really need to rethink the scenario 40-50 years ahead when the oil depletes. Singapore's current economy depends heavily on international trade. How are we going to get imports when shipping cost keeps going up? Where are we going to get our resources/raw materials to manufacture goods for export? The Port of Singapore is the world's busiest, in terms of shipping tonnage. We have the biggest oil refinery in SouthEast Asia. But all this will change with the energy crisis and it will deeply affect us and the future generation.<br><br>We need to be more far sighted, less selfish and be more active in reducing global warming. We can't just rely on our government to do the part. We need to spread the words to everyone including our neighbour countries as well - forest fires in Indonesia are speeding up global warming.<br><br>Global warming might sound like a big term for you. I urge you all to start taking small steps to fight it. You can use less fuel (drive a smaller or hybrid car, carpooling , take public transport, ride a bike or even better, walk), plant more trees or plants, use less electricity (use energy saving light bulbs), use less hot water, recyle,  support environmental friendly companies, be Anti-Bush(Geoge Bush would not support/sign the Kyoto Protocol and the United States is as of 2005 the largest single emitter of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels) and spread the words to your family,  friends, school, relatives and colleagues.<br><br>I am proud that Singapore has signed the Kyoto Protocol  in April 2006.

            <div class='col-md body'>Global Warming is not an entirely man-made construct. Certainly, human activity is partly responsible for accelerating the process, but it has been noted that Global warming is part and parcel of the Earth. It has been noted that temperatures some 2000 over years ago are less than what they are and the average global temperature has risen and fallen (including the occasional megatonnage or gigatonnage volcanic eruption) over the last thousands of years.<br><br>And ..er.. Tsunami 2006 is a product of Global Warming??? Jeezz... The Tsunami will still be pretty bad even if the sea level were a tad lower. Energy of the Tsunami will be pretty unchanged. If Lake Toba goes kapow, then we will start thinking of underground shelters for heat! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Global warming is a global phenomenon, so there will be particular countries that will benefit from it. Most likely countries with large expanses of frozen and barren land will become fertile grounds, Canada and Siberia for example. But one thing is for sure, no tropical or equatorial regions will benefit from it.<br>Here are the main changes that will disrupt people lives all over the world.<br><br>When Greenland and Antarctica glaciers start to break into the sea, the water level will raise between 8 and 16m, while it sounds like a moderate increase, that means that millions of square kilometres of land will be underwater. Moreover, most of this coastal land is extremely fertile and home of hundreds of millions of people.<br><br>These people will have to be displaced, creating insurmountable geopolitical problems and wars.<br><br>Other consequences of global warming are the disparition of glaciers in the Himalayas. The glaciers are providing a large source of fresh water for India and China, these populations will face serious shortages.<br><br>Increased temperatures will increase evaporation of moisture contained in the soil, increasing the size of the deserts, they will also increase rainfall and hurricanes, as seen with Katrina.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's put it in another way. Greenhouse gases are pretty much a fact of manufacturing. No single industrial process doesn't emit some form of greenhouse gas directly and indirectly. Indirectly meaning power plants.<br><br>If you want to reduce power plant greenhouse emission, then you have to resort to nuclear power because that is the only power generation technique that allows for high density power generation.<br><br>However, there's a trade off. High power density means you have higher heat emission instead and that does have an influence on the weather to an extent though not incredibly noticeable. I wonder if anyone did a study on how much power generation influences the weather since concrete does especially in a city like Singapore. In fact, you could say the mere existence of cities itself influences the weather. Given the increasing urbanisation of the world, that average global temps increase should be no surprise.<br><br>That being said, a lot of scientists haven't really come up with conclusive models and have them shown on the newspapers to give their claims indisputable doubt. They can go blabber all they want but until they suggest solutions, I am going to have to be a skeptic on what can be done to reverse the trend. What can be done to slow the trend is to start using more power efficient products and attempt to decrease greenhouse gas emission.</div>
