              <p>Its not a matter of being heartlell or altrustic.</p>
              <p>Its economics.</p>
              <p>We cannot have an aging population with a mentallity that they need not save, that they need not work, that they can continue consuming resources without contributing, that all will be taken care of, no need to worry about costs. The ripple effect would be wide and ever enlarging as other facets of the economy are affected by high costs and loss of manpower.</p>
              <p>Someone will have to bear the cost of welfare, and it will have to be the young ones, like the forumers here who are disgruntled against the government. A government of their choice will want them to foot the bill to support healthy retirees, would they be willing? Or would they again curse the government of the day just the same as now.</p>
              <p>As for old people collecting cans and cardboard boxes. These forumers use these to critise the government without checking out the circumstances of the old people. These old people could be proud and not want welfare, and rather exercise their  initiative and eak out a living collecting cans or cardboards than get a handout. Take them out of the streets into a sanitised home and they will die in a few months of boredom.</p>

              <p>i agree with you about "work makes you free"</p>
              <p>it's all about one making the effort to see through one's desires.</p>
              <p>put it this way, polytechnic students have always disapprove of paying the "extra" in concession compared to JC students. last year and this year they even went on to get signatures to petition to LTA. it was reported on Channelnewasia. yes, LTA or SMRT rejected their petition but they have not given up... they are still unhappy with the differences and they continue to make the effort to have their displeasure heard through "legitimate" and peaceful ways. i believe they will continue this actions next year.</p>
              <p>the point? forumers here complain about the flaws of the government but they do not reach out and rectify the flaws. they just complain and complain... they take millions, they increase GST, they increase working age limit... they this they that...</p>
              <p>start a petition then to ask the present government to step down in a legit and peaceful ways. you can ask forumers here to sign a petition form and then when you have about 1000, call Channelnewsasia and have a face to face forum to present your case.</p>

              <p>no worries...</p>
              <p>end of the day, you can moan about your misfortune or you can do something about it. if you think singapore has lots to improve, start working towards it then.</p>
              <p>get a degree, join an opposition... get residents support... i know you won't win in elections but you can still be a MP if you have lots of votes. lead by example and when the general public sees that you are working hard to improve the lives of the people, many more will join you and you will have a stronger voice... be a competent leader and many will follow... the way you conduct yourself will determine your character and people sees that.</p>
              <p>even our MM Lee has utmost respect for Mr. Chiam See Tong, the veteran of Potong Pasir who has held his fort for almost 30 years. he was respectful and people respected him... he does not have antics that caused embarrassment... it's all about character.</p>

              <p>ha ha ha, govt help in financial difficulty??? ha ha ha h ah , fat hope, it is just for show.   i know of someone who is seeking financial aid, still looking for job but still can't find, now facing financial difficulty.  Seek financial aid, CDC refuse to apply for the financial aid for this person because he is jobless.    CDC will only provide financial aid if someone is working.     Instead of applying for financial aid for this person, the CDC officer made this person signed agreement to look for job.    But he is already constantly looking for job but still cannot find.</p>
              <p>There was large lump sum of leftover of community fund last year.   So now we know why the fund is not used up.</p>
              <p>Govt, pap only cares for $.   You wanna depend on them for help in $ when facing difficulty, no way.</p>

              <p>Boon Keng is traditionally a poorer area, totally unlike Serangoon Gardens. The old folks here will wait at around 6pm for this truck whose driver will buy their collected cardboxes. Please tell me you see old folks here pushing heavy cardboxes for many kilometres to their landed house from Boon Keng to Potong Pasir MRT ok?</p>
              <p>You might as well say if we see people sleeping on the streets, it's because our streets are extremely clean, cleaner than our beds even, and people are sleeping on the streets to enjoy nature (from mrbrownshow)... Duh... What's the point of taking extremes to compare (as in your flawed statistics of 1 single old man) when there are so many non-extremes around who are suffering?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the thing is, I don't even see any posters around there for such things. How to even tell them? All I see from the RC is banners advertising subsidized health checkups and courses on how to build a business.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>maybe it tells u that the failure of job governing for sporeans could mean that no one is really governing spore!even countries where people work as cowboys can earn more than sporean manager in any MNC company in spore!salary is bad...jobs are bad......wat else is bad???</p>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore's Goh Chock Tong visibly disappointed with brain drain</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Singapore's
              state controlled newspaper the Straits Times online edition of June 28,
              2009 has the article "Strong Wings Deep Roots. SM Goh urges schools to
              retain their emotional bonds to Singapore". <br><br>It shows a picture of him, looking down, clearly dejected, disppaointed. You have to look at his face. <br><br>He
              was speaking to 1000 guests at the 70th Anniversary of Chung Cheng High
              School where he said one out of three top students’ of the school who
              went overseas for an education never returned. What he said was true
              except for the fact that the figures were wrong. Very probably 2 out of
              every 3 students never returned. <br><br>One of them was I, Gopalan
              Nair. I had gone abroad for an education but did return only to be
              charged in court for contempt of court and being suspended from
              practicing law for 2 years. In 1991 I left for good and have never
              returned except for pleasure visits which eventually ended in my
              imprisonment for 3 months last year and a permanent prohibition from
              entering Singapore. <br><br>I have written about this many times in
              this blog. Emigration of the educated and skilled has progressively
              increased over the years that it is now an unstoppable flood with as
              many as 1000 a month taking up overseas permanent residence and 1000 a
              year giving up their citizenships.</p>
              <p>These émigrés not including the
              students who do not return is so large and continues unabated that it
              is now seriously affecting the ability of this country to survive. They
              have been trying to bring in replacements to cover the loss from
              Communist China and India but any right minded person can tell
              immediately that it will not work.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>These human imports are second rate
              for 2 reasons, first they would have preferred to go to Australia and
              failing that choice Singapore, and secondly, they have no intention of
              ever making Singapore home. No loyalty at all, only financial gain
              matters.</strong></span></span> Their other failures are a lack of English and ignorance of
              the British system of government that Singapore is supposedly based on.
              No European, American or Australian would want to make their home here,
              if they had any decency about them.<br><br>Goh Chock Tong deliberately
              feigns ignorance as to why this is happening when the reasons are
              staring him in his face. Why should any capable young man or woman with
              a good education or skills and with a bit of decency and principles
              about him want to stay in a country which:<br><br>1. Has no freedom of speech or expression?<br>2. Has no independent press? <br>3.
              Has a Lee Kuan Yew who pays himself $3 million a year and gives similar
              amounts to his son, after making him Prime Minister and pays the same
              obscene sum to every one of his good friends.<br>4. Where he abuses the
              law and shamelessly orders his judges such as Belinda Ang Saw Ean to
              order his political opponents to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars
              to Lee Kuan Yew for doing nothing but criticize?<br>5. A country which
              has turned entirely into robots unable to think or speak openly for
              fear of defamation actions brought on by Lee Kuan Yew through corrupt
              dishonest lawyers such as Davinder Singh? <br>6. A country which the International Bar Association has said has no rule of law or any independent judges? <br><br>There
              are a few dishonest men and women who would be prepared to stay but
              which mother of her son, or which young man or woman, if he had any
              decency would want to live the shameful lives that opportunists such as
              Lee Kuan Yew's defamation lawyer Davinder Singh lives, or like his
              corrupt judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean?<br><br>Almost every suggestion that
              Goh chock Tong makes in the article is downright ridiculous, as if he
              has no care whatsoever that Singaporeans too have a mind of their own.
              Let me give you the examples.<br><br>For instance, he says they should
              sink roots here even if they leave for good! Isn't that the height of
              incredulity! What, leave for good and yet sink roots in Singapore! How
              is that possible, Mr. Goh Chock Tong? Then he goes on to utter more
              gibberish and drivel, such as saying that Singaporeans should be like
              geese that migrate in winter but return in summer. Yes, Mr. Goh, that
              is what geese do. But we are not talking about geese. Human beings
              can’t live in 2 places. If they have gone, they live elsewhere. Not in
              Singapore. <br><br>And then he tries to appeal to their good nature,
              urging them to remember where they got their education and therefore
              they should be grateful to Singapore. But is Mr. Goh not forgetting
              something? Is it not the duty of the government, just as the duty of
              any other government, to provide an education?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And if so, why should
              any student be grateful for what they are entitled to anyway? </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>And
              besides, is he going to say that Singaporeans had a good education?<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Hardly. I went through Singapore education. It is bad. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It instills fear
              in children, not courage and curiosity for learning. It dwarfs a
              child's development and turns children into young robots. It is good to
              know that many children from Singapore do manage to go abroad despite
              the poor education they get. Education is not just book learning; it
              also includes the development of character, which Singapore students’
              lack. Australian, New Zealand, British and American children get much
              better education than the mediocre Singapore system. </strong></span></span><br><br>I have
              personally contributed to the brain drain by what had happened to me.
              In the 1980s I was punished as a lawyer in Singapore for no other
              reason but being a critic of the dictatorship in Singapore. I was
              charged for contempt of court for making an election rally speech at
              the 1991 Bukit Merah elections for suggesting that the Subordinate
              Court judiciary should be free of control by the Legal Service
              Commission, so as to give the impression of impartiality.</p>
              <p>Nothing wrong
              in what I said, but Judge Sinnuthuray at the behest of Lee Kuan Yew
              fined me $8,000.00 and costs. Next, when I questioned the Attorney
              General Tan Boon Teik about his statement over the late JB Jeyaretnam
              which were false, I was subjected to disciplinary proceedings and
              suspended from practicing law for 2 years. Both these cases were given
              extensive coverage in Singapore’s state controlled press so as to
              frighten similarly minded lawyers from ever challenging Lee and
              company. <br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>What do you think the effect of these cases had on
              the Singapore population, and especially on the legal profession?
              Immediately after the publicity of my cases in the Singapore press, I
              personally know that more and more Singapore lawyers began leaving the
              profession, mainly to Australia. Can anyone blame them?</strong></span></span> The Singapore
              legal system's reputation had sunk rock bottom. Lee Kuan Yew wanted to
              make it known that it was he who was master, not the law. Did you
              expect any honest lawyer to remain after this in Singapore? <br><br>Then
              there were the series of cases against the late JB Jeyaretnam and the
              ongoing never ending cases against Dr. Chee Soon Juan; the arrest of
              the "Marxist Conspirators", as Lee calls them; the series of cases
              against the foreign press; then my imprisonment?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You see the people
              including young men and women are not blind or shielded from this
              injustice that goes on there on a daily basis. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>An educated man would
              want to be able to engage in an intelligent debate and not fear
              imprisonment for it. Singapore is no place for an honest decent
              educated person. </strong></span></span>Neither is it for their families and their children.
              It is no place to bring up children, period.<br><br>It may be fine for
              the likes of people such as Davinder Singh who does it for money, but
              how many good parents would want their children to end up like him? <br><br>My
              concern and interest lies with the people of Singapore, not with this
              one party dictatorship. My advice to parents and young men and women in
              schools is this. If you have the chance to emigrate, do it.</p>
              <p>In
              Singapore, you will never be able to achieve your full potential.</p>
              <p>It is
              a one party state dictatorship with Lee Kuan Yew running the show
              together with his son placed there by him.</p>
              <p>If you want to succeed in
              it, you have to do whatever the father and son say. If you are prepared
              to live like that, fine. If not, get out now. And my best wishes to
              you. You would have made the right decision by leaving. <br><br>Singapore is s silly country. With a silly government. You would be wasting your time with it.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>as i drink my pepsi n think...............maybe goh chok tong meant those rambo and intelligent types from spore who will remain loyal n obedient to spore n went thru more than any normal sporean had ever been thru but had to leave spore.</p>
              <p>they left because spores policy didnt give much fighting chance in peacetime to its own citizens.it probably wont give much fighting chance in war time too.and whats the plan for u in 10 years time with what u are getting or will lose in future?is it all enough to live as a human being ........or as a homeless man without a home ...without food.....without a decent shower or savings.plus we have to fight with foreigners for jobs too.</p>
              <p>even a carpet salesman or supermarket salesman overseas in civiised countries earn enough to buy himself a fully paid car n house in  10 years.so from time they finish high school n work till they reach their early 30's......they would have S$380,000 at around age 31.can u get this in spore at age 40??so u virtually waste your youth with not much to gain in spore.might as well be in hell for eternity.</p>
              <p> i dont think people can even find a job easily with foreigners grabbin the same job in spore...n if they do get a job in spore...its all normally regarded as a joke in most civilised countries.</p>

              <p>Public officials are only representatives of our citizen and society, and reflective of society's desires or the lack of it. Any simpleton would realise that it takes MONEY to help the poor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Money as handout, money as opportunities, money to live on no matter how mean or meagre it is, be it a loaf of bread daily only, but not just for one old aunty, but for the entire aging population, education, healthcare, etc,etc.</p>

              <p><br>WHERE is the money that Temasek made? It made $114 b in profit, as the venerable finance minister himself said, before losing most of it to American banks. Why wasn't a part of that money set apart for social spending?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyone knows that investment returns are supposed to fatten the reserves, for a rainy day, which is a good thing. But even if 100 billion had been pumped back into reserves, there would still be 14 billion, a helluva lot of money that could have brightened the lives of many poor folk. Instead, the govt chose to reinvest all that money, and we all know what happened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps you should stop being stubborn and consider the possibility of social spending without 40% GST!</p>

              <p>Our country is very fragile in term of it geopolitical location and situation, we must show our might so as to deter others onlookers taking us on as mouse who got no guts and weapons, in any countries you go, defence and arm forces occupied the most heavy budget in their agendas. And afterall, National Day is a country birthday, a pride for us to celebrate and show our might.</p>
