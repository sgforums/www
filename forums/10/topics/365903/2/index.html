              <p>as if so easy my friend! by that time, more than 80% of the population are foriegners and how to overthrow them?and maybe that's the reason they start to give out PR and red ic to them as easy as ABC! Our culture, the lasak, chicken rice... will go down history and replace by their philippine, china or vietnam food liao!!!</p>

              <p>When you take a ride on the MRT, you faced hordes of indian,china,asian workers, espacially on weekends, similarly at rest and recreation facillities on our island. It is jam packed with hordes and makes you think Singapore are populated with foreigners.</p>
              <p>But that is only a <strong>PERCEPTION</strong> and not based on facts. The truth is that these workers are only here working on our massive infrastructure projects known as IR, which is in the critical final phases whereby a large labour force is required, jobs of which Singaporean shun or feel that they would not pay enough.</p>
              <p>Another 2-3 years and these massive large labourforce will be gone, when the IR projects are completed. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But</span> it will be replaced by another pool of foriegners - well heeled tourists.</p>
              <p>You will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALWAYS</span> be facing foriegners in Singapore. It contributes substantially to our economy and will be more so when the IR is completed. This is a reality you will face, and for what?.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The reason</span> is because we need to grow. In an equal society, every individual has the right to grow up and take his/her place in the halls of opportunities, in the work place and in social life. In order to partake in this citizenship birthright, leaders will have to ensure there must be sustainable economic growth for opportunities to be present for all, not only today, but for our tomorrows as well.</p>
              <p>Thus the reason to expand, not only in Singapore, but to the world as well. While we cannot use might to seize control of other nations, we can garner wealth for the furtherance of our society by economic might as Japan and Germany did in the 70s.</p>
              <p>For that to happen, we will need a large amount of funds for education, to give our next generation of employees and leaders a better education and eradicate the peasant mentality we were all born with, as evident in our local bosses who circumvent labour laws and hired excessive foreigners to secure more profit instead of giving our locals a chance and share profits more equitably - something called social responsibility which is lacking by bosses, espacially in these difficult times.</p>
              <p>Such revenue will come partially from tourism, which accounts for the sacrifices made by all citizens today for our future.</p>
              <p><br>BUT does that mean, in mingling with foriegners, we loose our identity as Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>NO. Singapore is only a name, a piece of rock. Your home is where your heart is - made up of your parents and previous generations where they lived, and collectively made this piece of rock great. This is place where you grew up, along with your peers and friends.</p>
              <p>Some will fly away from their nests, but many more will remain, and those who remain, are yours and my fellow citizens where we grew up with and contributed to our society collectively, for our future generations. This is our only home.</p>
              <p>Politicians will change, political scenaries may change, but what NEVER will change is the collective memories of us all growing up on this island in peace, studying, working and improving our rule of law and equal society, with the right of say but based on majority vote on the direction to move forward into the future, something NO foriegners will ever get to do here, amidst the turbulence and turmoil of other nations.</p>
              <p>( I hope my language and writing used is simple enuff for all to comprehend.)</p>

              <p>But we have now a third generation leader with a 3rd generation educated population who will be moved by rationality rather than emotions or presumed slights, and will choose wisely, be it for the ruling party or the opposition, but they must be the ones who can lead the nation as our previous had done, elevating our society and ensuring no one gets left behind in our society.</p>
              <p>The next generation of leaders must evolved and be enlightened to improve upon the neccessary foundations built by our founding fathers, and that enlightenment will have to begin now if it had not already be done, by leading through example, this generation of adults that is made up of you and me.</p>

              <p>Competition is good in society. But too much of it translates into nasty politics that deprives humanity.</p>
              <p>You know if there is too much division between the rich and poor Singapore society, whereby the PAP government is believed by most people to represent the rich, it will end up like India.</p>
              <p>India, for milleniums  and centuries since the dawn of civilisation, has been using the caste system to divide the outcaste and other classes of society. This continues until only to be broken by Gandhi during its independence. But even now, I heard, remnants of this tradition still surfaces. For example, in Mumbai, the rich have been notoriously known for their murders of the poors from time to time. I ever heard a rich gangster can barge into a house of poor and shoot down the whole family, without even letting off the innocent kids.</p>
              <p>This also happened during pre - Mao China during the reigns of the warlords of the 10s to the 30s.</p>
              <p>So, my point is, this is a constant reminder for the government to really understand the plight of what most Singaporeans are going through now in the midst of this recession.</p>

              <p>there is this uncle, aged about 70+ a patient at a nearby polyclinic who due to some carelessness, tore the skin above his thumb. he goes to the polyclinic for "dressing" of his wounds every 3 days at no charges. fully paid by the government as he's on the community care scheme which enables him to visit doctors at government medical centres for free until he sees the Maker. he was accompanied by a "volunteer" (not really a volunteer cos' they are paid) to the clinic for every visit which he also do not pay for. i was told that he was given food and groceries every week. amounts that could last them for a week, just nice.</p>
              <p>my wife like him alot for he reminds her of her demised grandfather so she did asked if he needed money. he said no... he has no need for lots of money, just companionship. he lived in those small HDB which he rent from a friend a about 200 - 300 a month... he told my mrs that he receive some allowance about the RC every month and he is pretty happy with the help he received... he is just lonely at times but what he received tides him over substantially...</p>
              <p>so indirectly, did we Singaporeans pay for his "living" cost now?</p>

              <p>because they were not told where to get help from? let's be honest; there are a lot of government department that we do not know about to get help from.</p>
              <p>for 1; do you know if you are retrenched and couldn't find a replacement job immediately, you can get a allowance of (if i'm not wrong) $500 for 3 months before they review your case again? i know a guy that has been on this scheme for 1 year before he found a job. also when you approach them for the $500, you are given job placement opportunities based on your qualification and experience and of course your interested job scopes.</p>
              <p>it's a matter of us, who knows the "round about" of the system to stretch our hands out and reach out for those who do not know and are suffering.</p>

              <p>no I don't know that</p>
              <p>and if it is true, I'm wondering why isn't it better made known to people, especially in times of recession and many retrenchments? I do know people who are retrenched who aren't even aware such a scheme exists.</p>
              <p>If what you said is true, I really wonder why RC residents or MPs walking around the estate seeing such things do not even automatically go to extend this help to these poor old folks?</p>
              <p>lastly, if there are many govt departments that we do not
                                          know about which we can get help from, then what are these deparments even around in the first place when not many pple know about it? To help only a selected few?</p>

              <p>have you not seen posters hanging around recently?</p>
              <p>"if you have financial difficulties or you know someone who needs help, please call 6xxx xxxx"</p>
              <p>the MPs who go around estates always ask, "do you need any help" when they go door to door... this i can testify cos' Mr. Teo came knocking and asked me the same question.</p>
              <p>why the departments are not openly advertised? friend, they are... if you need help with a quarrel with a neighbour, when a school is making too much noise in the morning or a group of teenagers always hanging around in the playground in the wee hours of morning and making a din, where do you go? Meet The MP Session...</p>
              <p>over there; all doors available are open to you.</p>
