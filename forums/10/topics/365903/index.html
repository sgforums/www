              <p>Steven G , i really empathise with u man. This Gahmen n all the
                                      rubbish talk abt helping his people are bullshit i think. What i
                                      see now is even doctors in my family are leaving town and settling
                                      overseas permanently. It is not because the land is greener on the
                                      other side. It is because the country do not cherish its local
                                      talents. Y cherish when they can always import from overseas. Even
                                      the athletes representing OUR COUNTRY( i almost forgot i have one)
                                      are imported from overseas.</p>
              <p>This country is losing its people. I was so proud to be a
                                      Singaporean 15 years ago. I remember sitting in the Kallang Stadium
                                      and waving the Singapore flag proudly on our National Day. Now, i
                                      got laughed by my foreign friends for being a Singaporean. They
                                      laughed at my country for being so unfair to his people. Even one
                                      of my friends from China have the audacity to say that they will be
                                      the ones governing our country someday.</p>
              <p>Today, Singapore has become like the US. I won't be surprise in
                                      10 years time, there ill be an Obama from China standing on
                                      the podium and addressing us on National Day parade.(I will be so
                                      disgust and perhaps dig a hole n bury myself). A country
                                      that is packed with immigrants. Please don't give me rubbish about
                                      my ancestry. I was borned and raised here. The Gahmen is giving our
                                      PRs like nobody business, cause they r the Gahmen. Even my friend
                                      who just got her PR after studying for 3 years here at a local poly
                                      out of her own pocket money sighed at the fact that another girl
                                      who came and worked as a waitress also got her PR. She wonder why
                                      she even care to get a diploma when any father's mother's son or
                                      daughter who fly in from their foreign lands can just stem their
                                      roots here and claim worthy to be a Singaporean.</p>

              <p>It could finally temper the people to overthrow the PAP regime.</p>

              <p>China's liberation movement,

              from that of any previous period. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Although the domestic and foreign forces
              opposing it have caused it serious setbacks, at the same time they have tempered
              the Chinese people...</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Chinese people will become tempered in the course of this long and
              ruthless war. </strong></span></span>The political parties taking part in the war will also be steeled
              and tested. The united front must be persevered in; only by persevering in
              the united front can we persevere in the war; and only by persevering in
              the united front and in the war can we win final victory. Only thus can all
              difficulties be overcome. After travelling the hard stretch of road we shall
              reach the highway to victory. This is the natural logic of the war...</p>

              <p>That is a very reactionary view fostered by repressive rule.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Before the War of Resistance, there was a great deal of talk about national
              subjugation. Some said, "China is inferior in arms and is bound to lose in
              a war." Others said, "If China offers armed resistance, she is sure to become
              another Abyssinia." Since the beginning of the war, open talk of national
              subjugation has disappeared, but secret talk, and quite a lot of it too,
              still continues. For instance, from time to time an atmosphere of compromise
              arises and the advocates of compromise argue that "the continuance of the
              war spells subjugation".<strong>[<a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_09.htm#bm1">1</a>]</strong> In a letter from Hunan
              a student has written:</p>
              <p class="quote">In the countryside everything seems difficult. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Doing propaganda work on my
                own, I have to talk to people when and where I find them. The people I have
                talked to are by no means ignoramuses; they all have some understanding of
                what is going on and are very interested in what I have to say. But when
                I run into my own relatives, they always say: "China cannot win; she is doomed."</strong></span></span> They make one sick ! Fortunately, they do not go around spreading their views,
                otherwise things would really be bad. The peasants would naturally put more
                stock in what they say.</p>
              <p>Such exponents of the theory of China's inevitable subjugation form the social
              basis of the tendency to compromise. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They are to be found everywhere in China</strong></span></span>,
              and therefore the problem of compromise is liable to crop up within the
              anti-Japanese front at any time and will probably remain with us right until
              the end of the war. Now that Hsuchow has fallen and Wuhan is in danger, it
              will not be unprofitable, I think, to knock the bottom out of the theory
              of national subjugation...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Do we deny the danger of national subjugation?</strong></span></span> No, we do not. We recognize
              that China faces two possible prospects, liberation or subjugation, and that
              the two are in violent conflict. Our task is to achieve liberation and to
              avert subjugation. The conditions for liberation are China's progress, which
              is basic, the enemy's difficulties, and international support. We differ
              from the subjugationists.</p>
              <p>Taking an objective and all-sided view, we recognize
              the two possibilities of national subjugation and liberation, stress that
              liberation is the dominant possibility, point out the conditions for its
              achievement, and strive to secure them.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The subjugationists, on the other
              hand, taking a subjective and one-sided view, recognize only one possibility,
              that of subjugation; they do not admit the possibility of liberation, and
              still less point out the conditions necessary for liberation or strive to
              secure them. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Moreover, while acknowledging the tendency to compromise and
              the corruption, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>we see other tendencies and phenomena which, we indicate,
              will gradually prevail and are already in violent conflict with the former</strong></span></span>;
              in addition, we point out the conditions necessary for the healthy tendencies
              and phenomena to prevail, and we strive to overcome the tendency to compromise
              and to change the state of corruption. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Therefore, contrary to the pessimists,
              we are not at all down-hearted... </strong></span></span></p>

              <p>And for sports! To play for you country is a great thing, Because of you the country binds together feeling Proud. You dont farking bring a chinamen who doesnt know shit about this country nor have grown up here and gone thru the school system and know what it feels like living in a heartland, They dont even understand this society, they dont talk or act like us. A person brought up here regardless of their race or religion acts and talks the same.</p>
              <p>So what if singapore silver in ping-pong, 3/4 of the locals dont give a fark. And the reason always is this person in not local. The news says we are proud! do a poll and 3/4 doesnt give a hoot, let a local born citizen win it, and i know everyone will be proud, i know i will even if i hate that sport.</p>

              <p>i can go on and on about all the bad stuffs in singapore but i rather scratch my balls for now.</p>

              <p>We have enough smart singaporeans in our country to be able to take over to form a new government. We have singaporeans who are 10 times smarter than the stupid Lee Hsien Loong who will govern Singapore 10 times better than him.</p>

              <p>I think the civil service and ministries of Singapore are managed quite well.</p>
              <p>Our country is a small one after all.</p>
              <p>Even without cabinet ministers, I am sure that the country can still function well.</p>
              <p>There was no proper government in Belgium for 9 months in 2007-2008.</p>
