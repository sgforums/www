              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Fact is, you are still unable to
              answer why is it that money is rather spent on so many NDP stuff,
              yet little is spent on these old folks? -eagle</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NDP is a day where we citizens celebrate our independence
              together as one. It is a gala pagent event, only once in a
              year for us to feel and treasure that moment in time shared across
              all ages the anniversary day we became free to decide and determine
              our future as a society, free from colonial discrimination and
              robbery.</span></p>
              <p>As such, there will be costs involved. Nothing is free. All the
              committee can do and had done is to ensure that the costs are kept
              low and contracted out fairly.</p>
              <p>Personally, I dont need such reminders, for I love my country -
              made up by my family, relatives and friends as well as yours. I
              would prefer it go to feed the old uncles and aunties, even if such
              monies can only feed them for a day, and I will frown again
              tomorrow when they go hungry.</p>
              <p>But that's me. There are others who shares my society, and
              should not be deprived of the gala and joyous event, the reminders
              of our national achievements and milestones, as well as the
              pomp and pagentry on a national level.</p>
              <p>I had not avoided your specific questions. Now, my question to
              you. Where and how do you intend to ensure social spending costs
              can be provided without incurring increase in taxes, failing which
              should you have no answer, would you support your elected
              representatives' call for more contribution from you towards
              it?</p>
