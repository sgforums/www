              still complaining about singapore when  he has successfully
              gotten himself out of singapore????</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does he feel more miserable or happy when he continue to blame
              this and that in singapore.... ???? Or is it is inner wisdom has
              told him that he has made a wrong choice to leave singapore.. that
              is why he is still continuing whining about singapore instead of
              living happily in the place he thinks that it is good...</p>

              <p>I, am very happy, and very grateful, for singapore status at

              <p>My life is not easy now in singapore but i am not complaining...
              its is good enough.. There are still enough resources to grab that
              i can improve myself and my situation in singapore...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Internet forum are like that... its is an extremely easy form of

              <p><br> u ask the N korean why are they spending so much on missile and
                  nuclear rather than to take care of their own starving
                  citizens?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At least singapore is more balance in a way, and spending is the
                  key to economic churning too, if all dun spent, we come into a
                  stand still, then maybe you and i will be begging on the street. Of
                  course i agree with your sentiment toward aging peoples, but let
                  face it, what does an aging person contribute?? they are actually
                  the attribute to the society, but we of course never neglect them,
                  by providing food, shelter and medication, what else do you want to
                  give them, beers, disco, pubs, tours and credit cards ar??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our country is very fragile in term of it geopolitical location
                  and situation, we must show our might so as to deter others
                  onlookers taking us on as mouse who got no guts and weapons, in any
                  countries you go, defence and arm forces occupied the most heavy
                  budget in their agendas. And afterall, National Day is a country
                  birthday, a pride for us to celebrate and show our might.</p>

              <p>I agree with your thoughts on spending, but spending on useless stuff as excessive banners for NDP? An aging person might not contribute much at present, but they have contributed a lot in the past. If the govt wants to talk about filial piety at home, i.e. respect for the elders, etc, etc, why are they not becoming a role model by first giving more perks to the needy older folks who are around?</p>
              <p>Again, I have already said defence is a necessary cost. But NDP? What does it contribute other than the valid point you mentioned that spending is what drives the economy? Then again, spending on food for old folks is also spending that could drive the economy as well!</p>

              <p>NDP is a day where we citizens celebrate our independence together as one. It is a gala pagent event, only once in a year for us to feel and treasure that moment in time shared across all ages the anniversary day we became free to decide and determine our future as a society, free from colonial discrimination and robbery.</p>
              <p>As such, there will be costs involved. Nothing is free. All the committee can do and had done is to ensure that the costs are kept low and contracted out fairly.</p>
              <p>Personally, I dont need such reminders, for I love my country - made up by my family, relatives and friends as well as yours. I would prefer it go to feed the old uncles and aunties, even if such monies can only feed them for a day, and I will frown again tomorrow when they go hungry.</p>
              <p>But that's me. There are others who shares my society, and should not be deprived of the gala and joyous event, the reminders of our national achievements and milestones, as well as the pomp and pagentry on a national level.</p>
              <p>I had not avoided your specific questions. Now, my question to you. Where and how do you intend to ensure social spending costs can be provided without incurring increase in taxes, failing which should you have no answer, would you support your elected representatives' call for more contribution from you towards it?</p>

              <p>NDP is a day where we citizens celebrate our independence
              together as one. It is a gala pagent event, only once in a
              year for us to feel and treasure that moment in time shared across
              all ages the anniversary day we became free to decide and determine
              our future as a society, free from colonial discrimination and
              robbery.</p>
              <p>As such, there will be costs involved. Nothing is free. All the
              committee can do and had done is to ensure that the costs are kept
              low and contracted out fairly.</p>
              <p>Personally, I dont need such reminders, for I love my country -
              made up by my family, relatives and friends as well as yours. I
              would prefer it go to feed the old uncles and aunties, even if such
              monies can only feed them for a day, and I will frown again
              tomorrow when they go hungry.</p>
              <p>But that's me. There are others who shares my society, and
              should not be deprived of the gala and joyous event, the reminders
              of our national achievements and milestones, as well as the
              pomp and pagentry on a national level.</p>
              <p>I had not avoided your specific questions. Now, my question to
              you. Where and how do you intend to ensure social spending costs
              can be provided without incurring increase in taxes, failing which
              should you have no answer, would you support your elected
              representatives' call for more contribution from you towards
              it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You still fail to (or perhaps still unable to) answer to the point. Let me rephrase. Question is, why is it spent on NDP banners instead of spending on the old folks. Key phrase: Instead of.</p>

              <p>First part does not stand at all because I'm specifically pointing out that money spent on banners can be spent on these old folks. We do not need to increase taxes for this; and it is a duh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Second part of your question doesn't even reflect the impression you have given earlier that you rather spend the money for people to enjoy and reminise about past
              events than for old folks who aren't certain whether they will have a
              full meal the next day.</p>
              <p>Not only that, if they just make it law that you have to contribute more, you still have to. Does it matter whether you support?</p>
              <p>Also, it depends on where their call for more contribution goes to, and whether it really goes there.</p>
              <p>Finally, those elected representatives are not voted in by me, so I won't consider them as <strong>my </strong>elected representatives. They are just in my eyes, elected representatives.</p>

              nearly all stuffs are sponsored, the peoples performing and

              bosses, drink by yeo's, food by many others etc etc, the only

              <p>Before the national day, canvassing is done to get millions from

Do you know that town council and the Recreation committee use to canvas thru shops and hawker owners during national day, MPs will be busy going around, shaking hands and seeing to their problems, market stalls, coffee shops ++ all these are the sponsorship under their Council or group. And when the chinese festival like CNY or ghost festival, the MPs on behalf of the govt allow them to celebrate, give free electricity, water and space for them. And most also invite MPs and Ministers for dinner. The PAP also make most of these big shop bosses to be the town RC top members like treasurers, chairmanship etc etc...these is how the grassrood level works. Every time National Day come my pub ask for money!!! Damn, 7 month ghost festival also ask me to give money to attend, how can??? I celebrate 666 day ok</p>

              <p><br>The Old folks are well taken care of, some of these old folks are just too stubborn and like to have freedom and work as cleaner or card collector. Most of them, their childrens are top executives and some living in private apartment too, so dun alway think our old folks are in poor conditon, like my ah ma, ask her to stay at home, she said she rather go and die, stay inside my pub, all customers run away, cos she old old liao mah, all Uncle thot old folk pub. So in the end, she go behind the coffeeshop to wash plates for the good kopitiam towkay. Well, as long as she is happy, what to do?? Life is something about doing what you are happy at. I know your good heart, but dun get too emotion, Singaporeans all have good heart, if not huang Nan mother wouldn't become rich.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MNCs also give to charity, when you canvas for funds, you hv to be frank with people, if it is for celebration, the boss of MNC will be glad to support the govt and let us have a nice good day of fireworks where not only Singaporean enjoy, so do the whole world.</p>

              forthright and straightforward they were. Indeed, the rational
              readers will see how you failed to answer what I asked, and ask
              totally unrelated questions to throw the point off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In short, you did not answer anything, but chose to digress
              ask totally unrelated questions of which I have properly given you
              an answer as to why your question does not stand. It puts serious
              doubt on you.</p>
              <p>Whatever, be it intelligence or anything, I will leave it to you
              since this is an online forum anyway. You are entitled to post your
              rubbish around. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks again for enlightening me on the fact that you are of the
              same calibre as our dear missing Gazelle, and slightly better than
              our dear lionnoisy.</p>
