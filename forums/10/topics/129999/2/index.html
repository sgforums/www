            <div class='col-md body'>the JW have totally went against biblical teachings. they went against authority when the bible preached obedience to authority and the neccessity to take up arms to defend yourself and God's word when the time comes. sure many people say Christianity is a "wussy" faith which preaches peace to everything but come on and use some common sense, when you are attacked or htreatened you have the right to take up arms and protect yourself instead of sitting down there and letting yourself be a free target for would be agressors.</div>

If all nations were to practice disarmament and put a cap on armed service numbers, there would be greater chances for peace all around.<br><br>Ayyway, +1 to this thread. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
