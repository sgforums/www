              <p>without a mandate, how can they do it, the winner of the
              election will be in control, by then whether the health cost goes
              up higher or lower, nobody is going to know, the only thing i know
              of is that if PAP lost, the stock market will tumble to the very
              bottom, and many people will scramble and leave this country, most
              FDI and MNC will pullout, leaving a shell of jobless, riot and
              uncertain future. Mostly like we will move back by 5 years or maybe
              even 10 years, and it will takes another 50 years for Singapore to
              be what it is now.</p>

              <p>No, history taught us that any changes must go thru revolution of struggle before stablisation set in, just like you change your house, you need to adjust to it, and in a way you will hv certain arguement and disagreement with your family members.</p>
              <p>Moreover, PAP and opposition are humans, that will make it more worst. The question here is that peoples in other countries changed govt or rebel because of severe hardship and injustice in life. So, do need to change the govt??</p>
              <p>When oppositions took over, clashes will happen between several group of opposition including the PAP, power struggler in the parliament will spill into the town and places all over Singaporean, there may even be bloodshed if peoples go out of senses. All these will bring singapore to a complete standstill, regional countries will be laughing at us and also in a way, make it more worst. And worst still,  racial riot may come into the picture again and I will be booking the first flight back to Taichong.</p>
              <p>Now, for the sake of the citizens of Singapore, let there be peace, afterall, we are not suffering any major hardship as many others in other countries who went thru a revolution. I understand you people anguish on some of the govt policies, but you got to be objectives, some argued because they hated LKY past doing and in turn, everything the govt did is deem wrong. That's is personal, you cannot bring that to champion yourself and let others suffered with you.</p>

              <p>No, history taught us that any changes must go thru revolution of struggle before stablisation set in, just like you change your house, you need to adjust to it, and in a way you will hv certain arguement and disagreement with your family members.</p>
              <p>Moreover, PAP and opposition are humans, that will make it more worst. The question here is that peoples in other countries changed govt or rebel because of severe hardship and injustice in life. So, do need to change the govt??</p>
              <p>When oppositions took over, clashes will happen between several group of opposition including the PAP, power struggler in the parliament will spill into the town and places all over Singaporean, there may even be bloodshed if peoples go out of senses. All these will bring singapore to a complete standstill, regional countries will be laughing at us and also in a way, make it more worst. And worst still,  racial riot may come into the picture again and I will be booking the first flight back to Taichong.</p>
              <p>Now, for the sake of the citizens of Singapore, let there be peace, afterall, we are not suffering any major hardship as many others in other countries who went thru a revolution. I understand you people anguish on some of the govt policies, but you got to be objectives, some argued because they hated LKY past doing and in turn, everything the govt did is deem wrong. That's is personal, you cannot bring that to champion yourself and let others suffered with you.</p>

              <p>You are just another PAP lackey that warns of extreme consequences should they fall. Frankly, please don't make us laugh, though I would say I would send you off should you wish to fly back to Taichong permanently. After all, we do not need disloyal PRs like you.</p>
              <p>And your comparisons are all incorrect. We are talking about a legitimate election where the PAP lost its power legally to the opposition. Your discussion is about revolts, or riots, or revolutions that do not follow the constitution of the law. Frankly, it's totally out of context. Thailand was in a mess because of a military coup, which is not constitutional, as an example.</p>
              <p>Coming back to legitimate elections, was Taiwan in a mess when the KMT won the presidential elections? Was USA in a mess when the president changed from a Democrat to a Republican and vice versa?</p>
              <p>If you wish to bring up history, then kindly not be myopic about it, and only focus on extreme events.</p>
