              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: In what is likely to be a landmark case for the charity sector, 26—year—old Rajendren Rajamani — the man behind three charities that were set up to help children — will be sentenced on Thursday.</p>
              <div id="adlrec">
              <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td align="center"><span style="font-family: arial;">ADVERTISEMENT</span><br></td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              
              </div>
              <p>Children of Singapore Foundation, Children’s Leukaemia Foundation and Club Sunshine were shut down in 2007 after the Commissioner of Charities found serious irregularities and suspicious transactions in their accounts.</p>
              <p>Investigations had shown that much of the funds that were raised made its way to Rajendren’s pocket.</p>
              <p>Of the S$69,000 in the Children of Singapore Foundation account, S$47,300 went to Rajendren for his personal expenses, S$20,700 went to his girlfriend, Cindy Ong, and S$1,000 to his friend, Dominic Joseph.</p>
              <p>To cover his tracks, he admitted that he falsified payment vouchers, invoices, financial aid payouts and the accounts of the charities.</p>
              <p>He also misappropriated over S$42,000 in donation proceeds which he was supposed to hand over to New Hope Community Services, giving them some S$9,000 instead. No restitution has been made.</p>
              <p>Rajendren, who has been in remand since his arrest last December, has pleaded guilty to 26 out of 90 charges, ranging from criminal breach of trust to forgery.</p>
              <p>In mitigation, his lawyers said he started off with noble intentions, but faltered along the way, committing a series of crimes. He had since cooperated fully with the police.</p>
              <p>This case is the first major case where the accused has pleaded guilty after stringent charity rules kicked in back in 2007.</p>
              <p>Lawyers said this would likely set a precedent for other charity—related cases, such as the recently completed trial of former Ren Ci CEO Ming Yi</p>

              <p>There is a lot of media coverage and disproportionate attention.</p>

              <p>This reminds me of AWARE.</p>
              <p>There was heavy coverage of AWARE coups and counter-coups, and I see that the media is tilting towards favouring the counter-coupers. Then religious leaders got put up in newspapers emphasizing about how "Singapore is secular"</p>

              <p>AWARE and  Ren Ci trial,</p>
              <p>All these necessary dramas to distract good honest hardworking Singaporeans from the fact that they are getting fucked by the upper 5% on a daily basis so that our beloved government can continue to pay themselves salaries higher than the US President and tell us that they can't do shit about the Singapore economy unless the US economy improves.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>It is good that a guilty verdict has been delivered and that Ming Yi and his boyfriend now stand convicted of dipping into Ren Ci's funds for personal use, then lying about it when found out. However I hope that the guilty verdict will result in a significant custodial prison sentence and not just a fine, so that it serves as a deterrent to anyone else who might think of regarding charity funds donated by generous and well-intentioned benefactors as being money at their disposal for personal use. Anyway what is the use of giving a fine to someone holding nearly $500,000 in his personal bank account and who might just as easily con one of his richer devotees into paying the fine for him.? You will  recall that we were earlier informed that his bail money was provided for him by a rich devotee. At least he cannot persuade anyone to go to jail for him.</p></div>

              <p>With a Judiciary that is also "sensitive" to the needs of the Executive Branch of the Government, do you seriously believe that anyone will be sent to prison ?</p>
              <p>The sensitivities of the Buddhist Community will have to be considered.</p>
              <p>With an election around the corner, the Buddhist Community forms a significant block of voters that will need to be pacified in such a short period of time, when there are also other issues that are grinding into everyone's lives and pockets.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Surely, Atobe, you are not suggesting that the Buddhist community, (either Sangha or lay), knowing now how this individual has dragged the good name of the monkhood into the mud through his actions and lifestyle, would continue to support him? He is totally discredited. The Justiciary quite rightly sent Father Kang to jail for his criminal action irrespective of Catholic sensitivities. Maybe I am naive but I trust the independence of the Justiciary enough to believe they will act responsibly to demonstrate that charity funds can be safely kept out of the hands of criminals, and that any crook who does will repay by going to jail. We need to know that when we give money to charity it will be used for the purpose we intend, and not for redecorating flats belonging to the charity CEO's boyfriend.</p></div>
