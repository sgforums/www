              In our country, the political leaders sets no example for others and inspires nothing.
              
              They could have set the example for this monk and TT Durai.
              
              Yes, they do inspire one thing: scorn.

              Considering that he started up Ren Ci by himself and turned it around to help many less fortunate people, im sure that he deserves at least 10k salary even taking account that he is a monk.  
              
              Think of it this way, next time you or your family member have some costly illness and can't afford to pay the medical bills, who is going to or has the ability to raise millions of donations to help you?
              
              This case is very different from Durai who was over-charging his patients, and putting them in a worse financial position then if they were to go to another gov hospital.

              <p>i mean the salary of monk is subjective+ moral issue.</p>

              <p>the CEO of capitaland also rake in 20million bonus in 2007( i think) when Capitalland rake in billion of profits. Do you think he deserve it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all i can say is, as long as the salary of executive of charity organisation is make know to public or govt, and if ppl still want to donate, this is no issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ming Yi case is the more on his dishonesty on his assistant and failure as a monk to ensure his assistant also have moral standards.</p>

              <p>actually one might wana consider why he actually talked about
              his life story on tuesday. What relevance does it bring to
              misappropriation of accounts?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe he really does have a painful and enduring journey to
              bring ren ci up but it seemed like a ploy to gain sympathy with
              those tears. Crocodile ones i wouldnt say it is lol but he did
              work in a reptile skin shop before? hehe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Imagine if jesus is still living till today and he pays himself
              $30,000 a month because he is king of the christian world. That's
              so wtf right?</p>

              <p>Anyway, grandma said that i should not celebrate birthday, not only we are getting older, birthday celebration is also noted by the death and birth registra of Heaven. The saints above will take note of your age and review the time for you to go. If you dun celebrate, they might missed it and forget about you, so you can live long and stay forever young.
