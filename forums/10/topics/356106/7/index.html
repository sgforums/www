              <p>Luxury condo in Singapore containing pornographic videos, properties and luxury cars in Australia and the US, horses, membership of exclusive country clubs, several platinum credit cards....when and where is it going to end? I really find it hard to believe that a member of the sangha (a Buddhist monk) who is also the abbot of several monasteries and has vowed to lead a life of renunciation and detachment from material possessions could get away with this for so long. Leaving aside whether there may also have been criminal activity because this has not yet been proven in a court of law, and innocence is assumed until proven guilty, how was this lifestyle possible? Were his fellow monks and devotees blind to what was going on, or did they really not care? When questioned about the propriety of Buddhist monks personally owning properties in other countries overseas, his defence was "many people had that". In other words, provided other members of the sangha betray everything that the sangha stands for then it is justifiable for him to do the same. I find it truly unbelievable that a senior member of the sangha in our community would hold such an attitude. </p>
              <p>I am curious to know whether this individual continues to be the Secretary of the Singapore Buddhist Federation, and if so, for how long? Irrespective of whether or not he is found guilty in a court of law, should this man be allowed to continue the sham of pretending to live a life of renunciation and detachment as abbot and spiritual leader of several monasteries when his real life-style consists of extravagent self-indulgence and luxury? I think not.</p>

              <p>ya true in a way. but he is already convicted in the minds of sg for life. why he has to go work in middle east, simply cos no company in sg would want to hire him. if he go out anywhere in sg, he get stares from bystanders and in extreme cases, there might be people who will want to spit or insult him.</p>

              There are more to come...Anyone still remeber the Youth Challenge case?  Unfortunately those who pay the most for the crimes are always the needys in the charity organisation.
              
              Say if you stop donating to NKF, Ren Ci now as a result of the scandal, who suffers the most?  Is it the patients or the management?

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Courier New"; '>Modern Times <br><br>I remembered three years ago I was learning yoga at a gym. A Yoga master from India was teaching there. One day while early for the class I had a chance encounter with the master at the side of the swimming pool. We Chatted a while, the master asked me if I would be watching the charity show that evening. I said that I’d never watch this type of TV fund-raising programs and will never donated, because there just has been a NKF incident previously. Master asked: I heard that the monk is going to perform "climb high, high." I told him that monk is someone of great capability; commanding a monthly income of tens of thousands, "climb high, high" is just a piece of cake for him. After listening to me comment, the master responded in great surprise, as he had a few students back in India who are monks, but they are very different from the monks here. Masters replied coldly: It seems to me that he is not really a monk! <br><br>At that time, I thought how could we compare the standard of living between India and our country? Singapore is a developed nation. Living with colorful lifestyle in this modern era, one's thinking and way of life has to be adjusted in order to survive. <br><br>Indeed, it is a very different era. The common teaching amongst monk that “all space-directions are void” (</span><span style="font-family: SimSun;   ">å››å¤§çš†ç©º</span><span style='font-family: "Courier New"; '>) has found a new interpretation. Monks who devoted themselves wholeheartedly and selflessly to service the public during office hours, should also have private time to engage in some personal preferences, such as the sale of real estate, travel abroad, go diving, buy car, breed horse, playing golf, etc. Isn’t that what people used to do? Of course, in this era, besides making plans for the future, loyalty is still very important. When friends are in trouble, one should provide help immediately. Anyway, public money supply is unlimited. If it is not enough, all needed is to go on TV and shout or weep a bit, soon lots of money will flood in. So if money is lent temporary for emergency, then returned back to the pool quietly, while in the process without cause disturbance to the operations of the charity organization, is there anything wrong with that? Isn’t that banks are operating in this manner? Public please do not panic! In the midst of financial tsunami, with rising unemployment rate, the same sum of money that can do charity and at the same time achieving personal dreams and also bailing friends out of difficulties, isn’t that a great deed?</span></p>

              <p>The most recent revelation in court last Friday of this man's extravagance and self-indulgence is staggering. But do you know what sticks in my throat? I am sure most of you remember his stage appearances on tv. He stood on stage with what we now know were crocodile tears running down his face begging ordinary decent people to donate generously to Ren Ci. Many thousands of ordinary decent people have donated and their generosity has helped many elderly poor sick people. We are rightly proud of their decency and generosity. They are good people! What is nauseating is now knowing that the person standing there begging with tears running down his cheeks was spending money like water and thought nothing about spending $2000 a month on the upkeep of a horse. The hypocrisy is beyond belief.</p>

              As the story unfolds, we see more &amp; more dirty linings exposed in the public.  The monk is not as innocent as it seems intially.  The more he defends himself, the more ridiculous he gets.
              
              _______________________________________________
              
              (Extract)
              
              One terse exchange took place when DPP Singh suggested that Ming Yi's 'evidence that you were so selflessly motivated to look after Ren Ci and Fook Hai Ch'an (Monastery)' was 'an embellishment'.
              
              The monk said: 'I think actions speak louder than words.' He added that others would know what he had done for Ren Ci.
              
              To that, DPP Singh said: 'Yes, indeed, your actions did speak louder than words in Perth.'
              
              Ming Yi: 'I have my flaws, but that does not mean that I am not taking good care of Ren Ci and Foo Hai Ch'an.'
              
              DPP Singh: 'You looked after yourself when Ren Ci needed money.'
              
              Ming Yi: 'I took good care of the patients.'
              
              DPP Singh: 'You looked after yourself.'
              
              Ming Yi: 'I looked after myself but also the patients.'
              
              Buying, buying
              
              The prosecution produced documents showing evidence of the various big-ticket purchases Ming Yi made. The first, bought in the late '80s, was a piece of property in Mountbatten Road that housed Chao Yin lodge, run by Ming Yi.
              
              It was bought under his name and financed by donations from devotees and a mortgage loan from a bank. He used money from the sale of this property to buy a two-storey semi-detached house in Bedok Ria Crescent where the lodge was relocated.
              
              Ming Yi later bought an apartment at The Atria at Meyer Road.
              
              DPP Singh asked: 'Between 1994 and 1998, while Ren Ci was struggling in finances, you yourself had no problems buying a house, buying land, buying a BMW, buying a horse, being a country club member. Correct?'
              
              'Yes,' Ming Yi replied.
              
              The DPP then asked: 'So while Ren Ci and Foo Hai Ch'an were having financial difficulties, you were not? Did you think you should have put money in Ren Ci instead of buying things for yourself?'
              
              He added: 'You believe in helping people, Ren Ci was your baby... what you have not told the court today is that you were building a property empire by yourself. How do you gel these?'
              
              Ming Yi said that he bought the Atria apartment as an investment for Ren Ci. 'Unfortunately, I'm not a person who knows how to manage property.'
              
              He added that he did think of channelling his own money to Ren Ci's coffers to help his ailing organisation and had suggested it to a few of his board members.
              
              But they advised against it, he said.
              
              Ming Yi's first overseas property buy was a piece of land in Perth. The joint owner was Mr Wee Beng Seng, an ex-treasurer of Ren Ci.
              
              He then had a house built for him in Perth.
              
              DPP Singh asked: 'You want the court to believe that you're trying to do your utmost as far as Ren Ci was concerned. Isn't it true that you were enjoying the good life in Perth?'
              
              Ming Yi replied that he 'did not really go and stay there. I was there only three to four times'. Under further cross-examination, Ming Yi later said that he went to Perth once or twice a year.
              
              In Perth, he also bought a BMW S540 executive series car.
              
              But looking puzzled when it was raised by DPP Singh, he said he could not recall 'this whole thing' even after he had pored over the offer-to-purchase document shown to him. He repeatedly claimed he could not remember buying the car.
              
              DPP Singh persisted: 'Even if you don't remember this, are you satisfied that this is your signature?'
              
              Ming Yi said he was.
              
              When asked if he had made any other purchases, he revealed that he had bought a horse in Perth.
              
              'I was told that the horses need somebody to rear them, but later on, I found that the owner used it to go horse-racing... I thought he was meant to look after the horse, but not for racing purposes,' he said.
              
              The court was also told that Ming Yi and Mr Wee were joint members of the Vines Golf &amp; Country Club in Perth, 'one of the more upmarket resorts in Western Australia', DPP Singh said.
              
              Ming Yi's other purchases: A house in Seattle in the US, a two-storey bungalow and a penthouse in Melbourne, both of which he bought with Yeung.
              
              When asked by DPP Singh if it was 'okay for a monk to own properties in various parts of the world' and if that was 'what a modern monk does', he replied: 'That's what a lot of people do.'
              
              DPP Singh suggested that Ming Yi 'believed in luxury'.
              
              But the monk said: 'I think I can be very flexible. I can go to a village in Sri Lanka to stay there, I can go to villages in China and stay there, northern part of China to stay there, Thailand to stay there.'
              
              The court also learnt that Ming Yi shared an Australian Citibank account with Mr Wee to finance their Australian expenses.
              
              Asked about two withdrawals of A$900 ($1,000) made from an ATM at Burswood Casino in Perth in 2002, Ming Yi said it was Mr Wee who had made the withdrawals.
              
              'From birth to now, I've never been to any casino,' Ming Yi said.
              
              He also admitted that diving was one of his hobbies and that he had gone on diving holidays. But no details of these holidays were revealed in court.
