              <p>Especially in a non-profit org, people tend to lax because the discipline for controls is not as strong as in a profit corporation.</p>

              <p>What is abuse?</p>
              <p>In all non-profit orgs, there is this thing called surpluses. Non-profit orgs also need to think ahead into the future, and should not spend annual donations completely because the next year's donations might fall short of the needs of their annual expenditure.</p>
              <p>IF the money is not in use to help the needy, but is a surplus, what is wrong with loaning it to employees, so long as it is ensured that the employee returns the loan?</p>
              <p>You garner goodwill by helping employees in need. I don't see the issue with that. The only issue is that there is insufficient governance controls in Renci. Loaning to employees should have proper procedures, and ensure there are legal means to get back the loan should the employee fail to return the loan</p>

              <p>1. Don't you find it strange that he chose to go thru all the trouble (work permit) to hire Yeung and pay him high wages, to be his personal aide. It was not a highly qualified position and I find it hard to believe that he couldn't find a suitable person locally.</p>
              <p>2. Granting Yeung supp credit cards with practically no control over expense &amp; repayment for purchases of expensive goods. Granting him a substantial loan just because he opened his mouth!</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>1. Don't you find it strange that he chose to go thru all the
              trouble (work permit) to hire Yeung and pay him high wages, to
              be his personal aide. It was not a highly qualified position and I

              <p>1. No, I don't find it strange. There is no evidence whatsoever that Yeung is useless, or does not justify his pay. Moreover, whether a boss hires someone sometimes depends on personal liking. Of coz, the basic calibre must be there.</p>
              <p>2. That's just bad governance for me. It only tells me that Renci requires more governance. That's all.</p>
              <p>So what exactly sucks, because I don't see anything illegal (or the lack of evidence), and is only more a case of bad governance.</p>
              <p>The govt is just making an ant out of a molehill. Compared to the government's pay, which is funded by the SAME source (taxpayers) that funds welfare support to the poor, I would say this case is negligible.</p>
              <p>In fact, aside from bad governance, the monk has been doing a great job ensuring that the people benefiting from Renci CONTINUE to benefit.</p>
              <p>So what's the big deal?</p>

              <p>To highlight your question to darkknighthuang, there is no facts in the statement above <br>"just because he opened his mouth". darkknighthuang is actually commenting based on his emotions and not thinking deeper.</p>
              <p>and be aware that these are newspaper reports from our ST, whose reporters are considered very immature compared to other countries where there is greater press freedom.</p>

              Non-profit orgs also need to think ahead into the future, and
              should not spend annual donations completely because the next

              <p>IF the money is not in use to help the needy, but is a surplus,
              what is wrong with loaning it to employees, so long as it is

              <p>You garner goodwill by helping employees in need. I don't see
              the issue with that. The only issue is that there is insufficient
              governance controls in Renci. Loaning to employees should have
              proper procedures, and ensure there are legal means to get back the

              <p>The crack on NKF is way overdue when its exposed! This is precisely why government and the people "overreacted". I would have prefer the government "overreact" on NKF just when they started misusing funds, rather than till a later stage where the gold taps and superinflated pays comes in, damaging the image and creditability of the NPOs.</p>
