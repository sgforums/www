              misusing funds, rather than till a later stage where the gold taps

              <p>Can you see the difference btw Renci and NKF?</p>
              <p>1. Gold Taps. Superinflated peanut pays, incredible bonuses paid to staff. THAT'S NKF</p>
              <p>Compared to</p>
              <p>2. Inadequate loan procedures. THAT's RENCI.</p>
              <p>Case 1 is true misuse of funds. Case 2 is just bad governance</p>
              <p>In fact, Case 1 can be compared to the superinflated pay packets of our leaders. Aren't the management of NKF and our leaders the same type of people, given that one is a  non-profit organization, and the other is a nation's leadership (which is also non-profit)?</p>

              <p><br>Crucifying??? well, Rome was not build in a day, so is Singapore, you got to trust and believe in our system or else, we are history. The system is allowing this guy a fair chance to represent himself thru his lawyers and he get to appeal if the verdict is against him, unless u are talking about Do what the romans do, crucifying Jesus to prevent him from preaching further.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes of course the judge is a human, nobody is playing God here, the laws can never be balance, there is always some short change in it, 2 parties enter court and one will come out happy whilst the other will be angry and sad and shouting unfair. That is the nature of things, nothing is fair, but we are just trying to make it fairer thru a proper system, that is all. UNDERSTAND!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To a religious person, he should not fear the mortal laws, for he who knows the rules and regulations of his God should know better that what await him below. That will be worst. Burnt in HELL!!</p>

              <p>When I was running my committee in school, I also have loyalists whom are treated specially because they are loyal to me and would help to go all out to get things done for me.</p>
              <p>It's again a case of bad governance. So what if there's personal liking? In the words of my secretary in the past, "if you are an apple, no matter what you do, you are an apple. If you are not an apple, no matter what you do, you are still not an apple"</p>
              <p>This is the reality of this world. I have worked long enough to know there is no true fairness at work.</p>

              <p>Excuse me for the late reply - actually was out the whole
              afternoon &amp; when I came back - wah! so many posts already.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your reply which I think is cool calm &amp;
              courteous.</p>
              <p>Regarding the question of what is improper management &amp; your
              examples of people being highly paid, you stated "setting up
              <em><strong>legal</strong></em> means to
              .................   Overpaying one self is not improper
              management?"</p>
              <p>Well, personally I feel it's a shame re the sky high salaries
              they are paying themselves but the fact that it's
              <em><strong>legally</strong></em> set up will qualify it as proper
              &amp; not improper although morally it's another issue.</p>

              <p>Well, if the monk had control of the law, then it would also become legal...</p>
              <p>Either way, I think I have argued enough, people reading my postings would know what I mean. It'sa case of overhype resulting in overreaction. Ultimately, if you focus at looking past the fiasco, the monk is still doing this job effectively.</p>
              <p>For those who do not accept my point and believe that Renci = NKF, so be it.</p>

              <p>1. No, I don't find it strange. There is no evidence whatsoever
              that Yeung is useless, or does not justify his pay. Moreover,
              whether a boss hires someone sometimes depends on personal liking.
              Of coz, the basic calibre must be there.</p>
              <p>2. That's just bad governance for me. It only tells me that
              Renci requires more governance. That's all.</p>
              <p>So what exactly sucks, because I don't see anything illegal (or
              the lack of evidence), and is only more a case of bad
              governance.</p>
              <p>The govt is just making an ant out of a molehill. Compared to
              the government's pay, which is funded by the SAME source
              (taxpayers) that funds welfare support to the poor, I would say
              this case is negligible.</p>
              <p>In fact, aside from bad governance, the monk has been doing a
              great job ensuring that the people benefiting from Renci CONTINUE
              to benefit.</p>
              <p>So what's the big deal?</p>
