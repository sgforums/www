            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, why are Muslims worshipping Muhamad?<br>By venerating him and holding him up to a pedestal, muslims are indeed worshipping and idolising him their their hearts.<br>Muslims believe Jesus is a prophet too but never said anything much less protest over incidents where Jesus was attacked in the west every day. Why give Muhamad a mere human who wear his pants one leg at a time just like us such an exalted position? This is idolatry, paganistic and unislamic to say the least!<br><br>Secondly, I understand that Muslims were told by Muhamad not to draw Muhamad so that he cannot be idolised. This command was directed at Muslims, not to non Muslims. The Quran says, there is no compulsion in religion, so why are Muslims forcing non Muslims to follow their religion of not drawing Muhamad? What right do muslims have to force others to follow their religion? Why is there tolerance? Why the apparent idolatry and bigotry by Muslims?<br><br>I bet you that had Muhamad not be dead, he would have been against muslims of today for their intolerance towards others and giving the great religion islam a bad name. Muhamad himself would have punished those fanatics for misrepresenting a loving and compassionate God that Allah is supposed to be.<br><br>Thirdly, why are Muslims treating others as inferior?<br>Why on earth would Allah, who was the creator of all, teach his followers to despise his own creations? Or why would Allah create some people as non Muslims to be discriminated &amp; oppressed by others?<br><br>I think Islam needs a severe rethinking just as the Christians had their reformation in the middle ages with Christianity. Muslims today contradict both natural morality and the teachings of the holy Quran and give Islam a lousy  name. All this intolerance and fanaticism has to stop, let it be today.</div>
