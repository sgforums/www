            <div class='col-md body'>I will just address a few of the responses in this thread. I shall refrain from engaging with certain foul-mouthed imbeciles who are not capable of rational thinking. There is no need to reduce oneself to the level of such low life.<br><br>There is this argument that Chinese nationals go to Singapore and expect unconditional acceptance due to ethnic affinity. This is an interesting but ultimately unconvincing argument without factual substantiation. I would like to know in what form this thinking is instantiated among Chinese nationals. Who are the Chinese nationals that demand VIP treatment in Singapore simply because they are Chinese? If anything, we know better than anybody else that there is no free lunch in this world. With a big population base, one has to work hard to earn a livelihood. Certainly the same attitude applies when one is relocated to a different land. For most Chinese nationals, we earn our own keep in China or overseas. To say that we demand special treatment in a foreign country because of shared ancestry is an obscene misrepresentation of facts.<br><br>But if there is one thing anybody expects when arriving in a foreign country, it is the basic level of respect and the absence of discrimination. If that is too much to ask, then it is a sorry state of affairs in your country.<br><br>There seems to be a prevalent sentiment that every Chinese national is bad until proven otherwise. This is why some lunatics spout toxic and illogical rantings against China and Chinese nationals. I wish to put this question to some of you: Is this the right attitude? Is there a justification in discriminating against an individual based on one's nationality? Is there justification of discrimination in any form in this enlightened era we are living in? Is it rational to see an individual through tainted lenses and form pre-conceived opinions of him/her before you even get to know that individual?<br><br>There is a difference between fair criticism and sheer bias. There is a dearth of the former and the latter abounds in your society with respect to Chinese nationals. My friend, a decent female professional, has more than once been asked by Singaporeans if she engages in dubious trade .Imagine her frustration. Is there rhyme or reason to assume that most Chinese women engage in dubious trade? Yet, that kind of twisted thinking seems to prevail amongst a sizeable proportion of your country. It betrays a very superficial level of thinking that refuses to see things beyond their surface. It is this kind of thinking which projects the impression that you have a narrow mind-set.<br><br>I accept fair criticisms. I do believe that many Chinese nationals are not considerate enough. Some complain about noise from basketball playing late at night. Maybe you could approach them and reason with them. I am sure they will understand and refrain from doing the same in future. There is an importance in building dialogue. Once you do, you will see that people are not who you think they are. We are not monsters. We are capable of thinking in other peopleÂ’s shoe.<br><br>As I said, I accept fair criticisms. But once they degenerate into sheer hostile bashing, which abounds here, I will feel compelled to stand up and point out the stupidity and unfairness.<br><br>Lastly, there is an amusing reply demanding that I leave. I merely pointed out a problem that exists in your society. And I think it is a real problem which deserves attention and healthy debates. Some of you seem so eager to bury your head in the sand and refuse to acknowledge it and try to stifle me by asking me to leave. You are living in a fancy world where everybody must agree with you and different voices are not allowed. Escapism is not the solution to problems. It just saves more trouble for your own future.<br><br>On an unrelated note, I am now in the US. I could almost hear some of you heaving a sigh of relief nowÂ….<br><br>Good luck, proud Singaporean!<br><br></div>

I said "wrong, if you want to know the difference in Chinese, it is better to look into groups like PRC Chinese, Taiwanese Chinese, HK/Macau Chinese, and the SEA Chinese, such as Singaporean Chinese." Afterall, Chinese is too numerous to be look as one entity.<br><br>When you look at the Chinese in PRC, there are the Beijing Chinese, the Shanghainese, the southerners, the northerners. In Taiwan, you have the 'ben shen ren' and the ' wai shen ren', and when you look the Singaporean, what do you find? can you tell the difference between the Chinese educated, the english educated and the "neither hear nor there" educated Chinese? There are big differences in their attitude and their outlook.<br><br>So, the China bashers you mentioned here do not represent Singaporean, not even the majority!<br><br>If you look at the people in this forum, where most would bash PAP, if they truely represent the majority singaporean, then PAP should never be in power. I am not surprised many kao pe kao bu here but still vote for PAP (i vote for WP  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> ), like many who bash PRC Chinese here, but when they meet their PRC Chinese senior in China, you won't find them speaking anything similar.<br><br>You must understand that China has developed very fast, PRC Chinese are flooding everywhere like never before, and among you, there are the good, the bad and the ugly!  What then is the overall impression of PRC Chinese that has developed in the mind of Singaporean? Besides newspapers report, many of us have personal interaction with many of you, in and  out of China.<br><br>In as much as many singaporeans need to get out and meet the world, many singaporeans should learn proper Chinese, and other languages to understand other people, there are as much corrections the PRC Chinese need to do to correct the wrong impressions that PRC, the country and the people presented to outsiders, since the cultural revolution.<br><br>PRC were 40 years behind the world outside during the cultural revolution, you progressed very much and caught up much of the development in hardware, but in software, sad to say, due to the large chinese population,  still a lot need to be done. I still saw a PRC Chinese, wearing branded suit, carrying brief case, spitting on the marble, or granite floor inside the Beijing Airport building, in Jan this year. Toilets is still an experience for most of our ladies when travelling in China (though it has improved siginificantly over the years), and many singaporeans who visit their home town in China are still expected to bring in money to distribute to everybody.<br><br>Talking about PRC Chinese in Singapore, we have the general workers, the businessmen, the students, the peidu mama, the professionals, plus tens of thousands of you here on social visits, you don't and you can't present a collective impressions, often this is at the mercy of the media. It was only a while ago when the news about PRC in Singapore was only about peidu mama engaged in undesirable activities, and in the Universities, I saw many of you just keep to yourself instead of mixing around. People who only visit geylang will only remember the prostitutes, but there are also singapore who travel to china to look for wives. While many are bashing PRC Chinese here, there are also thousands of Singaporeans who packed the auditorium to listen to Prof YuDan on "YuDan Lun Yu xin de".<br><br>It is not about being biased, just different people see different things.<br><br>I would be happy if you chose to stay in Singapore, but since you leave, you are no different from many of those singaporeans, born and brought up here, but chose to migrate and then come online to bash everything, from the government, to the policies...... and the PRC people living in this country. Why you don't stay here and make a difference? Goh CT called you people quitter, and I know now quitters are not confined to those born and brought up in singapore only. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

What makes you think they came to singapore and used it as a springboard to america? Even if they do, please only use facts that you can backup.<br><br>You think PRC chinese cannot get their own visa to the USA? Maybe there are some truths in that some may come to singapore first before progressing to other countries, but its just plain rude to make silly remarks like that. It makes you look like an ignorant, self-righteous, and proud singaporean!!!<br><br>I can imagine how the PRC chinese will feel if they hear your remarks. Proud singaporeans think singapore is everything? We go to singapore to work or to study is like owe them a living!<br><br>This is quite literally a bully mentality that singaporeans have. Claims like if you dont like it here, stfu and leave! Its easy for you to say! Absolutely bully mentality!<br><br>Example, how many maids have been bullied in singapore? Why? Just because they are from indonesia or phillipines means they are lower class? And we kow tao to ang mo instead? Ok, i maybe going off tangent now, but these are my observations about us singaporeans and i think we gotta do something about it. Or at least admit that its going on. I've seen countless double standards out there. Singaporeans will feel above other chinese and instead kao tow to ang mo!<br><br>Its like we are still living in the colonial days. I once visited the british high commission 2years ago in tanglin. I was astounded by the way the guards greeted the british national. It was like they are some god! OK ok, totally off topic now.<br><br>You know, it saddens me because i can feel the frustration of singaporeans. We are in a pressurised cooker waiting to explode! There are so many things that people are unhappy about and we can't do anything about it, so we end up bashing and complain like no tomorrow.<br><br>But most importantly, I SINCERELY THINK WE SINGAPOREANS are reasonable people!<br><br>allenb, i'm very impressed with your effort to explain, clarify and backup your posts. Esp the first few posts in this thread. That goes to show, at the end of the day, singaporeans are preety reasonable people.<br>But allenb, dont you think you've already portrayed the wrong impression to others when you started your bashing in the first page? Yes, someone said something that infuriated you and as a singaporean you stood up to it, but by bashing that way, it just makes us singaporeans look real bad. You did calm down later and explained your stand and i think its a good job, but its like making a U turn. People will not remember your efforts to even explain and hope they'll understand. THey will remember you as a loose tongued PRC basher.<br><br>Maybe the social problem is worse than i thought. If it has reached such an untolerable state, the government should reconsider its immigration policies.<br><br>THere are thousands of PRC chinese here in UK. But the brits are not complaining like singaporeans are. Yes they complain about immigration policies, but not PRC bashing on a personal level. Maybe singaporeans should be alittle more tolerant of others?<br><br>Hold your guns guys, let me sum up.<br><br>Singaporeans are nice people, deep down. We are compassionate, kind, and definitely not discrimatory or racist.<br><br>Only problem is our loose tongue and our habit of complaining and sometimes letting it get out of hand.<br><br>Singaporeans are proud no doubts about it. We better watch out, dont let it get out of hand.<br><br>Finally, i'm critical of ourselves because i care for our own. I certainly dont enjoy bashing my own.<br><br>Once again, i hope this wont turn out to be a flame war.

            <div class='col-md body'>First, I would like to dismiss everything you had said as gross generalization. I afraid that your friendÂ’s theory is not accurate for the fact that there were PRCs in Singapore show the flaws in her theory.<br><br>Secondly, not all Singaporeans speaks ill of PRCs. Xiaomayi did not have a bad impression of PRCs. And you should not be using the comments in an online community to brand all Singaporeans as China-bashers. You are committing the same mistake of generalizing people as we are.<br><br>Thirdly, you told us that people from civilized society do not sneer at other society. Yet you yourself sneer at the smallness of our country. So why should I even listen to someone who doesnÂ’t practice what he preaches?<br><br>Perhaps I would be more receptive to your ideas if you had come in speaking for less biasness from Singaporeans than to bash us about our sizes and our ugly habits.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I for one have grown pretty sick and tired of responding to this pointless thread.<br><br>I would just like to clarify one thing.<br><br>By asking you (and other PRCs to leave), I'm not avoiding the topic; rather, I'm proposing the most straightforward solution to everyone's problems (well, to those who have problems at least), and this solution works and applies to namely:-<br>1) For the PRC who is over-demanding and full of complaints<br>2) For the Singaporean who is demeaning and equally full of complaints<br><br>Clearly for the PRCs who are fine in Singapore (as for those Singaporeans fine with PRCs being in Singapore), there is no reason to leave.<br><br>And quite frankly, now that you're in the US and I assume have found greener pastures, there is no need to stir up any debate or argument. If you are genuinely concerned about the morality in Singapore, and the unfortunate position (if any) of PRCs, then you know as well as I do, that this forum is the inappropriate avenue to initiate change.<br><br>By starting this discussion with such a hateful and unobjective tone, you have already proven that you're not here to initiate change, but rather, to incite hate.<br><br>And I sincerely wish you the best in the States; because it clearly bodes well for you, and for us (Singaporeans in general), that someone like you is no longer here leeching off our resources.<br><br>EDIT: Do fairly note as well that I have not yet "bashed" or "bagged" PRCs. I have merely defended my country and countrymen from your very ... remarks. I once again clarify that I for one, am fine with the PRCs; I am self-assured and am not worried or threatened by their increasing presence in my country. Again, by asking certain PRCs to leave, it is a solution for those to which it applies, to think about.<br><br>Do not mistake the silent good graces of fellow Singaporeans to be anything beyond that.</div>
