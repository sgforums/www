When promotion comes up , suddenly she will become very brilliant- trust me on that.<br><br>There are some stupid ones around no doubt, and they don't keep their mouth shut - but the ones who keep very quiet from all the scolding and what's not are the ones I watch for. They learn fast and they are very good at dropping a bombshell on the unsuspecting workers.<br><br>The girls I call them Wang Zhaojuns - read history . </div></blockquote>She is not being clever, SHE IS LAZY!

Old chinese thing - master never tells apprentice how to do things because apprentice might surpass him. BUT apprentice always watches and figure the improvements til he can take over the master's work.</div>

Heehehee<br><br>Maybe she is one of the nasty ones . I don't know. However I did meet chinese nurses - I tend to outrank them when I was in nursing here so they never did give me trouble at all.<br><br>Now I am working in research , so the ones I meet tend to be a different class from the normal class of workers. Those are very intelligent and they are not arrogant at all. But they just never let you know how to solve the problem- they solve it and then when they leave , the knowledge is gone.<br><br>Good thing tho , I watch them like a hawk ...so at least not all is lost.<br><br></div>

The Singaporean rote learning condemned a number to just think within the square by just looking at my sister - just modify the variables and she cannot do it ...just because the textbook doesn't tell her how to do it.<br><br>The China Chinese talents - the truly brilliant ones - they can take an equation/item apart - put it together and add some improvements . To them , it is about taking things apart and learning from other peoples' mistake. Do you know that China's animal vaccine research lab in Harbin is capable of churning out at least 10 billion vaccines within 3 weeks and their research on zoonotic diseases is quite impressive? They start from the basics and then they look through your advanced tech and take it apart to figure out how to improve on it and how to make it viable.<br><br>No because obviously some of you think Singapore is so great and good that China is some second rate country.<br><br>Never underestimate your rival. That is my advice.<br><br></div></blockquote>PRCs aren't the ones who are shrewd. I have seen Sri Lankans who are equally capable of what you described.</div>
