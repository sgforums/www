In a Chinese restaurant there are many tables that can sit 10 persons, and people have to turn on their volume to talk to the person across the table. In a Western restaurant you will have to join table if you want have a group of more than 6. Chinese cheers by shouting "yam seng" and they bottom up their drinks at dinner, the angmoh say "cheers, to good health" and take a seep. If you don't want the noise in a Chinese restaurant, you should never even step in, so that you don't have to walk out, or run out, complain too much and you will be kicked out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Have you ever seen a chinese menu? you don't need that only if you go to food court or cheap restaurants with pictures in the menu. In a Chinese menu, usually in a posh restaurant, the item "Mini Buddha Jump Over The Wall" tells you nothing about what dish is it, what are the ingradients and how it is cooked. But any western food menu usually tells you if it is steak, pasta, or potatos, grilled, fried or stew, ..... . In a Chinese restaurant, I ask in details the dishes I order, or you never know that the dish "sai pang xie" (crab) does not have any "pang xie" in it. You don't have this experience? or never got chance to order, or never knew what you ordered?<br><br>Loud noise is not only confined to PRC Chinese. I was in Germany once, had breakfast in a small cosy restaurant in a hotel, then came two Taiwanese couples. Immediately the whole restaurant knew their presence because they talked to each other as if in a chinese restaurant. Or is it only Chinese got loud voice? I have also heard an American laughing on top of his voice as if nobody is around in a western restaurant inside a 6 star hotel in China.<br><br>Is bad manners confined to PRC Chinese, Taiwanese, and Americans only? obviously not, I often see Singaporean taking breakfast in a posh western restaurant serving international buffets, in the business district in Bangkok, wearing jogging short (not bermudas), sleaveless T shirt and a pair of slippers provided by the hotel. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>I guess when it comes to manners and behaviors, there is no difference between different ethnicities and nationalities, a lot depend on how sensitive one is to the different cultures in his environment, and how much he is prepared to respect others, It is bad bad manners, or shall I say "rude" to take on a moral high ground and start to shoot, before you know where you are and understand the difference. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
