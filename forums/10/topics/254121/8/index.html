            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dreameryb:</div><div class="quote_body">My friend once commented that Singaporeans are generally narrow-minded and ignorant, which I quickly dismissed as a gross generalization. She had a theory though: the temperament and character of a people is determined by the land where they are raised. In this regard, she makes a link between the limited geography of Singapore and the small-mindedness and pettiness of Singaporeans. I was skeptical of this Â“theoryÂ” for some time until I decided to venture into a Singapore on-line community. Here it seems that her theory has found some proof.<br><br>Hardly a single day goes by without somebody here making an effort to slight and sneer at China and Chinese nationals. Many comments are full of sheer prejudice and animosity towards my country. I need to remind some Singaporeans that bigotry and prejudice is a reflection of oneÂ’s social standing and upbringing. Studies have repeatedly proved that it is people from the lowest stratum of society in educational background and economic viability that are prone to harbor discrimination and prejudice. The hostile comments here therefore say a lot about the social standing of their posters.<br><br>I believe that some issues related to Chinese nationals are real to some extent, for example the manners of some Chinese persons, but not anywhere close to magnitude implied in some of the twisted accounts being offered here. I hardly see any of my fellow countrymen spit nowadays in major cities. On the contrary, I have witnessesed middle-aged Singaporean men spit on the street. Most of my friends are soft-spoken. On the contrary, those loud talkers on MRT trains are mainly Singaporean students, as my own observation attested. Another twisted argument I have encountered here is that we canÂ’t tolerate our own people such that we have to kill other Chinese nationals in Singapore, based on a few homicidal cases. Those who pursue this line of reasoning please first have your brains checked, as the level of retardedness they exhibit is appalling. Second, be reminded of the murder incident committed by your own people against your own countrymen in Australia and elsewhere.<br><br>The logic that prevails in some individuals here generally, is that whenever a Chinese national is seen spitting or talking loud, or committing murder, the same trait must also exist in the rest of the Chinese nationals. The same unpalatable behaviour, when witnessed in a Singaporean, is only seen as individual problem. Exactly the same incident is interpreted in different ways. Why is it so? The answer is simply that some of you are not capable of objective thinking. It seems to be a general problem amongst some of your people. It if persists, it bodes ill for your future. After all, what can we expect from a people with a lop-sided and biased mind-set?<br><br>In any case, enthusiastic China-bashers here need to examine their own behaviour before pointing fingers at us. Remember that members from a truly civilized society do not sneer at another society. Bear in mind the basic axiom that one disgraces oneself by talking ill of others. If anything counts as bad behavior in the 21st century, it is the alarming level of ignorance, xenophobia  and retardedness displayed by some of the posters here.<br><br>But that is not the only reason why I am posting this. I am also interested in exploring why some Singaporeans are fond of bashing China. I think it may have to do with a pathological sense of inferiority as a citizen of a small country. Singaporeans know very well that their country has little chance of wielding substantial influence in the world stage. On the other hand, China is making huge progress on all fronts and looks set to becoming a major player in the world. The rapid metamorphoses China is undergoing and the rise of country as a whole has struck fear and bitterness among some Singaporeans who are too tiny-brained to comprehend world dynamics. In an eagerness to assert their own presence and for fear of being overshadowed by China, these people have resorted to China bashing to achieve a delusional sense of psychological balance. This is essentially reflective of the Napoleon syndrome that afflicts many of your people.<br><br>In this era defined by inter-dependence of countries, one really cannot afford to be close-minded and xenophobic. For a country like Singapore, the toxic attitude some of your countrymen displays towards foreigners is not healthy to your own development. It is very dangerous indeed for people of small countries to have tinier hearts.<br><br></div></blockquote>By labeling Singaporeans as being a "a people with a lop-sided and biased mind-set", xenophobic and essentially napoleon, aren't you putting forward certain stereotypes of your own? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And by the way, if I see someone committing disgusting acts in public regardless of nationality or race, the last thing on my mind would be "the need to ones own presence for fear of being overshadowed by a larger country". To me, its just disgusting behavior thats all.<br><br>Perhaps, being a PRC citizen yourself, you are highly sensitive to comments that involved other PRC nationals and chose to ignore the fact that there are thousands more on people of other nations, races and even against fellow singaporeans?<br><br>Furthermore, are you seriously going to take just Sgforums as a great representative of the population spectrum and sentiment of Singaporeans? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>By the way, prejudice is prevalent across educational backgrounds and social status. Many members of the Ku Klux Klan were highly educated as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As always, I respect honest opinions with good intentions.<br><br>You are very right in pointing out that the negative sentiments in this forum do not represent the larger population in Singapore, which is why, in my original post, I carefully qualified my statements to refer to only a subset of Singaporeans. In fact, the first paragraph of my original post shows that I was mainly talking about some Singaporeans in this very forum. So I obviously was not referring to the majority of Singaporeans in the real world.<br><br>Indeed, as you pointed out, China has a lot of catch up to do. The country as a whole however, has made an earnest effort to be a responsible nation in the world. Problems abound, not unexpectedly, as we were left behind economically during the politcal turmoil that was the cultural revolution. Also, the large population of China makes rapid and across-the-board development a difficulty. But... effort is being made. If we also only had 4 million people to manage, things might be much easier.<br><br>Spitting is now considered a vice. I heard that the Beijing local government has passed some laws to criminalize this and some other uncivilized habits. Once again, some Western media is quick to mock this effort as an authoritarian government's manipulation of people's bahaviour. But it is done with good intentions. The toilet had been a real disgrace. But as you aptly pointed out, conditions have improved significantly over the years. I myself had been quite impressed with the makeover of public toilets.<br><br>Once again, I want to reiterate that we accept fair and honest criticisms. I only feel the need to speak up when criticisms turn into hateful remarks whose sole purpse is to spite us. Who wouldn't?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">An angmoh onced told me, "I travelled in Asia extensively and I think I understand Chinese well, I understand the cantonese, the hokkien, the mandarin...." I said "wrong, if you want to know the difference in Chinese, it is better to look into groups like PRC Chinese, Taiwanese Chinese, HK/Macau Chinese, and the SEA Chinese, such as Singaporean Chinese." Afterall, Chinese is too numerous to be look as one entity.<br><br>When you look at the Chinese in PRC, there are the Beijing Chinese, the Shanghainese, the southerners, the northerners. In Taiwan, you have the 'ben shen ren' and the ' wai shen ren', and when you look the Singaporean, what do you find? can you tell the difference between the Chinese educated, the english educated and the "neither hear nor there" educated Chinese? There are big differences in their attitude and their outlook.<br><br>So, the China bashers you mentioned here do not represent Singaporean, not even the majority!<br><br>If you look at the people in this forum, where most would bash PAP, if they truely represent the majority singaporean, then PAP should never be in power. I am not surprised many kao pe kao bu here but still vote for PAP (i vote for WP  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> ), like many who bash PRC Chinese here, but when they meet their PRC Chinese senior in China, you won't find them speaking anything similar.<br><br>You must understand that China has developed very fast, PRC Chinese are flooding everywhere like never before, and among you, there are the good, the bad and the ugly!  What then is the overall impression of PRC Chinese that has developed in the mind of Singaporean? Besides newspapers report, many of us have personal interaction with many of you, in and  out of China.<br><br>In as much as many singaporeans need to get out and meet the world, many singaporeans should learn proper Chinese, and other languages to understand other people, there are as much corrections the PRC Chinese need to do to correct the wrong impressions that PRC, the country and the people presented to outsiders, since the cultural revolution.<br><br>PRC were 40 years behind the world outside during the cultural revolution, you progressed very much and caught up much of the development in hardware, but in software, sad to say, due to the large chinese population,  still a lot need to be done. I still saw a PRC Chinese, wearing branded suit, carrying brief case, spitting on the marble, or granite floor inside the Beijing Airport building, in Jan this year. Toilets is still an experience for most of our ladies when travelling in China (though it has improved siginificantly over the years), and many singaporeans who visit their home town in China are still expected to bring in money to distribute to everybody.<br><br>Talking about PRC Chinese in Singapore, we have the general workers, the businessmen, the students, the peidu mama, the professionals, plus tens of thousands of you here on social visits, you don't and you can't present a collective impressions, often this is at the mercy of the media. It was only a while ago when the news about PRC in Singapore was only about peidu mama engaged in undesirable activities, and in the Universities, I saw many of you just keep to yourself instead of mixing around. People who only visit geylang will only remember the prostitutes, but there are also singapore who travel to china to look for wives. While many are bashing PRC Chinese here, there are also thousands of Singaporeans who packed the auditorium to listen to Prof YuDan on "YuDan Lun Yu xin de".<br><br>It is not about being biased, just different people see different things.<br><br>I would be happy if you chose to stay in Singapore, but since you leave, you are no different from many of those singaporeans, born and brought up here, but chose to migrate and then come online to bash everything, from the government, to the policies...... and the PRC people living in this country. Why you don't stay here and make a difference? Goh CT called you people quitter, and I know now quitters are not confined to those born and brought up in singapore only. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, footprints, thanks for your nice replies. You are right that the problems depicted in my original post are not widespread in Singapore in general, which is why I  was explicitly referring only to "some" Singaporeans.  On the contrary, the Singaporeans I met during my sojourn in Singapore are very nice and gracious people. I have no doubt that people are nice deep down when you get to know them on a personal level,  which is why I emphasized the importance of looking beyond the surface.<br><br>Essentially, we are all human beings with our own foibles and flaws. Life is already difficult enough without being mean to others. Mutual understanding is the key to harmonious co-existence of nationalities and races.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by footprints:</div><div class="quote_body">dreameryb,<br><br>I think your statements are very fair and well written.  How long did you live in singapore? Your style of writing hints of the singaporean flavour...<br><br>Anyways, i'm glad you've never encountered any of the problems personally. Perhaps these social problems are not as widespread as we thought.<br><br>Criticisms aside, i'm sure you must have dealt with many singaporeans on a personal level before, whats your impression? </div></blockquote></div>

I am also interested in exploring why some Singaporeans are fond of bashing China. I think it may have to do with a [b]pathological sense of inferiority </strong>as a citizen of a small country. Singaporeans know very well that their country has little chance of wielding substantial influence in the world stage. On the other hand, China is making huge progress on all fronts and looks set to becoming a major player in the world. The rapid metamorphoses China is undergoing and the rise of country as a whole has struck fear and bitterness among some Singaporeans who are<strong> too tiny-brained </strong>to comprehend world dynamics. In an eagerness to assert their own presence and for fear of being overshadowed by China, these people have resorted to China bashing to achieve a delusional sense of psychological balance. This is essentially reflective of the Napoleon syndrome that afflicts many of your people.<br><br>In this era defined by inter-dependence of countries, one really cannot afford to be close-minded and xenophobic. For a country like Singapore, the toxic attitude some of your countrymen displays towards foreigners is not healthy to your own development. It is very dangerous indeed for people of small countries to have tinier hearts.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Note that you aren't helping PRCs by making sweeping statements back at Singaporeans. Though you try to cover your own tracks later on by saying "some", I think you have fallen into your own accusations of Singaporeans.<br><br>That aside, I am ok with PRCs. Have loads of PRC friends, and many of them are nice people. My wife's also PRC.<br><br>Just that, when finger-pointing, do note that 3 fingers are pointing back at yourself. Stereotyping is a normal characteristic of human beings, and it doesn't help when some PRCs display arrogance and poor attitude in another person's homeland.<br><br>I say this becoz I understand there is a general regard in China, that Northerners tend to look down at Southerners, and since Singapore is even further south, there are Northerners that come here and look down on Singaporeans.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi TS,<br><br>I agree there's an alarming level of blind anti-PRC types in Singapore.<br><br>Yes, Singaporeans are known to be arrogant abroad.. but as an ang mo once observed, "The Singapore govt is highly representative of its people".  We are the product of an odd marriage between a 1st world economy, and a 3rd world social structure.  If we were to have a 1st world social structure, most of us wouldn't lack critical thinking skills like we do today.<br><br>As you know, Singapore is still very much an elitist society.  Those who do not belong to the "elite" feel helpless because they feel they do not really have a choice in what they want to do with their lives.  Many of us did not even get to vote in the last general election.. we seldom have say in government policies, for example, the one that opened the floodgates to foreigners incl PRC.  I believe this is where the seeds of hate were planted, and from there, snowballed.<br><br>The hatred shown toward the PRC is irresponsible and loathsome, yes, and unfortunately this abhorrent attitude extends to any groups of foreigners whom we associate with menial jobs.  Many Singaporeans tend to combine all the undesirable traits that a particular race exhibited, some of which may only be based on hearsay and not on something they've personally witnessed, and then combine it into one gross representation of that foreign race.  But this is not the average PRC, Bangledeshi or Indian, Filipino, Indonesian worker's fault.  How can we possibly fault someone who simply accepted the Singapore government's own invitation, based on the Singapore government's official representation??<br><br>As for the vices, I believe the Singapore govt CAN control it if they want to.  Singapore's flesh trade is much worse than our government would have us believe, and PRC women aren't the only ones being exploited on a regular basis.. they just happen to be the easy targets because they may not know how to seek help in a country that has become hostile to them.. they may not even understand the average Singaporean's hostility toward them.  They lack a safety net - but then, Singaporeans don't have a safety net either!<br><br>But despite these social problems, Singaporeans <strong>are</strong> a kind people as a whole.  It's just that we do NOT know how to protect our own interests, and then we react badly when we are taken advantage of.. and we can be surprisingly biased.  The average Singaporean cannot, does not, think further than what can be seen on a superficial level.  We have been conditioned to believe things as we see them, and we seldom are able to look past the surface.. in other words, we are the kind that buy into Hollywood imagery &amp; stereotypes.  We have much talk, but little action.  Those who become capable or strong enough to act often migrate.<br><br>And that's the sad part.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I am hesitant to reply as i fear that it might add more fuel to the fire but I just wish to describe some of my observations regarding PRCs in SG and the cyberspace on the whole......<br><br>Yes, studying in ntu, I have met a fair share of nice and easy going PRCs and a also a bunch of PRC that tarnishes the image of their country. I believe that the friction between the locals and the PRCs did not happen over night. Firstly, our lax immigration policies and cheapning of PR-ship and citizenship has caused lots of unhappiness in SG. All citizens regardless of nationality, sex and age have national pride irregardless of how the citizens might bitch abt the country of system. Many locals have felt that the great un-controlled wanton influx of foreigners have not only threaten their jobs and survival but also the social fabrics and racial and national integrity as a whole. As much as some PRC may attempt to integrate into our social fabrics, a large number have choose not to do so. Like the age old saying goes, when you go to Rome, do it the Roman way. By not doing so, many end up sticking out like a sore thumb, thus making themselves the target of critism. We have read news of PDMMs, massage girls, girls cheating old man money and even things like Prostitutes disguising as garang guni man and go around practising their trade in HDB. All these just increase the unhappiness between locals and PRCs. Most SGreans are low-profile individuals that just want to lead a quiet and peaceful life the usual way. Yes, PRCians may mock SGreans as being too straight and staid and some may consdier eg.cheating during exams, doing illegals stuffs as being street smart, flexible or even good adaptability. They dun realise that they are destroying this "pleasantville". Sgreans are like the animals in the forest while the PRCians are like human activity, deforestration, acid rain, water pollution, .......they just dun go hand in hand. I also know that many PRCians refuse to adapt as there are already a huge pool of their citizens here, thus they dun find the need to do so. I also frequently hear PRCians complaining, mocking , bitching, degrading some of the SGreans as we do not do things their way or their style. I believe this is due to the new found economical and military might that make them think so. I have seen many PRC forums that contain many fascistic and racist remarks and a heavy over dose of nationalism. i do not blame them as this is the internet and ppls are given the freedom to critise others. So I'm quite surprise NUS made the girl apologise to those PRCians. Perhaps the Dean should accquaint himself to the PRC antics and slurs on the net. Just like the Americans are too proud of their democracy and ideals, thus they go abt enforcing them  on others which lead to general discontent by some nations with alternative views. Wad most PRCians dun see is that their behave and attitude reflects some wad like dat of USA. Yes PRC can be proud of it's 5000yrs history, bt this does not give you the rights to condemn other nations or insult others. Dreamyrb's fren is a classical narrow minded and over-nationalistic ideal person. But am I going to slam him out right? No. Bcos he reserves his rights on some views and ideas. So don't blame the locals for harboring some views that differ from yours.<br>The logic at the end of the day is.......just fit in. Like for example if you go to a Islamic country, if you are a women, can you choose not to put on a Burqua? Yes, in your original nation, a female may not need to do so, but dun cry foul if  you are caught by a religious police as you are in their country, you ollow their system.......</div>
