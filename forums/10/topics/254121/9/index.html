            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by equlus84:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually I am hesitant to reply as i fear that it might add more fuel to the fire but I just wish to describe some of my observations regarding PRCs in SG and the cyberspace on the whole......<br><br>Yes, studying in ntu, I have met a fair share of nice and easy going PRCs and a also a bunch of PRC that tarnishes the image of their country. I believe that the friction between the locals and the PRCs did not happen over night. Firstly, our lax immigration policies and cheapning of PR-ship and citizenship has caused lots of unhappiness in SG. All citizens regardless of nationality, sex and age have national pride irregardless of how the citizens might bitch abt the country of system. Many locals have felt that the great un-controlled wanton influx of foreigners have not only threaten their jobs and survival but also the social fabrics and racial and national integrity as a whole. As much as some PRC may attempt to integrate into our social fabrics, a large number have choose not to do so. Like the age old saying goes, when you go to Rome, do it the Roman way. By not doing so, many end up sticking out like a sore thumb, thus making themselves the target of critism. We have read news of PDMMs, massage girls, girls cheating old man money and even things like Prostitutes disguising as garang guni man and go around practising their trade in HDB. All these just increase the unhappiness between locals and PRCs. Most SGreans are low-profile individuals that just want to lead a quiet and peaceful life the usual way. Yes, PRCians may mock SGreans as being too straight and staid and some may consdier eg.cheating during exams, doing illegals stuffs as being street smart, flexible or even good adaptability. They dun realise that they are destroying this "pleasantville". Sgreans are like the animals in the forest while the PRCians are like human activity, deforestration, acid rain, water pollution, .......they just dun go hand in hand. I also know that many PRCians refuse to adapt as there are already a huge pool of their citizens here, thus they dun find the need to do so. I also frequently hear PRCians complaining, mocking , bitching, degrading some of the SGreans as we do not do things their way or their style. I believe this is due to the new found economical and military might that make them think so. I have seen many PRC forums that contain many fascistic and racist remarks and a heavy over dose of nationalism. i do not blame them as this is the internet and ppls are given the freedom to critise others. So I'm quite surprise NUS made the girl apologise to those PRCians. Perhaps the Dean should accquaint himself to the PRC antics and slurs on the net. Just like the Americans are too proud of their democracy and ideals, thus they go abt enforcing them  on others which lead to general discontent by some nations with alternative views. Wad most PRCians dun see is that their behave and attitude reflects some wad like dat of USA. Yes PRC can be proud of it's 5000yrs history, bt this does not give you the rights to condemn other nations or insult others. Dreamyrb's fren is a classical narrow minded and over-nationalistic ideal person. But am I going to slam him out right? No. Bcos he reserves his rights on some views and ideas. So don't blame the locals for harboring some views that differ from yours.<br>The logic at the end of the day is.......just fit in. Like for example if you go to a Islamic country, if you are a women, can you choose not to put on a Burqua? Yes, in your original nation, a female may not need to do so, but dun cry foul if  you are caught by a religious police as you are in their country, you ollow their system....... </div></blockquote>Two wrongs don't make a right.  It doesn't matter now who started the fight, that is a grey area.  So forget about trying to score points for "your side"(Singapore 1 PRC 0 etc), coz u'll never run out of new things to hate about each other.  The important part is how we can end the fight, sans mudslinging.<br><br>Drawing a firm line with foreigners on their behaviour is one thing.  Telling them to "fit in or f*** on home" is quite another.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel sorry for the unpleasant dining experience being reported here. When an issue is being brought up, I examine their intentions. Is it a fair criticism or is it intended to spite us? Unfortunately, I do not think some comments are made in good faith, as shown by the use of expletives in some replies. Some Singaporeans bemoan the bad manners of some Chinese nationals. If using bad language constitutes ill manners, when one browses through all the posts in this thread, one may tentatively conclude just who belong to the uncouth lot.<br><br>Since someone is talking about dining, I recall reading an incident in ST two years back. There, a Singaporean was dining with her friend in a posh hotel in Singapore and was engaged in conversation. Apparently, they were talking in a volume that disturbed some Caucasian diners who subsequently threw bread at the Singaporeans. The whole thing then just grew out of control and turned ugly. I am not going to read too much into this incident except to say that bad manners exist amongst people from all races and nationalities. How you interpret them is crucial here. If your intention is to spite, it reflects very badly on your own narrow-mindedness and pettiness.<br><br>Speaking of Caucasians, some replies here (think it is from footprints) speak of how Singaporeans treat white people as if they are superior. This just reminds me of another aspect of the Singaporean psyche (again, this restrictively refers to only a subset of Singaporeans) that might bear on the China-bashing trends in this forum and beyond. Namely, the arrogance and narrow-mindedness shown by some Singaporeans reflects a servile mentality inherited from the colonialization of your country and a traumatized sense of one's own ethnicity. The colonization took away your culture, your language and the pride in your own ethnicity, which lead to a sense of inferiority. This sense of inferiority then engendered a feeling of wrath of insecurity amongst some Singaporeans. They were slighted before in the old days. In order to achieve a delusional sense of psychological balance, they begin to slight other peoples, as a channel to vent out their built-up anger. The reason why Chinese nationals is targeted is explained by a traumatized sense of oneÂ’s own racial identity from the colonization process. As I said, colonization took away your pride in your own ethnicity. Unconsciously, you begin to develop an unfortunately disdainful attitude toward your own race. The Chinese from a developing economy then easily became the scapegoat of the sense of insecurity in your own ethnicity.<br><br>The mentality depicted here applies to only a subset of Singaporeans, apparently. However, it is not without any base. See the following ST forum article two years back that reveals this mentality and thus (directly or indirectly) bears on my argument. Incidentally, it also deals with a dining experience in Singapore:<br><br>STI Home &gt; ST Forum &gt; Story &gt; Print	&gt;&gt; Back to the article<br><br>Feb 5, 2005<br>Boycott establishments that favour Caucasians<br>DURING the colonial era, Caucasians were served first in any establishment, public or private. They enjoyed the best of everything. Singaporeans were subservient and solicitous towards them. As they were our masters, we had no choice in the matter.<br><br>But, alas, four decades after independence, nothing has changed. We still hold Caucasians in higher esteem than we do our fellow citizens, and dance attendance on them at the expense of locals. We see this servile attitude enacted every day. It is endemic.<br><br>Like Mr Long Tien Kian who complained of racial discrimination at a restaurant ('Expats welcome, no reservation required'; ST Jan 29), I, too, have been subjected to such indignity in many establishments, including a five-star hotel. It is a humiliating experience.<br><br>Why the bowing and scraping before Caucasians? I suspect that it is because we suffer from, if I may coin a word for it, Caucasianphobia. It is time to expunge the phobia. After all, we are citizens of a First World nation, no longer the diffident, cringing people we used to be during colonial times. We should be proud of our social standing.<br><br>Caucasians are welcome to enjoy what Singapore has to offer. By all means, be civil to them. However, racial discrimination is unacceptable in multi-racial Singapore and it should therefore be stamped out. We are one nation and one people. This is our land. We Singaporeans deserve equal treatment from our fellow citizens. Singaporeans should wake up and take up arms against establishments that indulge in this degrading practice.<br><br>Boycotting offending establishments is an effective measure. But it has its limitations. To be effective, it must be a collective effort with everyone agreeing to such action, and there lies the difficulty. How do we organise a boycott of, say, a hotel whose clients are mostly foreigners?<br><br>The best solution is a law against racial discrimination so that transgressors can be punished. I strongly call for its legislation if the situation worsens.<br>In the meantime, let us continue to expose establishments which prefer Caucasian custom to ours.<br><br>Anthony Oei<br><br></div>
