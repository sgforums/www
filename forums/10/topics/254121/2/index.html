            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree that most singaporeans have a tainted impression of PRC chinese. I hear it all the time. Even when i tell most people that 90% of my closer friends in the UK universities are from China. People get surprised to hear that. Its almost embedded in their minds that China is backward or something.<br><br>I think some are totally clueless about china. I've met people who totally dispise china. These are the worst lot, when you ask them if they've even visited china, they say no. WTF? These are the self righteous english speaking groups. Fortunately, there are not many of these about.<br><br>From my observations and feedbacks from friends from many countries, singaporeans are probably one of the proudest people walking on this earth. Why is that so? I am a proud singaporean, but i think we should be alittle more modest, dont preach to others on how they should behave or run their country. It makes us look arrogant and stuck up.<br><br>We should accept it guys, we can have opinions about others, good or bad. Its nice to compliment about good things, but be considerate when dispensing the criticisms. It does not reflect well on us if we start bashing every little faults they have.<br><br>That makes us look really petty!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS What crap are you talking about civilised society.  You mean your China is a civilised society.  WE have so many uncivilised China Chinese behaving badly here.  Come to us we show them to you.  If your people from your country misbehave so badly in another country, then stop pointing your fingers at the people of Singapore.<br><br>If you wanna Singaporeans to stop talking negatively about your people from China then you go stop them from misbehaving.  If Singapore is really that bad why is it that you China men and women keep coming here, the number of china people in Singapore is increasing so fast.  Go get lost, you sicko arrogant toad!!!  Why take the prank from others when you and your own China people have lots of prank!!!??<br><br>Stop creating trouble here.  YOu are not welcome.  Go back to China!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To thread starter,<br><br>Thanks for posting your thoughts here. I knew one day someone will step up and say something. I hope this discussion will help to sort out some of the issues raised. I think we can learn alot from this discussion and maybe understand more about each other. Most importantly, i hope you wont be infuriated even further from this thread as the purpose isnt about a war of words and wits here, its a social issue and we should understand from both party's point of view.<br><br>I think deep down, singaporeans are really nice people. We are down to earth and compassionate. We are not as hardcore as our mouths.<br><br>I think at the end of the day, take away all prejudice, arrogance, etc, you'll find that majority of singaporeans are really nice people. Down to earth, compassionate and accomoadating.<br><br>Please ignore those with their foul mouths, bad sheep of the society. I'm sure you'll find that all over the world.<br></div>
