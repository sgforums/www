And if you cannot confirm that you are right, you don't deserve to go bagging one party over the other until you know for sure.<br><br>Position is different for Singaporeans. A double standard exists simply because we are directly connected to the issue in question whereas you're just a third party. We can bag fellow Singaporeans as Singaporeans, and sure as hell we can bag the PRCs as the other party caught up in this debate. Likewise the PRCs can do the same.
