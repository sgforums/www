But to be honest, I seriously doubt that 1/3 of Bahasa's words were taken from English. I am half Indonesian myself and I just can't seem to associate Bahasa with English even though there may be extremly slight similarities.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would say that it is a great personal loss to those individuals who do not know how to speak a word of Bahasa Malaysia!  It is so much easier to learn Bahasa Malaysia than any other existing languages in the Singapore school curriculum because the language is pretty new, the written form is not exceeding half a centuary and the vacabulary is still pretty limited and it is evolving and bringing in more and more foreign words and technical terms  to supplement the usage. So if you are serious, it may take you just a month or so to master all the root words and if you know the grammar part and know how to coin all the root words, you are going to be an expert soon if you keep practising it with a Malay friend!<br><br>I learn the language not because I love the language, I use it as a tool to know more about the cultures, the arts, and the general feelings of our neighbour! It is a regret that not many Singapore Chinese like me know how to communicate with their Malay Singaporeans in Bahasa. I go beyond the causeway to talk and shop from the Malay petty business people, they are the cordial lots if you are kind to them and speak their language! One thing is for sure that the Malay businessmen are NOT as calculative  as their Chinese counterparts and they are very unlikely of going all the way out to cheat you like those Chinese durian sellers in JB or those Bakua sellers in Chinatown!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mahathir placed emphasis on Bahasa in schools when he came to power. The result was a generation of Msians who could hardly speak English.<br>They realised their mistake after more than 20 years and now teach maths and science in english. So cok up.<br>I think if you speak bahasa at the UN, they will scold you bad words and spit on you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dr.Mahatair and his predecessor had made a greatest mistake in their administration because of their personal plight-by telling their countrymen to fully activiting the usage of Bahasa Malaysia. Singapore leaders were smart by adopting English to unite the different races and each race maintain their own mother tongues. Singapore has progress because they could trade with more than 3 quarters of the countries round the globe and part of the main reasons were of course we could communicate with them in perfect English! Moreover Singapore has progressed tremendously in the scientific fields because we studied English and most of the scientific research papers and text are in English! If you studied only Chinese, your mindset may be revolving around the Chinese rich cultures with little scientific  progress. if you study only Bahasa Malaysia, you may just been able to trade with those Malay speaking neighbours, scientifically you were be far far behind those English speaking countries!<br><br>Dr Mahatair realised that internet was completely useless to the Malaysian Malays because very few of them could understand and read English. Moreover ,even those websites in Bahasa Malaysia were limited so how to catch up with the world? By the time he realised the importance of English they were already years behind the clock! Once he shed some crocodile tears when he come to know that those who scored the highest  in Bahasa Malaysia language were Malaysian Chinese or Indian students! The non-bumi in Malaysia were doing well economically becuase they are more versatile in their language and communication skills.<br><br>Many non Chinese Singaporeans have started to learn Madarin because they realised the importance of learning more languages. More Singaporean Malays and Indians are able to speak and communicate in Mandarin. Many could speak better than their Chinese counterparts! Those Chineses in India could speak Tamil fluently! So if you could do what the Roman is doing when you are in Rome, certainly you will have higher survival skills!</div>
