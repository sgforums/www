              <p>Thursday, 15 October 2009</p>
              <p><em>Singapore Democrats</em></p>
              <p><br> <img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/the-party/letstalk.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="240" height="192" align="left">The Singapore Democrats will launch a new online video programme called <em>Let's Talk </em>where we interview personalities and opinion-makers in and around Singapore. <br> <br> This series will be the first of its kind in the country. It is part of
              the SDP's continuing effort to reach out to Singaporeans through the
              Internet.<br> <br> The programme adopts a talk-show format with Mr Chia Ti Lik the
              presenter and interviewer. Each episode will typically run for less
              than ten minutes and will focus on economic, social and political
              issues.</p>
              <p>There is a dearth of such programmes on MediaCorps' channels which
              do little to promote political awareness and to foster a diversity of
              opinions and views. The few interviews that are broadcast by the
              state-run media generally toe the PAP line and seldom challenge
              officialdom or stray very far from the Government's stand.<br> <br> The SDP has never been invited to speak on its shows even though Dr
              Chee Soon Juan has appeared on various programmes like CNN's Talk Asia,
              CNBC's News Tonight, and BBC's World Service. (Shortly thereafter, the
              PAP amended the Broadcasting Act to enable the Government to prosecute
              international broadcasters for "interfering in domestic affairs".)<br> <br> Years ago Caldecott Hill prohibited the mentioning of Dr Chee Soon Juan and his first book <em>Dare To Change</em> on air by its radio stations.  <br> <br> The Democrats hope to change this media culture by introducing <em>Let's Talk</em> where issues of the day are discussed and Singaporeans with important
              things to say are given the opportunity to say it even though their
              messages do not conform to PAP thought.<br> <br> We have lined up a few very interesting interviews which we hope will
              stimulate even more discussion of issues as well as to raise social and
              political awareness in Singapore. <br> <br> We are constantly finding innovative ways of engaging Singaporeans to
              interest them on important issues. This is especially important because
              we are faced with a Government that is bent on keeping the minds of the
              people closed and society free of debate and discussion. <br> <br> We were the first political party to produce political videos (in 1996)
              , the first to use podcasting (in 2006), and the first to use Internet
              tools like Twitter (in 2008) to reach out to Singaporeans. <br> <br> These initiatives will not be the last. The Singapore Democrats will
              continue to break new ground and establish new frontiers in political
              communication. <br> <br> This is possible only because we are an inclusive party that is open to
              diverse views. As a result we continue to grow and take in more people
              in our midst, who then contribute even more ideas which, in turn,
              attract more people. <br> <br> Political parties, in this day and age, cannot afford to be one-track
              minded and operate in rigid ways. We need to be big-tent players by
              encouraging pluralism and tolerance of diverse views. <br> <br> So keep your mouse on this website and let's continue to work for media
              freedom in this country. Better still, why not come on board and help
              the cutting-edge party be even more cutting-edge?</p>

              <p>The Worker's Party, The Singapore Democratic Alliance and the Reform Party should either join forces with the SDP or start similar plans to take advantage of the internet to reach out to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>It is sad that only the SDP is left to educate Singaporeans, and ignite the interests in politics so as to make Singaporeans less apprehensive with politics.</p>
              <p>This is the only way to overwhelm the deep seated suspicion that the PAP will vent its petty vengeance by "fixxing" Singaporeans individually.</p>
              <p>It is only when there is mass participation that the PAP machinery will get clogged and it will have to either jam pack its ISD facilities, or forego the troubles to themselves in tackling the entire population.</p>

              <p>Forget about local media lar - it is a sham. Fortunately, the internet is a boon and hope the parties (opposition) would use it advantageously and in turn people benefit.</p>
              <p>Frankly, voting out the ruling party may not be easy lar but the possibility of a two-party system is sth singaporeans should embrace. It may not overwhelmingly change things but at least there is a chance of accountablity, costs of living can be checked. There are too many areas that can be enumerated or mentioned here.  </p>
              <p>One party system is flawed - <strong>just watch and observe</strong> - n u would know what i mean.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, we suffer at the hands of a few political imbeciles who assume arrogantly that they know all.</p>

              <p>Shake the tree hard enough - the parasitical worms, dead leaves, dry twigs, and all the rotten fruits and seeds will fall off from the tree, and allow the tree with the hope of a new beginning.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should take courage that our fore-fathers did place their trust in a young lawyer, who took over the PM seat at age 35 - with zilch experience in politics nor as a Minister, and still Singapore survive the deceit in leading us to a failed merger with Malaysia, and with our forefathers galvanising themselves to break ourselves free from over dependence to the British Military Camps and Naval Bases.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans can take heart that our forefathers had achieved so much with so little resources during their various moments of crisis after crisis, with the trials of uncertain futures during the Indonesian Konfrontasi, sudden expulsion from Malaysia, and the surprised announcement of the withdrawal of the British Military from Singapore.</p>
              <p>If our forefathers were able to survive through all the crisis after crisis, when courage is needed, why is it impossible for this generation to rise up to take back the responsibility for our own future by electing an Alternative Political Party into power, even if they do not have any political experience ?</p>
              <p>There are many capable Singaporeans, who will step forward to serve Singapore without the million dollar wages that the PAP politicians demand for themselves.</p>
              <p>These Singaporeans prefer to step away from the Third World politics practised by the PAP, and prefer to be apolitical, but many are waiting to provide their service when the call comes through.</p>
