            <div class='col-md body'>A country needs good leaders who can only be groomed or thrown up through open political processes from the masses.<br><br>Such leaders could only be tested out through involvement in community activities, grass-roots organizations, trades and industries. The masses will support and nominate people with ideas, ideals and idealism as well as a sense of pragmatism to come forward for election to build a strong and properous country in the context of new world order.<br><br>At present, this selection process may be too narrow. Selection is confined to a small group many of whom have got into parliament due to allegiance and party loyalty. They were coopted to join politics in a play-safe screening process to suit party's ideas of leadership.<br><br>Many may be technocrats as they did not go through any contest or baptism by fire in open arena. They may be good in managing existing order and conventionalism not having the extra qualities and charisma needed to solve the bigger problems and issues we may be facing.<br><br>So far none of our 2nd and 3rd tier leadership seem to have succeeded in eradicating entrenched unworkable policies. They did not come across as people daring to put up their own visions to fit new challenges.<br><br>It is not too late for people to put up proven leaders from among trade and industry and professional bodies etc who are courageous and able persons to come forward to serve Singapore. Open up the political process to be accountable in leadership selection.<br><br>The present de-politisation, machinery and co-coption scheme will only hamper our progress in this direction as it is a containment process. We need leadership renewal for Singapore survival and wellbeing by removing all constraints and openning up to participation by all so that the right leadership will come forward to contribute the nation building. Appointing leaders from the masses will be a good legacy to the retiring leaders and people will greatly appreciate such a contribution.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
