              <h3 class="post-title">Why it is hard for the PAP govt to do the right thing...</h3>
              <p>Another day <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/283886.asp">another explanation</a> for the 21% increase in electricity tariffs. Recent explanation gets
              interesting - the $1B profits last year is due to one-off asset sales,
              SP Power does not benefit from the price hikes and Singapore is already
              very efficient in generating power so our consumers are getting the
              best possible deal etc. The thing is Singapore Power did not make $1B
              only last year it made this amount the year before and even more the
              year before that[<a href="http://www.singaporepower.com.sg/html/investor_relation/financial_information/financial_information_contents.htm">Link</a>]. As for efficiency, some Singaporeans are asking if we are so efficient, why are the paying <a href="http://www.salary.sg/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/comparison-of-electricity-tariff-increase-across-cities.PNG">2nd highest tariffs in the world</a> and 82% more than Hong Kong. Why did Singapore Power use the billions
              to buy those Aussie assets instead of returning it to consumers? They
              are very good at explaining things to citizens so maybe next week the
              govt can generate a new explanation for all this.<br><br>Everytime
              Singaporeans stand up and ask the govt to do the right thing usually
              all we get is an explanation why the govt cannot do it. Hold back GST
              hike - cannot....but after all the explanation to us why it was so
              critical to accept the pain of GST hike, we had the horror of finding
              out that the govt had a <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/specials/budget2008/">surplus of $6.4B</a> straight out of our pockets. Now people are asking if the govt can undo
              the painful GST hike given the recession is biting hard. I'm sure the
              govt has a good explanation why it cannot. Along the way to this 2008
              financial crisis and recession we have received a number of
              explanations why the public transport fare has to be hiked - oil price
              increase, improvement of service quality, rising costs. Well the oil
              price has collapsed and did anyone see improvement in service
              quality?...Its more like people are getting used suffocating sardine
              cans which we call buses. Reduce fares due to fall in oil price? I'm
              sure the govt has a good explanation why that cannot be done.<br><br>Given
              we have a govt that is so good at explaining why it has to do what it
              does, it is only right that I reciprocate by giving an explanation why
              the PAP govt finds it hard to do the right thing. ...hmm where do I
              begin? There was a time when Singapore paid its ministers only $10,000
              a month and Singapore didn't sink. Why? Those days the job of the
              minister was simple - he looked at the needs of the people and does
              what was best for them in the long run. All policy decisions were
              simple and optimised to best serve the people of Singapore. Today our
              ministers are paid $150-$200K a month. Why? The job of the govt is a
              lot more complex now. The PAP govt has links and stakes in a huge
              conglomerate of GLCs and decision making is no longer so simple.
              Singapore is now Singapore Inc - the interests of the PAP govt is now
              diversified. When the minibond fiasco erupted, the job of the Hong Kong
              govt was very simple - they stood firmly on the side of the people,
              spoke to them first to find out what they needed, threaten to sanction
              the banks for wrong doing and recently promised to provide unlimited
              sums to pursue legal action against the bank. Things are not so simple
              in Singapore - DBS bank for example is part of the PAP govt financial
              eco-system so MAS had to discuss with them first before listening to
              Singaporeans on the way forward to resolve the matter. Our transport
              ministry probably has more meetings with our transport monopolies than
              ordinary citizens to understand their financial concerns....hmm
              incidentally SMRT has increased <a href="http://www.smrt.com.sg/Upload/2008103116462719706.pdf">its profits again for the latest quarter</a>.<br><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span><br>Next
              time the PAP govt does something that you think is not right please be
              more understanding. Things are a lot more complex behind the scenes and
              unlike many other govts the PAP govt cannot simply do what is best for
              you.</p>

              <p>If your monthly electricity bill is $100 prior to the 21% increase, you will still be levied a 7% GST that result in a monthly total of $107.</p>
              <p>Now with the 21% increase being implemented, the monthly bill will be $121 PLUS the 7% GST - resulting in an increased monthly bill to $129.47.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Assuming a population of 3 million Singaporeans form households of four persons, this will result in 750,000 households.</p>
              <p>The additional revenue from the 21% increase in Electricity Charges will result in the 750,000 households paying an extra $21 per month - which totals $15,750,000.</p>
              <p>Before the 21% increase, the 7% GST collection from 750,000 households is 750,000 x $7 - resulting in GST total of $5,250,000 per month.</p>
              <p>After the 21% increase, the GST collection from 750,000 households is 750,000 x $8.47 - which totals $6,352,500 that amount to a monthly addition of $1,102,500 into the GST box.</p>
              <p>At the flick of the pen, this Government has increased its monthly revenue to a remarkable total of $16,852,500.00 - which only represent the sum collected from the 21% increase and the 7% GST levy.</p>
              <p>In one year, the Government would have collected $202,230,000.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are looking at Year 2008 as a base, while <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.senokopower.com.sg/plant.asp">Senoko Power Station was developed in 3 stages between 1976 to 1983 at a total cost of $1.2 billion; and upgraded in 1990-91 at a total cost of $300 million.  </a></p>
              <p>If the monthly electricity is assumed at an average of $100 per household since 1976(with no GST), the annual revenue to the Government will be 750,000 x $100 x 12 months - resulting in Annual Gross Revenue of $900,000,000.</p>
              <p>From 1978 till 2008 - (when Senoko was sold), the Government would have collected over a period of 30 years : $900,000,000 x 30 years : a Gross Sum of $27 Billion. </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://pepei.pennnet.com/display_article/341939/6/ARTCL/none/BUSIN/1/Singapore's-Temasek-to-sell-last-of-three-power-firms/">In October 2008, Temasek sold Senoko Power to Japan’s Marubeni Corp for S$3.65 billion, and the intended sale of PowerSeraya is estimated to fetch around S$2.5bn .  </a></p>
              <p>It is quite obvious that the initial infrastructure cost of the Power Stations have been covered more then ten times over during its life time before Temasek sold off these units to foreigners.</p>
              <p>Where is the money that Temasek when operating the Power Stations and selling the generated electricity to Singapore households since 1978 ?</p>
              <p>Where is the money collected from the sale of the Power Stations when these were already paid for by the Government from Tax Payers' monies ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The humongous amount of revenue collected by Temasek Holdings ownership of these power stations would have been better used to uplift the quality of life for our Young as well as those over 65 years.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the profits generated from the Citizens hard earned monies - toiled from sweat, blood and tears - have seen the Ministers and the Ruling Clique paying themselves more, while ensuring that the Citizens accept low wage increases, or even fixed pay on short term employment contracts.</p>
