              <p>in hongkong, the regulator get the power service companys to revise their tariff lower by 3%, the citizens still say its not justifiable for the steep fall in oil prices..</p>
              <p>yet in singapore, our garbermnt out to maximum their profit increase the electricity by 21% and ppl here are still keeping mum abt it.. seems like singaporeans r so much richer than hk citizens and its much easier to run a country like spore where everyone jus suffer in silence and dun dare to voice out..</p>

              <p>in fourth reich opinion, selling energy company is quite common in many developed nations. such as Australia. But the only difference is that in these countries, running it is not as profitable as in Singapore. the reason they could be giving is because of the forward energy pricing, better management to lower cost, efficiency and $%$^.</p>

              <p>It's also the same case with property tax, everytime they decrease the tax rates, but everytime I ended up paying more. When they lower the tax rates, they increase the Net Annual Value, that's why in the end always end up paying more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Price will come down in another 3 months, after they have profitted the $178 million first. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Observations from the past few weeks have led me to conclude that Hong Kong's government is far more superior than our's. Given that difference in salary that we pay our ministers, I am thoroughly convinced that our Government is a <strong>waste</strong>.</p>
              <p>I've been saying that our government needs to provide bank deposits guarantee and they've just realized they need to do so.. because money is moving out of Singapore to overseas..</p>
              <p>Here's my next suggestion to the governement - free up lending money and help SME business with their debt. Why? Because if not, we're going to see more commercial defaults which will eventually lead to unemployment.</p>
              <p>Let's set a clock and see how long our smart scholarly economist will realize this and how soon will our government come to realization that they have to do this.</p>

The last time fuel prices were cut was on Oct 7. <br><br>On Thursday, Shell took the lead by reducing prices at 10.30am, followed by Singapore Petroleum Company (SPC) and ExxonMobil at 11.30am, and finally Caltex at noon. <br><br>All four companies have cut petrol prices by five cents per litre for all fuel grades, and 10 cents a litre for diesel. Premium 95 grade now stands at S$1.846 a litre before discounts, while the price of diesel is reduced to S$1.603. <br><br>The latest revision follows a series of petrol price cuts since July 2008, after a drop in crude oil prices. <br><br>Crude oil futures were down more than 50 per cent from record highs of above US$147 reached in July, when prices rocketed on fears of supply disruptions. <br><br>In early London trade on Thursday, Brent crude slid below US$68 a barrel to the lowest level in more than 15 months, as slowing energy demand took its toll. <br><br>Brent North Sea crude for November delivery slumped to US$67.17 a barrel - the lowest level since mid-2007. <br><br>New York's main futures contract, light sweet crude for November delivery, was down US$2.06 at US$72.48 a barrel after sinking as low as US$71.21. </span></p></div>

              Thank you for the input.
              
              By breaking into smaller bands HK's rates are also fairer to the consumers. My household less than 300kWh usage will cost us $57.68 in HK's rates and $97.74(GST inclusive) in Sg rate. No wonder so many Sg households are unable to pay their utilities bills! We have been grossly overcharged!
