              <p>I think we have to be fair to them too, they did clarify that the charges for Oct to Dec was based on "future price" of around US$100 which amounts to around SG$150. But the thing is when I look at the historical price chart for crude oil, it shows:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>May 2008 = US$130 (approximately)</p>
              <p>June 2008 = US$135 (approximately)</p>
              <p>July 2008 = US$145 (approximately)</p>
              <p>August 2008 = US$115 (approximately)</p>
              <p>September 2008 = US$ 100 (approximately)</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If that's the case, then what about the charges for May to August? It was definitely way above US$100, but we still pay around 25 cents per kwh. <strong>When crude oil was US$135 we pay 25 cents per kwh, but when crude oil goes down to US$100 we pay 30 cents per kwh? Makes sense? The person doing the calculation must have some PhD in Abstract Mathematics. </strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The trend line for the price of crude is also on the decline. Then there is the issue of whether we actually use "crude oil" to generate electricity, when 80% of our electricity generation comes from "natural gas".</strong></p>

              <p>Should sporeanos be happy and proud that electricity has gotten more expensive?</p>
              <p>When so many things got more expensive, should sporeanos be more proud than ever?</p>
              <p>I went out and see that shopping mall foods have skyrocketed to easily 6 bucks for 1 simple item or disk!!   A simple date will cost the man on average easily 100 bucks just for basic entertainment for 2. Does this form a marriage barrier? Pls exclude those who got rich fudder mudder aunty and god-dudder-mudder.</p>
              <p>When discussion about cost of living in spore, we must always remind ourselves that we EXCLUDE all rich and filthy rich who could have earned their wealth either by inheritance or strange means.  If I am one of them, I certainly would have no compraing about ALL and EVERY HIKE of the past, present and future. I would feel that things are moving in the right direction - when less car ply the roads, and i still can , i feel even more haughty.</p>
              <p>since sporeanos accept all and every hikes by way of continuing to Pay and Pay for hiked items, I must congratulate sporeans for more good years where expensive lifestyle makes you feel very the 1st world. yahooo! 1st world citizen leh! Proud ah!</p>
              <p>Huat Ah!</p>
              <p>I welcome all hikes. The more the better ..... for business and the country. </p>

              <p>It just make my blood boil to see that time and again, the
              Singapore Govt is always using Oil Prices in Middle-East to justify
              higher and higher tarrifs for electricity!</p>
              <p>Note: Singapore signed a very long-term contract with Indonesia
              to supply the former with Natural Gas so as to convert them into
              supplying electricity to Singaporeans.  And the price is
              already fixed in the cont<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">ract at very low rate and will therefore
              NOT fluctuate.</span></span></p>
              <p>Hence, since we are not relying on Oil to make electricity, why
              penalised Singaporeans for Higher Tarrifs!  When Oil Prices
              have dropped since Sept, why the need to raise Electricity Tarrifs
              again! I was expecting it to come down and not up!</p>
              <p>Since the last Election, Govt has increased almost everything
              except pay!  From more ERP gantries being build, increase taxi
              Fuel Surcharge (so fast to implement but not fast enough to remove,
              especially since the fuel price has come down significantly, there
              is no reason for these taxi drivers to earn that extra Fuel
              Surcharge also), increase in Bus and MRT fares, increase in
              electricity tarrifs, etc.... Infact, for those forgetful ones, it
              was the Govt who has decided to increase GST from 3% to 5% right
              after the GE!  And the lame excuse was that the Govt did not
              know that they would need to increase the GST so soon... completely
              bullshit.</p>
              <p>I just hope that the next GE will be here soon...... Guess who
              shall we vote for?</p>
              <p>The Govt even said that they do not need any opposition to do
              any audit on them or to have a Check &amp; balance scheme.  If
              this was the case, we will not have expose the NKF Saga and the
              Peanut joke...</p>
              <p>So for the forgetful Singaporeans, everytime when it comes to
              GE, the Govt will give us one Chicken drumstick and most of us will
              feel like Heaven... In Reality, they demand one whole chicken back
              from us! Now we are in Hell!</p>
              <p>Enough is Enough.  The Govt must be checked. Policies to
              increase prices should not be done at will....</p>

                                                  <br><br>The power distributor’s subsidiary SP Services explained that
                                                  the increase was due to higher oil prices and that for the October to
                                                  December quarter, the tariffs were pegged to a higher forward fuel oil
                                                  price of $155.14 per barrel, compared with the previous quarter’s
                                                  $112.35 per barrel. <br><br>Mr Dave Ernsberger, the Asia editorial director of energy
                                                  news service provider Platts, told this newspaper: “Fuel oil prices hit
                                                  that record high for about one month only and we have to pay the high
                                                  power prices for three months, which seems a little unlucky for all of
                                                  us, really.”
                                                  <br><br>But as the new fuel price was 38 per cent higher than the
                                                  previous quarter’s, SP was trying to tell us that it was not passing on
                                                  the entire increase in the cost of the fuel oil.
                                                  <br><br>What made the announcement even more egregious was that it
                                                  came at a time when the price of oil — on which the tariffs are based
                                                  despite the fact that 80 per cent of the electricity produced here
                                                  comes from natural gas — was on its way down.
                                                  <br><br>And in the third quarter, customers had already been subjected
                                                  to a 5-per-cent increase, again the result of high fuel prices — with
                                                  the US$82.61 per barrel being 11 per cent higher than the US$74.40 per
                                                  barrrel cost of the second quarter.
                                                  <br><br>According to a source, the price of natural gas supplied to
                                                  the gencos (the power generating companies like Tuas Power, PowerSeraya
                                                  and Senoko Power) has fallen in recent times in tandem with the decline
                                                  in the price of High Sulphur Fuel Oil.
                                                  <br><br>Furthermore, the latest hike comes in the wake of the
                                                  financial crisis, rising costs and commodity prices, and, when everyone
                                                  else is being exhorted to tighten their belts.
                                                  <br><br>For the year ended March 31 this year, SingPower made a
                                                  whopping $1.09 billion on revenues of $5.45 billion. In fact, in the
                                                  last three years, the power distributor has been raking more than a
                                                  billion dollars a year in net profits. <br><br>The gencos, too, have been making good money. 
                                                  <br><br>For instance, Tuas Power, which provides 25 per cent of the
                                                  electricity consumed here, reported an Ebitda (earnings before
                                                  interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of$331 million on
                                                  revenues of $2.27 billion for the financial year ended March 31, last
                                                  year. Net profit before tax rose to $218.7 million from $130 million
                                                  the year before, and it had a healthy return on equity (ROE) of 16.5
                                                  per cent.
                                                  <br><br>Senoko, the country’s largest power generator, with an
                                                  installed capacity of3,300 megawatts and providing 30 per cent of the
                                                  power supply, posted revenues of $2.49 billion, an Ebitda of $245
                                                  million and net income of $130 million for the year ended March this
                                                  year.
                                                  <br><br>With an installed capacity of 3,100 MW, PowerSeraya had for
                                                  the year ended March this year, revenues of $2.8 billion, after-tax net
                                                  profits of $218 million, and an ROE of 19 per cent.
                                                  <br><br>But some suspect the hike was due to pressure from the gencos
                                                  to maintain their profit margins, especially in the case of Tuas and
                                                  Senoko, which were recently sold for $4.2 billion and $4 billion
                                                  respectively. Tuas was bought by China Huaneng Group, while Senoko was
                                                  acquired by a consortium led by Japan’s Marubeni. PowerSeraya has been
                                                  put up for sale.
                                                  <br><br>One observer noted: “With the gencos being sold for high
                                                  prices now, there might be pressure for the new genco owners to recover
                                                  their capital from increasing the cost of electricity. As two of the
                                                  gencos are now in foreign hands, the government (through the Energy
                                                  Market Authority) may have less influence going forward to get the
                                                  gencos to keep their prices low.”
                                                  <br><br>Furthermore, aren’t the three main gencos supposed to be in
                                                  competition with each other? Why do they then appear to be ordering
                                                  their fuel at the same time and paying exactly the same price?
                                                  <br><br>In the case of Singapore Power, perhaps we are paying the
                                                  price for it achieving “one of the best network performance worldwide,
                                                  surpassing its peers operating comparable underground networks”.
                                                  <br><br>For sure, the next quarter should see a sharp fall in
                                                  electricity tariffs, given the recent steep decline in oil prices, but
                                                  are we really getting the best deal? </span></span></span></p>

              <p><span>Is this the best deal? <span><br> <br> <span>Next quarter should see fall in electricity tariffs, given
              steep decline in oil prices</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span>SHOCKING! No pun intended but that was how the
              recent 22-per-cent hike in electricity tariffs by Singapore Power
              (SingPower) was described by many. Households and other users have
              to pay 30.45 cents a kilowatt hour till the end of the year.<br> <br> The power distributor’s subsidiary SP Services explained that the
              increase was due to higher oil prices and that for the October to
              December quarter, the tariffs were pegged to a higher forward fuel
              oil price of $155.14 per barrel, compared with the previous
              quarter’s $112.35 per barrel.<br> <br> Mr Dave Ernsberger, the Asia editorial director of energy news
              service provider Platts, told this newspaper: “Fuel oil prices hit
              that record high for about one month only and we have to pay the
              high power prices for three months, which seems a little unlucky
              for all of us, really.”<br> <br> But as the new fuel price was 38 per cent higher than the previous
              quarter’s, SP was trying to tell us that it was not passing on the
              entire increase in the cost of the fuel oil.<br> <br> What made the announcement even more egregious was that it came at
              a time when the price of oil — on which the tariffs are based
              despite the fact that 80 per cent of the electricity produced here
              comes from natural gas — was on its way down.<br> <br> And in the third quarter, customers had already been subjected to a
              5-per-cent increase, again the result of high fuel prices — with
              the US$82.61 per barrel being 11 per cent higher than the US$74.40
              per barrrel cost of the second quarter.<br> <br> According to a source, the price of natural gas supplied to the
              gencos (the power generating companies like Tuas Power, PowerSeraya
              and Senoko Power) has fallen in recent times in tandem with the
              decline in the price of High Sulphur Fuel Oil.<br> <br> Furthermore, the latest hike comes in the wake of the financial
              crisis, rising costs and commodity prices, and, when everyone else
              is being exhorted to tighten their belts.<br> <br> For the year ended March 31 this year, SingPower made a whopping
              $1.09 billion on revenues of $5.45 billion. In fact, in the last
              three years, the power distributor has been raking more than a
              billion dollars a year in net profits.<br> <br> The gencos, too, have been making good money.<br> <br> For instance, Tuas Power, which provides 25 per cent of the
              electricity consumed here, reported an Ebitda (earnings before
              interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of$331 million on
              revenues of $2.27 billion for the financial year ended March 31,
              last year. Net profit before tax rose to $218.7 million from $130
              million the year before, and it had a healthy return on equity
              (ROE) of 16.5 per cent.<br> <br> Senoko, the country’s largest power generator, with an installed
              capacity of3,300 megawatts and providing 30 per cent of the power
              supply, posted revenues of $2.49 billion, an Ebitda of $245 million
              and net income of $130 million for the year ended March this
              year.<br> <br> With an installed capacity of 3,100 MW, PowerSeraya had for the
              year ended March this year, revenues of $2.8 billion, after-tax net
              profits of $218 million, and an ROE of 19 per cent.<br> <br> But some suspect the hike was due to pressure from the gencos to
              maintain their profit margins, especially in the case of Tuas and
              Senoko, which were recently sold for $4.2 billion and $4 billion
              respectively. Tuas was bought by China Huaneng Group, while Senoko
              was acquired by a consortium led by Japan’s Marubeni. PowerSeraya
              has been put up for sale.<br> <br> One observer noted: “With the gencos being sold for high prices
              now, there might be pressure for the new genco owners to recover
              their capital from increasing the cost of electricity. As two of
              the gencos are now in foreign hands, the government (through the
              Energy Market Authority) may have less influence going forward to
              get the gencos to keep their prices low.”<br> <br> Furthermore, aren’t the three main gencos supposed to be in
              competition with each other? Why do they then appear to be ordering
              their fuel at the same time and paying exactly the same
              price?<br> <br> In the case of Singapore Power, perhaps we are paying the price for
              it achieving “one of the best network performance worldwide,
              surpassing its peers operating comparable underground
              networks”.<br> <br> For sure, the next quarter should see a sharp fall in electricity
              tariffs, given the recent steep decline in oil prices, but are we
              really getting the best deal?</span></span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">PAP knows Singaporeans cant vote
              them out because their dirty politics has resulted in good people
              unwilling to join opposition politics. Combined with supersized
              GRCs anchored with a Minister, its no wonder PAP hikes prices at
              its whims and fancies.</span></p>
