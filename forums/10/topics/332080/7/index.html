                                                                                      for power generation and the electricity tariff must reflect this cost.
                                                                                      Indeed, the cost of fuel accounts for about 60 per cent of the
                                                                                      electricity tariff.</p>
              <p>While 80 per cent of our electricity is generated using natural
                                                                                      gas, the price of this gas is tied by long-term contracts to the fuel
                                                                                      oil price. <strong>This is the market practice in Asia where fuel oil is the

                                                                                      pricing. </strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">If what they said is true why did Hong Kong public listed company cut tarrifs?  Most importantly, <strong>where did the ultra high returns on equity (ROE) <span style="color: #ff0000;">25.5%</span> of Singapore Power come from? Not by overcharging Singaporeans by buying at gas prices and charging at oil prices?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>For your info DBS Bank ROE is 12%</strong>*</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">If the Ultra High ROE is due to super efficient management over Hong Kong Companies, could the Singapore Power please explain what did they do to beat Hong Kong companies hands down.</span></p>

              <p>The electricity tariff in Singapore is therefore pegged to
                                                                                      the fuel oil price. If the fuel oil price goes up, the electricity
                                                                                      tariff will be increased. Likewise, if there is a reduction in the fuel
                                                                                      oil price, the electricity tariff will be reduced accordingly, as
                                                                                      happened in two consecutive quarters last year.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>To provide certainty in pricing, </strong>the electricity tariff is
                                                                                      set in advance for a three-month period based on the three-month
                                                                                      forward fuel oil price. For example, the forward fuel oil price quoted
                                                                                      last July for delivery between this month and December will determine
                                                                                      the tariff for this period. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Another lame reason. Then why Hong Kong power companies do not need to follow out certainty in pricing excuse?</span></p>
              <p>As the fuel oil price increased sharply in July this year,
                                                                                      there was a corresponding spike in the July forward fuel oil price for
                                                                                      this month until December. This is why we are experiencing a sharp
                                                                                      increase in the electricity tariff now. Recently, the fuel oil price
                                                                                      has started to come down. If the downward trend continues this month,
                                                                                      we can expect a reduction in the electricity tariff for the first
                                                                                      quarter of next year.</p>
              <p>The increase in the electricity tariff has nothing to do with
                                                                                      the recent Formula One event. The F1 organisers brought in their own
                                                                                      generators and equipment for the race. The electricity tariff was not
                                                                                      used to pay for the costs of lighting the F1 circuit.</p>
              <p>The increase in tariff is also not linked to the
                                                                                      privatisation of the electricity industry. On the contrary, the
                                                                                      privatisation process has helped to promote greater competition and
                                                                                      drive efficiency gains in the power generation companies. This has
                                                                                      brought real benefits to all consumers. Despite the substantial rise in
                                                                                      fuel oil price over the years, the increase in electricity tariff has
                                                                                      been much smaller in comparison. Our electricity price would have been
                                                                                      much higher had it not been for competition.</p>

Please be more humane even though you need to make profits. These aren't exactly Rosey Times and life isn't Peachy amongst the mid and low incomers. <br><br>=========================================<br>LET FLY <br>By Lediati Tan <br><br>October 04, 2008 <br><br><br>THE latest power rate hike has Miss Chua Kim Choo scratching her head.<br><br>On the one hand, the bank administrator read in the newspapers that electricity bills are up by 21 per cent from Wednesday. On the other hand, there are news reports saying that oil prices have fallen.<br><br>Miss Chua, who is in her 50s, pointed out that My Paper carried an report that quoted the Energy Market Authority (EMA) as saying that the projected fuel-oil price for the next three months will jump by 38 per cent, justifying the 21 per cent increase.<br><br><br>She said that in the same day's paper, there was another report saying that Taiwan Airlines will cut fuel surcharges on international routes to reflect oil prices.<br><br>The latest round of power hikes - the fourth this year - has left MissChua fuming.<br><br>'The 21 per cent increase is ridiculous. It's too high. <br><br>'How can it be justified when there are reports saying fuel prices have fallen?' she asked.<br><br>It is the highest one-time increase in about seven years, EMA said.<br><br>EMA chief executive Khoo Chin Hean explained that petrol and diesel pump prices, which have fallen in recent weeks, are not indicative of how much power generation companies have to pay. <br><br>Since 2004, electricity tariffs have been pegged to the price of fuel oil delivered to power generation firms for the next three months, otherwise known as 'forward fuel oil' prices.<br><br>Mr Khoo was hopeful that if oil prices continued to drop, electricity tariffs could fall in the next quarterly revision, due in January.<br><br>When this reporter asked Miss Chua if she understands what forward fuel oil prices means, she replied: 'I don't know what it means. I don't think the majority of us do.'<br><br>This only adds to her confusion.<br><br>Miss Chua lives in a five-room HDB flat with her younger sister and her 20-year-old niece. <br><br>They pay power bills of more than $300 a month. With the latest increase, they can expect to pay another $63.<br><br>Miss Chua said: 'I've grown tired of analysing it, so I just pay.'<br><br>She said she and her family have tried out ways to cut down on their power usage. They no longer leave their electrical appliances on standby and they have used energy-saving lightbulbs for the last three years.<br><br>But, she lamented, 'no matter how much we save on usage, the electricity bills are always high'.<br><br>Despite the Government's rebates, she feels that the lower-income will be the worst-hit, although she thinks middle-income earners are also increasingly being squeezed.</p></div>

              <p>To the Khoo and the Teo of EMA,</p>
              <p>For the next 3 months oil price projected as your "forward fuel pil prices" will be S$ 155 per barrel.  What if oil prices stays at S$ 90 per barrel  instead? What are you going to do?  If it is truth you had sucked all citizens by 60% min of the over charged S$65 per barrel? </p>
              <p>Next quarter how do you charge if oil price at S$ 90 per barrel? What will be your "forward fuel price" again? S$ 120?? to reflect adjustment of "going down only"??  or compensate the citizen by projecting it at S$ 35 per barrel??</p>
              <p> Will this so called "forward fuel price" compensate your "over &amp; irresponsible" assumption price??</p>
              <p>Since both of you take high high post and collect high high salary, then must also take big big responsibilities mah..  Please automatic and submit your resignation if your prediction overcharge the citizen by more then 20%.  Then maybe citizen thumbs up for you.</p>
              <p>Learn from the previous PTC guy (dont know what name la) after made the decision to increas public transport and kenna left right centre from the public but cannot U-turn then after that resign la.  But the hack is still remember from the newspaper with his F-face and title "I know I am right!"</p>
              <p>Lets settle one thing at a time, next will be HDB.. S$8,000 income cap but HDB selling at S$ 600K plus.  Subsidise = reduce profit and not what we'd been understood since 1970s it is a government sharing of the building cost for the citizen..  This one is the most solid one... MBT go where, where zialat.. Golden horse for PAP cos where he sit all price goes up.  If LHL want to "revamp" another area to increase revenue, you guys know by know who do LHL call...</p>

              <p>Posting in the net could be an action.  Dont estimate the power of internet, you keyed your credit card number to do purchase so you can trust the internet then you can trust the power.  All things need patience, time and hardwork.  For those who agreed for the past 3 years, nothing had been forwarding for the citizen except for all stupid policies increasing our hardship and telling us to accept only so that they can collect their million dollars salary and no need to think so much.  (or maybe their high salary is just to tell citizen to shut up and live with it for the government)  Now despite the real and present social problems, they go ahead with the domitory in Serangoon Garden then waste more money by creating another route. Are they listening??  </p>
              <p>We got 3 more years to go, wack one at a time.  Next election will be the time where citizen throws away their fear and walk out of their comfort zone.  If you want no more nonsense policy that is the only chance if not, another 5 years and then GST 10%, maybe every citizen must rent one of their room to 2 FW and collect little money cos government say you ppl must be understanding mah.  Also to solve the housing problems for FW and also to let citizen get close to the FW to understand them better, stay with them lor. </p>
              <p>Choose!!!! 3 more years of hardship (which we dont know what else they will come up with) or another 8 years of hell without a voice.</p>
