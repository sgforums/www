              <p>By Mark Pittman and Bob Ivry</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&amp;sid=aGq2B3XeGKok">http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&amp;sid=aGq2B3XeGKok</a></p>
              <p>Feb. 9 (Bloomberg) -- <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The stimulus package the U.S. Congress
              is completing would raise the government’s commitment to solving
              the financial crisis to $9.7 trillion, enough to pay off more
              than 90 percent of the nation’s home mortgages. </span></strong></p>
              <p>The Federal Reserve, Treasury Department and Federal Deposit
              Insurance Corporation have lent or spent almost $3 trillion over
              the past two years and pledged up to $5.7 trillion more. The
              Senate is to vote this week on an economic-stimulus measure of at
              least $780 billion. It would need to be reconciled with an $819
              billion plan the House approved last month.</p>
              <p>Only the stimulus bill to be approved this week, the $700
              billion Troubled Asset Relief Program passed four months ago and
              $168 billion in tax cuts and rebates enacted in 2008 have been
              voted on by lawmakers. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The remaining $8 trillion is in lending
              programs and guarantees, almost all under the Fed and FDIC.
              Recipients’ names have not been disclosed. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">“We’ve seen money go out the back door of this government
              unlike any time in the history of our country,” Senator Byron
              Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, said on the Senate floor Feb. 3.
              “Nobody knows what went out of the Federal Reserve Board, to
              whom and for what purpose. How much from the FDIC? How much from
              TARP? When? Why?” </span></strong></p>
              <p>Financial Rescue</p>
              <p>The pledges, amounting to almost two-thirds of the value of
              everything produced in the U.S. last year, are intended to rescue
              the financial system after the credit markets seized up about 18
              months ago. The promises are composed of about $1 trillion in
              stimulus packages, around $3 trillion in lending and spending and
              $5.7 trillion in agreements to provide aid. The total already
              tapped has decreased about 1 percent since November, mostly
              because foreign central banks are using fewer dollars in
              currency-exchange agreements called swaps.</p>
              <p>Federal Reserve lending to banks peaked at a record $2.3
              trillion in December, dropping to $1.83 trillion by last week.
              The Fed balance sheet is still more than double the $880 billion
              it was in the week before Sept. 17 when it agreed to accept
              lower-quality collateral.</p>
              <p>The worst financial crisis in two generations has erased
              $14.5 trillion, or 33 percent, of the value of the world’s
              companies since Sept. 15; brought down Bear Stearns Cos. and
              Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.; and led to the takeover of Merrill
              Lynch &amp; Co. by Bank of America Corp.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The $9.7 trillion in pledges would be enough to send a
              $1,430 check to every man, woman and child alive in the world.
              It’s 13 times what the U.S. has spent so far on wars in Iraq and
              Afghanistan, according to Congressional Budget Office data, and
              is almost enough to pay off every home mortgage loan in the U.S.,
              calculated at $10.5 trillion by the Federal Reserve. </span></strong></p>
              <p>‘All the Stops’</p>
              <p>“The Fed, Treasury and FDIC are pulling out all the stops
              to stop any widespread systemic damage to the economy,” said
              Dana Johnson, chief economist for Comerica Inc. in Dallas and a
              former senior economist at the central bank. “The federal
              government is on the hook for an awful lot of money but I think
              it’s needed to help the financial system recover.”</p>
              <p>Bloomberg News tabulated data from the Fed, Treasury and
              FDIC and interviewed regulators, economists and academic
              researchers to gauge the full extent of the government’s rescue
              effort.</p>
              <p>Commitments may expand again soon. Treasury Secretary
              Timothy Geithner postponed until tomorrow an announcement that
              may invite private investment as a way to clear toxic debt from
              bank balance sheets. Measures that have been settled include a
              new round of injections of taxpayer funds into banks, targeted at
              those identified by regulators as most in need of additional
              capital, people briefed on the matter said.</p>
              <p>Program Delay</p>
              <p>The government is already backing $301 billion of Citigroup
              Inc. securities and another $118 billion from Bank of America.
              The government hasn’t yet paid out on any of the guarantees.</p>
              <p>The Fed said Friday that it is delaying the start a $200
              billion program called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan
              Facility, or TALF, to revive the market for securities based on
              consumer loans such as credit-card, auto and student borrowings.</p>
              <p>Most of the spending programs are run out of the Federal
              Reserve Bank of New York, where Geithner served as president. He
              was sworn in as Treasury secretary on Jan. 26.</p>
              <p>When Congress approved the TARP on Oct. 3, Fed Chairman Ben
              S. Bernanke and then Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson
              acknowledged the need for transparency and oversight. The Federal
              Reserve so far is refusing to disclose loan recipients or reveal
              the collateral they are taking in return. Collateral is an asset
              pledged by a borrower in the event a loan payment isn’t made.</p>
              <p>Fed Sued</p>
              <p>Bloomberg requested details of Fed lending under the Freedom
              of Information Act and filed a federal lawsuit against the
              central bank Nov. 7 seeking to force disclosure of borrower banks
              and their collateral. Arguments in the suit may be heard as soon
              as this month, according to the court docket.      Bloomberg
              asked the Treasury in an FOIA request Jan. 28 for a detailed list
              of the securities it planned to guarantee for Citigroup and Bank
              of America. Bloomberg hasn’t received a response to the request.</p>
              <p>The Bloomberg lawsuit is Bloomberg LP v. Board of Governors
              of the Federal Reserve System, 08-CV-9595, U.S. District Court,
              Southern District of New York (Manhattan).</p>
