            <div class='col-md body'>The government will probably put in a policy to curb the growth. The messaging has been flowing out consistently; SM, MM... PM... etc<br><br>The market will not crash because it will reflect badly on PAP. They will curb it and slow it down. After all, the government and Temasek is the one who is making all the money during this price hike.<br><br>Question is, what will our multi-millionaires proposed? So far, they do not have any good ideas; even for the simplest problems.<br><br>Here's some thoughts;<br><br>1) Work with all the major property business to stop en-block fever. This would be simple since Temasek as a stake in most of them.<br><br>2) Change the rules to stop topping up of lease-hold property. That way, 99-years price will reduce drastically and the prices hike will slow down (HDB will start reflecting their actual value instead of the currently inflated values created by government policy). Second benefit is that property company can only buy from government; so government makes all the millions instead of the current owners.<br><br>3) Introduce new policies to tax heavily on en-block or HDB resale.. that will also curb HDB price hike.<br><br>4) Release more land; but I doubt this will be effective as most available land are not in prime areas except for those in District 15.<br><br></div>
