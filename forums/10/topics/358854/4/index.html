              <p>One
              of the witnesses is Edwin Lesmana Tjiong, who noted that Widjaja once
              told him that he found the final year project hard and troublesome.</p>
              <p>The
              court also heard he and Widjaja attended the same church located in the

              <p>The family of David Hartanto Widjaja, an Indonesian student who died at
              Singapore's Nanyang Technological University (NTU) on March 2, and a
              local verification team doubt the Singaporean court process of his
              death.</p>
              <p>The coroner court under the subordinate court in Singapore has been
              processing the case to decide whether David's death was a suicide. If
              it not, then the case will be forwarded to the criminal court.</p>
              <p>However, it appeared the court process was <span style="color: #ff0000;">intentionally directed to a
              conclusion </span>of suicide despite evidence showing a strong possibility of
              murder, according to David's family and the verification team.</p>
              <p>"We have <span style="color: #ff0000;">strong evidence that he was murdere</span>d but that fact was not
              brought up in the court," David's father, Hartono Wijaya, told a press
              conference Tuesday at the National Commission on Human Rights.</p>
              <p>"Testimonies from witnesses presented by the NTU were fictitious and none of our witnesses was brought to the court."</p>
              <p>Djaja Surya Atmadja, a forensic expert from the Faculty of Medicine in
              the University of Indonesia, said any forensic doctor could see from
              the forensic report that David's body had defense wounds, and that<span style="color: #ff0000;"> there were no wounds of suicide. </span></p>

              The electrical and electronic engineering (EEE) student would study only when exams were near.</p>
              <p>Instead of aiming to score well, he just wanted to pass.</p>
              <p>By the time he reached his final year, things had become so bad that
              he was scared of the supervisor of his Final Year Project (FYP),
              Associate Professor Chan Kap Luk, 45.</p>
              <p>So much so that he avoided the professor and would sneak away rather than face him because he had fallen behind in his FYP.</p>
              <p>His close friend, Mr Hardian Setiawan Winata, revealed this yesterday at the coroner's inquiry into Widjaja's death.</p>
              <p>The Indonesian fell four storeys to his death moments after he
              allegedly stabbed Prof Chan in his office at about 10.30am on 2 Mar.</p>
              <p>Mr Hardian, an Indonesian who is in the same course at NTU, told the
              court that he noticed that Widjaja began skipping his lessons and
              tutorials in August 2007.</p>
              <p>His grades worsened because he was spending a lot of time playing computer games in his hostel room.</p>
              <p>'He told me that he can play more than 10 hours a day,' said Mr Hardian.</p>
              <p>Then last August, Widjaja received an e-mail from the school regarding his poor grades.</p>
              <p>Said Mr Hardian: 'He showed (the warning letter) to me at the beginning of our final year.</p>
              <p>'David said it was okay. He said if his scholarship was terminated, his family can support him.'</p>
              <p>By then, Widjaja was close to finishing his course and would have to pay only for his last semester if he lost his scholarship.</p>
              <p><strong>Avoiding professor</strong></p>
              <p>Mr Hardian, who is from West Java, and Widjaja became close friends
              in May 2007 after they were in the same project group. Mr Hardian said
              Widjaja shared his problems with him while they were working on his FYP
              and Human Resource Management project (HRM).</p>
              <p>'He complained to me that the HRM project meetings took up a lot of time, disrupting his FYP,' he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Hardian also said that Widjaja started to struggle with his FYP
              and tried to avoid Prof Chan, who was pressing him for updates.</p>
              <p>'I could see David was scared of Prof Chan,' he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Hardian recounted an incident late last year when the two students wanted to go to a laboratory to work on their assignments.</p>
              <p>He said: 'But when David saw Prof Chan in the lab, he sneaked away.
              He avoided Prof Chan because he had no updates on his FYP. He was
              really busy (with his HRM project).'</p>
              <p>Still, Widjaja did not appear worried about his FYP. Hardian said
              this was because he had one year to work on it. It was not mentioned
              how much time he was given to work on his HRM project.</p>
              <p>The court also heard that Prof Chan would meet his FYP and
              post-graduate students every Wednesday evening, and the student would
              take turns to give updates on their projects.</p>
              <p>Widjaja told Mr Hardian that during one such meeting in the first
              semester last year, Prof Chan scolded him for failing to give an update
              on his FYP.</p>
              <p>Mr Hardian said that Widjaja played World of Warcraft and Defence of the Ancients.</p>
              <p>But last December, he noticed that his friend was hooked on another
              online game called Destiny Online. While playing this game, he got to
              know a girl whom he was interested in.</p>
              <p>'He told me he liked her. But he never showed me the girl's photograph even though I'd asked to see it,' said Mr Hardian.</p>
              <p>He added that Widjaja communicated with the girl online and over the phone, but he did not know if they had met in person.</p>
              <p>Two pathologists from the Health Science Authority also took the stand yesterday.</p>
              <p>Dr Marian Wang, who conducted the autopsy, told the court that Mr
              Widjaja had 36 external injuries, which included abrasions,
              lacerations, cuts and bruises on his hands, head, fingers, and legs.</p>
              <p>She said that there were 18 superficial cuts and one deep cut on the body.</p>
              <p>'They could be inflicted while David was involved in a struggle with another party to gain control of the knife,' said Dr Wang.</p>
              <p>She added that the other injuries sustained were consistent with those caused by a fall from height.</p>
              <p>'He died from multiple injuries and it's impossible to isolate the most serious injury,' she said.</p>
              <p>She was supervised by Dr Gilbert Lau, who was present during the autopsy.</p>
              <p>Criminal lawyer Shashi Nathan, who was hired by Widjaja's family to
              hold a watching brief, wanted to know if a faint bruise on his neck
              could have been caused by a punch or a karate chop.</p>
              <p>Dr Lau replied that he was 'rather intrigued' by the proposition. 'I
              have not been informed by the police of any martial artist involved (in
              the case),' he said.</p>
              <p>He then said that it was very unlikely, as a punch or karate chop
              would have caused more serious injuries, such as the rupture of the
              voice box instead of just a faint bruise.</p>
              <p>Widjaja's parents, his elder brother and uncle flew in from Jakarta on Tuesday and were in court yesterday.</p>
              <p>Also present were representatives from NTU, officials from the
              Indonesian Embassy here and the Indonesian media. The inquiry continues
              today with Prof Chan taking the stand.</p>
              <p><strong>ABOUT THE CASE</strong></p>
              <p>ON 2 Mar at about 10.30am, Indonesian student David Hartanto
              Widjaja, 21, fell four storeys to his death at the Nanyang
              Technological University.</p>
              <p>The incident happened moments after he allegedly stabbed his final
              year project supervisor, Associate Professor Chan Kap Luk, 45.</p>

              You know Widjaja could afford to pay the tuition fee. He's in his final year already how much left does he have to pay.
              
              Commiting suicide over scholarship termination in the final year doesn't make sense at all. I know some people would like the general population to believe that the scholarship termination depressed Widjaja into committing suicide.
              
              Disinformation as this argument is not of sound logic.

              <p>the issue here is a complicated one, a mix of crime, politics, education and social responsibility all jumbled up in one case.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Crime: still not solved, witnesses are one sided, no neutral witness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Politics: Singapore govt is sensitive to Indonesia politics, they need to continue good relationship, on the other hand, indonesia are looking for loophole to get Singapore. And this case may provide a chance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Education: The project or the so call education of Singapore and the University reputation is at stake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Social: Foreigner issue getting singaporean court to foot the bills, are Singaporean taxpayer going to be happy. Our local findings and conclusion against indonesia findings and conclusion can be a diseaster for both country.</p>

              <p>The Jakarta Post, 20 Jun 2009<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Photos prove student did not commit suicide: Forensics expert</strong></span><br> <br> A forensics expert insists that recently revealed photographs of the
              body of David Hartanto Widjaja, an Indonesian student who died at
              Singapore's Nanyang Technological University (NTU) on March 2, prove he
              died defending himself against knife attacks.<br> <br> Djaja Surya Atmadja, a noted forensic expert from the University of
              Indonesia who had seen the photographs, said Friday that all wounds on
              the body emphasized the fact David had not committed suicide as
              reported.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The photographs, which The Jakarta Post also obtained, show several defense wounds that have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never been revealed in or out of the Singaporean court</span>, Djaja says.</strong></span><br> <br> "I can assume, based on the photographs, David was attacked by one or
              two people with a knife," he told the Post in a telephone conversation.<br> <br> Early reports in the Singaporean media had accused David of stabbing
              his professor at NTU, Chan Kap Luk, before slitting his wrists and
              jumping to his death.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>One of several defense wounds found on the body is
              a deep diagonal 20-centimeter-long cut on the right hand near the
              wrist, Djaja said after observing the photographs.<br> <br> A diagonal cut, he said, showed David was more likely to have been warding off a knife attack against him.</strong></span> <br> <br> "If David wanted to commit suicide, he would not have cut his hand that
              way *diagonally*, but with a flat cut along his wrist," Djaja said.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The pictures also showed David's right leg had
              been twisted, which Djaja believes was caused by somebody, or was
              sustained because the leg had been stuck before David fell.</strong></span><br> <br> "I'm sure the twisted leg was not caused by the fall," Djaja said.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The photographs also showed David's right palm was covered in small flat wounds.<br> <br> Such wounds could have been caused by David clenching the knife in a defensive position, Djaja said.</strong></span> <br> <br> Djaja said he would attend the next hearing at the Singaporean
              coroner's court on June 24 and 25, to explain the forensic facts, based
              on photographs, that wounds on David's body were defense injuries.<br> <br> Meanwhile, the lawyer for David's family, Otto Cornelius Kaligis told
              the Post he would undertake whatever measures were necessary to prove

              <p>The Jakarta Post, 20 Jun 2009<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Photos prove student did
              not commit suicide: Forensics expert</strong></span><br> <br> A forensics expert insists that recently revealed photographs of
              the body of David Hartanto Widjaja, an Indonesian student who died
              at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University (NTU) on March 2,
              prove he died defending himself against knife attacks.<br> <br> Djaja Surya Atmadja, a noted forensic expert from the University of
              Indonesia who had seen the photographs, said Friday that all wounds
              on the body emphasized the fact David had not committed suicide as
              reported.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The photographs, which The
              Jakarta Post also obtained, show several defense wounds that have
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never been revealed in or
              out of the Singaporean court</span>, Djaja
              says.</strong></span><br> <br> "I can assume, based on the photographs, David was attacked by one
              or two people with a knife," he told the Post in a telephone
              conversation.<br> <br> Early reports in the Singaporean media had accused David of
              stabbing his professor at NTU, Chan Kap Luk, before slitting his
              wrists and jumping to his death.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>One of several defense wounds
              found on the body is a deep diagonal 20-centimeter-long cut on the
              right hand near the wrist, Djaja said after observing the
              photographs.<br> <br> A diagonal cut, he said, showed David was more likely to have been
              warding off a knife attack against him.</strong></span><br> <br> "If David wanted to commit suicide, he would not have cut his hand
              that way *diagonally*, but with a flat cut along his wrist," Djaja
              said.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The pictures also showed David's
              right leg had been twisted, which Djaja believes was caused by
              somebody, or was sustained because the leg had been stuck before
              David fell.</strong></span><br> <br> "I'm sure the twisted leg was not caused by the fall," Djaja
              said.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The photographs also showed
              David's right palm was covered in small flat wounds.<br> <br> Such wounds could have been caused by David clenching the knife in
              a defensive position, Djaja said.</strong></span><br> <br> Djaja said he would attend the next hearing at the Singaporean
              coroner's court on June 24 and 25, to explain the forensic facts,
              based on photographs, that wounds on David's body were defense
              injuries.<br> <br> Meanwhile, the lawyer for David's family, Otto Cornelius Kaligis
              told the Post he would undertake whatever measures were necessary
              to prove David was not guilty and that he had been attacked.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>"I have found many irregularities
              in the legal processing of David's case in
              Singapore,"</strong></span> Kaligis said, adding that <span style="color: red;"><strong>he suspected the Singaporean officials had
              been covering up many significant facts.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>David's father, Hartono Widjaja,
              said his family had tried to present nine of David's NTU fellow
              students as witnesses to the court, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but only one was approved by court

              <p>my theory is that mas selamat smuggle himself into singapore to murder David Hartanto and escape out of singapore again.</p>
              <p>the police/ gahmen/ some guy who cant sing is too embarrassed to reveal the truth so they stabbed the ntu prof and claim David Hartanto commit suicide</p>
              <p>of course, if the gahmen admit mas selamat can anyhow enter singapore to murder people, it would cause a panic so its all for the best</p>

              In my opinion David was clearly murdered. The fact that the Singapore authority try to deny this and it's been so weakly convincing is a clue that a power play is at hand.
              <br><br>
              The people in power in Singapore is getting bolder and more unashamed.

              <p>1.Have they received 3 letters fr NTU concerning the poor results of David?</p>
              <p>The family said they had not been informed that scholarship renewed.</p>
              <p>2.If they could not see the body,why did they authorize NTU to</p>
              <p>cremate the body?They should bring the body back.</p>
              <p>Now,they said the were pressuised by NTU to cremate the body in SG.</p>
              <p>I think it is not fair to NTU.</p>
              <p>3.NTU and Spore are also treated by this family unfairly.</p>

              <div>NTU need to feed back the concerns of many students,staff and their families,</div>

              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Internet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="color: #0066cc;">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>

              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>
              <blockquote>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Note the bad acting, where he pretended to be "excited" and "surprised" about what he wrote himself.</span></p>
              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny, frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked. Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>

              <p>You know Widjaja could afford to pay the tuition fee. He’s in
              his final year already how much left does he have to pay.</p>
              <p>Commiting suicide over scholarship termination in the final year
              doesn’t make sense at all. I know some people would like the
              general population to believe that the scholarship termination
              depressed Widjaja into committing suicide.</p>
              <p>Disinformation as this argument is not of sound logic.</p>
