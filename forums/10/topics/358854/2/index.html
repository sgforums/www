              <p>David’s body should have never been cremated in the first

              <p>David’s body forensic would yield a treasure of proofs that
              might help the family in their legal battle.</p>
              <p>The hurried of David cremation itself is a proof that somebody
              is trying to hide something imo.</p>

              Hello PothePanda I will be reading your blog from time to time.
              It's a shame and a cowardice act that the ruling people would make use of the police to intimidate its own people.<br><br>
              
              Stay strong. You're welcome to PM me if you have any need of my help however I'm no Singaporean and not residing in Singapore.

              <p>This topic becomes pointless by the minute. Have you guys heard about the term 'CONSPIRACY'. The guys who go on using conspiracies to make a point = CONSPIRACY THEORIST. Now, ladies and gentlemen, what is the point of a CONSPIRACY and a CONSPIRACY THEORIST?</p>
              <p>Humans have always accepted thrills. By just the father of the David saying "he was murdered", all this funny funny stories come up. And people choose to believe these stories because it facinates. Let me ask you something. What does the government gain by covering up the story? Whatever that is being mentioned in here is very much baseless accusations.</p>
              <p>Now I can understand the human nature of grieving. Five years ago, I had a friend that died of a car accident. His parents wanted to sue the driver because they claim "the driver wasn't alert". They claim that that was the cause of their son's death. But my brother was there to witness the accident. My friend actually dashed across the road. I'm sure his parents knew he dashed, but they choose to blame the driver. They lost the case in court. As much as I don't like to see how the parents turned out after the accident, I couldn't say anything because they had the WILL to go all out until court. Ladies and gentlemen, THIS is the power of WILL. It is these WILL that drives us to prove our point of what actually happened, thus fabricating stories.</p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong. I'm a person driven by facts, and what can be proven. If it is indeed true that he was murdered, then God help his parents.</p>
              <p>Now to Miracles&amp;Prophecies, by just looking at your posts, I can tell that you are one really desperate person that just hates anything with the words Singapore, MM Lee and [basically anything Singapore] in it. I like how you take a REALLY BIASED approach to this case. I would love to see what you post next. You mentioned  that "Singapore is run by JERKS and BASTARDS". In a case proper, you would have lost everything if you don't chose to see it to a point of neutrality. And before that you mentioned "My theory is david didn’t commit suicide he was murdered. apparently by coward(s)". Now, I would like to see some theory to that, because as it seems, it's just your f***ing point of view.</p>
              <p>To help you with that. A theory can start from an allegation or your point of view. But if there's no evidence to support whatsoever, then the allegation will remain an allegation. It will never make it as something that can be accepted.</p>

              <p>You must be new to sgforums.  There are people here who are so eager to discredit the government that they will resort to all means to do so (including lies, half-truths and unsubstantiated accusations).  And they ended up compromising their own objectivity and credibility.</p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong.  I am not pro-PAP. Neither am I anti-PAP.  I am just trying to be as objective as possible (which admittedly is not always easy).  While I am against certain government policies (such as paying of high salary to politicians, lack of press freedom, etc), I give credits when credits are due (such as developing Singapore economically, providing good public transportation and a good education system).</p>

              <p>You're so right man. I'm not saying that I'm PAP's lapdog. Neither am I saying that they suck to the core. But what I'm saying is exactly what you're saying.</p>
              <p>"I give credits when credits are due."</p>
              <p>This is especially true. The fact that I can get up and jog in the early morning without the fear of being mugged shows how safe I am here. This is one of a few countries where even the poorest can escape poverty, just by the means of education. It would not be fair to just criticise the success of the PAP so directly.</p>
