              <h1><strong>Protesters to stage rally outside Singapore Embassy</strong></h1>
              <p><br><br>Jakarta (ANTARA) - A group of protesters calling themselves a team for the care of the David Hartanto Widjaja case, will stage a rally in front of the Singapore Embassy here on Tuesday.<br><br>Jakarta Metropolitan Police Traffic Management Center (TMC) said the protest rally would be staged from 11 a.m to 1 p.m.<br><br>As reported earlier that David, an Indonesian student at the Nanyang Technology University (NTU) in Singapore, was found dead after allegedly committing suicide by jumping from a balcony of a campus building.<br><br>According to media report, the university claimed that David was in a meeting at the office of his mentor, Prof Chan Kap Luk, when he ran amuck and stabbed the professor in the back, then left the office while stabbing himself repeatedly before jumping off the balcony.<br><br>But David`s parents insisted their son was murdered, saying he would never commit suicide and claiming they had evidence to prove it.<br><br>The family and an independent verification team filed the case with the coroner`s court last week and gathered their own witnesses to support their case at the coroner`s inquest in Singapore from May 20-26, 2009.<br><br>It was reported that about 16 witnesses have been lined up to testify at the inquiry into the death of the 21-year-old Indonesian undergraduate student.<br><br>Besides the protest rally outside Singapore Embassy, other groups of protesters will also stage rallies in front of Parliament building on Gatot Subroto street in South Jakarta, in front of Presidential Palace, and the Home Affairs Ministry office on Merdeka Utara street in Central Jakarta.<br><br>The protest rallies on Tuesday may cause heavy traffic jams along the main roads in the capital city and motorists are therefore called on to take alternative roads.  (*)</p>

              Actually the strongest proof in this case is already gone.
                                                  
              David's body should have never been cremated in the first place.
                                                  
              David's body forensic would yield a treasure of proofs that might  help the family in their legal battle.
                                                
              The hurried of David cremation itself is a proof that somebody is trying to hide something imo.

              Typical defamation, Singapore style. Easiest way is to label somebody went nuts so that he lost all credibility. If you think David was depressed why would he be depressed. He was in his final year already when his scholarship was revoked and his family could afford to pay the tuition fee.This is only to tarnish David's name and obstruct justice. According to national news here there's a lot that NTU and the authorities in Singapore have to answer in regard to David death.
                                                                    <br><br>
              NTU has been proven to have lied or released an incorrect statement that David cut his own wrist which autopsy proved he never did. This alone is one reason too many to suspect.
                                                   <br><br>
              Also there were multiple slash wounds on David one of which was on his neck which the police claimed due to his fall or impact but this is very unlikely as his teeth were complete 
                                                   <br><br>
              Also why would David went to lower floor before jumping instead of going up or jumping from the floor which his Prof offices was located on.<br><br><br><br>

              That's the job that Singapore police are obviously reluctant to investigate and happy to cover up. It's obvious that the authority is trying to cover something.
                                                                    
              From psychotic offended government official to a greedy professor who might be a member of the ruling party.
              <br><br>
              After all Singapore is not a clean country with a thoroughly corrupt system based on dictatorship instead of rule of law like other more civic nations.

              <p>he was flung off by the illuminati who in his investigations implicated the professor? the supposed slash marks on his wrists were actually stigmata signs? the UFOs were in league with the illuminati who helped put a cloaking spell on the knights templar who were the hired help of the illuminati so that they can drag hartanto across the campus and then fling him off the building?</p>

              somebody went nuts so that he lost all credibility. If you think
              David was depressed why would he be depressed. He was in his final
              year already when his scholarship was revoked and his family could
              afford to pay the tuition fee.This is only to tarnish David's name
              and obstruct justice. According to national news here there's a lot
              that NTU and the authorities in Singapore have to answer in regard
              to David death.<br> <br> NTU has been proven to have lied or released an incorrect statement
              that David cut his own wrist which autopsy proved he never did.
              This alone is one reason too many to suspect.<br> <br> Also there were multiple slash wounds on David one of which was on
              his neck which the police claimed due to his fall or impact but
              this is very unlikely as his teeth were complete<br> <br> Also why would David went to lower floor before jumping instead of
              going up or jumping from the floor which his Prof offices was
              located on.<br> <br> <br> <br> Gary: He said to me at the lift lobby 90% of the exact words - ”Mr

              <p>Actually the strongest proof in this case is already gone.</p>

              <p>David’s body forensic would yield a treasure of proofs that
