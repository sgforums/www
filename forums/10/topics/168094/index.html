            <div class='col-md body'>Government has the power to change perspective of any problems to make what are basically wrong look right and what is basically right look wrong.<br><br>Why is this the case ? Because perception of problems are different from different angles.<br><br>From one point of view, Durai can look right - he is doing a great job in fund raising.<br><br>Looked at from another angle, people are being short-changed. Our government has denied medical and other help to the people because of its fundamental policy to avoid welfarism.<br><br>It charges all fees at the fullest to recover costs and sometimes as in the case of selling HDB flats to make exceptional profits by way of creative accounting.<br><br>So what is wrong with charging fees at market values? Taxes paid by citizens become surpluses and surpluses are used for overseas investments which do not create jobs for its own citizens. There is nothing to stop the government from using the surpluses for its own purpose like using it as goodies before election to win votes.<br><br>Because the government cannot change its past policy of taxing and recovering full costs or market prices, it cannot afford to admit mistake in NKF case. The lower rung people are just their own trusted lietenants who will finally do an about-turn of the NKF finding to look it look like the NKF reserve of 3 years or 7 years was not wrong.<br><br>But how does the government come to the 7 years' figure. Very simple, by taking the development costs and business infrastruture costs incurred by NKF in the past into the equation. If NKF uses patient treatment costs as measurements of its needs, why should they need more monies and more reserve?<br><br>So it is a matter of creative accounting again that is the devil. This habit of using creative accounting to solve problems is the real problem.<br><br>The Singapore national reserve if properly worked on people's needs for jobs and medical cares and other necessities should have been more than enough if there is no creative accounting to include all the infrastructural extravagants. Just use the $150 billions as endowments to generate certain portions to sustain basic needs of people in medical and jobless reliefs or tie-over, why should we continue to build more and more reserve.</div>
