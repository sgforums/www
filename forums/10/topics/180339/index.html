            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore regrets Taiwan's move on unification council, guidelines: FM<br><br>A spokesman from Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed regret at Taiwan's move on the "National Unification Council (NUC)" and the "National Unification Guidelines" in a statement Monday.<br><br>"It will raise concerns about Taiwan's intentions and it is not conducive to the maintenance of stable cross-strait relations," the spokesman said in response to media queries.<br><br>He reiterated that Singapore has a one-China policy and is opposed to any unilateral move to change the status quo across the Taiwan Straits.<br><br>Taiwan authority leader Chen Shui-bian announced in Taipei Monday afternoon a decision to stop the operation of the "National Unification Council" and application of the "National Unification Guidelines".<br><br>The action was strongly opposed and criticized by both senior officials in the Chinese mainland and Taiwan's major parties, including Chinese Kuomintang, the People First Party and Non-Partisan Solidarity Union.<br><br>On May 20, 2000, Chen promised not to declare "Taiwan Independence," not to incorporate the "two states" idea into the "constitution," not to change the so-called "country's name," not to hold a "referendum" on "Taiwan Independence," and not to abolish the "NUC" and the "National Unification Guidelines."<br><br>The "NUC" was established in 1990 by the Taiwan authorities headed by Lee Teng-hui, and fourteen meetings had been held since its establishment. However, no "NUC" meeting has been held since Chen Shui-bian became Taiwan leader.<br><br>The "National Unification Guidelines" were issued in 1991, saying both the mainland and Taiwan are under the sovereignty of China and promoting the country's reunification should be the common task of all Chinese. The guidelines also outlined a three-phase goal for the realization of China's reunification.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. I think its mainly a political move to win support from the pro-independence electorate, and also partially because of his pro-independence ideals.<br><br>I think Chen is making a grave mistake when he thinks China will not attack before the 2008 Olympics. Looking back in history, the former Soviet Union <strong>did</strong> attack Afganistan in support of its local communist party in 1979, despite preparing for the 1980 Moscow Olympics. I remember that year US and many of its allies boycotted the Olympics. Furthermore, whether China's leaders like it or not, they will go to war if Taiwan declares independence because they are bound by their own anti-succession law passed in Beijing last year.<br><br>No doubt China will suffer economically if it goes into war, but it does <strong>not </strong> mean that China cannot finance a war. I mean, while preparing for Olympics, China still has money to invest in its manned space programme.<br><br>I think the ultimate sufferer of all these is Singapore. Political-economic ties with these 3 countries, China, Taiwan and US is very important to us. If conflict eventually breaks out in Taiwan strait, which side can Singapore go? if it sides with US and Taiwan then we lose our economic ties with China's market. If we side with China then our military and economic ties with Taiwan and US also screw up. If we stay neutral than US will no longer regard us as ally, FTA and all economic treaties all kick away. hmm.. big dilemma.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>However, I also think that Chen moves may not be of much substance lah. The opposition KMT has much influence in legislative body, they will block any move for independence, like how they block the purchase of weapons from US...<br><br>I think Taiwan current situation is the best: status quo. Just let it be. Now the Taiwanese economy is doing quite well and the people led relatively comfortable and stable lives. Why mess things up? Chen zis big troublemaker!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) leader Ma Ying-jeou will make a move to recall President Chen Shui-bian, Ma's spokeswoman said yesterday, following Chen's announcement that a council for charting unification with the mainland will be scrapped.<br>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said Ma made this decision during a high ranking summit held by his party to discuss Chen's latest move.<br><br>Chen's eliminating of the National Unification Council (NUC) and its guidelines for national unification is likely to trigger new tensions in the Taiwan Strait, angering Beijing and worrying Washington.<br><br>"KMT chairman Ma Ying-jeou thinks President Chen has not only set a time table for extreme independence ... but has also taken concrete actions," Cheng told reporters.<br><br>"(Ma thinks) this seriously damages the status quo and is a threat to the national interest," she said.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Abolishing the NUC arguably violates one of five promises Chen made in his first inaugural speech, known as his "five noes" policy.</span> The "five noes" policy includes a promise not to scrap the NUC provided China does not use military force.<br><br>Chen's aides have argued that China's escalating military build-up is a show of force destroying the premise of his original promise.<br><br>Cheng said the KMT thought otherwise.<br><br>"The 'five noes policy' is the most important foundation for maintaining the status quo," she said.<br><br><span style="color: red;">"Terminating the national unification guidelines puts the other 'four noes' promises on the brink of collapse</span>," she said.<br><br>Besides a promise not to scrap the NUC and its guidelines, the "five noes" policy also includes promises such as not changing the island's official name to "Taiwan," a move that would provoke Beijing to invade the island.<br><br>Beijing has threatened to invade Taiwan if it moves towards de jure independence. The U.S., Taiwan's largest ally, is legally bound to come to the island's rescue in the event of an unprovoked attack.<br><br>Cheng said U.S. promises to protect Taiwan from an unprovoked attack from China were not a "blank check." <span style="color: red;">Washington had said many times that Taiwan could not provoke changes to the status quo, she said.<br><br>"President Chen and his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government must shoulder the full blame for.. these serious irresponsible actions," she said.<br><br>"President Chen... goes against the mainstream of public opinion," she said.</span><br><br>Cheng also accused Chen of stirring up antagonistic feelings between independence supporters and supporters of unification by making his announcement on the eve of an anniversary marking a 1947 massacre of local Taiwanese by mainland troops.<br><br>"(Chen's) move will make the international community think we are trouble makers and we will not gain its sympathy," Cheng said.<br><br>"Taiwan will face even more boycotts as a result," she said.<br><br>She said the KMT had made preparations to recall Chen and had already negotiated the issue with other opposition parties.<br><br>Ma, who is also the popular mayor of Taipei, is widely viewed to be the opposition's likely contender for presidential elections in two years time.<br><br>Cheng accused Chen of ignoring important social problems such as suicide, unemployment and corruption.<br><br>Ma also earlier told reporters Chen had misplaced priorities in stoking such a controversial issue when the nation faced many economic problems.<br><br>"The president has the wrong priority in setting his political agenda," Ma said.<br><br>"The public hopes that the president will refocus on what he should do.<br><br>"If he insists on going down the controversial path, history will record it," Ma said.<br><br><span style="color: red;">The NUC, set up by the former KMT administration in 1990, sets the stage for eventual unification with China. After taking office in 2000, Chen sidelined the NUC and did not convene any NUC meetings.<br><br>All three opposition parties -- which together hold a majority in the legislature -- are opposed to Chen's move to scrap the government body.<br><br>In a news conference in the legislature before Chen made the announcement, the KMT, People First Party (PFP) and Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) whips said they could take drastic steps -- such as boycotting the legislature, calling for a referendum on whether to abolish the guidelines, organizing national protests and pushing for a recall of the president.<br><br>KMT lawmaker Tseng Yung-chuan, the director of the KMT Policy Coordination Committee, said Premier Su Tseng-chang needed to brief the legislature on his administration's major policies, including scrapping the NUC.<br><br>"The premier should be accountable to the legislature," Tseng said.<br><br>PFP whip Lee Hung-chun said he thought Su, who is viewed to be a likely DPP presidential contender in the 2008 election, was trying to keep away from the controversy.<br><br>"Su needs to take responsibility for government decisions," Lee said.<br><br>The NPSU also condemned Chen scrapping the NUC.<br><br>"The president is plunging the country and its people into danger by doing away with the guidelines, angering Beijing for his personal political purposes," said NPSU law maker Kao Chin Su-mei.<br><br>Recalling the president involves strict legal procedures and requires the approval of over two thirds of the legislature.<br><br>KMT officials said even an unsuccessful recall could tarnish Chen's reputation. The move would make Chen Taiwan's first president to be targeted by a recall motion.</span></div>

Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao (ÂŒÃ“Â‹Ã‘ÂŸÂ·) in Washington in April will be a focus of attention.<br><br>Although Chen's decision has thrown new uncertainty into cross-strait relations, the KMT will follow an agreement reached between former KMT chairman Lien Chan (Â˜AÂ�D) and Hu when Lien visited China in April last year to continue to promote cross-strait peace and prosperity, Ma said.<br><br>Ma also said that he has no plans to visit China in the near future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">U.S. officials are becoming increasingly uneasy about the behavior of Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian</span>. A cause for concern was his February 28 decision to shut down the National Unification Council and announce that the unification guidelines Taipei adopted in 1990 would "cease to apply." Chen had telegraphed that step during a speech a month earlier marking the Lunar New Year. In that speech he also outlined two other major tasks for his government in the year ahead-finalizing a new constitution ahead of a national referendum in 2007, and applying to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan (rather than the island's official name, the Republic of China).<br><br>All of those positions were certain to infuriate Beijing. One newspaper with close ties to the Chinese leadership described Chen's speech as "a bombshell," and PRC officials soon branded the Taiwanese leader as a "troublemaker" who was raising cross-straits tensions to dangerous levels.<br><br>Beijing reiterated its long-standing warning that it would never tolerate the triumph of separatist policies on Taiwan, even if preventing that triumph required using military force. China's reaction to Chen's apparent scrapping of the NUC was equally uncompromising, as PRC President Hu Jintao warned that the Taiwan leader risked "disaster" with such conduct.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Washington has also reacted negatively to Chen's behavior</span>. U.S. officials had already been surprised and alarmed by his address to the nation on January 1, which had seemingly gone out of its way to challenge Beijing. Now, Chen was escalating tensions again.<br><br><span style="color: red;">The U.S. State Department responded to Chen's Lunar New Year's speech with an unusually blunt statement. It stressed that Washington "does not support Taiwan's independence</span> and opposes unilateral changes to the status quo by Taiwan."<br><br>Making certain that Taipei got the message, Department spokesman Adam Ereli emphasized that the statement was being made "in the wake of some comments by President Chen" that might be "inflammatory and send the wrong signal." <span style="color: red;">The extent of Washington's irritation with its Taiwanese client was evident when Ereli added that U.S. policymakers "certainly weren't expecting" the speech and "weren't consulted about it."</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have been visiting a no. of US forums and brought up the Taiwan issue. The bad news is I feel many Americans support Taiwanese independence.<br><br>According to some of their forum replies, their beliefs are: China will never invade Taiwan as long as US defends it because US navy is far superior to China. Taiwan is never part of China because the mainland PRC govt never held control over Taiwan. Attacking Taiwan is like the land grab by Iraq over Kuwait and US have to intervene for the sake of "freedom". Taiwan have the right to declare independence just like US did from the Britain in 1776. Some even compared Taiwan-China to Israel-Palestine issue.<br><br>I think the US govt supports the one-China principle because it wants to maintain good relations with China as a political partner in internation affairs and break into its market for economic gain. In terms of ideals, I am sure many Americans would love to the see the free Taiwanese rising against the Communist tyrants, esp Bush. Maybe he will start another Operation Taiwanese freedom.</div>
