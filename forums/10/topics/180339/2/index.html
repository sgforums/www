Taiwan have the right to declare independence just like US did from the Britain in 1776. Some even compared Taiwan-China to Israel-Palestine issue.<br><br>I think the US govt supports the one-China principle because it wants to maintain good relations with China as a political partner in internation affairs and break into its market for economic gain. In terms of ideals, I am sure many Americans would love to the see the free Taiwanese rising against the Communist tyrants, esp Bush.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">A recent statement by a U.S. official requesting Taiwan to "unambiguously affirm" it "did not abolish" the National Unification Council has revealed an "underlying level of U.S. frustration" in its dealings with Taiwan over the NUC</span> episode, an American expert in cross-Taiwan Strait issues said Friday.<br>Alan Romberg, director of East Asian Studies at the Henry L. Stimson Center, said that some in Taiwan are too carried away with what they consider a "victory" - President Chen Shui-bian's move to "cease the function" of the NUC - at the risk of damaging an understanding between Washington and Taipei.<br><br>"When the U.S. negotiated the language used in President Chen's seven-point statement, it obviously felt that, whatever the nuances of the Chinese-language version, the ambiguity of the English permitted the interpretation that the NUC and Guidelines had not been abolished," Romberg said.<br><br>"Since then, however, some people in Taipei have trumpeted their 'victory' too loudly, even to the point of seeming to equate 'cease to function' and 'abolish.'... the impression among many in Washington is that there has been a breach of faith and that Taipei's claim of 'maintaining the status quo' rings hollow," he added.<br><br>Chen announced on February 27 that the NUC would "cease to function" and the National Unification Guidelines would "cease to apply," a move which he promised "does not involve changing the status quo." The announcement came nearly one month after Chen proposed that the country should seriously consider "abolishing" the council and guidelines.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Not to "abolish" the NUC and its guidelines - symbolic of Taiwan's ultimate objective of unifying with China - was one of the "five noes" promises that Chen made in his inaugural addresses</span> of 2000 and 2004, under the prerequisite that "China has no intention of using force against Taiwan."<br><br>On Thursday, <span style="color: red;">U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Adam Ereli issued a rare statement in written form saying, "we expect the Taiwan authorities publicly to correct the record and unambiguously affirm that the February 27 announcement did not abolish the National Unification Council</span>, did not change the status quo, and that the assurances remain in effect."<br><br>Ereli also said that "abrogating an assurance would be changing the status quo" and that "we believe the maintenance of Taiwan's assurances is critical to preservation of the status quo."<br><br>According to Romberg, the United States had sought to avoid such a direct statement, but the way the issue has been handled has brought the situation to the point where <span style="color: red;">Washington now seeks an explicit reaffirmation</span> of earlier assurances.<br><br>"Now it's hard to hide the fact that, clever use of English aside, abolishing the council and guidelines is precisely what was intended and what Taipei thinks it has, in fact, done," Romberg said.<br><br>"Any further statements from Taipei on this or other cross-strait issues will be very closely scrutinized," he said.</div>
