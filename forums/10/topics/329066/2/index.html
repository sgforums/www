              <p>It is also a sad truth that there are many Singaporeans out there who are deluded and think the PAP is doing great things for the country. In fact, many of these are middle-income educated people who are having a good life in Singapore. Unfortunately these people who can't see or don't care about the difficulties the lowest 20-30% of the population are experiencing. They are brainwashed by the PAP into thinking no one owes them a living, that these people are poor because of laziness. Probably they are too kiasi to risk their career, income, HDB flat/condo/house, and every other wealth for justice, equality, and human rights.</p>

              <p><br>The greatest feat the PAP has pulled is their brilliant social engineering.   They've built a nation of people with very little, but enough to risk losing.</p>
              <p>A lot of these middle-income people you mentioned are not really living comfortably, they can lose everything they have with one mistake made.</p>
              <p>We're all a lot like a small frog hiding behind a rock in a storm.   It provides just a little protection if the frog carefully positions itself so the frog is afraid to hop out from behind the rock not knowing that there's a huge cave to hide in just 5 meters away.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans vote PAP because they are under influence of PAP regime state propaganda.</p>
              <p>This propaganda is bombarded to the voters daily.</p>
              <p>So once they are under influence of PAP propaganda, they will vote for PAP.</p>
              <p>The sad thing is that many are not aware they are under influence of PAP propaganda.</p>
              <p>They do not understand they are fed one sided and biased shit on TV, Print and Radio.</p>

              <p>We can describe these people as depoliticised people.</p>
              <p>That is the goal of PAP propaganda.</p>

              <p>For example above point of view.</p>
              <p>From where did this type of thinking come from?</p>
              <p>From PAP regime state propaganda media.</p>
              <p>State media sing praises of PAP regime and protrays opposition as fools or morons, so the view is formed that voting for PAP is better.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew also likes to sell this propaganda to the public.</p>
              <p>He likes to repeat the view that Singapore would collapse once opposition takes over.</p>
              <p>He keep on repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat.</p>
              <p>He wants to drill in the propaganda into public's head.</p>
              <p>So, this is how PAP regime state propaganda media wants to influence public to vote for them.</p>
              <p>Of course once a person is politicised, this type of propaganda will have no effect whatsoever on opinion.</p>
              <p>We know that is just horseshit by PAP regime.</p>
              <p>But the trouble is that state media is also designed to depoliticise people.</p>

              <p>Thailand is different, the opposition can oust a billionaire PM by buying votes and riot, each rioter are being paid, most are umemployed and need money, are our oppositions going to pay us to riot?? and base on what ground we are going to riot?? why not just peacefully sit in our aircon room, drink coffee or latte or my favorite ice blend and surf sgforums??
