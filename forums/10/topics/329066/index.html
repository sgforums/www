              <p><br>Yes and no.   Yes, because people vote for them elections after elections.   No, as pay and pay has made it so impossible to be out because of GRCs.   Remember the election dept is under the son, lee hsien loong, PM's office.   </p>

              <p>I am not saying that they will do something to the vote though I don't "discount:" the possibility.     We don't have enough oppositions to form GRCs to contest against them.   Want a fair game, PAP should do away with GRC and just have single wards for election.    Imagine the GRC is ridiculous,  for eg the TG pagar GRC, is so big - River Valley, Pek Kio, part of Balestier are under them. </p>

              <p>Gotta think if the constituency one is in is a walkover, how to vote them out?    Other than voting them out, the other thing we can do is to expose them to as many as possible.   Many, especially some women are still ignorant of the nuisance Pay and Pay are creating.   </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>It is also a sad truth that there are many Singaporeans out there who are deluded and think the PAP is doing great things for the country. In fact, many of these are middle-income educated people who are having a good life in Singapore. Unfortunately these people who can't see or don't care about the difficulties the lowest 20-30% of the population are experiencing. They are brainwashed by the PAP into thinking no one owes them a living, that these people are poor because of laziness. Probably they are too kiasi to risk their career, income, HDB flat/condo/house, and every other wealth for justice, equality, and human rights.</p></div>
