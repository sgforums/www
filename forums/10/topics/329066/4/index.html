              <p>in SAF, who dares to defy orders? its their rice bowl, if not

              <p>if many people in Singapore still dare not demonstrate here,
              dont expect SAF men to defy orders. And yes, we have no guts to
              take the risk to get ourselves in trouble.</p>
              <p>I really salute CSJ for trying so hard to let people notice his
              hard work. I've come to realise that sometimes all talk doesnt
              work. CSJ is a man with guts, and mind you he is intelligent too,
              just that the papers always make him sound and look stupid. If he
              is really stupid, why is the police always tracking him whereever
              he goes? He must be a big threat right?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You make it sound like SAF personnel are cowards.They are the boys with guns and weapons.. if anything.. the leadership should be afraid of them.. not commoners who can only fight with sticks and stones. And why wouldn't SAF defy orders ? If the leaders order them to rape their own mothers.. will they defy the command ? Please.. SAF are also intelligent people.. they are not robots with no brains.</p>
              <p>Have you wondered why there are still so many gurkhas contingents in Singapore ? And they are not cheap.</p>
              <p>Yes, I agree.. CSJ is very gutsy.. and he speaks the minds of many Singaporeans. Because of his guts the current leadership are scared of him.. If not LKY will not make him a bankrupt..a bankrupt cannot run for election.</p>
              <p>Removal of bankruptcy can be easily done at the top level...But LHL have no guts to face off with CSJ.</p>
              <p>If CSJ truly gets defeated via the vote of the people.. I'm sure he will accept the defeat graciously.</p>
              <p>Will LHL dare take up the challenge to a fair duel..? I doubt it.</p>

              <p>Court transcript :</p>
              <p>CSJ: Mr Lee, we get to meet at last.<br><br>LKY: (pause)...Sorry?<br><br>CSJ: We get to meet at last.<br><br>LKY: I thought we've met many other times across election rallies.<br><br>CSJ:
              Your memory fails you. I've never met you before and you know why?
              Because you keep avoiding me. (Mr Lee laughs) Well, we have this
              opportunity right now. Let me ask you this question. You gave an
              interview saying: "If you defame us, and if I'm involved, I go to the
              the witness box and you can question me not only on the particular
              defamation issue, but on all issues in my life." Do you stand by your
              words?<br><br>LKY: I do.<br><br>CSJ: Good. In the course of the
              cross-examination, will you then answer questions not just on this
              particular defamation issue, but on all issues in your life -- and I
              don't mean your personal life, I mean your political life? Will you
              stand by that?<br><br>LKY: Your Honour, we appeared in court when the
              issue was whether or not the summary judgment was proper. That was the
              time to challenge --<br><br>CSJ: Mr Lee, that was not my question.<br><br>Judge: Allow the witness to answer. Mr Lee, please go on.<br><br>LKY:
              I have to answer. I'm a lawyer. I no longer practice the law. I know
              your purpose. You dodged that occasion and you're trying -- Dr Chee is
              trying today when the issue is the question of quantum of damages, it's
              not liability. I'm here to answer questions relating to the quantum of
              damages.<br><br>CSJ: Thank you. Then why is it that you say you will go to the witness box --<br><br>LKY: I have already explained that, Your Honour --<br><br>CSJ:
              -- and answer questions not just particular to this defamation issue
              but on all issues of your life. Now tell me, are those just brave words
              meant for public consumption and in this situation right now you're
              turning tail and running?<br><br>LKY: Ha ha ha, no Your Honour --<br><br>CSJ:
              Good. Then you won't mind me asking you why is it that you make this
              application to cut short your cross-examination precisely when you walk
              in at noon and say that you have to be stopped in the cross-examination
              by 2:15 giving me. the defence, only two hours and fifteen minutes, and
              then insisting that all of us can't go for lunch. And on top of that
              refusing to tell the court what this "important matter" you have this
              afternoon is.<br><br>LKY: That's...Your Honour...(pause)<br><br>CSJ: I'm lost for words too as I think you are right now.<br><br>LKY: ...(pause; Mr Lee was seen opening his mouth to answer but no words came out)<br><br>CSJ: Go ahead, Mr Lee.<br><br>LKY: ...(pause)<br><br>CSJ: No answer? That settles the question then.<br><br>LKY: Ha ha ha.<br><br>Judge: Dr Chee!<br><br>CSJ:
              Fine, let Mr Lee continue. I'm just waiting. He's probably lost for
              words because he doesn't quite know what to say at this stage.<br><br>Judge: If you keep interrupting the witness...Yes, Mr Lee.<br><br>LKY: ...(even longer pause)<br><br>CSJ: Please don't run down the clock. I've only got a few minutes.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">At this stage, Mr Davinder Singh jumped in to bail out Mr Lee.</span><br><br>Singh:
              What is the question? Dr Chee has made so many points in his speech. He
              has already been told that the time to cross-examine the witness was
              during the summary judgment. If he had leave to defend. All issues
              would have been open for Dr Chee to have questioned him. The witness
              said that for Dr Chee to have questioned him. The witness said that Dr
              Chee had dodged that application and is now trying through the back
              door to introduce impermissible material. The witness said he is here
              as he said to answer questions on quantum. Dr Chee should really get on
              with the issue of quantum.<br><br>CSJ: Let me ask the question again.
              Mr Lee, you have said that you are here to answer these questions and I
              say that in that case why did you make an application to, halfway
              through the session, want the court to cut short this entire hearing.
              Now, I remind you that we have got until the end of tomorow, the end of
              tomorrow. So we have one-and-a-half days. But you insist that we have
              to finish by 2:15 for you to attend to some matters that you won't even
              reveal to the court. Now I ask you now does this sound like somebody
              who's willing to come to court and meet and resolve the issues?<br><br>LKY:
              Your Honour, I had a message from one of my counsel's aides to say that
              I should be in court by here 2 o'clock - by 12 o'clock because Your
              Honour has imposed a guillotine that the cross-examination of the prime
              minister would end at twelve. So I turn up at twelve. I was told that
              the guillotine allowed - had already been late he would be given 2
              hours. I suggest - I asked my counsel to request the court to finish
              this two hours so that I can attend to some important matters. There's
              no disadvantage to anybody to be sitting here and finishing off this
              cross-examination within the two hours. What I do not want to be a
              party to is a deliberate abuse of the process, of the proceedings of
              the court by delaying tactics.<br><br>CSJ: So, Mr Lee --<br><br>LKY:
              And by asking irrelevant questions, Dr Chee is running out the
              gullotine. At the end of the day, we've had this confrontation face to
              face have you thrown any dirt, have you dug up any scandal? Are you
              still saying as you've said before that this government is run like the
              NKF?<br><br>CSJ: Now, Mr Lee, let me try to --<br><br>LKY: No, we are here because you have said that --<br><br>CSJ:
              Mr Lee, I'm going to ask you this question and I wish you'd just stick
              to the questions that I pose to you. I'm asking you why did you come to
              court --<br><br>LKY: Because I was asked --<br><br>CSJ: Let me rephrase
              my question. Are you telling the court that you had nothing to do with
              the curtailment of this entire process?<br><br>Singh: Your Honour, I
              made the application this morning and Your Honour would remembers that
              I said I was very troubled with what the Chees did yesterday and that
              it was quite apparent that they had nothing to ask which was of any
              relevance and that unfortunately or otherwise has been proven in this
              exchange. And I said, Your Honour, that the whole purpose of the
              cross-examination was to insult, annoy and to scandalise and that's
              also been proven true. For that reason, I had asked that there be a
              guillotine. Your Honour had full powers to control the proceedings. The
              order has already been made and I don't see why this witness should be
              asked to explain something that was the subject of my application and
              Your Honour's order.<br><br>CSJ: Do you see the game that's being
              played here, Mr Lee? Do you see how you are beginning to hide behind
              your counsel and then claim, "Look, I'm willing to confront them. It's
              my counsel." Now I'm going to ask you a very simple question: Right
              here, right now, tell Mr Davnder Singh "Don't interrupt. I will answer
              these questions as they are put to me right now."<br><br>LKY: Heh-heh.
              Your Honour, I've briefed counsel, I've always found it's never wise to
              be my own lawyer in my own case. I know that some perople believe that
              they can do otherwise, and I'm quite sure that Dr Chee is making a very
              great impression on all the reporters in this court of how he is better
              than Mr Ravi --<br><br>CSJ: I think you meant Mr Singh.<br><br>LKY: I believe Mr Singh is better qualified to deal with the legalities of this case.<br><br>CSJ:
              Well, I should hope so with all the training that he's got. Now, coming
              back to my question, Mr Lee, is your answer no, that you wll not tell
              Mr Singh: "Stay out of this. Let me answer my question because --<br><br>LKY: I --<br><br>CSJ:
              Let me finish my question -- because you have said -- and I repeat to
              you -- that you will answer not only questions about the "particular
              defamation issue, but on all issues in my life."<br><br>LKY: Yes...as
              long as that was what was an issue and that was the, it was an issue in
              the summary judgement was appealed against. [Note how garbled the
              answer is.] And we turned up for the hearing but you dodged the hearing.<br><br>CSJ: Mr Lee, you are not unintelligent.<br><br>LKY: Thank you.<br><br>CSJ:
              You knew precisely what you meant and what you mean is: "Come and ask
              me all these questions that doesn't pertain to this defamation suit and
              I will answer you because my entire standing, inlcuding the standing of
              this government, is at stake." Is that not correct?<br><br>LKY: I think, Dr Chee, we'll cut short this proceeding to become more relevant.</p>

              integrity as you are referring to when you jailed Mr Chia Thye Poh for

              Lee Kuan Yew: May I point out to you what Singapore was when I became
              prime minister in 1959 and what Singapore is now. We had less than $100
              million in the kitty. Now that the assets that we have and I am not
              disclosing this but Global Financial Services assessed Singapore's
              sovereign wealth fund at over $300 billion.<br><br>Dr Chee: I am impressed. Now –<br><br>Mr Lee Kuan Yew: If you are impressed, Mr Chee – Dr Chee, if you're impressed, you would not have made these allegations.<br><br>Dr Chee: Mr Lee, is this the same integrity where you're talking about declassified documents from London?<br><br>Judge Ang: Irrelevant.<br><br>Dr Chee: – that you have –<br><br>Judge Ang: The witness is not required to answer.<br><br>Dr

              and I just want to be able to pursue that line just a little bit more.
              Is it the same integrity –<br><br>Mr Singh: Your Honour, I object to this line of questioning.<br><br>Dr Chee: That you are referring to, Mr Lee, where now we begin to know –<br><br>Justice Ang: Question is disallowed.<br><br>Dr

              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">The following exchange took place
              after Mr Lee Kuan Yew introduced the award given to him by Transparency
              International (Malaysia):</span><br><br><br> CSJ: Are you or are you
              not depending on this document to show your integrity in this court
              room. I remind one more time you will need a lot more that this because
              I can tell you this award is not worth the paper it is written.<br><br> LKY: We are also judged by PERC, we also judged by IMD, World Economic Forum and a whole host of other rating agencies.<br><br> CSJ: Good. Are you including International Commission Jurists? Are you
              including Human Rights Watch? Are you including Amnesty International?
              Are you including Committee to Project Journalists? Are you including
              International Federation for Free Exchange? Are you including Southeast
              Asia Press Alliance? Are you including World Movement for Democracy?
              Are you including Human Rights Defenders? Are you including World Forum
              for Democratisation in Asia? Are you including National Endowment for
              Democracy? Are you including Liberal International? Tell me you cited
              four, I cited you at least ten, Mr Lee. So do me a favour, let us not
              pick and choose at what endorsements you get because overall if you're
              trying to show me that your standing in the world is that high you
              wouldn't be clutching at straws and producing something from Tunku
              Aziz. I had a conversation with him -<br><br> Singh: Your Honour, what is the question?<br><br> CSJ: The question is why is Mr Lee depending on such a slipshop - when
              it is not a verifiable - if you come and tell me that you have been
              awarded the Nobel Prize I would accept it because that has been vetted.
              Tell me, who is in this organisation called Transparency International
              Malaysia. Tell me who are the officer here and when they make awards
              such as these, what vetting process do they go through?<br><br> Singh:
              Can we ask the cross examiner if he has a question? If he has not and
              he wants to make a speech and maybe for the next one hour left he can
              make his political speech. If he has no more questions for the witness
              he should say so.<br><br> CSJ: Your Honour, my question is this: Mr Lee
              has brought this ridiculous piece of paper and tells me that he is
              depending on this to prove his reputation. I'm asking him, does this
              plaintiff know who is behind this Transparency International Malaysia?<br><br> LKY: Your Honor, the man is on the Internet and the organisation is
              also on the website. They asked me in a private letter if I would
              receive this letter, There were wanting to score a point that it is
              possible to have in Southeast Asia a clean government. I agreed and I
              assume he would not sign a document citing TI which rates us always
              among the top 5 unless it had been authorised to do so. And now you are
              saying that he is liar, that he has falsely attributed this paragraph
              to Dr Eigen. Well then I say if you brought Dr Eigen here with an
              affidavit, then you can demolish Mr Adnan (should be Aziz) but not
              demolish me because I do not depend on Transparency International. I'm
              just putting this as an example of what PERC, IMD -<br><br> CSJ: But we
              haven't got the records of PERC, IMD and so in line with what Mr Singh
              said, let's dispense with it. Because if you did, you would produce
              them.<br><br> LKY: Ha. The simple answer really is between the
              competing NGOs, one for HR, one for liberal ideas of how governments
              should be and rating agencies concerned with actual assessment of
              government performance - where do investors put their money in. hey
              have not put their money in, if you study the World Bank and IMF
              reports in countries which are unable and corrupt -<br><br> CSJ: I think you're deliberately running down the clock. Let me ask you this question -<br><br> LKY: You are asking me this question -<br><br> CSJ: Let me pose this question. You had mentioned the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy -<br><br> Judge: Dr Chee! The witness, continue, finish -<br><br> CSJ: Let me ask you this question -<br><br> Judge: Dr Chee! I would like to hear this witness. Please continue.<br><br> LKY: There are liberal organisations which disagree with the way
              Singapore runs its social system but we believe we know better. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Otherwise
              we wouldn't be here, otherwise we wouldn't have this courtroom,
              otherwise you wouldn't be able to be living in an HDB flat. That's the
              final test.</span><br><br> CSJ: I think you're making this leap of
              logic that even Bruce Hawking would find did hard to follow. You are
              saying that without you without this entire government, we wouldn't be
              here? A little presumptuous, don't you think?<br><br> LKY: Your Honour, I'm saying -<br><br> CSJ: You see, Mr Lee, in Hong Kong people thrive without you and your
              system, in Taiwan people thrive without you and your system, in Korea
              people thrive without you and your system, and you are coming to this
              court and telling me that what we have right now is all because of you
              and your system that you have created. I think you are making too much
              of a presumption.<br><br> Judge: "Dr Chee, I'm going to stop this line of cross-examination."</p>

              <p>In general, if there were a peaceful protest with 1000 people marching along orchard road to demonstrate their discontent, would the Home Team and SAF put down their weapons and not disperse the crowd?</p>
              <p>Is it even possible to get 1000 people to demonstrate anyway? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>People are scared of this and that because they have so much to lose. It shows our true selfish nature of couldn't be bothered attitude.</p>
              <p>I will be looking forward to the results of the next elections. However I don't expect things changing much if the system and policies never change. It's like a game, if the rules never change, you don't expect the players to change their playing style very much.</p>

              <p>Create the choice. Give the opposition more votes = more power = more resources to encourage recruitment of better players. Even the playing field. Choice is good yes? Or would people like to watch the World Cup with 1 country as the only participant.</p>

              <p>And is that good or bad? So the people are unhappy (think that change is good for them) but they don't want to risk change because it could turn out worse or maybe they are lazy and could not possibly give the matter some thought?</p>

              <p><br>I totally agree with sirAdrian and Jojo. I have no issue with CSJ neither do I have an issue with the Lees he did great things before and Singapore has benefitted greatly from his hindsight.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However the truth is its not the case anymore.... the shroud of invincibility is no longer there. We no longer can say "don't worry about the state of affairs in Singapore just do what LKY says and we'll be fine." We are NOT fine. People are struggling. Kids have to do well in school and stay mainstream or end up with a bleak future. Foreign talents are competing with your kids should they fail in school for low paying jobs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Medical is costly in Singapore living standards are going down. Fewer families want kids and the list goes on and on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Top it off we don't have an opposition to raise our views. People are afraid to raise their opinion especially if its against the govt in public for fear of backlash. They could well be scaring themselves and for a fact the govt may not be oppressive in that extent but thats the political climate in Singapore right now.
