              <p>From better road planning, to decentralizing offices so we can spread the traffic out, to fixing existing bad road designs (exits before entrys on highways, for example), etc, etc, etc, etc...   Many, many, many, MANY better ideas than the ERP which only pushes the problem from one road to another to another and to our pockets.</p>

              <p><em>Immediately, however, Kuan Yew's attention was concentrated on how he
              would deal with J.B Jeyaretnam in parliament. I was quite alarmed at some
              of the things he told me at that lunch. "Look," he said, "Jeyaretnam
              cant win the infighting. I'll tell you why. WE are in charge. Every government
              ministry and department is under our control. And in the infighting, he
              will go down for the count every time." And I will never forget his
              last words. <strong>"I will make him crawl on his bended knees, and beg for

              <p>in SAF, who dares to defy orders? its their rice bowl, if not DB.</p>
              <p>if many people in Singapore still dare not demonstrate here, dont expect SAF men to defy orders. And yes, we have no guts to take the risk to get ourselves in trouble.</p>
              <p>I really salute CSJ for trying so hard to let people notice his hard work. I've come to realise that sometimes all talk doesnt work. CSJ is a man with guts, and mind you he is intelligent too, just that the papers always make him sound and look stupid. If he is really stupid, why is the police always tracking him whereever he goes? He must be a big threat right?</p>
