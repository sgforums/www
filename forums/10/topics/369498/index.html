                  <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SINGAPORE'S model of governance is one that tries to achieve a
                          balance between delivering quality leadership and giving people the
                          opportunity to voice their dissatisfaction with government policies,
                          said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</strong></span></span></p>
                  <p>It is a system that has <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>worked
                          well and one that has not let the people of Singapore down</strong></span></span>, he told a
                          German newspaper.</p>
                  <p>'How do you keep a system which delivers an outstanding quality of
                          leadership and government, and yet at the same time, have free play and
                          the opportunity for people to say, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'I want this government, but I do
                          not like this policy or the other'?'</strong></span></span></p>
                  <p>The ideal system, he said, balances both. It delivers a good
                          government, while providing for aspirations to be fulfilled and voices
                          - the full range of them - to be articulated. 'This is the ideal,' he
                          said in an interview published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
                          last week.</p>
                  <p>The newspaper wanted to know if Singapore would become 'even more
                          democratic' in future, as it had recently relaxed its rules on public
                          assemblies and was introducing changes to the political system to
                          enable more opposition voices in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>In his reply, Mr Lee said Singapore, like other countries, is
                          feeling its way forward in establishing a system that works best for
                          it. What would not work, he stressed, is to simply rely on the
                          simplistic approach that 'if you develop, you will need democracy'.</p>
                  <p>For Singapore, Mr Lee said, having a good system is important, but
                          getting good people to run it is equally crucial. He rebutted the
                          suggestion that the system was unfair, saying that the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>opposition had a
                          fair chance to compete and contest in general elections.</strong></span></span></p>
                  <p>In fact, he pointed out that in a small country like Singapore, the
                          ruling party would get booted out very quickly if it lost the mandate
                          of the people. 'It is for us to make sure that we continue to merit
                          their confidence and their support and deliver a good government,' said
                          Mr Lee, who is also secretary-general of the People's Action Party.</p>
                  <p>The German newspaper also <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>asked Mr Lee why there were 'no signs of
                          dissatisfaction' with the Government, </strong></span></span>despite the country facing one of
                          its worst recessions since independence. There were three reasons for
                          this, said Mr Lee.</p>
                  <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The first is that many workers see what the Government is doing to
                          help them, such as through training, which keeps them employable.
                          Another reason is the special measures like the Jobs Credit scheme,
                          which helps employers defray part of the wage bill of local workers.
                          This has helped companies keep workers rather than retrench them, he
                          said. 'And thirdly, when there are problems, they are able to talk to
                          us and we respond and deal with these problems,' said Mr Lee.</strong></span></span></p>
                  <p>These measures have helped buffer the impact of the recession on
                          Singaporeans, preventing unemployment from shooting up. Said Mr Lee:<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> 'If you look at the people on the streets and in the shops, life goes
                          on. It is a serious situation, but it is not a calamity.'</strong></span></span></p>

                  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>That's
                          what the Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore dictatorship does all the time.
                          Hoodwink foreigners, particularly Westerners into thinking Singapore is
                          something what it is not.</strong></span></span> What it is is this. It is a dictatorship, a
                          one party state, with Lee Kuan Yew and his family as the oligarchy in
                          total control; where the press is controlled entirely by them, where
                          the courts abuse the law at will to preserve the Lee family in power,
                          and where every organ of government is firmly in their control. In
                          short, a country where the people live in fear of the Lee Kuan Yew
                          family, completely at their mercy and whose lives are abandoned to
                          their whims. <br><br>What it is not is this. It is not a democracy. <br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>Singapore
                          has over the years successfully misled the Western world into thinking
                          it is a democracy. And to a large extent, so far, they have managed it.
                          With a state controlled press in Singapore, who is there to refute the
                          non stop good news that flows from it? </strong></span></span>Any country that has a state
                          controlled press can very much get away with anything they say. But all
                          this is changing with the Internet. Today it is getting harder and
                          harder for dictatorships and totalitarian regimes around the world to
                          get away with lies. But despite this, despite the fact that the west is
                          now aware of what Singapore, Burma and other small minded dictatorships
                          in the region are, Lee Kuan Yew's son, the boy whom his father placed
                          as the Prime Minister is at it again.<br><br>Singapore's state
                          controlled newspaper the Straits Times online edition of July 23, 2009
                          has this story, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"Striking a Balance, Singapore feeling it's way forward
                          in establishing a system that works best for it, says PM Lee". This is
                          an interview with the well known German newspaper Frankfurter
                          Allegmeine Zeitung.</strong></span></span><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The state controlled newspaper's title
                          itself is completely false. </strong></span></span>With 50 years continuous rule by this man
                          and his father Lee Kuan Yew, when every opposition political candidate
                          over the years has been either bankrupted or imprisoned by them, the
                          system “does work for them”, that is for him, his father and his
                          family. It certainly has not worked for the 4.5 million other ordinary
                          people who live in fear of him lest they say something he does not like.<br><br>As
                          we go on with this completely misleading article, every single line of
                          it is false and a lie. In the first sentence he says it is "a system
                          which achieves a balance of quality leadership" and "which gives the
                          people an opportunity to voice their grievances". If it a quality
                          leadership, then why is that almost half the population live below the
                          poverty line in their government owned HDB flats or cubicles, many
                          without even being able to afford 3 meals a day, no electricity or
                          water and many going hungry? Why is there massive unemployment? Why
                          does every Singaporean almost to the man, if they could, leave
                          Singapore for settlement abroad? Why are no children being born and why
                          does 2 out of 3 students who go abroad never return? <br><br>And if
                          the people are "given an opportunity to voice their grievances" then
                          why is Dr. Chee Soon Juan repeatedly jailed, bankrupted and
                          impoverished by the corrupt courts for doing just that "voicing his
                          grievance". And why is there no dissent at all from the entire
                          population, because they have all been subdued and silenced from even
                          the slightest criticism, lest they end up like Dr. Chee Soon Juan. Why
                          was I sent to jail for 3 months last year for doing just that in this
                          blog, criticizing? And if people are allowed to criticize, can he or
                          his father explain why they have both between them monopolized the
                          office of Prime Minster in the country and winning every single
                          election since 1959? <br><br>In the next line, Lee's son tells the
                          Frankfurter Allegmeine Zeitung, "It is a system that has worked well
                          and not let the people of Singapore down". Instead of telling
                          Frankfurter Allegmeine Zeitung, he should tell that to the miserable
                          wretches who live in the 1 and 2 room flats and the millions of others
                          who have lost their jobs and unable to find any other. He should say
                          that to the thousands of young people who are coming out of the schools
                          with no jobs and no prospects. He should tell that to the millions of
                          other Singaporeans whose jobs have been taken away by foreigners.
                          Without the benefit of a minimum wage, he should tell that to the
                          thousands of man and women who earn less that $500 or less. He should
                          tell that to the growing numbers who have made their homes in the void
                          decks of the government owned flats. He should tell that to the man who
                          was so upset he set one of his politicians alight on paint thinner. <br><br>The
                          next paragraph is so blatantly false, it seems as if he has no respect
                          whatsoever for the intelligence of Frankfurter Allegmeine Zeitung. He
                          says, believe it or not, "How do you keep a system which delivers
                          outstanding quality of leadership and government and yet (allow) the
                          people to say, I want this government but not this policy or the
                          other". My dear Lee Kuan Yew's son, you are presuming too much. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How can
                          you say you deliver "outstanding quality of leadership" when the truth
                          is, your entire government is literally falling apart, and it will with
                          your father's impending demise. And what makes you think the people
                          want your government but not a particular policy or other? What makes
                          you think that? If you ask me, I think to the last man every
                          Singaporean wants your entire family out. But there is nothing they can
                          do since you will put them in jail if they say so.</strong></span></span><br><br>Further down
                          it is alleged (we do not know if this is true, keeping in mind this is
                          a state controlled press) that Frankfurter Allegmeine Zeitung had asked
                          if Singapore will become more democratic? I am not sure whether the
                          German newspaper was being a bit sarcastic or whether they really
                          believed there was any democracy in Singapore. If the German newspaper
                          Frankfurter Zeitung did not know, there is no democracy at all.
                          Protests are disallowed entirely throughout the island except for a
                          small patch of ground no bigger than a football field, where even there
                          plain clothes police will harass and threaten anyone found in it. <br><br>Next
                          Lee's son says every country has to devise a system that works for
                          them. Sure, Burma has devised a system that works very well for the
                          military junta and the Lee family in Singapore has similarly devised a
                          system that works very well for them. Not for any other Singaporeans.
                          Then he says, that simply because you are developed does not mean you
                          should have democracy. Wait a minute, dear son. What makes you think
                          only developed countries should have democracy? Should it not be a
                          universal right for everyone, as along as you are a human? <br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>He
                          then puts out another shameless blatant lie that "the opposition had a
                          fair chance to compete and contest in elections"! Tell me son, did the
                          late JB Jeyaretnam get a fair chance? Did Dr. Chee Soon Juan? Did Chia
                          Thye Poh? Did Francis Seow? Did Tang Liang Hong? Come on boy who are
                          you kidding? The Germans are not as stupid as you think.</strong></span></span><br><br>Then he
                          says the reasons why the people have not organized a revolution and
                          rebellion against him is because the government helps them through
                          training. The truth is there is no re-training at all, and no one who
                          has been re-trained has ever got any job because there are none. <br><br>Another
                          reason he says is that employers have been given money towards
                          employees’ salaries. The truth is that money is only given to
                          government linked or government supportive companies and none of that
                          money has ever gone to any worker; it is pocketed by the employers. And
                          thirdly, he says when people have problems they can talk to the
                          government. It is true that unemployed and miserable Singaporeans can
                          form a line outside one of the son's members of parliament and beg for
                          help. They might get a bag of rice and a couple of hundred dollars but
                          this in no way helps any Singaporean who is in a bind. <br><br>Unemployment
                          he says has not shot up. If you count those who earn less than $500.00
                          per month wages, an amount way below the poverty line, almost half the
                          people of Singapore live in poverty, not much different from Communist
                          China or India. Then he says look at the people in the shops shopping
                          as evidence of the people's wealth.</p>
                  <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This is the lowest of the low, a
                          dastardly and shameful lie. </strong></span></span></p>
                  <p>Yes in any country that is jam packed like
                          Singapore with 4.5 million people living one on top of the other; you
                          will see some people in shopping malls. But Frankfurter Allegmeine
                          Zeitung has to be warned these shoppers are just 5% of the population
                          of the island. The rest 95% live in their cramped government owned
                          flats hardly surviving. <br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>Please Frankfurter Allegmeine Zeitung,
                          go on a tour of the HDB flats and ask the miserable creatures ensconced
                          in them. Lee's son is just pulling wool over your eyes because he
                          thinks, you, being a foreigner would not know.</strong></span></span><br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>Ah Chia, I don't mind you posting. But stop the crap about insulting the peranakan community. If you want to fuck LKY that is your business but leave the peranakan coimmunity alone! Don't tie in the peranakan community with LKY. He is just a memeber in the set of peranakans and his views don't represent all the peranakans. Let this be my first warning to you.</p>

              <p>Fantagf, I beg your pardon. The mods take trolls issues very seriously. That is why we even bother to erase the threads that idiot makes. If we really choose not to care we won't even edit the threads. Only the super mods like Fireice and Jason have the authority to delete threads. We work within our means.</p>
              <p>The best way you all can help us is to post and let his thread sink to the dolrums. Ignore him like he is some bastard borned from the devil's spawn. In this manner he will be dealt the greatest blow ever.</p>
