            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, just a few relaxing days out of Singapore, and I receive an opening address of endearment - from of all persons in sgForums: TidalWave333.<br><br>Did a real "tidal wave" actually hit home, and washed away all the ills ?<br><br>Unfortunately, it will seem that the old reality remains.<br><br>Why do you always assume that one need to get angry, hostile, frustration, or even suffer bruised ego or pride in any exchanges here in this sgForum Â– especially with you ?<br><br>Is there a need to fall into such emotional weakness when each of us are entitled to our own creative thinking - that when private thoughts are put into print in this sgForum, it will invite challenges from minds that are either better or questionable ?<br><br>With your constant attempt at inference and persistent suggestions to infuse such reactions in others, surely it can only be revealing of your similar emotional dysfunction over my comments to the various issues raised by you ?<br><br>Can simple effort on your part to correcting economic facts and vocabulary jar my emotional state of mind so easily ?<br><br>You give yourself too much credit in thinking that you can affect my emotions or my sensibilities.<br><br>As was so clearly explained in at least two of my responses, the English Language remains an evolving language, that is more tolerant and accepting to its flexible application, then your dogmatic insistence in following your assumed standards and understanding.<br><br>If you use dictionaries as a guide of accepted norms of English, you may wish to note that even the latest Oxford Dictionary (or was it Cambridge) has begun to include SINGLISH words from Singapore.<br><br>If good English is intolerant of aberrations and dogmatism is pursued in maintaining its purity, will English remain relevant to this day ?<br><br>By the way, recognizing your good command in the use of English, does not necessarily qualify you to be an arbitrator of the Language.<br><br>Your self-acclaimed role simply confirms my suggestion of your pompously arrogant nature.<br><br>With regards to your preferred position concerning the economic concept of large population and unemployment, you insist on adopting preset concepts and theoretical assumptions Â– as shown in your post of 12 September 2004 Â– 5.00P.M. : <span style="font-style: italic;"><br><br>Â“ <span style="color: blue;">And if I may correct your ignorance of economics or economic reality, population or territorial size are not the only (and definitely not the most important) determinants of unemployment rates, otherwise, big countries with big populations would all be economic superpowers now (think China, India, Russia, Indonesia). In fact, statistically, small countries with small populations are more likely to succeed Â….. You also made a paradoxical statement- if countries with industrial strength give it a headstart in dealing with unemployment problems, why havenÂ’t they already done so eons ago? In cases like Germany or Australia, high unemployment rates have been an economic reality for many years compared to the past few years Singapore has experienced.</span> Â“ </span><br><br>Yet you will not engage my reply given, preferring to miss my points to suit your own debating agenda of winning any argument even by skipping issues.<br><br>The following is an extract of my reply 13 September 2004 Â– 08:13A.M.<br><br>Â“ <span style="font-style: italic;"> <span style="color: green;">China and India is already stirring from their many years of deep slumber, and even your beloved mentors from the Ruling Party is already telling Singaporeans to wake up to the challenges from these countries.<br><br>In the short span of the last 20 years, since China opened its doors, we have seen China's foreign reserves and trade surplusses increased in geometric proportions - that even outstripped Singapore's reserves by three times.<br><br>Are you still living in your preferred matrix vision ?<br><br>GermanyÂ’s present problem with a relative high unemployment percentage is due very much to the financial burden in absorbing the Communist half of East Germany - that brought with it a huge and inefficient economic and industrial structure, despite a well educated work force with good basic skills.<br><br>With Germany being part of a larger European Community, its national border is no longer a limitation to the opportunities available for its continued ability to resolve the unemployment problems. Being a member of a wider European Community has helped Germany to prevent an otherwise higher unemployment rate.<br><br>Is Australia having any problems in resolving her unemployment issue, or is its economy performing so well that the Australian Currency has increased in value over the Singapore Currency by more then 30 Percent between 2002 to 2004 ?<br><br>If small size has a better advantage Â– as you have stated by quoting from some source Â– then by your own measure of performance, where was Singapore in the same period that you suggested in measuring</span></span> Â– <strong> Â“<span style="color: green;">eons ago</span>Â”  </strong>?<br><br>Your response to my reply given on 13 September 2004 - 12:59PM Â– was merely selective, and avoided giving any full reply. <span style="font-style: italic;"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Â“Yes, yes, yes to all that digressive drivel. But what are the unemployment rates in those countries? What is the point of rehashing economic clichÃ©s about India and China when no one is disagreeing about the size of their foreign reserves. The pertinent subject here is unemployment rates.(Answer: latest annual 2003 figures China 10% urban unemployment where ironically most jobs are; India:9.1%) Is Singapore not, and indeed the rest of the world, restructuring and taking note of the challenges posed by the two countries? For example the American government highlighting the outsourcing problem, the Japanese government fretting over its domestic industries moving to China etc. Â“</span> </span><br><br>Did you reply in full to the issues posted in my earlier reply ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PART ONE</strong><br><br>Atobe dearest,<br><br>I see you have implicitly recognized the disadvantages of engaging in hostile mindless drivel that puts you in a poor position where public opinion is concerned.<br><br>It is amusing to observe that you have chosen to adopt a calmer disposition in your first post, as well as incorporate part of my vocabulary subsequently. I canÂ’t say the same for your second post of course, but it does reflect your tacit admission that you werenÂ’t going anywhere with the incoherent and illogical slobber.<br><br>For some reason, reading your post today has put me in a pleasant mood, and so I shall try to be extra nice to you in this response.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Why do you always assume that one need to get angry, hostile, frustration, or even suffer bruised ego or pride in any exchanges here in this sgForum Â– especially with you ?</blockquote>I ask myself the same questions when I read your previous posts. Your spiteful language, agitated tone and juvenile insults that come with the verbal garbage you produce have not gone unnoticed by other readers of this thread. From a psychological perspective, your questions can be interpreted as an inner search for answers to your own conundrum as you superficially pose them to me. They are actually meant for yourself, arenÂ’t they? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>As was so clearly explained in at least two of my responses, the English Language remains an evolving language, that is more tolerant and accepting to its flexible application, then your dogmatic insistence in following your assumed standards and understanding.<br>If you use dictionaries as a guide of accepted norms of English, you may wish to note that even the latest Oxford Dictionary (or was it Cambridge) has begun to include SINGLISH words from Singapore.<br>If good English is intolerant of aberrations and dogmatism is pursued in maintaining its purity, will English remain relevant to this day ?</blockquote>Yes, you are quite right in noting that languages are always evolving, and colloquialisms are included in dictionaries. But the issue is not one of language evolution or the inclusion of colloquialism. It is <strong>simply</strong> about your lack of mastery over it- the occasional spelling mistake, but extremely frequent syntactical errors and rambling sentences. As it is, when I correct you, they are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALWAYS YOUR</span> own mistakes. I do <strong>NOT</strong> make them up, but I did dissolve into incredulous laugher when I read your horribly constructed remark criticizing my language use. <strong>FOUR</strong> mistakes in one sentence! Gosh! I also read with disbelief that you have anything to do with Â‘proof readingÂ’ in real life, but I suppose that explains why general standards are falling. Put simply- with you around, can one expect anything more? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>By the way, recognizing your good command in the use of English, does not necessarily qualify you to be an arbitrator of the Language.</blockquote>I did not crown myself as Â‘arbitratorÂ’. You did. (But no thanks.)<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>With regards to your preferred position concerning the economic concept of large population and unemployment, you insist on adopting preset concepts and theoretical assumptionsÂ…Â…Â….Yet you will not engage my reply given, preferring to miss my points to suit your own debating agenda of winning any argument even by skipping issues.</blockquote>I do <strong>NOT</strong> Â“skip issuesÂ” and I do <strong>NOT</strong> have an Â“agenda.Â” This whole issue arose out of the point on employment rates. You digressed, and promptly forgot what the focus was. Scroll back and refresh your memory. I do <strong>NOT</strong> Â“winÂ” arguments by dictating the Â“agenda.Â” I simply produce facts, back it up with accurate statistics, and make a few relevant and logical statements to that effect. With your difficulties in economics, you should try it sometime. Works well for me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>(<strong>Note</strong>: New readers of this thread may wish to read it from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PAGE ONE </span>onwards, to learn about AtobeÂ’s record of misleading statements, inaccurate usage of economic numbers, and poor understanding of economic concepts. You will be highly entertained at the same time.)<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>While I have been diligent to address your responses by quoting in full, and had attempted to give full reply to each and every point - as much as possible, your approach in giving selective responses to my points can only be seen as being dishonest.</blockquote>I wonÂ’t bother to correct this horribly constructed sentence. (*gets goosepimples*). What I wish to say is that the simple reason why I do not quote every word from you is because most sentences are just insults, do not make sense or progress the debate further, and are thus unworthy of appearing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TWICE</span> in a public forum. The ungrammatical remarks are already an eyesore just by appearing once- there is no need to prolong or repeat the agony. I respond to <strong>ALL </strong>relevant issues (unlike you who suffers from selective amnesia apparently), but I see no need to engage in crude meaningless drivel at your expense.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>One can only wonder if you do not have a preset agenda of preferring to focus your replies with a Â‘politicalÂ’ agenda to merely discredit my persona more then being interested in a debate.</blockquote>The evidence is overwhelming- where numbers, reason and fact are concerned in this thread. Whether your public Â‘personaÂ’ has been discredited as a result was long a foregone conclusion even before I participated in this forum. One only needs to look at previous threads, and the responses from other readers. If you lose your credibility through ignorance, spite, crudity and generally by bullying others, it is your <strong>OWN</strong> doing. Do not blame it on me.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Despite your poor attitude in being so arrogantly dismissive of my postings, as reflected in all of your selective replies, it is heartening to note that you are such a fan to my postings, and had even been able to quote from my own submission dated 21 August 2004 Â– 04.:04P.M.</blockquote>I must admit I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AM</span> quite a fan of your ignorance. SgForums is a treasure trove of your stupidity and arrogance. It has provided me (and no doubt other educated readers) with many laughs. But your pattern is getting predictable- posting an article from the papers, writing a few ignorant remarks with your half-baked economic and political ideas, before opening it up to the rest of the forum. Have you considered a change to your self-serving act? LikeÂ….. actually writing a well researched, thoughtful and grammatical post before inviting opinions from others? (Hahahaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br></div>

What agenda might that be? What do I seek to achieve? As for Â‘discreditingÂ’ your persona (Hahahaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ), you have already demonstrated itÂ’s entirely your own doing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Since you are such an expert in so many fields as displayed from your wide range of seemingly expert comments Â– including your self-advertised ability to spot and correct errors in my print Â– perhaps you would like to join my staff as a Â“proof readerÂ” ?</blockquote>Wow, a job offerÂ…Â…but no thanks (for the third time). I am sure you need assistance to Â“proof read.Â” Afterall, if you depend on just yourself, nothing will ever get done.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  If I need a Â‘leaderÂ’ to guide me, or intend to work for others, I prefer that my boss has the intellectual ability of at least a garden snail besides the appropriate language skills.

Take away the personal frustrations, anger, and meaningless drivelÂ….and you will discover there is very little substance, but a lot of garbage.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Â…Â…  all of which were aimed to achieve your political agenda of discrediting my persona ? You ought to try harder if you think your can intimidate me with your childish attempts to destabilize my persona.</blockquote>Do you feel threatened? Why are you manifesting the behaviour of a pitiful man under siege? Why do you keep pretending you have any semblance of credibility left? Or that I need to destroy you? ItÂ’s all nonsense, and just your mind playing tricks on you. My intentions and motives are entirely honourable.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>It would seem that the calmer my response, the more agitated you become.</blockquote>I like this remark very much! (Hahaha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) It is an apt description of your behaviour, and your explicit attempt to Â“changeÂ” reality simply by stating the opposite, hoping others will be influenced, and hence recreating actuality. From a psychological perspective again, it is a reflection of your self-doubt and tacit recognition of past behaviour.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>You ought to be more serious if you intend to succeed in driving me off this sgForum Â– especially if you claim that my intellectual writing is low, and I am so poorly read.</blockquote>I think I need to spend some time compiling your errors from all posts in this thread- poor language use, poor understanding of economics and politics, and incoherent rambling. But thatÂ’ll prove to be a long and tedious task considering the number of mistakes there are. But it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IS</span> the best antidote to your condition of selective amnesia.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Do you think that your manner of blind support to an overbearing Government is doing any service to Singapore, or qualify you to be a better Citizen ?<br>Your arrogant attitude is typical of the Government and the Ruling Party - that it is disloyalty to Singapore by criticizing the Government or the Ruling Party.<br>It only confirms that 'your mind' is either 'dulled by a full stomach' according to the Political Maxim expounded by your beloved MM, or that you are prepared to turn a blind eye to the aberrations in the Civil and Political Life of Singapore that is perpetuated by the Ruling Party forming the Government.</blockquote>You are quite mistaken in all three assumptions. Your <strong>pathological hatred </strong>of Singapore, and all things Singaporean has blinded you to the fact that this country and its people are not all-bad, all-evil, all-materialistic, all-unthinking and all-conspiring. There are many achievements one can be justifiably proud of. I am not a 'blind' supporter just because my views do not converge with yours- I can Â‘see very wellÂ’, my mind is clear, and I recognize there are areas that need improvement. But I do not labour under the self-important burden you carry- poor, pitiful Atobe, who thinks the weight of reform is on him, and his to carry alone *sniffs and wipes a tear away*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> .<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>With your kind of arrogant, pompously self-righteous attitude and hypocritical values, it will not be surprising if you take on a more pathetic role in SingaporeÂ’s society Â– selling your soul for the sake of material advancement.</blockquote>Best to look at yourself, and rectify your psychological hatred of Singapore, Singaporeans, and the people who participate in this forum.

Â“ItÂ’s <span style="font-style: italic;">swell</span> that Atobe likes garden snails in soupsÂ” instead of<br>Â“itÂ’s <span style="font-style: italic;">wonderful</span> that Atobe likes garden snails in soupsÂ”<br><br><strong>Singaporean Colloquialism</strong><br>E.g. Â“Atobe <span style="font-style: italic;">blur like sotong</span>?Â” instead of<br>Â“Atobe is <span style="font-style: italic;">stupid</span>?Â” (<span style="font-style: italic;">sotong</span> literally 'squid' in Malay, but figuratively stupid. 'Blur' is colloquial for 'stupid' as well.)<br><br>Â‘Working housewivesÂ’ is not colloquialism. It is neither Singlish, nor colloquial. ItÂ’s an <strong>oxymoron</strong>, and a reflection of your inability to grasp the nuances of the English language. ThatÂ’s the nicest way I can think of to describe your language ability. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">primary occupation</span> of a housewife is to take care of the household. As I suggested previously, ask your neighbour or a primary school kid to enlighten you.<br>In case you have difficulty understanding the term Â‘oxymoronÂ’Â…...itÂ’s simply a term used to describe the combination of contradictory words like Â‘mini sagaÂ’. Use a dictionary to find out more.<br><br>Why donÂ’t you sign up for EL101 in NUS? You will have fun learning about acrolectal, mesolectal and basilectal forms of spoken English in Singapore. Saves me from conducting mini lessons here.<br><br>Atobe writes (20 September 2004)<br><blockquote>If you use dictionaries as a guide of accepted norms of English, you may wish to note that even the latest Oxford Dictionary (or was it Cambridge) has begun to include SINGLISH words from Singapore.</blockquote>I can see you have full mastery over your facts. I wonÂ’t ask about the relevant edition until you know which dictionary you are referring to.<br><br>Atobe writes (20 September 2004)<br><span style="font-style: italic;">By the way, recognizing your good command in the use of English, does not necessarily qualify you to be an arbitrator of the Language.</span><br><br>Tidalwave responds (20 September 2004)<br><span style="font-style: italic;">I did not crown myself as Â‘arbitratorÂ’. You did. (But no thanks.) </span><br><br>Atobe responds (21 September 2004)<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Did I crown you, or have you deluded yourself with your supreme vanity ?</span><br><br>I do not see myself as an arbitrator of the language. Neither should you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SUGGEST</span> I am one by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CROWNING</span> me as one. For the lexical meaning of Â‘inferenceÂ’, I suggest you look up a dictionary again.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>This entire episode was supposed to be about a 5-day workweek, and yet you will hijack the thread in a useless exercise to display your arrogance in deriding someone elseÂ’s opinion.</blockquote>I do not deride opinions, including yours. Did you feel you were being treated with derision and contempt? I treated you with the upmost respect and refrained from name-calling (which is more than I can say of you of course.) In fact, I also bore your repetitive and tedious insults with good humour. Where ignorance was displayed, I pointed them out accordingly. Correcting you is not equivalent to treating you with disrespect.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>So this exercise is merely about the center stage, the spotlight, the adulation and admiration that you are only seeking.<br>A deep set psychological need for public acceptance, recognition and adulation ?</blockquote>Again, correcting you is not an Olympic sport. In fact, a few have pointed out that talking to you is Â‘dirty workÂ’. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>So far I have not seen persona of more substance supporting your position Â– except for some Â“papier-macheÂ” characters, and one self-acclaimed member from NSP who is a dogged defender to the Ruling Party.

LetÂ’s get back to economic and political issues soon. ItÂ’s boring playing your game of rebutting insults although I understand why you avoid going back to the REAL issues assiduously. I donÂ’t want to sound patronizingÂ…but you realize I have been giving you time to read up in the last few days by penning responses to your meaningless drivelÂ…Â…why would anyone engage you with kid gloves otherwise?<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>It is merely your own opinion concerning the status of my persona, which you seem to find it intolerable with the positions that I prefer to take concerning some issues</blockquote>You seem to have an obsession with the word Â‘personaÂ’. Maybe I should come up with another top nine list soon. We are not in a literary work, and you are not a literary character. Check the dictionary for the meaning of Â‘personaÂ’.<br><br></div>

I made myself quite clear when I pointed out your pattern of posting here- pasting a newspaper article, writing a few ignorant remarks, and inviting others to join in. I have read all your posts, and most threads. You donÂ’t need <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ME</span> to tell <span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOU</span> what I think of your opinions in those threads. Instead of just laughing at your frivolous and half-baked ideas in other threads (which you seem to think are intelligent), perhaps you want grand exposes of your ignorance elsewhere too? I am also amused that I am now a Â‘juvenileÂ’Â…after being given adult-like labels such as Â‘government menteeÂ’, Â‘trained economistÂ’, Â‘technocratÂ’, Â‘civil servantÂ’ etc by you. Consistency dear boy! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote> How do you reply 9 out of 9 posts when you do not even care to give some degree of indulgence to all that you see in my posts - which you have so eloquently described in your PART ONE (above) just to merely give yourself a decent way out ?</blockquote>As I mentioned earlier, most of your recent posts are insults and verbal garbage. There is no need to respond to insults and the like. I am quite happy to let you (1) make them, (2) enjoy a few indulgences, and (3) portray yourself as a hapless, pitiful man under siege. I see no need to invite contempt from others by sinking to your level.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Threatened ? From someone who took so long to sign up on this sgForum ?</blockquote>What does the date of participationÂ…Â….errrÂ…have to do with anything? If you do not feel threatened, why do <strong>YOU</strong> keep insisting (repeatedly) I am out to wreck your Â‘personaÂ’? A few examples to refresh your memory:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">1. One can only wonder if you do not have a preset agenda of preferring to focus your replies with a Â‘politicalÂ’ agenda to merely <strong>discredit my persona </strong>more then being interested in a debate.<br><br>2. How would you define Â“hostilityÂ” - that you deny being carried in your two part postings, when both parts included insults, sarcasm, ridicule, taunts, and harangues Â– all of which were aimed to achieve your political agenda of <strong>discrediting my persona</strong> ?<br><br>3. You ought to try harder if you think your can intimidate me with your childish attempts to <strong>destabilize my persona</strong>.<br><br>4. Why bother with the terms of endearment when your intention is hypocritically bent on <strong>defacing my persona </strong>?<br><br>5. If this is not a clear example of your style of deception in AVOIDING issues that can undermine your focused effort on a single issue Â– <strong>to discredit my persona</strong></span><br><br>Digressing a little, do you see how nice I am to you? I could have easily created another top 10 list Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">Atobe Portrays Himself as a Victimized PersonaÂ’</span>, but I resisted the temptation. (Hahahaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>I thought I was already a late comer to this interesting place Â– with all the colorful names that abound, each Â‘nickÂ’ taken that quite accurately reflect the persona behind.</blockquote>Why do you make it so easy for me to portray you as juvenile? This isnÂ’t primary school where kids make fun of given names or give nicknames. Just as a fire can kill and destroy, it can also be smothered and turned into wisps of smoke. When you buy a book, do you just read the title, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OR</span> look at how colourful the cover is? Regardless, either option makes u look silly.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Do I have the powers Â“to Â‘changeÂ’ reality simply by stating the opposite, hoping others will be influenced, and hence recreating actualityÂ” ?</blockquote>I am afraid being delusional is your forte. Unfortunately, being informed isnÂ’t.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>If you happened to have a few good laughs from some posts that you managed to view, it has at least drawn your attention.</blockquote>Dead right about that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  I couldnÂ’t believe the sheer ignorance displayed, the amount of ill-will you earned, the abuse you heaped on othersÂ…..and most importantly, the number of private messages I received from strangers between 16-17 September. In fact, I took the liberty of forwarding your posts on the 13 and 16 September to friends working in _________ for some glee and hilarity. At least your economic ignorance produced some useful benefits.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Am I suffering from amnesia, or is it the double standards being practiced here that is causing someone to be confused as to which side of the table one should be sitting at ?</blockquote>It must be the former. Your selective amnesia has caused you to forget the boo-boos you made in economic statistics, language use, and other miscellaneous facts.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote> In your own self-indulging arrogance of your own position, you fail to recognize that opposing the Ruling Party Â– which happen to form the Government Â– is NOT being disloyal to Singapore.<br>Opposing the Government POLICIES is not OPPOSING SINGAPORE.<br>No one can control what you prefer to see or what you prefer to think.</blockquote>Actually, these are very sensible sentiments you have. I do not take issue with them. At the same time, they remind me of the language used, and the mud-slinging between Democrats and Republicans in the coming American Presidential election.<br>But one does not simply take an opposition stand for the sake of taking an opposition stance. ItÂ’s evident you delight in making half-baked comments on issues you have no real understanding or given little thought to. This is evident from your bizarre conceptions in economics: German unemployment, the state of the Singapore economic growth, the Singaporean exchange rate, international trade dependency, industrial output; politics: the 5-day work week, globalization, how PRs are granted to foreigners; language use: Â‘working housewifeÂ’, Â‘serious household chores, Â‘dogmaÂ’, Â‘colloquialismÂ’Â…just to quite a few examples offhand. I donÂ’t see anything wrong in correcting you factually. If I call you Â‘ignorantÂ’, it is always substantiated. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

Grand statements that aspire to an idealized form of political society! I (must) applaud you for such fine and noble sentiments. It is such a change from your usual abusive self. You are making these remarks out of genuine conviction, and not out of fear or desperation I hope? But it is still quite unnecessary to heap abuse on those who differ from you. This is evident in many threads. It is also difficult to equate loyalty with a person who declares publicly his intention to migrate. LetÂ’s see how you persuade and convince other readers here in the future then.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Perhaps you should get out of your closeted environment and see the World beyond theories, dogmas and statistics.</blockquote>What makes you think I am enjoying your little ignorant tantrums in Singapore now?

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PART TWO</strong><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote> Well, since you are having a whale of a time in your puddle of supreme confidence with your English, I am surprised you are so unwilling to stretch your mischievous moronic standards a little more to cover also those OXYMORONIC areas too.<br>About the Â“working HOUSEWIFEÂ” Â– if you are into Talking Cock, you should try to talk to your neighborhood Ah Soh Â– who is a housewife, and will probably be working at the neighborhood marketÂ…Â…</blockquote>OhÂ…..Â’oxymoronicÂ’Â…Â…this is going to be another one of those persistent abuse of a perfectly good wordÂ….like Â‘working housewifeÂ’. So long as you feel good about it, I suppose it doesnÂ’t matter if you reinforce perceptions of being silly.<br><br>Atobe writes on 23 September 2004<br><blockquote>Only THREE (3) fits the said range of a FEW ?<br>Well, what are you complaining about ?<br>I was more generous then yourself, and had suggested the most likely number of SIX fans to your style of writing; but still it is only six out of a current count of 2500 PLUS hits to this thread.</blockquote>Atobe writes on 22 September 2004:<br><blockquote>From these three fan of yours - two of them could not stand up to the scrutiny of their posts, and are simply borrowing your stage to make a vain effort to have a prick at my position; and perhaps another three more likely fans from the papier-mÃ¢chÃ© menagerie in this sgForum.</blockquote>Until you are sure of what you are talking about, I will ignore your speculations. Since you have already ascertained Â“these three fansÂ” of mine but qualified your uncertainty with Â‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">PERHAPS</span> another threeÂ’Â….there is no need to give it much attention. I can name the first group of three myself (although I <strong>donÂ’t</strong> think they are Â‘fansÂ’), but who are the next group of three? Your enemies here? Indeed you go on to acknowledge that the most Â‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">LIKELY</span>Â’ number is six, but you cannot be sure can you? So many qualifications, so little certainty.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote> Â“Atobe, atobe, you ignorant fool! Â“<br>Â– what happened to your call for Â‘decorumÂ’ ?</blockquote>Repetitive. Still nursing your bruised ego. See above why you are deserving of that label.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Â“What followers? What admirers? Tok tok wat har? More gibberishÂ”<br>Â– Now, now, you are so riled up that you cannot even recognized those FEW who were agreeable to Â‘talk dirtyÂ’ with you about me.</blockquote>Repetitive. Still nursing your bruised ego. See explanation above. Ever wondered why you have not garnered any support from strangers?<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>You see what I mean ? When you get all riled up being emotional, you will loose track of your tasks. Did you not address the issue about Â‘FEWÂ’ a few paragraphs above ? Drivel again ?</blockquote>Hehehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Â…..you are far too kind. More imitation, and more flattery. This is indicative of your lack of resources where language is concerned. Why donÂ’t you dig deep into your cache of silly drivel for more ammunition? By the way, itÂ’s Â‘<strong>lose</strong>Â’ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT </span>Â‘looseÂ’. But I wonÂ’t be holding any celebratory parties taunting youÂ….with so many errors, such parties will become as repetitive as your drivel. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Aspire to be you completely ?<br>No thanks, I rather enjoy all your antics from a long distance, being half of Kumar in the Â“Boom Boom RoomÂ” - Kumar at least will make better stand-up jokes than you.</blockquote>ErrrÂ….there is no shame in wanting to idolize me. You are already adopting my vocabulary and style of writing here anyway. You can become my fan, but refrain from being a tedious groupie. As for Kumar, if you are enamored by the comedian, why donÂ’t you search for your feather boa and make a trip to see the new place for yourself? Far East Square, not Bugis JUNCTION, so donÂ’t get lost!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
