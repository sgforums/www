            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PART ONE</strong><br>atobe writes on 7 September 2004<br><blockquote>Great news, after restoring the 10% cut to the wages of Ministers and most Civil Servants, they are now giving themselves a 5-Day work week to enjoy the extra 10% wages. </blockquote>This is the relevant excerpt of what Lee Hsien Loong <strong>ACTUALLY</strong> said in his speech (www.gov.sg) on 22 Aug 2004<br><blockquote>So, the Civil Service will go to a five-day week.  I didn't know you were all civil servants!  It will apply also to schools and army camps, but we will not reduce the official working hours.

It's very clear where you went wrong from the very first statement.  And it's <strong>not</strong> because I 'simply' said so, but because you didn't listen/read LHL's speech carefully and made a mistake. Is it so difficult on your ego to be corrected on a simple obvious error?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>atobe writes<br><blockquote>Are there that many Singaporeans being truly "quite happy" that this rearrangement to their work schedules will give them a whole day off, and "Many are happy to work 30-60 mins more each weekday, instead of coming back on Saturdays" ?<br>What is your basis for such unsubstantiated confidence in such a position ?<br>You seem to display an unfounded sense of superiority with your assumptions made that will be applicable to, and agreeable by, all Singaporeans.</blockquote>This question is best answered by LHL who explained why the government was compelled to change to a five day week after many new civil service recruits expressed their wish to work five days.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">"We have always resisted a five-day week......when we talk to employees coming in or staff coming in and ask them, "What is it which you are looking for?", the first thing they ask us is, "Do you work on Saturdays?" because they want that time.  Two days of a weekend is different from one-and-a-half days of a weekend.  So, after having said, "No" for a very long time, I think it is time to turn this stone over also. "</span><br>The government is actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;">acceding</span> to the requests of the majority. They are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">giving in </span>to demands from the majority after many years of rejecting the five-day work week demand. No policy can satisfy <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> Singaporeans (and certainly I did <strong>NOT </strong>say <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> Singaporeans will be pleased.) Due to the nature of my research/work carried out in a formal setting over the last three years as well as government feedback received (no, I don't work for the government as SnowFlag asked), the majority of people I have talked to are pleased with the new changes. They are pleased the government is finally adopting <span style="text-decoration: underline;">working days </span>adopted by Western governments, societies and companies.  They are happy that instead of having to come into the office on Saturdays, they can allocate the entire day for non-work related activities.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Your opinion are merely your own assumptionsÂ…Â….Do you have any contact with this generation of womenfolk - age between 28 years to 48 years, married with young or teenage children ?</blockquote>Again in the formal setting I mentioned earlier, I can say that the majority (more than four-fifths) are pleased with the new working hours. I should be the one asking you, who are these civil servants in your social/work circle who are dismayed they can no longer work on Saturdays, and who are furious, shocked and angry that they now have an entire day to themselves?<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Do you even have an inkling of understanding of what a working mother is going through in having to cope with her job and to mother her children ?<br>Perhaps you come from a better endowed family with less problems faced by those having to struggle to make ends meet, and living on a COMBINED family income of less then $3,000 per month ?</blockquote>These statements are irrelevant to the issue. They digress to appeal to emotion, rather than logic. The total working hours remain the same, while working schedules are tweaked slightly by 30-60 minutes. Working mothers work 30-60 minutes longer daily now in the civil service now, they no longer have to work on Saturdays.....this is exactly what people have been asking the government to consider for a long time. You imply this is somehow unsatisfactory to the working mother who has to Â‘cope with her job and to mother her childrenÂ’ <strong>because of what</strong>Â…Â…Â…Â…Â….?? She canÂ’t prepare meals 30 to 60 minutes earlier? She will now have the entire day with her family thereby breaking her routine, and placing stress on having to spend (gasp!) one whole Saturday facing the kids? Just what exactly is the link? And what exactly does struggling Â“to make ends meet, and living on a family income of less than (not Â‘thenÂ’)$3000 per monthÂ” have to do with the subject of civil service working hours being tweaked slightly? Pray point out the logical link.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>If your figures are correct, it will certainly reflect Singapore's position is not to bad vis-a-vis the situation with the other countries.<br>Unfortunately, Singapore do not have the attributes that will help those mentioned countries - such as population and territorial size, industrial strength - which will give these countries a headstart in flexiblity of policies when dealing with their present unemployment problems.</blockquote>My figures are certainly accurate. You can do your own checks with respective government websites to confirm them yourself. Without bringing in more factors to complicate this issue, I donÂ’t see any Â‘headstart in policyÂ’ being made by other countries. Your claims are neither confirmed by economic figures nor economic reality.<br>And if I may correct your ignorance of economics or economic reality, population or territorial size are not the only (and definitely not the most important) determinants of unemployment rates, otherwise, big countries with big populations would all be economic superpowers now (think China, India, Russia, Indonesia). In fact, statistically, small countries with small populations are more likely to succeed according to <span style="font-style: italic;">The Economist </span>in its article Â‘Small But Perfectly Formed' in http://www.stanford.edu/~wacziarg/articles/economist/econart.html ). You also made a paradoxical statement- if countries with industrial strength give it a headstart in dealing with unemployment problems, why havenÂ’t they already done so eons ago? In cases like Germany or Australia, high unemployment rates have been an economic reality for many years compared to the past few years Singapore has experienced.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PART TWO</strong><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>The "feel good" propaganda, and play of numbers with statistics, does not hide the fact that there remains an unemployed number of 4.5% of KNOWN Singaporeans being unemployed.<br>This 4.5% is only a conservative number, and the real data is perhaps too politically sensitive and damagingÂ…</blockquote>You dismiss all official figures as Â‘propagandaÂ’, but the only propaganda I see is yours. If the Singaporean government wants to perpetuate propaganda, they have certainly done a horrific job. I wonder why high unemployment figures were revealed in the past years in the first place, and why the government repeatedly issues statements that reveal the bad state of the economy, the global challenges from 2001-2003 then? You display an ignorance of the economic concept of Â‘unemploymentÂ’. Of course, the government only includes numbers it knows, do you expect it to inflate numbers, or include things it doesnÂ’t know? Now <strong>that</strong> would be dishonest, besides being speculative. (Hahaha. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ) You may also want to check your grammar/sentence structure 'unemployed number of 4.5% of known...' What is an 'unemployed number'? Are you being deliberately meaningless?<br>And then you go on to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">qualify</span> your statement by adding Â‘and the real data is <strong>perhaps</strong> too politically sensitiveÂ…..Â’  suggesting you aren't really certain of what you are saying. What Â‘real dataÂ’ are you pointing to? Are you implying the government is doctoring figures? What evidence do you have this is not Â‘real dataÂ’?<br>ItÂ’s far too easy to dismiss numbers you donÂ’t agree with as Â‘propagandaÂ’ and resort to suggestions of deceit. I donÂ’t see you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">disagreeing</span> with government numbers in 2002 that pointed out the economy was dong badly and the unemployment rate was high! I donÂ’t see you insisting Â“the government is lying to us! The economy did well in 2002 actually!Â” Perhaps you should ask yourself why you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> accept government figures when they are bad numbers, but accuse the government of propaganda when the economy improves, and positive data is published.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>No one is disputing with the fact that with globalisation being the catch word for most countries to "integrate" at all tiers of economic activities, it will be the solution to the present Singapore sluggish economy.....even while they have embraced the liberal principles of 'Globalization'.<br></blockquote>You write a lot of meaningless drivel about Â‘liberal principles of globalizationÂ’ without actually saying anything, other than fill up space. What is so liberal about globalization? Do you even know what the political concept of Â‘liberalismÂ’ refers to philosophically?  The pertinent question to ask now is, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IS</span> the economy improving? Has it taken a turn for the better from the previous few years? The answers are evident.<br>I might also add that that we already established in previous posts (10 Sept 2004) as well as this post that the economy is improving with annual growth expected at 8-9% this year, and last quarterly growth at 11.9%. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You acknowledged </span>yourself (on 12 Sept 2004 2:33pm) that "<span style="font-style: italic;">Singapore's position is not to bad vis-a-vis the situation with the other countries</span>. " In your continuing post just <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1 MINUTE LATER </span>(2:34pm on the same day), Singapore has suddenly developed a 'sluggish economy'?!?!? Consistency would be good and much appreciated here! It'll be wise not to change facts, and viewpoints so quickly (in one minute too!) just to suit your own argument.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>While it is correct that where no skillful Singaporeans are available, a foreign worker will be and should be employed. Unfortunately, while it had been said that with each Single Qualified Foreign Worker being employed, there will be more then six local workers being employed too.</blockquote>Â…Â….what exactly is the point you are making here? Yes, more than six local workers will be employed for every one foreigner worker employed Â…in fact the exact figure is <strong>NINE</strong> as I pointed out earlier. So what is your disagreement? Trying to fill up more space?<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>This has nothing to do with semantic games, but we are discussing about Government Over-the-Counter Services staying open on a Saturday even when a 5-day work week is implemented; and how did you come to a conclusion that traffic will not get any worse, when there already exist a traffic problem even during a 6-day workweek ?</blockquote>I suggested that traffic congestion has always been bad on Saturdays (and Sundays and public holidays too!). I didnÂ’t say it will not get any worse (or any better for that matter). I merely stated explicitly that people will not refrain from running errands during lunch hour now and in the future. I also stated explicitly that many government services can be accessed online and face-to-face personal attention is not a common weekly occurrence. And traffic is always bad during working days, especially morning and evening rush hour, which is why the ERP is implemented only then. As for why people will not all be joining the queue to access government services on Saturdays, re-read my previous post.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>The reasons you gave are clear ?</blockquote>Yes, they are.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>If you have not perform any "SERIOUS" household chores, how can you be in any position to pass judgmental statements that allow you to understand how the demands that the working housewives have to face daily ?</blockquote>What are Â‘serious household choresÂ’? HahahahaÂ…laundry? Cooking? How does one differentiate the serious, from the non-serious? Why do you insist on sayingÂ’working housewivesÂ’ when I pointed out your error and suggested 'working mother', or 'working woman' A housewife by conventional lexical understanding does not work, she is a Â‘stay-at-homeÂ’ homemaker.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PART THREE</strong><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>The fact that it was necessary to perform your required services at the Government Service Counter, whatever the duration of time taken for your need to be completed, would already have resulted in you being added to whatever queu that exist, and the additonal workload on these Governent Workers attending to your need.</blockquote>Again, meaningless drivel. You state the obvious without saying anything. What government services do you need to perform frequently? You renew your passport personally every week? If you need a service personally, why should it be construed as Â‘additional workloadÂ’ to the civil servant? Trying hard to press a point without saying anything?<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Are we not continuing with our "discussion" concerning traffic congestion, or do you prefer to drop this issue.</blockquote>We are talking about traffic congestion. ThatÂ’s why taking the MRT reduces (1) traffic congestion besides (2) environmental pollution. Your (3) parking woes reinforce this.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Do you know that leaving my car at a Private Carpark will cost $4 for one hour in the Central Business District, MRT fares of at least $1.60 for a short distance two way round trip ?</blockquote>Take the MRT then (since (4)cheaper for you, especially when you claim you need 6 hours to renew passport!!)  4 disadvantages of driving ahve been pointed out based on what you said. You want to face parking problems and pay 6 x 4 ($24) or NO parking woes and pay $1.60/$3.20 (?) via MRT?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Whether Singapore is being on par or being ranked in whatever position in any international survey of "govt e-readiness" does not have any significant bearingÂ….</blockquote>Why not? You complain that Singaporean government websites are poorly designed, and hence imply inefficiency. I pointed out that this is invalidated by international surveys which rank SingaporeÂ’s government e-readiness highly. It has a direct bearing since I disproved your point using evidence from rigorous methodological studies.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>So are you now into a game of semantics, and avoid the real issues posed to you, or do you simply have no response other then to divert attention from the issues laid out, by starting a reply into another direction ?<br>Do you believe that collecting revenue from citizens should be a more significant component in the tax structure ?</blockquote>I think you are the one unable to comprehend direct answers. You claim that the government speaks with a Â‘fork(ed) tongueÂ’. I showed you where you read wrongly.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>If collecting revenue from the citizens is critical to the revenue collectionÂ….</blockquote>Another tautological statement?<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>So you want to enlarge this debate from revenue collection - personal tax (income or consumption tax) - to that of international trade as well ?</blockquote>The debate was not originally on revenue and tax collection, but an example used by me to (1) show that exports and trade are an important component of economic growth, and (2) bonuses and AWS are not directly dependent on revenue collection, but economic growth in general.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Are you gullible enough to believe that Singapore has "the world's highest per capita international trade dependency" - making it 2.5 times the country's GDP ?</blockquote>ItÂ’s not gullibility. This is an economic fact acknowledged by academics, economists, and international institutions and governments. It is also used in international economic reseach, and is the subject of many academic articles and texts. High trade dependency can be a good or bad thing (and is not necessarily a good thing as you suggest). One negative aspect: one is more influenced/affected by global economic cycles and swings than other less foreign trade dependent countries. See for example this description from the American Association for Advancement of Science, a non-profit organization:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Trade dependency<br>The extent to which countries are dependent on international trade depends on many factors, including population and natural resources. Small, rich countries with few natural resources....are generally the most dependent on trade. Thus the top ten countries for whom trade represents the highest proportion of GDP include Singapore (top at 93 percent)Â…Â…..</span><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Is our industrial output anywhere near that of Hongkong, Taiwan or Korea (forget Japan) ?</blockquote>I used the term <span style="text-decoration: underline;">per capita </span>trade dependency in my previous post. Overall trade volume numbers are not higher than Japan for example. But divide it by population (hence the term Â‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">per capitaÂ’</span>) and it is the worldÂ’s highest.<br><br>Clarity, precision, refraining from meaningless drivel to fill up space, and factual evidence will aid and substantiate your responses.

This is an economic fact acknowledged by academics, economists, and international institutions and governments. It is also used in international economic reseach, and is the subject of many academic articles and texts. High trade dependency can be a good or bad thing (and is not necessarily a good thing as you suggest).

(1) You made an error of suggesting that getting Saturdays off is equivalent to working fewer hours for more money. (2) You direct it to LHL and use it as a fulcrum to serve up more sarcasm suggesting it was Â‘clevernessÂ’ on his part. (3) You certainly responded to my remarks, BUT nowhere in all the posts did you <strong>explicitly acknowledge </strong>you made an error, by admitting and expressing recognition that getting Saturday off is NOT Â“giving themselves a 5-Day work week to enjoy the extra 10% wages.Â”<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>In your continued haste to dribble up all that is emitted from LHL, will you be so gullible to take in every single word from him with mindless efficiency ?<br>Western Government and societies and companies worked far less hours than the 44 hour week practised by the Singapore Government.<br>Even in the Private Sector in Singapore, some Companies that follow a 5-day week do not insist on a 44 hour week, and even go a step further by allowing their Employees flexi-working hours.</blockquote>You serve up another conspiracy theory- the government is up to no good in tweaking working hours, even though this has been welcomed anecdotally. If it had been working longer for lesser pay, or working more hours with no extra pay, there may have been cause for complaint. I am amazed you think the government acceding to the requests of new civil service recruits <strong>IS NOT</strong> a thing to be applauded, but a thing to find fault with. You appear obstinately ready to press on with the belief that civil servants, and the encouraging of private companies to implement a five-day work week is horrendous, and indeed, a conspiracy by the government. What is your agenda here?<br>Notice I used Â‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">working daysÂ’</span>, not Â‘working hoursÂ’. I am well aware that Singapore, and indeed, the rest of Asia as well as the US clock in more hours than Europe , with Denmark holding the record for lowest hours per worker at 34.  This has (1) caused many companies to threaten to move abroad (with some already having done so, and not just to China and India) to take advantage of more competitive conditions (2) prompted reviews by the EU to overhaul its labour conditions so as to be able to stay in the game against its competitors like the US. Reality boy, not fantasy.<br>Nowhere in the post have I suggested that the private sector all clock in 44 hours or more. That is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your </span>assertion, not mine. While stay-at home-work, or flexi-hours is indeed laudable, it is ultimately the prerogative of the private company or civil service where implementation is concerned.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Excuse me, what formal setting did you mention earlier ?<br>Or are you referring to the 'formal setting' that LHL had conducted his "research" ?<br>When did you decide that you can fit his shoes ?<br>Will Civil Servants dare to complain ?</blockquote>This is the formal setting I referred to in the very same wordsÂ…. <span style="font-style: italic;">Â“my research/work carried out in a formal setting over the last three yearsÂ”.</span><br>Again, a similar question should be posed to you: When did you reach the conclusion I was aspiring to fill LHLÂ’s shoes, or anyoneÂ’s shoes for that matter?<br>What do civil servants have to complain about? Getting the Saturday off? Having the entire weekend to themselves? Why is it so difficult for you to accept that many welcome a 5-day week, and not having to work on Saturdays?<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>The housewives are those who are married to close friends, associates, social contacts, whom I have had the privileged of communicating and listening to some of their views on social, economic and political affairs that affect their domestic life.</blockquote>How are housewives personally affected since they are homemakers and do not work? Why would they complain that their family time with husbands and kids on weekends has increased? Are the aghast their husbands will no longer have their mornings at the office? What grouses did they Â‘communicateÂ’ to you?<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Now you are digressing with your exaggeration in your preffered direction of argument that do not address the points that I have made.<br>Were "kids" the issue of my last post, or did I mention the fact that the Housewife will finish off 30 to 60 minutes later each day, that will affect her household chores of preparing meals and doing the laundry ?</blockquote>All <span style="text-decoration: underline;">emotive</span> issues were brought up by you, not me. If anyone should be accused of muddying the waters, digressing with other issues, making irrelevant statements to take the focus away with the original subject, itÂ’s certainly not me.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>In either case, it will be near impossible for you to appreciate the problems experienced by the average working housewife, who is from the HDB heartland.</blockquote>You insist on speculating on my marital status which really serves no function other than contribute more irrelevant words to this space.<br>Again, it is digressing from the subject at hand. What do the demands and problems of a Â‘working housewifeÂ’ have to do with the civil service tweaking working days? Again, it shows a lot of your inability to acknowledge errors by insisting on Â‘working housewife.Â’ Despite the evident oxymoron (a Â‘housewifeÂ’ does not work in a fulltime career) you are unable to accept erroneous remarks on your part, even though these have been pointed out to you repeatedly.

But what are the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unemployment rates </span>in those countries? What is the point of rehashing economic clichÃ©s about India and China when no one is disagreeing about the size of their foreign reserves.

Is Australia having any problems in resolving her unemployment issue, or is its economy performing so well that the Australian Currency has increased in value over the Singapore Currency by more then 30 Percent from 2002 to 2004 ?</blockquote>GermanyÂ’s problems are not solely due to reunification. Your ignorance, simplicity and naivety in pinning German economic malaise to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">primarily</span> one factor is amusing to say the least. Problems include low private investment, inability to balance the budget, the reluctance of Germans to spend, high welfare payments, ageing population, restrictive labour conditions that inhibits productivity, high taxation practices that discourage business among others. ItÂ’s very weary pointing out such naivety and ignorance, and especially when you make yourself out to be an economic czar finding fault with fact.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>As for Australia, its currency has indeed increased its value by 30% from 2002-2003 measured against the <strong>Trade Weighted Index</strong>, not against the Singaporean or US dollar.  Currency value can also be manipulated through pegging or central bank interventions (think China, Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong). Some countries want their currencies to remain pegged to maintain exports (China), some do not want currency volatility (Malaysia).

(But of course I have already pointed out your economic ignorance in my remarks about the strength of the Australian currency).<br>I can only say that while the Asian financial crisis did affect Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and indeed other parts of the word, they did NOT suffer a meltdown, unlike the four most directly involved- Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea, Indonesia. Indeed Singapore clocked in 5.4% in 1999, and 9.9% in 2000. It was the global (from the US, Japan and EU) economic downturn that hit the economy, not the Asian crisis per se that put economic growth at minus 2.1% in 2001. Ignorance again. Bleh! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>Accusing me of deceit and arrogance is easy and convenient enough to disguise your ignorance, but it is a glaring fact, you made no attempt to point out directly and explicity, WHAT exactly the deceit is.

I didnÂ’t say it will not get any worse (or any better for that matter).Â”</span><br><br><strong>YOU</strong> are the one insisting congestion will worsen on Saturdays on <strong>TWO PREVIOUS OCCASIONS</strong>:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“You will be lucky if those will not be further increased, and meanwhile they must stay due to the fact that some Government Over-the-Counter Services will stay open on Saturdays - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">leading to heavier traffic flow </span>when nearly everyone will adopt a 5-Day workweek.Â” (7 September 2004 3:30pm)</span> and<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“Â….how did you come to a conclusion that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">traffic will not get any worse</span>, when there already exist a traffic problem even during a 6-day workweek ?Â” (</span>12 September 2004 12:34pm)<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>A psychological condition in desparately being right ?</blockquote>No, just consistency, and delighting in showing to all readers following these posts closely your ignorance over economic fact and your attempts to disorientate others with your illogical rambling.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Again you do not wish to give any reasons for such an assumptionÂ…..If you have not perform any "SERIOUS" household chores, how can you be in any position to pass judgmental statements that allow you to understand how the demands that the working housewives have to face daily ?</blockquote>Again I ask you: What are Â‘serious household choresÂ’? HahahahaÂ…laundry? Cooking? How does one differentiate the serious, from the non-serious? Why do you insist on sayingÂ’working housewivesÂ’ when I pointed out your error and suggested 'working mother', or 'working woman' A housewife by conventional lexical understanding does not work, she is a Â‘stay-at-homeÂ’ homemaker. (see dictionary meanings provided for your reference in the above post).<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>The term "working housewives" is not an outdated term, that is now less heard - with modern preference to 'working mother' or 'working woman' - which do not necessarily give a fuller meaning to the tasks that a 'housewife' does at home, and still having to work as an employee to some enterprise.</blockquote>You need to get over corrections to your vocabulary and learn the correct usage of words. See two dictionary meanings provided for your reference.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>If you only consider your worthless self without any need of Government's service, at least have the consideration that there is a larger number in a population of 4.5 million Singaporeans, who will need to perform a variety of tasks at the various Government and Statutory Boards Counters.<br>Since your limited capacity only can view Passport service, let us keep it simple to overcome your inadequacies.</blockquote>Ouch (again)! More insultsÂ…Â…Hahaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  I donÂ’t know which is more <strong>tragic-comic</strong> to describe youÂ….you needing 6 hours and paying $24 to park in order to renew a passport, or you refusing to acknowledge easy solutions, and cheaper alternatives after I pointed them out.<br>I didnÂ’t mention this in all my previous posts, you can get instant photos at a booth the next timeÂ…no need to go to Kodak counters TWICE and pay MORE THAN $11. Hahahaha!<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>What if you still have the capacity to take a holistic view of all services that are provided by the Government, Statutory Boards, and Essential Services Units, that will need different Singaporeans to travel to different destinations, and with some significant percentage moving cross-Island to be served at the Service Counter, will this also not cause a heavier traffic congestion ?</blockquote>What exactly are the personal face-to-face services that an ordinary individual needs so frequently? What are these chaotic tasks which will cause massive traffic congestion when a five-day week is implemented? LetÂ’s start with you raising a few examples from your personal experiences the last 1-2 months.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>The economic viability of taking the MRT versus driving oneself with a car will require the better part of a separate thread.</blockquote>4 disadvantages were pointed out to you in my post on 12 September 2004:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"ThatÂ’s why taking the MRT reduces (1) traffic congestion besides (2) environmental pollution. Your (3) parking woes reinforce thisÂ…Â…. Take the MRT then (since (4)cheaper for you, especially when you claim you need 6 hours to renew passport!!)"</span><br><br>You didnÂ’t address why you chose to drive when a cheaper and more convenient alternative is available. Merely suggesting a separate thread is required is really avoiding a simple question posed to you.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote> Is this not similar to a situation of "the Chicken and Egg, which comes first" ?</blockquote>My reply on 12 September 2004 was<br><span style="font-style: italic;"> Â“the debate was not originally on revenue and tax collection, but an example used by me to (1) show that exports and trade are an important component of economic growth, and (2) bonuses and AWS are not directly dependent on revenue collection, but economic growth in general.Â” </span><br><br>No, it merely clarifies things for you since you require help in so many areas : not just familiarity with economic facts, but also vocabulary (think Â‘housewifeÂ’), and semantics (think tautology from you like Â“collecting revenue from the citizens is critical to the revenue collection.Â”)<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>The principle behind "Trade Dependency" is but stating of the obvious - (as in most academic works) Â…..  Is there any economic value to this discussion?</blockquote>Yes, there is. It serves to correct you (yet again) on the economic concept of Â‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">per capita international trade dependencyÂ’</span>, and educate you on the difference between overall industrial output numbers and Â‘per capita international trade dependency.Â’<br><br></div>
