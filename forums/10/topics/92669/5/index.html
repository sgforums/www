I promise you I <strong>WILL</strong> make an effort <strong>NOW</strong> to patronize you- you must have sacrificed the few brain cells left, and your precious meal time to produce such long and tedious literary waste. I must <strong>NOT</strong> disappoint, and grant you the courtesy of a <strong>longer</strong> response this time. For one who tries to portray himself as reasonable and calm, you certainly lost that disposition in your desperate attempts to crawl to the top of the dung-heap. Be my guest, others are only too happy for you to occupy that spot alone (and for as long as you want too!) HeheheÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I can see my responses, however benign, didnÂ’t go down well with you. ThatÂ’s probably an understatement since this latest response from you only produced more insensible and obtuse verbatim. More repetitive, tedious, garbage from that foul gap of yours? Same old words, same old Â“I-am-so-pissedÂ” attitude (Hahahaha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>I always have time for a spot of laughter when engaging a <strong>dullard</strong>. All that anger, all those frustrationsÂ…Â…..and all for what? To soothe your low self-esteem temporarily? To continue to delude yourself that you are actually intellectually competent? Come on, give yourself a break nowÂ…Â….you can copy my vocabulary, you can imitate my style of writingÂ….but you canÂ’t transform yourself from a <strong>pudding-head</strong> to something better- no matter how Â“superiorÂ” you pretend to be.<br><br>But really, are you totally oblivious to the silly hokum you produce here? Those long, meandering posts that go nowhere but demonstrate your resentment and uncouth upbringing? You are already disappointed with your present circumstance, why aggravate it further? For you, restraint, decorum and moderation are probably signs of weakness. I beg to differ of course. You pour scorn on those who offer differing views and yet you do not possess the intellectual capacity to back up yours. You display the kind of character defect that invites contempt if not bemusement. Your loud, agitated Â“anti-everythingÂ” rhetoric is just a thin disguise for the frustrations you feel. Admittedly, I do have some pity for you- but what can one do? Accept you are just a nobody, and an ignorant one at that, thatÂ’s all. You see yourself as an Â“ordinary citizenÂ” fighting for the common cause?  Keep thinking that way- maybe you will gain someoneÂ’s sympathy one day. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>And ohÂ… whatÂ’s this drivel about Kumar and your silly taunts about sexuality? HahahahaÂ…. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> how low do you intend to go, old boy? Take my adviceÂ…you have already lost your credibility and demonstrated your ignoranceÂ…Â…..save some grace for yourself before you truly reduce your Â‘personaÂ’ here into the ultimate joke of SgForums. (And donÂ’t try to pin the blame on me when that happens! Hehe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  )<br><br>LetÂ’s see what bits of garbage I will grant you the honour of a response here.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>If my response was not substantive, I wonder why you even bother to carry on with this exercise through so many days, except for the sheer vanity of public adulation and recognition ?</blockquote>You are an exceptional dullard. ItÂ’s so hard to find a person who is so deluded and delightfully spiteful (Hehe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ). Like I said, your ignorance provides laughter and I can certainly afford the 30-minutes daily. But the question can also be asked of you: What do you gain from writing such long tedious insults? How many hours did you take to type all that drivel between Â‘writing and workingÂ’?  Come on, donÂ’t fool yourself- you keep imagining I enjoy public adulation and recognition. Those <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ARE</span> exactly what you crave for but never received <span style="font-style: italic;">EH</span>? You can have it all- in your deluded, anxious mind, itÂ’s probably a panacea for your pitiful condition. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>To describe you as being Â‘queerÂ’ will be ironic to your status reflected in your determined display of high standard of English usage, and yet your preferred usage of endearment will probably confirm the correctness of this term applied</blockquote>HahahaÂ….you really are catty arenÂ’t you? While I am aware of your crude nature judging from your coarse and distasteful responses in this and other threads, it never occurred to me you would stoop this low. If you canÂ’t act like a real man (even when agitated), why donÂ’t you just tie your hair with red ribbons, wear a dress and be done with it? What a N***Y (Hehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>In your anxiety to flip me and pin me down, you seem to be unable to discern the significance of the Â‘old addressÂ’ given, which clearly shows that I am an infrequent visitor to the Â‘Boom Boom RoomÂ’, and do not even know of its existence since the closure of its premises at Bugis Â– ( back in the 1980s ?</blockquote>The problem with the Â‘old addressÂ’ is that Boom Boom Room was ORIGINALLY located at <strong>Bugis STREET</strong>, <strong>NOT</strong> Bugis Junction. Ho ho hoÂ…Â…..it is unnecessary to tell me if you used to be a regular there. I have no problems with your patronage there, neither do I discriminate against people of different sexual inclinations. Of course, I donÂ’t expect you to display a tolerant and enlightened attitude towards this, seeing how persistent you try to crack jokes about it. Tsk tskÂ…some people are not only uneducated where economics and languages are concerned, they also lack the qualities one desires in a grown adult.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>You need not have taken the trouble to look up for its present address unless you are particularly inclined towards Kumar, and to share your terms of endearment with him and his pals ?</blockquote>Dear meÂ…Â…I see you canÂ’t get over it. You have something against Kumar donÂ’t you? Or are you just prejudiced against people who perform in cabaret shows? Grow up a bit wonÂ’t you dearest Atobe? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Unfortunately, I am not too inclined towards terms of superfluous endearment of the highest degree Â– dear perhaps may slip through, but Â‘DEARESTÂ’ ???</blockquote>DonÂ’t you like that affectionate salutation? Beats being a <strong>spiteful nitwit </strong>doesnÂ’t it?<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Whether you are a female, or someone belonging from the in-between-world of the Twilight Zone, it does not matter to me. Those that are of any interest to me will probably be more palatable and sensuous in intellect and feminity than you can ever hope to be</blockquote>Here we go againÂ…Â….you really are obsessed with transvestites arenÂ’t you? Get over it old boy (Hahahaha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) I must have hit a nerve or something, or threatened your masculinity. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

Anything that is <strong>more than ONE</strong> but remains an infinitely small number <strong>IS</strong> acceptable according to the dictionary meaning I provided for your reference. Are you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRYING VERY HARD </span>to dismiss dictionary meanings, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRYING VERY HARD</span> to save some Â‘faceÂ’ after I pointed out your ignorance of the word Â‘fewÂ’.

If you need to refresh your memory, simply scroll back to relevant posts. The excerpts are all dated.<br><br><strong>ONE- CIVIL SERVICE WORKING HOURS</strong><br>What do you have to say about the reforms being carried out in the European Union now where working hours are concerned? What do the events there tell you? What is it about the new civil service hours you find so objectionable?<br><br>Atobe writes:<br><blockquote>Western Government and societies and companies worked far less hours than the 44 hour week practised by the Singapore Government.<br>Even in the Private Sector in Singapore, some Companies that follow a 5-day week do not insist on a 44 hour week, and even go a step further by allowing their Employees flexi-working hours. (13 Sept 2004)<br>What is the big deal of this ..... "time to turn this stone over also" .... that merely allow him to exercise his "new" muscle as a new PM ?<br>All the fanfare and hullabaloo for merely changing the working arrangement of a Government that remained stubbornly to a 6-day week since independence ?<br>Does this change reflect a super-human effort on LHL's part to lift such a heavy stone and have it turned over ? (16 Sept 2004)</blockquote>TidalWave333 writes<br><blockquote>I have already addressed why shortening work hours is NOT the way to go in previous posts. I have also quoted examples from the West, esp. the EU where extending working hours is crucial to maintaining competitiveness. They are learning too late that the economy is losing out- badly. These are not offhand remarks on my part, but reality. Under European Union rules, 48 working hours is the maximum legal limit, and controversy over a new act to change this is NOT because workers want to work shorter hours, but because they are PREVENTED FROM WORKING LONGER if they wish to. (See http://www.euobserver.com/?sid=19&amp;aid=17276). Your attempt to portray the government as being out-of-sync with labour reforms elsewhere is ignorant to say the least.<br>More importantly, the move is not even about shortening work hours, it is about giving families more weekend time without sacrificing national competitiveness. This is NOT simply government propaganda (you wouldnÂ’t want hundred of thousands of jobs to be lost from Singapore to others, would you?), but striking a balance between family and career? Unless you are obtuse, which person wouldnÂ’t welcome having an entire Saturday off, by working 30-60 mins more per weekday? 9 hours Mon-Fri (45 hours) OR 8 hours Mon-Fri (40 hours) and 5 hours on Sat? No doubt workaholics may despair, but the majority will not. (16 September)</blockquote>Perhaps you will also find this recent <span style="font-style: italic;">International Herald Tribune </span>article on 23 September 2004 useful:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">BRUSSELS The European Commission proposed on Wednesday to water down the rules that govern maximum working hours for employees, bowing to pressure from business and from Eastern European members of the EU seeking to catch up with their richer western neighbors.<br>.<br>Five of the eight countries that pushed the commission to relax the restrictions were new European Union members afraid that too-tight limits on working hour would hurt competitiveness, and with it, their chances to catch up with their richer western neighbors.<br><br>The working time directive, as it is known, limits most employees who work on a shift to an average workweek of 48 hours including overtime. This is among the most restrictive working time laws in the world. The United States, by comparison, has no federal limit on working time. Europe's law does not apply to managers or "other persons with autonomous decision-taking powers." To make the law more flexible, the commission would allow employers to measure the average workweek over a period of 12 months, instead of the current four-month reference period. </span><br><br>(For full story, see url  http://www.iht.com/articles/540151.html)<br><br>LetÂ’s hear your comments.<br><br><strong>TWO- UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE Â“HEADSTARTÂ” OTHERS ENJOY</strong><br><br>What does the unemployment situation in India and China tell you? How do these countries with a larger industrial base and bigger market have a HEADSTART (as you claimed) in resolving unemployment issues compared to Singapore?<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>If the population size of India or China is ten times bigger then Singapore, will not the percentage of unemployment become even more significantly larger, without necessarily to be in the same proportion. Yes, restructuring is affecting the entire world economies, but countries with a larger industrial base that has access to a larger natural and captive market of consumers formed by their larger population numbers Â– will eventually offer themselves a better than even chance of success, when compared to the acknowledged natural limitations that are quite unique to smaller countries like Singapore. (16 Sept 2004)</blockquote>TidalWave333 writes<br><blockquote>Yes, yes, yes to all that digressive drivel. But what are the unemployment rates in those countries? What is the point of rehashing economic clichÃ©s about India and China when no one is disagreeing about the size of their foreign reserves. The pertinent subject here is unemployment rates.(Answer: latest annual 2003 figures China 10% urban unemployment where ironically most jobs are; India:9.1%) Is Singapore not, and indeed the rest of the world, restructuring and taking note of the challenges posed by the two countries? For example the American government highlighting the outsourcing problem, the Japanese government fretting over its domestic industries moving to China etc.<br>It doesnÂ’t mean the larger the population, the percentage will become Â‘significantly largerÂ’. (Think USA or UK). What percentages tell us is the ratio of the unemployed compared to the employed in a country.<br>YOU are the one who said territorial and population size are advantages in Â‘flexibility of policyÂ’.<br>YOU are the one who brought up the examples of China and India. Unfortunately, we have neither seen examples of how territorial and population sizes have demonstrated this Â‘flexibilityÂ’ from concrete evidence, nor have your economic cliches of China and India said anything more about them curbing high unemployment rates.

You canÂ’t be referring to the territorial size of Switzerland of course, and the population size of Switzerland is almost twice that of SingaporeÂ’s at 7.4 million. But your ignorance still shows in many ways.<br><br>(a)Switzerland has few natural resources like Singapore (unless one counts timber). It is also landlocked with no natural harbour or a strategic geographical position unlike Singapore. Referring to SingaporeÂ’s Â‘natural limited characteristicsÂ’ and then using Switzerland as a basis of contrast is telling. Like Singapore, Switzerland did not allow itself to be Â‘limitedÂ’ by its lack of Â‘natural characteristicsÂ’ (Your choice of words is amusing!) Â– instead it sought to leverage on its financial and manufacturing capabilities. Similarly, Singapore has not allowed itself to be limited by its lack of natural resources, or land size, but has developed its capacities in other areas. Its success over three decades is evident.<br><br>(b)SwiterlandÂ’s Â‘accessÂ’ to the European community is underpinned by the FTA of 1972, and another seven agreements in 1980. Following your logic that success is guaranteed by market access and FTAs, we must then conclude that Singapore with its many FTAs with US, Japan , Australia, NZ, Chile etc etc, EFTA (wtih Switzerland Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein) and its membership in the ASEAN Free Trade Area with 500 million people will perform the same miracle for us. How does that make Singapore and Switzerland different from your simplistic logic then?

He has ignored my response to that assertion and remained silent as usual.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>While the values of currencies maybe measured against Trade Weighted Index, it nevertheless showed up the weakness of Singapore's position in our own Singapore Dollar weakening so rapidly, when the Australia's Dollar managed to climb in value during the same period from 2002-2003.<br>Leaving aside those countries who do not wish to have their currencies exposed to the volatality of market forces, and prefer to pegged it at a fixed rate to other stronger currencies, it already is available and serves as a good indicator of economic performance. (16 Sept 2004)</blockquote>TidalWave333 writes<br><blockquote>No explicit admission of error that you were wrong in stating that the AUD currency rose 30% against the SGD. Just Â‘acknowledgementÂ’ again? (hahaha!  )<br>The SGD is traded between a narrow undisclosed band and managed against a basket of other currencies. It will not appreciate to its true market value (since internationally it is considered undervalued like the Chinese yuan or Malaysian ringgit- see EIC reports for e.g) because that will make our exports too expensive. So the SGD did not Â“weaken so rapidlyÂ” (unlike the Thai baht or Indonesian ruppiah) in the past, neither will it strengthen rapidly in the future. Currency values are of course affected by forex speculations, which is why central banks of various countries spend millions (in the case of JapanÂ’s Central Bank) to keep it within their desired range. Many countries, especially in Asia prefer their currencies remain Â‘competitiveÂ’ compared to the USD in fact. It is NOT a real or true indicator of economic performance. Get it? (16 Sept 2004)</blockquote><strong>FIVE-ORIGINS OF SINGAPOREÂ’S ECONOMIC SLUMP FROM 2001-2002</strong><br>You have also not said anything about the origins of SingaporeÂ’s economic slump, after mistakening the Asian financial crisis as the main agent (despite statistics to the contrary.) You have refused to challenge my figures, or provide any alternative evidence, choosing instead to explode into another barrage of insults. Time now that you offer your perspective.<br><br>TidalWave333 writes<br><blockquote>I can only say that while the Asian financial crisis did affect Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and indeed other parts of the word, they did NOT suffer a meltdown, unlike the four most directly involved- Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea, Indonesia. Indeed Singapore clocked in 5.4% in 1999, and 9.9% in 2000. It was the global (from the US, Japan and EU) economic downturn that hit the economy, not the Asian crisis per se that put economic growth at minus 2.1% in 2001. (13 Sept 2004)</blockquote>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>The recommendations from the 1987 ERC was never fully implemented, and the economy had recovered by its own natural cyclic evolutions, with a moderate push from the Singapore Government by tweaking the CPF and Wage Rates - that were soon restored to its full 40% rate for CPF, and NWC of 8% increases.<br>Having ignored the careful studied proposals by the 1987 ERC, the status quo in conducting affairs continued until the Financial Crisis of 1997 crashed onto us, even when the signs were already warning us that the continued methods cannnot "sustain or protect us through another storm. (13 September 2004)</blockquote>TidalWave333 writes<br><blockquote>Woah!!!! You had the great foresight to predict the Asian financial crisis TEN TEARS BEFORE it actually happenedÂ…all without any statistics too! Just making links from one proposal to another and finally drawing Â“logicalÂ” conclusions. Do us a favour, join the MAS or become a temple medium. (hehe  ) You really have no shame portraying yourself as an economic czar (despite your evident limitations), better than the economists, analysts and government officials from around the world put together, don't you?<br>So, on 13 September, the "Financial Crisis of 1997 crashed onto us" but hold on(!) today (16 September) you say Â“Singapore had withstood the pressures of the currency crisis in this Asian Financial debacleÂ”???<br>Another example of your well-documented mode of inconsistency?? Shifting subtle but important perspectives from post-to-post?<br>Make up your mind as to whether the crisis affected Singapore directly or not!!  Otherwise, itÂ’s very difficult to conduct a rational and logical discussion. (16 Sept 2004)</blockquote><strong>SIX- "LIBERAL" GLOBALIZATION</strong><br>So tell us, where did you read about Â“LIBERAL" GLOBALIZATION? Is this your new invention in the discipline of political science, or do you know something other political scientists donÂ’t? And donÂ’t try to digress by resorting to insults again.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Are my views too jarring for your senses that seems only able to hear the directions of your mentors only ? Surely, you are not serious in wanting to know more of my views about this subject about "liberal globalizationÂ” Surely, the next few volumes of exchanges will not be tiresome for you, as you have already stated your preference in avoiding such matters in recent preceding replies ?<br>Perhaps, you should ask your "mentors" the same questions, as they seem to be ardent supporters of a more liberal trade environment based on a global grid.   (16 Sept 2004)</blockquote>TidalWave333 writes<br><blockquote>There is no such label as Â‘liberal globalizationÂ’. Anyone who is versed in the discipline of globalization, Third Wave politics or S. Huntington will tell you that. Ignorant as usual (16 Sept 2004)</blockquote>Waiting for your responses Atobe Dearest.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Give us sensible, meaningful ones (if you are competent).<br><br></div>
