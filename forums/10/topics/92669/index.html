            <div class='col-md body'>This is an amusing post too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Great news, after restoring the 10% cut to the wages of Ministers and most Civil Servants, they are now giving themselves a 5-Day work week to enjoy the extra 10% wages. </blockquote>The 5-day work week is to increase family time as everyone well knows. The official number of working hours remains at 44. This means that even though most civil servants will no longer work on Saturdays, they will have to work slightly longer on weekdays to make up for not having to work on Saturdays.  Hence no one is enjoying 10% more wages while working shorter hours.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remains at 4%, and is expected to remain at this level throughout 2005 and beyond. </blockquote>The global economic situation has been rather volatile in the past few years, the Asian Financial Crisis not witstanding. One can continue to blame the government, but really, some things are really beyond anyone's control esp when Singapore is highly dependent on global trade, and exposed to global economic cycles. Still, the unemployment figure has decreased over the past two years hasn't it? From a high of 5.5% in September 2003 to 4.5% now in Sept 2004. You may also wish to compare unemployment rates of other developed and trade dependent economies currently to have some basis for comparison: Germany at 10.7%, USA at 6.3%, Indonesia at 10.5%, Malaysia at 3.4%, Hong Kong at 7.9%, UK at 5.1%. (All figures from CIA World Factbook 2004) I don't think Singapore is doing too badly, especially when the rate <strong>IS</strong> showing signs of decline year-by-year.<br><br>And economic growth is anticipated to reach a high of 8-9% for 2004, making it Asia's 2nd best economy after China. Last quarter's growth was 11.9% too as reported widely in international media. Of course, it will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">take time</span> for these improvements to flow down and be felt by the general populace: better wages, increased consumer confidence, more job security etc.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>You will be lucky if those will not be further increased, and meanwhile they must stay due to the fact that some Government Over-the-Counter Services will stay open on Saturdays - leading to heavier traffic flow when nearly everyone will adopt a 5-Day workweek. </blockquote>Traffic congestion has always been heavy on Saturdays, (and Sundays and public holidays too!) but <strong>not</strong> for the reasons you stated- shopping, family-related recreational activities. I am not sure if having a day off means MORE people are going to rush down to queue up at govt counters instead of using the time for social and family activities. Why can't they continue to see to them during lunch hour if there is a real need for personal attention at govt buildings? Besides, with electronic online services, many things can be done in the comfort of one's home.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Whatever charges that have been increased will stay in place, as revenue must continue to be collected to pay for the 10% restoration of previously cut wages; as well as for the expected payment of 13 month pay at the end of 2004, and wage increase in a flexi-wage system for the Civil Service</blockquote>AWS/13th month bonuses are not directly dependent on revenue collected (hahahaha!) Bonuses are dependent on economic growth annually, while AWS is guaranteed. Perhaps you dont work for the civil service- just ask your civil servant friends.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> So even if the tax department collects more income tax this year, it doesnt mean that income tax officers are going to get a bigger bonus end 2004, or that it will be shared among civil servants from other ministries. (hahahaha!)<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Count yourself lucky that you will have an extra day for fishing, if your time is not taken up by Reservist Recall Service. </blockquote>I don't know about you, but most male citizens get called up 1-2 times a year, not most weekends.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

The government is merely keeping in line with private sector practices.<br><br>I did not state that having a five-day work week will "foster better family ties" or improve familial relationships. That's your idea, not mine.<br><br>I did say that it will 'increase family time' simply because working parents do not have to be at the office on Saturdays. It is hoped that spending more time with kids and having more opportunities to interact with them will strike a balance between career and family.<br><br>For childless couples, the govt is crossing its fingers that having regular and entire weekends to themselves may produce babies.<br><br>The idea is that the govt has taken the first step- how families bond (if at all), or if more babies are produced is entirely up to the individuals. You have already made your stand clear- you do not believe it will happen. Perhaps it will not happen for you and your family, but let's leave it to other families to decide for themselves. Many acquaintances (esp. those with families) I know are in fact <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very happy </span>with the change. It is something they have wished for, for a long time. I don't see how it's 'wayang' since it's a concrete step. Perhaps you have your own frustrations and anger with the govt or some govt policy, and are looking for some issue to vent your anger on?<br><br>Pay adjustments (up as Atobe claims, or down as Scorps claims- everyone has different ideas!) are simply a matter of maintaining competitiveness, and ensuring companies do not ship out. It's better to have a slight pay cut, than to lose your job isn't it? The European Union in fact is waking up to this fact although their method (increase working hours with no increase in pay) is different. They realise now that if job flexibility isn't there, companies will simply move to another country where people are willing to work longer hours for lesser pay. It has already happened in Europe, with jobs not moving to just China or India, but Hungary, the rising manufacturing star of Europe. That's the harsh reality everyone, incuding you, has to accept.</div>

But I do not see you acknowledging your error. For many, they are quite happy that rearranging their work schedules gives them a whole day off. Many are happy to work 30-60 mins more each weekday, instead of coming back on Saturdays. Or put in another way, people would be happy to work 9 hours from Mon-Fri (45 hours in all), than work say 40 hours from Mon-Fri, and 3 hours on Sat, 2 hours on Sun. Common sense isn't it?<br><br>atobe writes<br><blockquote>Is it beneficial at all ?<br>The working housewives will end up getting home later to prepare the meals for the family, staying up later to finish the household chores - ironing and laundering, which if not done during the weekdays, will end up as a huge pile that will have to be cleared during the weekend.<br>Is this the way to spend the extra day of the week 'WITH THE FAMILY' ? </blockquote>It's certainly beneficial <strong>and </strong>welcomed by many, especally those with families, and those who would prefer to have the full weekend off. Working mothers (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> housewives) may return home an hour late, but I really do not think it's a big deal (unless you insist on kicking up a fuss of course). It merely means meal schedules have to be rearranged. It's one hour we are talking about, not 5 or 6. Your exaggeration of a one hour delay resulting in "<span style="font-style: italic;">staying up later to finish the household chores - ironing and laundering, which if not done during the weekdays, will end up as a huge pile</span>" is amusing to say the least. It appears you are trying too hard to press a point.

In <strong>all</strong> instances, they have not fallen or gone up by 1% in the latest <span style="text-decoration: underline;">quarter</span>.

To be really picky (since you prefer precision), 2003's growth rate was 1.1% (above official forecasts of 0.8%). I do concede that growth from a low base does make the figure appear more spectacular.

Statistically, 9 out of 10 new jobs go to Singaporeans. (I suppose you are thinking of the NTU dons and their clash with MOM.)  Open borders is a reality that everyone must accept, ultimately, it is not the nationality that counts, but the skills that one has to offer. It is a bitter pill that many (including I) find hard to swallow. Would you employ a Singaporean by virtue of his nationality (or even race, gender etc), even though he does not possess the skills to perform, rather than a foreigner who is competent and trained? It's common sense isn't it? Many foreigners who take up professional jobs do so because there are simply inadequate numbers of Singaporeans trained for it (e.g R&amp;D in biomeds and pharmaceuticals). They are <strong>NOT</strong> 'freely admitted' to become PRs, but come into three different pass categories as I am sure you already know. I do understand your concern however that many foreigners excel in our local universities, esp math science and engineering, and the number of immigrants here have caused social tension (assimilation, worries about job securities). But the alternative of not having skilled people to support and propel the economy forward is even scarier, esp when one thinks of the future.

Honestly, you don't think that an extra full Saturday off is spent doing household chores? Working mothers will reschedule their time to complete chores since they are working just up to one hour longer daily on weekdays, not five.  Those with maids have no worries.  Housewives have no worries. I am sure even you realise your paranoia that people coming home an hour later will result in havoc at home is a sheer exaggeration to say the least. Perhaps havoc will occur if mothers need to work past midnight everyday, but not 30-60 mins more a day.

I do not expect everyone to be computer literate, esp the elderly. That's why counters are still open for them, weekdays and Saturdays. For the rest of us who have the benefit of education, it is simply a process of learning and adapting. Of course, there will always be a need for personal attention, but this is not a common weekly occurrence and people still have the benefit of counters open on Sat. Your passport agony is amusing to say the least. That is just your experience and does says nothing more than that. I can just as easily speak of my experience when I renewed my passport: I went to the Immigration building, filled up the renewal form, paid $10 by Nets, stapled the receipt to the form, glued my pre-prepared pic on the form, and dropped it into the box. (15 mins at most) Three days letter, I collected the passport with the letter  sent to me (30 mins).

From my personal experience living abroad, it is on par, if not better than many other countries in terms of govt e-readiness. Your assertion is also NOT validated by international surveys. In the EIC/IBM government e-rankings in 2004, Singapore ranks 7th out of 64 countries surpassing many equally advanced OECD countries, including Australia (*winks*).

Statistically, 9 out of 10 new jobs go to Singaporeans. (I suppose you are thinking of the NTU dons and their clash with MOM.)  Open borders is a reality that everyone must accept, ultimately, it is not the nationality that counts, but the skills that one has to offer. It is a bitter pill that many (including I) find hard to swallow. Would you employ a Singaporean by virtue of his nationality (or even race, gender etc), even though he does not possess the skills to perform, rather than a foreigner who is competent and trained? It's common sense isn't it? Many foreigners who take up professional jobs do so because there are simply inadequate numbers of Singaporeans trained for it (e.g R&amp;D in biomeds and pharmaceuticals). They are NOT 'freely admitted' to become PRs, but come into three different pass categories as I am sure you already know. I do understand your concern however that many foreigners excel in our local universities, esp math science and engineering, and the number of immigrants here have caused social tension (assimilation, worries about job securities).

Honestly, you don't think that an extra full Saturday off is spent doing household chores? Working mothers will reschedule their time to complete chores since they are working just up to one hour longer daily on weekdays, not five.  Those with maids have no worries.  Housewives have no worries. I am sure even you realise your paranoia that people coming home an hour later will result in havoc at home is a sheer exaggeration to say the least. Perhaps havoc will occur if mothers need to work past midnight everyday, but not 30-60 mins more a day.
