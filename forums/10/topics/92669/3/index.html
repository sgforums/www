            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, gone for a few days, and you certainly have not let up, and have even superceded yourself and perhaps your alter-ego even ?<br><br><strong>PART ONE</strong><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by TidalWave333:<strong><br>Atobe writes<br>Your tenacity to find fault in my post truly amazes me<br>Now I wonder who is on an ego trip, in making "meaningless drivel to fill up space" for each issue that you have not read with objectivity, and in your haphazard haste to prove me wrong on each and every mundane matter ?Â….. already responded to your correction of my earlier statement, which obviously you did not read as an acknowledgement:</strong></blockquote><strong>ItÂ’s a very simple situation. (1) You made an error of suggesting that getting Saturdays off is equivalent to working fewer hours for more money. (2) You direct it to LHL and use it as a fulcrum to serve up more sarcasm suggesting it was Â‘clevernessÂ’ on his part. (3) You certainly responded to my remarks, BUT nowhere in all the posts did you explicitly acknowledge you made an error, by admitting and expressing recognition that getting Saturday off is NOT Â“giving themselves a 5-Day work week to enjoy the extra 10% wages.Â” </strong><br><br>If acknowledging a remark is insufficient "admission" or representative of an "expressed recognition" to your position, what are you looking for ?<br><br>A clear apology, accompanied by 3 "kowtows", and perhaps compensation to redress an offense to your sensibilities ?<br><br>Wow, you have certainly picked up more then a fair bit from your beloved mentors whom you are protecting so diligently.<br><br><blockquote>continuing post by TidalWave333:<strong><br>Atobe writes<br>In your continued haste to dribble up all that is emitted from LHL, will you be so gullible to take in every single word from him with mindless efficiency ?<br>Western Government and societies and companies worked far less hours than the 44 hour week practised by the Singapore Government.<br>Even in the Private Sector in Singapore, some Companies that follow a 5-day week do not insist on a 44 hour week, and even go a step further by allowing their Employees flexi-working hours.</strong></blockquote><strong>You serve up another conspiracy theory- the government is up to no good in tweaking working hours, even though this has been welcomed anecdotally. If it had been working longer for lesser pay, or working more hours with no extra pay, there may have been cause for complaint. I am amazed you think the government acceding to the requests of new civil service recruits IS NOT a thing to be applauded, but a thing to find fault with. You appear obstinately ready to press on with the belief that civil servants, and the encouraging of private companies to implement a five-day work week is horrendous, and indeed, a conspiracy by the government. What is your agenda here? </strong><br><br>Why is there an obssession with "conspiracy theory" and "hidden agenda" - whenever there are opposing or alternate views towards your preferred points of views ?<br><br>Perhaps the directions in which we are arguing may be hitting the same topic but at different tangents.<br><br>You are protecting the status of the event, claiming that it is a popular policy change by LHL.<br><br>I am saying that it is no big deal, as it is merely changing the work arrangements from a 6 day work week to a 5 day work week, and in so doing have not improved the available time for family as intended - due to the shorter hours available to the most important person in the family - the working "housewife".<br><br>How did you manage to infer from all my replies that "civil servants, and the encouraging of private companies to implement a five-day work week is <span style="color: red;">horrendous</span>, and indeed, <span style="color: red;">a conspiracy</span> by the government".<br><br>"Horrendous" and "conspiracy" ?<br><br>Amazing level of intelligence in being able to discern such sense from my post.<br><br><blockquote>continuing post by TidalWave333:<strong><br>Notice I used Â‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">working daysÂ’</span>, not Â‘working hoursÂ’. I am well aware that Singapore, and indeed, the rest of Asia as well as the US clock in more hours than Europe , with Denmark holding the record for lowest hours per worker at 34.  This has (1) caused many companies to threaten to move abroad (with some already having done so, and not just to China and India) to take advantage of more competitive conditions (2) prompted reviews by the EU to overhaul its labour conditions so as to be able to stay in the game against its competitors like the US. Reality boy, not fantasy. </strong></blockquote>It is not so much the changes in the "working hours or the working days" that form the core issues in the direction of post - as you do not seem able to discern the efforts of my posts.<br><br>To be more specific, what is all the fanfare about that is given to LHL ?<br><br>All the fanfare and hullabaloo for merely changing the working arrangement of a Government that remained stubbornly to a 6-day week since independence ?<br><br>Does this change reflect a super-human effort on LHL's part to lift such a heavy stone and have it turned over ?<br><br>If at all, this is merely a "mud-brick" of an issue, not a heavy weight stone of any current and more urgent issues affecting the Political Life of Singapore.<br><br>This is "Fantasy" - not "Reality"; if you can discern the differences, sonny.<br><br>It would have been a more credible effort on the part of LHL if he had shattered the manner in which the Ruling Party utilise their legal position to legislate laws to monopolises the Center Stage, and prevent Opposition Parties from any room to grow amongst the Singapore Community.<br><br>Until he is able to make such an effort to break the stubborn 'kiasu' mentality of the Ruling Party - he will hardly be a "Man of his own making".<br><br>This will be "Reality" - and no longer fantasy.<br><blockquote>continuing post by TidalWave333:<strong><br>Nowhere in the post have I suggested that the private sector all clock in 44 hours or more. That is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your </span>assertion, not mine. While stay-at home-work, or flexi-hours is indeed laudable, it is ultimately the prerogative of the private company or civil service where implementation is concerned. </strong></blockquote>So what your point of contention - whether this statement is made by me, or by yourself ?<br><br>This was brought up to merely reinforce my point that LHL's announcement of a 6-day week to a 5-day week, without any change to the total work hours for the week, is typical of the Government's methods:<br><br>"Give a little, and take back some, if not MORE" - then make a big hullabaloo about the change, as if it is some fantasy come true; when all along, the Private Sector has been practising 5-day week and with some working even shorter hours, as well as being more progressive in work policies by allowing flexi-hours.<br><br>For someone who try to project himself as a super-mover, out to reset and rethink all old work methods that are "set in stone", this new change in Government work period is not exactly a "super move" nor a "super speed move" into the future.<br><br>What is all the hullabaloo about ? Merely to boost LHL political image further.<br><br><blockquote>continuing post by TidalWave333:<strong><br>Atobe writes<br>Excuse me, what formal setting did you mention earlier ?<br>Or are you referring to the 'formal setting' that LHL had conducted his "research" ?<br>When did you decide that you can fit his shoes ?<br>Will Civil Servants dare to complain ?</strong></blockquote><strong>This is the formal setting I referred to in the very same wordsÂ…. <span style="font-style: italic;">Â“my research/work carried out in a formal setting over the last three yearsÂ”.</span><br>Again, a similar question should be posed to you: When did you reach the conclusion I was aspiring to fill LHLÂ’s shoes, or anyoneÂ’s shoes for that matter?<br>What do civil servants have to complain about? Getting the Saturday off? Having the entire weekend to themselves? Why is it so difficult for you to accept that many welcome a 5-day week, and not having to work on Saturdays? </strong><br><br>Having quoted those "haloed words" - concerning his work "carried out in a formal setting" - as spoken by LHL, you will now make it to be "again in the formal setting <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">I MENTIONED EARLIER </span></span>" ?<br><br>For someone who demand high standards of specific accuracy, you will now assume yourself to be LHL ?<br><br></div>

Why would they complain that their family time with husbands and kids on weekends has increased? Are the aghast their husbands will no longer have their mornings at the office? What grouses did they Â‘communicateÂ’ to you? </strong><br><br>If you fail to see the effects to working "Housewives" and prefer to hide behind the defence of accurate usage and choice of terms, is this not an exercise in a "game of semantics".<br><blockquote>continuing post by TidalWave333:<strong><br>Atobe writes<br>Now you are digressing with your exaggeration in your preffered direction of argument that do not address the points that I have made.<br>Were "kids" the issue of my last post, or did I mention the fact that the Housewife will finish off 30 to 60 minutes later each day, that will affect her household chores of preparing meals and doing the laundry ? </strong></blockquote><strong>All <span style="text-decoration: underline;">emotive</span> issues were brought up by you, not me.

            <div class='col-md body'>For Atobe<br><br><strong>PART ONE</strong><br>It is interesting to note that for once, your <strong>NINE</strong> consecutive posts contained no new economic assertions, but focused almost entirely on insults and hostility. Is that a sign that you are finally learning itÂ’s best to remain silent unless one is familiar with oneÂ’s subject? Is that also a symptom of your growing enmity that someone actually dared challenge your economic ignorance with substantiated fact- instead of engaging in more offensive drivel?<br><br>ItÂ’s even more telling that you spent so much time writing <strong>nine</strong> consecutive posts that <strong>DO NOT </strong>address the inconsistencies and factual points I pointed out. Instead even more agitated denunciation, and distasteful name-calling is produced.<br><br>Your animosity is puzzling at some levels. What could have hit at your nerves to such an extent when I have hardly retaliated by sinking to your level and handling you with kid gloves? What caused you to blow your top that you resorted to nine long pompous posts of haranguing? Did it hurt that much? Did producing facts puncture your spleen so much so that your hatred, anger, sarcasm exploded without control?<br><br>One can only surmise that unable to stem the tide of facts that exposed your self-serving agenda of inaccurate/ignorant economic figures and hateful anti-government propaganda, you resorted to the basest of all human instincts: if you canÂ’t attack factual economic statistics, attack the messenger instead!<br><br>Condemn the messengerÂ’s integrity (!), set on him with derision (!). That way, other readers will hopefully forget your previous wrong statistics, poor understanding of economic issues, and inadequate vocabulary.<br><br>And maybe if you are lucky, you might even arouse some scornful pity for being the self-deluded, mentally deficient character that you are!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I cannot possibly be all things to you. First, you implicitly suggested I am a government agent, subsequently I became a bootlicker. In this series of long posts, I have been promoted- I am now a mentee of the government (mentored by some high-ranking, all-powerful cabinet minister in your crazy deluded fantasies perhaps.) How many times have you used the label?<br><br>You should ask yourself why it has become more urgent to you that I be portrayed as such. Or question yourself why itÂ’s intolerable to you for anyone who dares hold an opposing view. To salvage your shredded reputation on economics? Lest others treat you with skepticism and contempt when you post another Temasek/GLC entry with your pseudo-intellectual assertions? Makes interesting contemplation doesnÂ’t it?<br><br>As usual I wonÂ’t bother responding to your juvenile and petty insults (which will of course shorten the number of my posts considerably) but look at other things you said instead:<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>If acknowledging a remark is insufficient "admission" or representative of an "expressed recognition" to your position, what are you looking for ?<br>A clear apology, accompanied by 3 "kowtows", and perhaps compensation to redress an offense to your sensibilities ?</blockquote>Acknowledging a remark is different from admitting you are wrong. If one murders another, it means different things<br>(1)	when the murderer says Â“I hear what you are sayingÂ” (acknowledging the remark), than<br>(2)	when the murderer says Â“I killed the personÂ” (admitting oneÂ’s wrong-doing).<br><br>Similarly, I no longer expect you to admit you are wrong when you equated getting Saturdays off as working fewer hours for the same or more same money.<br>But intellectually, (since I now suspect you are <strong>genuinely</strong> unable to comprehend the difference), you may wish to know that acknowledging what I have said is different from admitting you are wrong.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Amazing level of intelligence in being able to discern such sense from my post.</blockquote>Insult. Ignore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>To be more specific, what is all the fanfare about that is given to LHL ?<br>All the fanfare and hullabaloo for merely changing the working arrangement of a Government that remained stubbornly to a 6-day week since independence ?</blockquote>I do not know what fanfare you are referring to. Merely that civil servants welcome the fact that they no longer have to work on Saturdays like many in the private sector.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>It would have been a more credible effort on the part of LHL if he had shattered the manner in which the Ruling Party utilise their legal position to legislate laws to monopolises the Center Stage, and prevent Opposition Parties from any room to grow amongst the Singapore Community.</blockquote>Again, digressing from the topic at hand and taking up space with irrelevant remarks. What has this got to do with a discussion on civil service working hours? I have no wish to comment on, or console you on your personal frustrations. Perhaps you should speak to your MP or join an opposition party.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>This was brought up to merely reinforce my point that LHL's announcement of a 6-day week to a 5-day week, without any change to the total work hours for the week, is typical of the Government's methods:<br>"Give a little, and take back some, if not MORE" - then make a big hullabaloo about the change, as if it is some fantasy come true; when all along, the Private Sector has been practising 5-day week and with some working even shorter hours, as well as being more progressive in work policies by allowing flexi-hours.</blockquote>I have already addressed why shortening work hours is <strong>NOT</strong> the way to go in previous posts. I have also quoted examples from the West, esp. the EU where extending working hours is crucial to maintaining competitiveness. They are learning too late that the economy is losing out- badly. These are not offhand remarks on my part, but reality. Under European Union rules, 48 working hours is the maximum legal limit, and controversy over a new act to change this is NOT because workers want to work shorter hours, but because they are PREVENTED FROM WORKING LONGER if they wish to. (See http://www.euobserver.com/?sid=19&amp;aid=17276). Your attempt to portray the government as being out-of-sync with labour reforms elsewhere is ignorant to say the least.<br>More importantly, the move is not even about shortening work hours, it is about giving families more weekend time without sacrificing national competitiveness. This is <strong>NOT</strong> simply government propaganda (you wouldnÂ’t want hundred of thousands of jobs to be lost from Singapore to others, would you?), but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">striking a balance between family and career</span>? Unless you are obtuse, which person wouldnÂ’t welcome having an entire Saturday off, by working 30-60 mins more per weekday? 9 hours Mon-Fri (45 hours) OR 8 hours Mon-Fri (40 hours) and 5 hours on Sat? No doubt workaholics may despair, but the majority will not.</div>

Is this my next Â“promotionÂ” after being labeled a Â“government menteeÂ” in this post? (Hahaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )<br><br>To refresh your failing memory, this is what I said in my previous post (12 September 2004):<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“Again, a similar question should be posed to you: When did you reach the conclusion I was aspiring to fill LHLÂ’s shoes, or anyoneÂ’s shoes for that matter?Â” </span><br><br>No further comment.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>If you fail to see the effects to working "Housewives" and prefer to hide behind the defence of accurate usage and choice of terms, is this not an exercise in a "game of semantics".</blockquote>I provided dictionary meanings of the common noun Â‘housewifeÂ’ to you. There is <strong>NO</strong> such label as a Â“working housewifeÂ”. If you can even quarrel with formal lexical meanings that correct the wrong usage of a word on your part, there really is very little one can do to correct your self-delusions and invention of new meanings. If you insist the main occupation of a housewife is a fulltime career out of the home, and NOT household chores, I suggest you check the dictionary yourself, or speak to a knowledgeable friend. Or better still, ask a child, or your neighbour! I suspect they will be able to tell you immediately the meaning of Â‘housewifeÂ’ (hahaha!) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote> How can you be able to understand the difficulties of a working "HOUSEWIFE" - if you are not married ?<br>Even if you are married but is able to afford the luxury of a higher standard of living, will your working "HOUSEWIFE" need to perform any household chores similar to that of a working "HOUSEWIFE" from a Lower Income Group.<br>The English Language will allow greater tolerance and flexibility in the manner it is used.<br>Dogma has its place and time.<br>If I prefer the choice of using the term working "HOUSEWIFE - it carries the meaning more accurately then the simplistic term of a "working mother" or a mere "working woman".</blockquote>Married ladies who work out of the home are by definition not Â‘housewivesÂ’ regardless of their economic situation. See above response or refer to dictionary meanings provided in my posts on 12 September 2004.<br>Using words correctly is not dogma. (Do you know the lexical meaning of Â‘dogmaÂ’ by the way? Check the dictionary yourself.) Unfortunately, you are no poet or literary figure and hence cannot claim poetic licence. I suggest you stick to using words as they are meant to be used, instead of being Â‘creativeÂ’ and trying to scam your way into making others accept your new invention. As it is, the only person who has been deceived by your tedious argument is you.<br><br>By the way, I have yet to hear from you how one distinguishes Â‘serious house choresÂ’ from the non-serious, or what a Â‘serious house choreÂ’ IS to begin with. Or do you hope that others will forget another of your new and original vocabulary invention?<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Very professional in quoting the limited sentence from my full text, and using the same one sentence out of context, make some comedy from this and end up with sarcarsm ?<br>Is there no counter to what was posted, except a weak explanation to all that have been posted in my response ?

I responded using the same factors. But as usual, you were unable to respond directly with fact or statistics. Instead you preferred to engage in another round of insults. What is clear to me is not what has been said, but what <strong>HASNÂ’T</strong>. Why else would one refrain from responding maturely with concrete facts, preferring juvenile instincts? Instead of targeting the <strong>CONTENT</strong> of my reply, why do you choose to target the person who provided the economic statistics and figures? Says a lot about you again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote> If the population size of India or China is ten times bigger then Singapore, will not the percentage of unemployment become even more significantly larger, without necessarily to be in the same proportion.</blockquote>As with all other economic questions you ask me, the answer is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO</span>. It doesnÂ’t mean the larger the population, the percentage will become Â‘significantly largerÂ’. (Think USA or UK). What percentages tell us is  the ratio of the unemployed compared to the employed in a country.<br>Â‘without necessarily to be in the same proportionÂ’ is another one of those meaningless and vague qualifiers that you use to mislead. Same old tactic will not work twice old boy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOU </span>are the one who said territorial and population size are advantages in Â‘flexibility of policyÂ’. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOU </span>are the one who brought up the examples of China and India. Unfortunately, we have neither seen examples of how territorial and population sizes have demonstrated this Â‘flexibilityÂ’ from concrete evidence, nor have your economic cliches of China and India said anything more about them curbing high unemployment rates.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Â…Â…..when compared to the acknowledged natural limited characteristics that is quite unique to small countries like Singapore.<br>While Switzerland is similar in size to Singapore, it is able to hold its head above water, as it has access to the European CommunityÂ…Â…Â…</blockquote>Did you read the article from the Economist I provided for you. What has the past 39 years proven about Singapore? LetÂ’s see historical evidence, and current economic realities, instead of your endless speculations.<br>I am glad you did not state in words that Switzerland is part of the EU, otherwise that would be providing me with another entry in your list of ignorant statements. You canÂ’t be referring to the territorial size of Switzerland of course, and the population size of Switzerland is almost twice that of SingaporeÂ’s at 7.4 million.  But your ignorance still shows in many ways.<br><br>(a)Switzerland has few natural resources like Singapore (unless one counts timber). It is also landlocked with no natural harbour or a strategic geographical position unlike Singapore. Referring to SingaporeÂ’s Â‘natural limited characteristicsÂ’ and then using Switzerland as a basis of contrast is telling. Like Singapore, Switzerland did not allow itself to be Â‘limitedÂ’ by its lack of Â‘natural characteristicsÂ’ (Your choice of words is amusing!) Â– instead it sought to leverage on its financial and manufacturing capabilities. Similarly, Singapore has not allowed itself to be limited by its lack of natural resources, or land size, but has developed its capacities in other areas. Its success over three decades is evident.<br><br>(b)SwiterlandÂ’s  Â‘accessÂ’ to the European community is underpinned by the FTA of 1972, and another seven agreements in 1980. Following your logic that success is guaranteed by market access and FTAs, we must then conclude that Singapore with its many FTAs with US, Japan , Australia, NZ, Chile etc etc, EFTA (wtih Switzerland Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein) and its membership in the ASEAN Free Trade Area with 500 million people will perform the same miracle for us. How does that make Singapore and Switzerland different from your simplistic logic then?<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Kudos for the comprehensive knowledge that you have been able to display on the points posted that generally summarises the problems that I have been too simplistic in thinking that it is too much for you to cope.<br>I was probably wrong in assessing your ability too soon.</blockquote>Oh, I am temporarily disarmed!

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PART THREE</strong><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>While the values of currencies maybe measured against Trade Weighted Index, it nevertheless showed up the weakness of Singapore's position in our own Singapore Dollar weakening so rapidly, when the Australia's Dollar managed to climb in value during the same period from 2002-2003.<br>Leaving aside those countries who do not wish to have their currencies exposed to the volatality of market forces, and prefer to pegged it at a fixed rate to other stronger currencies, it already is available and serves as a good indicator of economic performance.</blockquote>Ahhh! Back to your old ways! No <strong>explicit admission </strong>of error that you were wrong in stating that the AUD currency rose 30% against the SGD. Just <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Â‘acknowledgementÂ’ </span>again? (hahaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )<br>The SGD is traded between a <strong>narrow undisclosed band</strong> and managed against a basket of other currencies. It will not appreciate to its true market value (since internationally it is considered undervalued like the Chinese yuan or Malaysian ringgit- see EIC reports for e.g) because that will make our exports too expensive. So the SGD did not Â“weaken so rapidlyÂ” (unlike the Thai <span style="font-style: italic;">baht</span> or Indonesian <span style="font-style: italic;">ruppiah</span>) in the past, neither will it strengthen rapidly in the future. Currency values are of course affected by forex speculations, which is why central banks of various countries spend millions (in the case of JapanÂ’s Central Bank) to keep it within their desired range. Many countries, especially in Asia prefer their currencies remain Â‘competitiveÂ’ compared to the USD in fact. It is <strong>NOT</strong> a real or true indicator of economic performance. Get it?<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Kudos for your effort to whitewash your own weakness by attempting to make such a light weight claim of my errors - that is seen largely from your own point of views ?<br>Such is the danger of arrogance of one man's opinionated views that are imposed on others, simply because he cannot agree with the differing opinions from others.<br>Try harder at your imitative efforts - you are just only a few hundred steps away, but will always not be in any position to catch up, if you only can imitate and not innovate your own style.<br>With all your high brow opinions, it certainly reveal a shallow understanding of the events that had passed. </blockquote>For someone who has difficulty understanding economics and writing in proper English, your attempts to accuse me of Â‘whitewashÂ’ing (the origins of SingaporeÂ’s economic downturn) is laughable. If you disagree with my statement thatÂ…Â…<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“I can only say that while the Asian financial crisis did affect Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and indeed other parts of the word, they did NOT suffer a meltdown, unlike the four most directly involved- Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea, Indonesia.

It was the global (from the US, Japan and EU) economic downturn that hit the economy, not the Asian crisis per se that put economic growth at minus 2.1% in 2001. Ignorance again.Â”</span><br>....why donÂ’t you challenge those figures or state the origins of economic slump from Â‘your perspectiveÂ’? Why do you ignore statistics? And more importantly, why do you spend the <strong>NEXT SIX PARAGRAPHS </strong>in more meaningless drivel and insults? Again, no other comment on the real issues at hand, besides personal attacks (hahaaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )<br>ItÂ’s ironical- you insist that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">official statistics </span>are merely Â‘my own point of viewÂ’ but you do not present counter arguments and statistics to disprove them.

Show us your rigorous and methodological studies. Otherwise refrain from forcing your speculative assumptions down the throats of others.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote> Me ? Ignorant of economic fact, simply on your say so ?</blockquote>No, proven repeatedly- again and again. Not just based on statistics, but also technical terms, and economic understanding. Again, too many to list, scroll back to previous posts.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>What a laugh for me that for someone who will make such a statement, when he is no better then a chamelion attempting to act different roles of an economist and a specialist in the English Language; and playing at this art form amateurishly, being nothing more then a mere copy of those who are more superior in this art form of character assassination towards opponents - who have the ability and daring to articulate private thoughts into prints.<br>Honestly - if one can trust you with it - what are you good at ?</blockquote>LOL.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> More spiteful personal attacks. But I have to resist sinking to your contemptible level.<br>What am I good at? How about I get statistics right, and you donÂ’t? Let me search for one example:<br><br>Atobe says <span style="font-style: italic;">Â“Singapore's economy performed below 1% in 2003Â”</span><br><br>Tidalwave says <span style="font-style: italic;">Â“Wrong again. To be really picky (since you prefer precision), 2003's growth rate was 1.1% (above official forecasts of 0.8%)Â”</span><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Laugh by all means about the seriousness of household chores, it simply shows that you have UNLIKELY matured into the responsibility of having a wife, and the ability to help her with the heavy load of house hold chores.</blockquote>So you finally say something about Â‘serious household choresÂ’ But again, what chores are serious, and what are not serious? Pray tell.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Despite your arrogance with your limited vocabulary and inflexibility with the English Language, somehow this language remains relevant - having survived centuries of use, and with the daily expansion and flexibility of the language expanding to allow one to express oneself more effectively.<br>Try harder to be narrow minded, you may just be able to squeeze your grey matter in between the lines of these passages.</blockquote>DrivelÂ…drivelÂ…insultÂ…insultÂ….where is the Â‘real stuffÂ’ anyway? When are you going to address inconsistencies and errors on your part besides more spite and hate? Tsk tsk! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote> What is the use of telling everyone that the Singapore Government's computerisation effort has won the accolade of international audit, when it is proven that it is not idiot-proof; and the irony of it all, is that an ardent government supporter will shy away from supporting the Government's call to use the e-Gov on-line service that has been put up at such a high expense ?</blockquote>I am sure you will find fault regardless of what has been done/is being done. Not even highly regarded international surveys by EIC/IBM will convince you. Your vengeful agenda against all things government cannot be possibly be distracted by rigorous surveys, fact and calm.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PART FIVE</strong><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Since you claimed that the MRT is so convenient - and instead of merely taking my prevaricating words that try to avoid and evade the truth - why not zip across town by yourself, in any given weekday, and at least one Saturday, to visit the various Government and GLC counters (no longer Statutory Boards) just to see the average Singaporeans stuck in queus ?<br>For a start, try the counters at CPF, Post Office, Singapore Telecoms, PUB, URA, HDB, Ministry of Inland Revenue, PWD, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Law, Supreme Court, Registrar of Companies, Prison Department - will this be enough for a start ?</blockquote>I have Â‘zipped across townÂ’, but I have not foolishly spent 6 hours and $24 in parking to renew my passport unlike someone here. Unfortunately, my kind advice to you to save time and money is unappreciated. (heh) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> . And these places you mentionedÂ…you visit them weekly? You apply for flats with HDB <span style="text-decoration: underline;">regularly</span>? You pay taxes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">weekly</span> at IRA (there is no Â‘Ministry of Inland Revenue' (haha!), only Ministry of Finance)? You attend court cases <span style="text-decoration: underline;">regularly</span> at the Supreme Court? Or you have some friend or relative in prison? Are these places ordinary people go to <strong>WEEKLY</strong> or on a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">regular</span> basis, especially on Saturdays?? So far, I donÂ’t think anyone would agree with you?<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Glad to know that you can imagine yourself getting any satisfaction in believing that you have been able to convince me with the twisted economic data, or self-espoused theories.</blockquote>Which data of mine is Â‘twistedÂ’? Actually they are not MY data, but figures and statistics from government websites, economic agency reports and the likes. I do not make them up. All of these facts have their sources acknowledged, and some even have url links provided for your convenience. Easy for you to brush them off dismissively, but I am sure more astute readers of this thread have referred to them, and read up for themselves.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Singapore Windows may not be the 'holy grail' but it at least is the best source of archived materials concerning events in Singapore - economics, politics, social - that I have been able to obtain freely.<br>To the best of my knowledge, it is apolitical in its agenda, as it stores all Singapore related information that include articles in support or critical of the Government.</blockquote>Your knowledge is obviously flawed. Common sense will tell you that there are <strong>MANY</strong> sources of information. Reading from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ONE</span> source gives you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ONE</span>- sided perspectives. Enough said.<br><br>It is interesting why you are unable to focus on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">content</span> in your arguments, preferring to launch long, verbose personal attacks instead over <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nine long posts</span>. I pity you- lacking in real substance, you only have insults to soothe your bruised ego and exposed ignorance.<br><br>That should not be surprising however. You are well-known around here for your lack of decorum as evidenced from many threads on different subjects. Anyone who differs from your views are immediately labelled negatively and abused. It would be just as easy for me to think of a few choice words to describe you (but I refrain from doing so of course). If you want to label me 'ignorant', show me a few factual errors, either in policy detail or statistical detail. If you can't do that, it's merely an opinion you disagree with. Sweeping generalisations (Singapore doomed, Singapore's education all bad, younger Singaporeans all brainwashed, everyone has been indoctrinated while Atobe is the only one thinking etc) merely reflect your lack of maturity and your inability to persuade with calm logic, rationale and consistency. Afterall, aren't you the one intending to migrate? For all we know...you may be in the pockets of foreign organizations already..out to stir things up here for some fun. Who knows?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I am portrayed as pro-government, simply because my views converge more with the government's than yours? Your spiteful rhetoric and name-calling shows you are certainly affected by it. If you are so capable and self-righteous, why don't you focus on what I have said, instead of engaging in juvenile personal attacks? Do you fancy yourself as some leading opposition figure, even though no one has labelled you as such yet? Or do you imagine yourself to be the guardian of truth, and others who dissent from your views as traitors to your 'true cause'?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Unfortunately you are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">neither</span>.

Is that also a symptom of your growing enmity that someone actually dared challenge your economic ignorance with substantiated fact- instead of engaging in more offensive drivel?<br><br>ItÂ’s even more telling that you spent so much time writing nine consecutive posts that DO NOT address the inconsistencies and factual points I pointed out.

Really, is there a need to endure so much pent-up anger, and animosity just because I corrected you on a list of economic facts, and vocabulary?<br><br>After all, itÂ’s not like I made anything up.

Is it worth your time and integrity to make such a sacrifice, even though the end-result ultimately <strong>demeans</strong> you?<br><br>Your big and worthless load of verbal garbage does you ill-well. Your harangue was becoming addictive for me, but I suppose all good things must come to an end.

Have you made any impact as a trained economist, other then being a mere technocrat to do the biddings of your political masters?</blockquote>I do not profess to be a gentleman of words. I do not aspire to fill LHLÂ’s (or anyone elseÂ’s) shoes. In no sentence have I declared myself to be a (trained) economist, a technocrat, a civil servant or a politician. Those are your silly delusions. In your rage, you were unconsciously influenced by the questions of others, and allowed what little sanity you possessed to be clouded by ridiculous thoughts. Why do you presume I am so many things simultaneously? (hahaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Other then a good command of the English Language Â– which you have a pervers narrow insistence of its use that prevent the Language from blossoming to its fuller glory Â– is there any basis that qualify you to pass pompous judgment on the correctness of the use of the language ?</blockquote>My response is an unqualified YES! You make <strong>two contradictory statements</strong>- you note that I have a Â‘good command of the English LanguageÂ’ and then proceed to ask how I am qualified to pass judgment on the correct use of the language. ItÂ’s simple- you have difficulty differentiating lexemes (Â‘thanÂ’ <strong>NOT</strong> Â‘thenÂ’), spelling correctly (Â‘perverseÂ’ <strong>NOT</strong> Â‘perversÂ’), using grammar (Â‘qualifiesÂ’ <strong>NOT</strong> Â‘qualifyÂ’), and writing fluently (Â‘correct use of the languageÂ’ <strong>NOT</strong> Â‘correctNESS OF THE use of the languageÂ’). <strong>Four errors</strong> in one sentence! Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  I guess I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AM</span> qualified, and answered your question. I won't bother to correct the rest of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> statements.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>It is pure childishness to walk away from this exchange by simply hiding behind limp insults and hollow accusations.</blockquote>ItÂ’s sheer ingenuity you accuse me of a crime you commit yourself! You chose to respond to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">first nine paragraphs </span>of my <span style="text-decoration: underline;">first</span> post, while <strong>IGNORING</strong> the remaining four posts that had more pertinent questions! Astute readers following this thread are waiting for you to acknowledge <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your errors in statistics and vocabulary</span>- the suitability of using Switzerland, unemployment rates in China and India, per capita trade dependency, exchange rates, use of the words Â‘housewifeÂ’, Â‘dogmaÂ’, SingaporeÂ’s educational system (and your education record), and Â‘liberal globalizationÂ’ etc. What happened to those comments? No clarifications or even Â‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">acknowledgement</span>Â’  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  you are wrong? <strong>Who</strong> is hiding behind insults and hollow accusations? <strong>Who</strong> is avoiding the Â‘real issuesÂ’? No response from you on those issues. Just one post filled with frustrated insults. (hahahaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )  Took the easy way out again huh? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>Were the other missing FOUR posts too truthful for your liking, or you simply wish to dictate the pace and agenda of our exchange ? I am truly amazed that an educated mind can take so much pride Â– in making acclamation of grand achievement in reducing the replies to only FIVE Posts, while expertly sweeping the remaining Four Â“under the carpet </blockquote>I responded to <strong>ALL </strong>issues you brought up. ThatÂ’s <strong>9 out of 9 </strong>posts. Most of the content is just inferior, juvenile and abusive garbage and warrants no attention. And  so, I only required five posts. Get it? In this instance, you ignored my remaining FOUR posts, preferring to respond to just nine paragraphs in my first post. As far as I can see, the agenda has been set by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span>. Your agenda now is to be abusive and demeaning to yourself.<br>Bet Atobe is thinking <span style="font-style: italic;">Â“Damn! I ainÂ’t informed enough to talk about government policies, economic statistics and language use! IÂ’ll do what I do best instead- insult, insult and more insults! ThatÂ’ll avenge my bruised ego!Â”</span><br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>As for the display in your ability to count backwards the number of reference to the word Â“MentorÂ” Â– it certainly confirmed your infantile and juvenile approach with your attempts at not engaging on the issuesÂ…</blockquote>Did you enjoy my countdown? I received <strong>5</strong> private messages just on that alone. Wow! You are certainly held in contempt here!<br>I can hardly be accused of not Â‘engaging issuesÂ’. You are the one dodging them not-too-brilliantly. All you have demonstrated so far is abusive language, debasing your own dignity and perpetuating your own silly vendetta.<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>You certainly have been well bred, and is a clear example of a 'full stomach dulling the mind' - can you stand up and even know who have actually brought you up to where you are today ? Will you claim that it was the effort of 'PAPa' or your own birth-parents ?</blockquote>Wow! A desperate man certainly knows no limits. IsnÂ’t your clichÃ© about mentors getting dreary and tired by now? My Â‘birth-parentsÂ’ are in this too?<br>DonÂ’t sink too low there just yet. You only have a tiny shred of dignity and intelligence left. (hehe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>Atobe writes<br><blockquote>The TRUTH certainly HURTS when spoken clearly by a Â‘small fryÂ’ like an ordinary Singapore Citizen such as myself.</blockquote>I donÂ’t know who your words are supposed to have hurt- I am certainly looking forward to your next response. Are you sure you are still a citizen? You certainly donÂ’t talk like one, displaying neither attachment nor bonds to this country or its people. Your strident posts in all threads demonstrate this. (Ahh! I knowÂ…. donÂ’t try to put on a poor victim act ('ordinary Singapore citizen') to gain sympathy or pity! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> ) HavenÂ’t you already emigrated as you so proudly informed everyone here? Are you sure you arenÂ’t being paid off by foreign organizations to demean Singapore and Singaporeans?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>p.s. so now I am no longer a <strong>mentee</strong> of the 'ruling party' eh? I have become an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">employee</span> of oldbreadstinks to do the 'dirty work'. Try not to be too pathetic. hahahaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
