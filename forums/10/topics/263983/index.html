Clearly, that is sufficient evidence to attest to the fact those who are capable - minority or otherwise - are not unduly marginalised in any form, shape or way. Take this example farther, you hardly see any nonsensical ploys like the GRC in the free world, do you? In spite of that, you don't hear about minority candidates complaining about them being marginalised victims either.<br><br>In fact, the rationale behind the need for the GRC - assuming we take the despots' justification for its necessity at face value - is self-contradictory : rather than protecting the interests of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">capable minority</span></span>, it effectively safeguards the interests of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">inept and incompetent minority candidates</span></span> (they're effectively telling you, for each GRC, there is a need for a minority to represent you even if there were no capable candidates).<br><br>With the greatest respect, I find it a complete and utter waste of time to even entertain the thought of coming up with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"alternative"</span></span> solutions to continue playing the game within the rules set by thugs out to ensure the survival of a totalitarian regime.

Do we need to prevent or hinder interested political aspirants from challenging the status quo or standing for election in single wards in the name of providing racial representation to protect the interest of the minority.
