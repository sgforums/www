He has opposed the entry of Turkey into the EU on the grounds that it is an Islamic nation. He alluded to the wars of the Ottoman empire against Christian Byzantine Europe on that occasion:<br><br>"In a widely cited interview in Le Figaro last year, then Cardinal Ratzinger made clear his view on the hotly contested political debate "over allowing Turkey into the European Union," reports IslamOnline. He was opposed to Ankara joining the EU "on the grounds that it is a Muslim nation."<br><br>The cardinal publicly cautioned Europe against admitting Islamic Turkey and wrote to bishops the reason for his stand:<br><br>The roots that have formed Europe, that have permitted the formation of this continent, are those of Christianity. Turkey has always represented another continent, in permanent contrast with Europe. There were the [old Ottoman Empire] wars against the Byzantine Empire, the fall of Constantinople, the Balkan wars, and the threat against Vienna and Austria. It would be an error to equate the two continents...Turkey is founded upon Islam...Thus the entry of Turkey into the EU would be anti-historical."<br><br>(http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0422/dailyUpdate.html)<br><br>Obviously the Pope has completely forgotten the massacres committed in the name of his church against the Muslims during the crusades and is silent on the ongoing oppression of the Palestinian Muslims today.</div></blockquote>Christianity was NEVER the original religion of Europe. Before the Roman emperors forced baptism on their subjects, Wicca held sway over the European continent.<br><br>The Zionists who rule over Israel today are an ungrateful lot. They seem to have forgotten that the Muslims gave their forefathers shelter when they fled persecution in Europe.</div>

These in fact were a quotation from a medieval text, which do not in any way express my personal thought.<br><br>"Yesterday, the Cardinal Secretary of State published a statement in this regard in which he explained the true meaning of my words. I hope that this serves to appease hearts and to clarify the true meaning of my address, which in its totality was and is an invitation to frank and sincere dialogue, with great mutual respect." </blockquote>---VATICAN CITY, SEP 17, 2006 (VIS)<br><br>2.<strong><a href="http://212.77.1.245/news_services/press/vis/dinamiche/b0_en.htm" rel="nofollow">the Cardinal Secretary of State published a statement</a></strong><br><blockquote> "Quite the contrary, what emerges clearly from the Holy Father's discourses is a warning, addressed to Western culture, to avoid 'the contempt for God and the cynicism that considers mockery of the sacred to be an exercise of freedom.' A just consideration of the religious dimension is, in fact, an essential premise for fruitful dialogue with the great cultures and religions of the world. And indeed, in concluding his address in Regensburg, Benedict XVI affirmed how 'the world's profoundly religious cultures see this exclusion of the divine from the universality of reason as an attack on their most profound convictions. A reason which is deaf to the divine and which relegates religion into the realm of subcultures is incapable of entering into the dialogue of cultures.'<br><br>"What is clear then, is the Holy Father's desire to cultivate an attitude of respect and dialogue towards other religions and cultures, including, of course, Islam." </blockquote>----VATICAN CITY, SEP 15, 2006 (VIS)<br><br>3.Let the storm be rested.Lets forgive and forget.<br><strong><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5362788.stm" rel="nofollow">Pope says he was 'misunderstood'Wednesday, 20 September 2006,</a></strong><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42108000/jpg/_42108410_pope_203body_afp.jpg"></div>
