The present text must therefore be considered provisional.<br><br>The Pope said:'<br><br>paragraphing by lionnoisy,not original<br><blockquote>In the seventh conversation (*4V8,&gt;4H - controversy) edited by Professor Khoury, the emperor touches on the theme of the holy war. The emperor must have known that surah 2, 256 reads: "There is no compulsion in religion". According to the experts, this is one of the suras of the early period, when Mohammed was still powerless and under threat.<br><br>But naturally the emperor also knew the instructions, developed later and recorded in the Qur'an, concerning holy war. Without descending to details, such as the difference in treatment accorded to those who have the "Book" and the "infidels", he addresses his interlocutor with a startling brusqueness on the central question about the relationship between religion and violence in general, saying: <strong>"Show me just what Mohammed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached".<br><br>copy the speech to Words file ,then search for key words<br>and u will find the relevant paragraph.<br><br></strong>The emperor, after having expressed himself so forcefully, goes on to explain in detail the reasons why spreading the faith through violence is something unreasonable. Violence is incompatible with the nature of God and the nature of the soul. "God", he says, "is not pleased by blood - and not acting reasonably (FÃ—&lt; 8`(T) is contrary to God's nature. Faith is born of the soul, not the body. Whoever would lead someone to faith needs the ability to speak well and to reason properly, without violence and threats... To convince a reasonable soul, one does not need a strong arm, or weapons of any kind, or any other means of threatening a person with death...". </blockquote>2.quoted fr BBC<br><br><blockquote>Stressing that they were not his own words, he quoted Emperor Manual II Paleologos of the Byzantine Empire, the Orthodox Christian empire which had its capital in what is now the Turkish city of Istanbul.<br><br>The emperor's words were, he said: "Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached."<br><br>Benedict said "I quote" twice to stress the words were not his and added that violence was "incompatible with the nature of God and the nature of the soul".<br><br>'Angry and hurt'<br><br>Pakistan's parliament passed a resolution demanding that the Pope retract his remarks "in the interest of harmony between religions".<br><br>"The derogatory remarks of the Pope about the philosophy of jihad and Prophet Mohammed have injured sentiments across the Muslim world and pose the danger of spreading acrimony among the religions," the AFP news agency quoted the resolution by the country's national assembly as saying. </blockquote>3.In this era,we need  more wisdoms and carefulness<br>not to arise misunderstanding .</div>

"The Vatican must now take full responsibility over the matter and carry out the necessary steps to rectify the mistake."<br><br>Afghanistan's Taliban militia, which sheltered the Al-Qaeda network before the September 11 attacks, said the pope's comments showed the Christian West was waging war against Muslims.<br><br>"We strongly condemn it," Taliban spokesman Mohammed Hanif told AFP.<br><br>In Germany last week, the German-born leader of more than one billion Roman Catholics implicitly denounced links between Islam and violence, particularly with reference to jihad, or "holy war".<br><br>The pope also quoted a 14th-century Byzantine emperor who said innovations introduced by the Prophet Mohammed were "evil and inhuman".<br><br>Papal spokesman Federico Lombardi said Benedict had meant no offence with his speech which was a rejection of violence motivated by religion. The explanation, however, failed to quell Muslim anger.<br><br>In Somalia, a hardline Muslim cleric linked to the country's powerful Islamist movement went so far as to call on Muslims to "hunt down" and kill the pontiff for his "barbaric" statement.<br><br>Palestinian security officials said Molotov cocktails were thrown at two churches in the West Bank town of Nablus on Saturday, a day after four small makeshift bombs exploded near the oldest Christian church in Gaza City.<br><br>The president of the central council of Muslims in Germany, Ayyub Axel Koehler, warned of further outbreaks of violence and urged the pope to issue a clarification.<br><br>"I have a high opinion of the pope but I cannot believe that this was just a blunder," Koehler said.<br><br>Iran joined the calls for a papal apology, saying his remarks could only serve to ignite religious discord.<br><br>"These comments are at odds with his position as a leader of one of the divine religions... and are a great mistake," said foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini.<br><br>The Pakistani parliament unanimously passed a resolution demanding the pope retract his remarks, while in neighbouring India the chairman of the National Commission for Minorities, Hamid Ansari, said the pope's language resembled that of his 12th century counterpart "who ordered the Crusades".<br><br>The Muslim Brotherhood, the leading opposition force in the Egyptian parliament, said the pope's speech was more serious than cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed, whose publication in European newspapers sparked Muslim anger and violent protests this year.<br><br>"I foresee an extreme reaction to the pope's words, which harm Islam more than the cartoons because they come from a leader who represents millions of people," said a senior official from the group, Abdel Moneim Abul Futuh.<br><br>The pope's speech also caused anger in Turkey, the destination of his next foreign trip in November.<br><br>The head of Turkey's state-run religious affairs directorate, Ali Bardakoglu, described the remarks as "full of enmity" and said he the trip should be cancelled.<br><br>The pope has received some support in the West notably from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, but an editorial in the New York Times was highly critical.<br><br>"The world listens carefully to the words of any pope," The Times said. "And it is tragic and dangerous when one sows pain, either deliberately or carelessly. He needs to offer a deep and persuasive apology, demonstrating that words can also heal."<br><br>Lombardi said it was not yet clear if the pope would address the controversy when he leads the Angelus blessing from his summer residence in Castel Gandolfo on Sunday.</blockquote>2.Oh,Father,give me more wisdoms in this crazy world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Pope is known to hold anti-Islamic views and this recent statement is not surprising. He has opposed the entry of Turkey into the EU on the grounds that it is an Islamic nation. He alluded to the wars of the Ottoman empire against Christian Byzantine Europe on that occasion:<br><br>"In a widely cited interview in Le Figaro last year, then Cardinal Ratzinger made clear his view on the hotly contested political debate "over allowing Turkey into the European Union," reports IslamOnline. He was opposed to Ankara joining the EU "on the grounds that it is a Muslim nation."<br><br>The cardinal publicly cautioned Europe against admitting Islamic Turkey and wrote to bishops the reason for his stand:<br><br>The roots that have formed Europe, that have permitted the formation of this continent, are those of Christianity. Turkey has always represented another continent, in permanent contrast with Europe. There were the [old Ottoman Empire] wars against the Byzantine Empire, the fall of Constantinople, the Balkan wars, and the threat against Vienna and Austria. It would be an error to equate the two continents...Turkey is founded upon Islam...Thus the entry of Turkey into the EU would be anti-historical."<br><br>(http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0422/dailyUpdate.html)<br><br>Obviously the Pope has completely forgotten the massacres committed in the name of his church against the Muslims during the crusades and is silent on the ongoing oppression of the Palestinian Muslims today.</div>

Unlike the previous Pope, he has not shown true willingness to cross the religious divide and work towards greater understanding between two of the world's greatest religions. IMO. these two incidents only serve to highlight his personal discrimination against Muslims and their faith.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NOTICE:<br><br>The article has been updated since I first posted the link. His Holiness has apologised to those he has offended:<br><br>CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy -  Pope Benedict XVI said Sunday that he was "deeply sorry" about the angry reaction to his recent remarks about Islam, which he said came from a text that didn't reflect his personal opinion.<br><br>"These (words) were in fact a quotation from a Medieval text which do not in any way express my personal thought," Benedict told pilgrims at his summer palace outside Rome.<br><br>The pope sparked the controversy when, in a speech Tuesday to university professors during a pilgrimage to his native Germany, he cited the words of a Byzantine emperor who characterized some of the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, Islam's founder, as "evil and inhuman."<br><br>"At this time I wish also to add that I am deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries to a few passages of my address at the University of Regensburg, which were considered offensive to the sensibility of Muslims," the pope said Sunday.<br><br>Benedict noted that the Vatican's secretary of state had issued a statement Saturday trying to explain the pope's speech.<br><br>"I hope that this serves to appease hearts and to clarify the true meaning of my address, which in its totality was and is an invitation to frank and sincere dialogue, with great mutual respect," Benedict said.<br><br>Security was high at the summer palace before Benedict spoke to the crowd. Police patted down many of the faithful, confiscating umbrellas with metal tips and bottles of liquids.<br><br>Sharpshooters kept watch from a balcony and other officers, dressed like tourists, monitored the crowd with video cameras.<br><br>Still, Benedict looked relaxed when he greeted pilgrims standing in pouring rain in the palace courtyard. He smiled and said he hoped it would be better weather on Wednesday for his general audience, when he planned to recount more of his pilgrimage to the faithful.<br><br>The Vatican statement Saturday afternoon said that the pope "sincerely regrets" that Muslims were offended, but stopped short of the apology demanded by many Muslim leaders in the Middle East and Asia.<br><br>Mahmoud Ashour, the former deputy of Cairo's Al-Azhar Mosque, the Sunni Arab world's most powerful institution, told Al-Arabiya TV immediately after the pope's speech that, "It is not enough. He should apologize because he insulted the beliefs of Islam. He must apologize in a frank way and say he made a mistake."<br><br>But the leader of Egypt's largest Islamic political group, the Muslim Brotherhood, told The Associated Press Sunday that "while anger over the Pope's remarks is necessary, it shouldn't last for long."<br><br>"While he is the head of the Catholic Church in the world, many Europeans are not following (the church) so what he said won't influence them. Our relations with Christians should remain good, civilized and cooperative," Mohammed Mahdi Akef said.<br><br>The Muslim Brotherhood is formally banned in Egypt.<br><br>In the West Bank, two churches were set afire as anger over the pope's comments grew throughout the Palestinian areas.<br><br>In the town of Tulkarem, a 170-year-old stone church built 170 years ago was torched before dawn and its interior was destroyed, local Christian officials said. In the village of Tubas, a small church was attacked with firebombs and partially burned, Christians said. Neither church is Catholic, the officials said.<br><br>Palestinian Muslims hurled firebombs and opened fire at five churches in the West Bank and        Gaza Strip Saturday to protest the Pope's comments, sparking concerns of a rift between Palestinian Muslims and Christians.<br><br>Italy's interior minister said Sunday that the tensions over Benedict's remarks wouldn't result in any further heightening of security concerns.<br><br>"I don't believe that for Italy the concern will rise," Giuliano Amato told Italian state radio.<br><br>Amato noted that suspected terrorist cells under surveillance inside the country were considered to be focused on targets "outside of Italy."<br><br>The interior ministry includes state police and civilian intelligence services.<br><br>Some Muslims have accepted the pope's statement of regret. Senior Indian Muslim clerics said it will "help in building good relations between Muslims and Christians" and asked their supporters to call off planned protests.<br><br>Turkey's foreign minister said Sunday that the pope was still expected to visit in November in what would be his first trip to a Muslim nation.<br><br>"From our point of view, there is no change," Abdullah Gul told reporters before departing for a trip to the United States.<br><br>Morocco recalled its ambassador to the Holy See to protest the "offensive" remarks, and Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono described the pope's reference as "unwise and inappropriate," the Kompas daily reported.<br><br><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060917/ap_on_re_eu/pope_muslims" rel="nofollow">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060917/ap_on_re_eu/pope_muslims</a></div>
