            <div class='col-md body'>Well, here's what happened to the first, last and only Elected President who tried to do his job :<br><br><a href="http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/2000/0310/nat.singapore.ongiv.html" rel="nofollow">"I Had a Job to Do, Whether the government liked it or not", says ex-president Ong</a><br><br>"<strong>The holdup</strong> <strong> was for administrative reasons?</strong><br>Either that or they did not think there was any urgency. You see, if you ask me to protect the reserves, then you've got to tell me what I'm supposed to protect. So I had to ask.<br><br><strong>Why did they not want to tell you?</strong><br>I do not know. Don't ask me, because I don't have the answer. I've been asking them. In fact, in 1996, exactly halfway through my term, I wrote prime minister Goh a letter. At that time, everybody was expecting a general election in December or January. After the election, a new government would be sworn in. When that happens, all the reserves, whether past or current, become past reserves and are locked up on the changeover date. As president, I have to safeguard them and they can only be drawn upon with my permission. So I said to Mr Goh: It's already halfway through my term, but until today I still don't know all these figures about the reserves.<br><br><strong>So the government had been stonewalling you, the president, for three years?</strong><br>Yes. What happened actually was, as you know, in accounting, when you talk about reserves, it's either cash reserves or assets reserves. The cash side is straightforward: investment, how many million dollars here and there, how much comes from the investment boards and so on. That was straightforward -- but still we had to ask for it. For the assets, like properties and so on, normally you say it's worth $30 million or $100 million or whatever. But they said it would take 56-man years to produce a dollar-and-cents value of the immovable assets. So I discussed this with the accountant-general and the auditor-general and we came to a compromise. The government would not need to give me the dollar-and-cents value, just give me a listing of all the properties that the government owns.<br><br><strong>They agreed?</strong><br>Well, yes, they agreed, but they said there's not the time for it. It took them a few months to produce the list. But even when they gave me the list, it was not complete.<br><br><strong>It seems the Singapore government does not know its own assets?</strong><br>Yes. It's complicated. It's never been done before. And for the assets of land, I can understand why. Every piece of land, even a stretch of road, is probably subdivided into many lots. There are 50,000 to 60,000 lots and every one has a number. If you want to value them all, it would take a long time. In the past, they have just locked everything up and assumed it is all there. But if I am to protect it, at least I want to know the list."<br><br>- The Late Mr Ong Teng Cheong, Singapore's first Elected President, in an <a href="http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/2000/0310/nat.singapore.ongiv.html" rel="nofollow">interview with Asiaweek</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bigmouthjoe:</div><div class="quote_body">Welldone spinsugar, that's a great link you got there. </div></blockquote>Thanks.  Abit more from the link :<br><br><strong>"Eventually then, with the list of properties and the executive summaries, you were kept informed?</strong><br>I wouldn't be able to say that. Even in my last year as president, I was still not being informed about some ministerial procedures. For example, in April last year, the government said it would allow the sale of the Post Office Savings Bank POSB to DBS Bank. In the past, when there was no elected president, they could just proceed with this kind of thing. But when there is an elected president you cannot, because the POSB is a statutory board whose reserves are to be protected by the president. You cannot just announce this without informing him. But I came to know of it from the newspaper. That is not quite right. Not only that, but they were even going to submit a bill to parliament for this sale and to dissolve the POSB without first informing me.<br><br><strong>What did you do?</strong><br>My office went to tell them that this was the wrong procedure. You've got to do this first, do that first, before you can do this. It was question of principle and procedure. We had to bring all this to their attention. That they cannot forget us. It's not that we are busybodies, but under the Constitution we have a role to play and a responsibility. Sometimes in the newspaper I came to know of things that I am responsible for, but if it had not been reported in the newspaper I would not know about it.<br><br><strong>You must have been pretty angry that this was still happening in your last year as president?</strong><br>Yes, I was a bit grumpy. And maybe not to the liking of the civil service. They did not like what I said. But I have to be a watchdog all the time, you see. So this is where they are supposed to help me to protect the reserves. And not for me to go and watch out when they do right or wrong.<br><br><strong>Under the Constitution, you have the right to all the information available to the cabinet.</strong><br>Yes. That's right. And I sourced much information from the cabinet papers. But they are not used to it. So I said: I understand, it's something new, and I know you don't like my interference and busybody checking up and so on. But under the Constitution it is my job to do that.<br><br><strong>Despite all this, it was widely believed that you wanted to run again for a second six-year term as president?</strong><br>No, I'd been telling my friends since late 1998 that my inclination was not to stand for re-election. But of course, life is unpredictable. In March last year, I went to Stanford and my American doctor confirmed that my cancer was in complete remission. He is very experienced, a world authority on my sickness. So I was fine after my treatment. I gave a complete report to the prime minister and we discussed it. I told him that my inclination was not to stand, but that I'd make the announcement later on. Then the cabinet met and they decided that if I were to stand again, they would not support me. "</div>
