              <p>to bring flats down to a reasonable level, someone must absorb the losses somehow.</p>
              <p>1) the flat-owner. borrowed heavily. can only suck thumb when flat devalue.</p>
              <p>2) Banks. Banks write off their losses and absorb the drop in housing price.</p>
              <p>3) The government, esp, SLA, refund back the portion of money for "cost of land" to the flatowner, to help offset some of the losses incurred by devaluation.</p>

              <p>Allow new applicants flats in shorter term.</p>
              <p>HDB is a PUBLIC housing option.Stay true to it's real purpose.</p>
              <p>LEASE in 20-30-40-50 years with option to extend lease, cater to occupant needs and how much they want to sink in to renovate their unit..</p>
              <p>Once lease is up.. or occupants decide to abandon lease for upgrading or downsizing,( refund remainder)..  give the unit back to HDB for re-leasing to other family. Do not allow RESALE by occupants in this scheme.</p>
              <p>99 year lease forces occupants to borrow heavily even from gov.. yes we know that's a surefire way of double dipping into our pockets. Who lives till 99 yo.. really...whats the point of taking up such a big burden ?</p>
              <p>With a shorter lease.. and lower lease cost.. occupants wont need to borrow so much money nor downpayment just to have a roof over their heads.</p>
              <p>Current 99 year lessors can continue to resell their remainder of their lease in open market.. but this should be gradually phase out.</p>
              <p>I'm sure gov hav already thought of this.. why they don't allow is what puzzles me...current HDB practise must be hauling in TONS of money for the gov.. that's why they are so reluctant to change ??</p>

              <p>one of the problems which many ppl din bring out is this.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">dual ownership of both HDB and private property</span></p>
              <p>'This will help ensure that buyers purchase HDB flats only when they have the intent of staying in it for long term and ensure equitable treatment for all HDB flat lessees during their MOP,' said an HDB statement. An HDB owner will also not be allowed to own private properties during the MOP.</p>
              <p>Currently, buyers of subsidised HDB flats are not allowed to own a private residential property within the five-year MOP. On the other hand, buyers of non-subsidised flats can concurrently own a private residential property during the MOP, as long as they live in the HDB flat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In summary, after you stay in your new subsidies flats for 5 years of MOP( minimum occupation period), you can buy a condo and own your HDB flats at the sametime. do you know any friends of your doing this? personally i know a few.</p>
              <p>that we had to go back to HDB basics. what is HDB policy? i would support that all HDB owners whether subsides or no subsidies could not own HDB flats. If they wish to do so, they had to sell their HDB flats within eg 1 year timeframe. HDB should never be allow to speculate. there are more needy couples out there. HDB should not be use as a tool for excessive financial gains.</p>

              i would rather HDB prices go up then go down! see below.
              
              No government can predict the demand of housing in short period.
              in long period say 5 years, may be,
              
              In financial tsunami, few people dared to buy HDB.
              Then, after recovery, the accumulated purchasing power released, like a broken dam.
              
              2. dunt blame PR. they only own about 5% of all 850,000 resale units.
              This figure accumulated in the past few decades, not within the past few years.
              blame the GDP growth is so good.
              If the economy is bad and high jobless rate, price sure go down and lot of below valuation sales!
              i would rather HDB prices go up then go down! 
              
              3. One sq foot of HK new private flats is S$3000 to 3500!!
              u read correctly, Lions Rise in Wong Tai Sin public housing and not from away fr the famous temple.
              
              Why? HK canceled HOS--like HDB--in 2002.
              Besides, the private flats completion (SG TOP issued) is around 10,000 flats a years.
              
              HK 7 million population. SG 5 million.

              <p><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: ·s²Ó©úÅé;">In Phase 19C, the Housing Authority introduced a new flexible discount rate system, allowing successful applicants to choose from three discount rates equivalent to 10% above or below the base discount rate apart from the existing 50% discount on full market value at the time of price fixing. During application, the potential buyers were also asked about their preference on the discount options. Almost 50% of the applicants responded to the question, amongst which 76% chose 10% above the base discount rate (60% off), 18% chose base discount rate (50% off) and 6% chose 10% below the base discount rate (40% off).</span></span></p>

              <p>HDB for goodness sake, is for you to live in, build a family and live on happily everafter, I do not understand, why it had become a business transaction and peoples are worrying about drop in properties prices which is not of HDB concern.</p>
              <p>That is the problem of having a capitalise govt who think of business more than the daily bread and butter issues, and as time goes by, the citizens also become like them, the culture of business, a culture of self interest, a culture of money minded.</p>
