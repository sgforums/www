              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Mas Selamat escape not only is a serious lapse of our security, it has long term implication on our security, safety and in foreign investment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Some of you forumites asked, what Selamat escape got to do with WKS?. Everything I said. Why? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">1) For those who have studied public governance, management, corporate affair etc, you will know this - accountability flows downward but responsibility flows upward. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In other words, the Gurkha who failed in his/their duties should be accountable for his/their act but responsibility for such blatant, unimaginable incident should be shouldered by the leader. In this case, the authority, ie WKS or the PAP government. Why? <br><br>WKS or the PAP government may not physically guarded over Mas Selamat. But they are responsible for the formulation, implementation, and most importantly, the approval of the ISD security plans. The responsibility should not lies solely on the shoulders of some ISD officer or Gurkha officer. The ISD officier or Gurkha are merely the executer and not the executive.<span>   </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">2) Because every month we pay millions of dollar for the PAP government to do a good job. We don't pay peanut but good money and we expect good return on our investment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">To add salt to the wound, LKY appeared on the media to say we are not infallible. As if we are a bunch of kids, not knowing the better of it. Infallible. Why not infallible in the first place? Because they screwed up on the security in the first place. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">LHK also appeared to say "what to do, it has happened". <span> </span>To give such statement is as good as not giving it in the first place.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If we are paying them top dollars for the job, we should expect better than these. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Is this all that our leaders are capable of doing in a crisis? Is saying sorry so hard? <br></span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><br>All the boosting about Singapore being number one in this and that, attracting top investment from here and there, are being unravelled and turning into thin air. INVESTOR WILL RUN IF MAS SELAMAT IS NOT CAUGHT. IT WILL BE WORSE THAN THE SARS AFFAIR. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Yet no one has spoken out on this issue. The opposition is quiet, the public is quiet. Why? Are we so numb that we are scared of voicing issue –issue that concerns our very own life?</span></p>

              <p>I fully agree with your view on how ministers should be answerable for the security plans and the lower rung officers be penalised for sheer negligence in execution.</p>
              <p>If there is any defects in the security plans the responsibility and accountability should fall entirely on the shoulders of the ministers. If there is poor overseeing of the security plans the prison superintendent and supervisory officers who are paid 5 figures should also lose their jobs.</p>
              <p>However I am afraid based on the public statements of our MM Lee and PM Lee the government minister and PM will excuse themselves from such responsibility and accountability and say that a mistake has been made but what can they do.</p>
              <p>They will try to attend to other issues and distract citizens' attention to this issue and suggest at other time that their job is to worry over the bigger policies and oversight of the entire goverment and they should not be pinned down for some minor oversight at the lower rung which may be inevitable.</p>
              <p>One wonders why in giving themselves the million dollar salaries they did not tell us citizens that they would defend to the last any attempt to make them take responsibility for any major policy fiasco as has happened with giving of wrong surpluses to justify GST increase or big screw-up in ERP.</p>
              <p>So the snakes slither off once again each time they were caught in the noose.</p>
