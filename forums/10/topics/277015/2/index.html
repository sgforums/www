The problem with "corruption" is that many of us feel that the law itself is corrupt. Now if some aspect of law is "corrupt" and it protects what other societies define as "corruption", then while technically in the country of its (the law) implementation, the act is not corrupt, it by no means can be used in comparison with another country.<br><br>In simpler words, of course we can say not corrupt. According to our definition ma~<br><br>This reminds me of a particular angsty blogger who once wrote that "we also have corruption. Just that ours in high class. We don't go from village to village to buy votes. We put money in their atm and even give it a name. Progress Packgage"<br><br>Hilarious stuff.<br><br>My point is that the smarter people resort to other forms of "enticement" which do not fall in the popular understanding of Bribery.<br><br>If we stripped away the flowery argument, for example the $180million carrot for upgrading, the statement effectively would read:<br><br>"You dont vote for me, I don't care whether you paid as much tax as the others, I'm not going to upgrade your houses"<br><br>Meritocracy what. You didn't merit the upgrading by voting for the opposition.<br><br>And then again, stripping the explanation for the Progress Package<br><br>"No lah.. its not about the election. It just so happens that we got money to give now [just before the elections], so we give la."<br><br>Compare that against vote-buying.<br><br>I wished the leaders in the other countries were smarter for their own sakes. They should take a leaf out of Singapore and "corruption" all over the world would reduce.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's a definition since you asked for it:<br><br>"Political Corruption", as a term by itself, to date is still being discussed without much headway. There are several schools of thought on this, continually arguing over the definition in order to justify their convictions.<br><br>I propose then, in order to get started on this topic, without having to waste time on definitions, that we use the simpler definitions afforded in dictionaries.<br><br>Political, as an adjective to the the noun, Corruption. Corruption by Politicians so to speak. Then it leaves us to define Corruption.<br><br>Corruption, very simply put is (according to dictionaries) - "dishonesty and illegal behaviour by people in power or authority"<br><br>Put together, it will be reasonable to define  for this argument, Political Corruption as Dishonest and/or Illegal Behavious by Politicians who are in authority.<br><br>Now, when MM Lee declared that our leaders were incorrupt, it should be seen in this context:<br><br>Singapore Leaders are not guilty of "illegal" behaviour according to OUR law.<br><br>The reason why we dont think this counts for much, is because Singapore's Law is passed by only one body without a referendum from the people. The Parliament which is dominated by PAP.<br><br>If I was a leader of a country, and I made every kind of law [and people had no power to complain] to protect my own ambitions and gains, I would most certainly be incorrupt by definition. There is no law that I've broken and hence not illegal.<br><br>Thus the stated definition of corruption is found lacking.<br><br>In view of all this, and addressing your very first motivation to start this thread, what we are effectively saying is that, there is nothing to be in awe of such a statement. It doesnt count for anything.</div>
