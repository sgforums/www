But why LKY wanted to join Malaysia if it wont benefit Singapore. On the other hand, LKY ruled Singapore too long and with iron fist to silence his opponents, so there is pros and cons. And I think he worries about the future of the world, the issue of global warming, but I think he would not able to see it, and most of us cant see it too, that will be 100 yrs from now where the ice melts will wipe out Singapore, that is his worry</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Catherine Lim<br><br>'Oh yes, Singapore is a model worthy of emulation by other societies but - '; 'Oh yes, I am very proud to be a Singaporean except for this fear thing that is still around, you know what I mean?'<br><br>3 pillars of sound governance<br><br>THE Singapore model has three features that are likely to authenticate and legitimate it in the eyes of the global community:<br><br>First, the tight political control is motivated not by megalomania, greed or corruption but their very opposite: a genuine concern for the welfare of the society.<br><br>Second, the method of getting rid of political dissidents is by due process of law or by the simple expedient of marginalising them.<br><br>Third, the sound pragmatism of a model that seeks only solid, practical results surely stands out in a world where ideology and high-sounding ideals have failed to solve problems.<br><br>The contrast has also led to an embarrassing anomaly. While Singapore is consistently ranked among the top three in global surveys on economic growth, business friendliness and so on, it is placed with North Korea, Myanmar and Iran when it comes to individual or press freedom.<br><br>Why is there this continuing government reluctance to open up at a time when it can well afford to do so?<br><br>There are three possible reasons. The first is historical continuity. This policy is part of an ongoing and enduring legacy from the Lee Kuan Yew era of tough rule.<br><br>The second reason is strategic. Tight control of even minor political issues means pre-emption of major ones, which, as the Government has always maintained, Singapore cannot afford, with its small size and dependence on the rest of the world to make a living.<br><br>The third reason is psychological - a natural distaste of a serious-minded and purposeful leadership for the noise and rowdiness of political debate and dissent.<br><br>Here is a government that has made no secret of an almost pathological dislike of polemics, posturing and populist rhetoric.<br><br>This aversion to political debate is the reason not only for the Government's continuing reluctance to make any change to its quiescent, inactive state but the reason for the desire to make that state permanent. Such a desire cannot obviously be openly articulated to an increasingly sophisticated and vocal electorate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>continued<br><br>Overall, this dual model is a very sophisticated strategy of containment, control and manipulation, by which the Government can have the political cake and eat it too: give every appearance of political freedom but ensure it is not the real thing, and meanwhile, behind the scenes, work at getting rid of it altogether.<br><br>Now, getting rid altogether of political dissent is something abhorrent to the free world and the Government is not about to provoke condemnation from a global community to which it is so comfortably, securely and advanta- geously linked.<br><br>But suppose it does the unimaginable, the truly ingenious. Suppose it turns things around and proves to the free world that this very condemnable act can lead to greater stability and prosperity for the society. Suppose it proves that dispensing with a major tenet of democracy can actually save democracy from itself.<br><br>The truth is that this is already happening. When the Singapore Government confidently tells inquisitive journalists and critics that it isdeveloping a model of governance that is geared specifically to the needs and aspirations of the people, it is in effect showcasing an alternative to the Western model of democracy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Catherine Lim<br><br>Indeed, the current high international standing of the Singapore Government is one of the reasons why it is succeeding so well in curbing political dissent at home. For if the world can accord such high praise to the leadership, how can its own people not believe that whatever it is doing must be right and good?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>continued<br><br>The result is that at no time has the dissident voice been more muted, at no time have political commentators stayed so warily away from the out- of-bounds markers. Political clubs such as the Roundtable have folded up; new ones are not likely to appear. And in an atmosphere of continuing anxiety, there will be continuing self-censorship. The greater the Government's efforts to raise material prosperity, the more irrelevant and even harmful will the role of the political activist be seen.</div>
