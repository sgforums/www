In this discussion thread we were challenged to show that LKY has at several places not made much sense.<br><br>The topic I brought up was that the statement<br><br>"Privatisation of the Public Services Would reduce prices due to Competition"<br><br>didn't make much sense.<br><br>By Privatisation of Public Services, in the Singapore context, was to make the company Public Listed, with a majority stake held by Temasek Holdings, which is a GLC or Government Linked Company. More clearly the GLC is a Lee-linked Company, rather than a Government Linked Company, for one can imagine that should the opposition parties take over the government one day, Temasek Holdings won't by default belong to it. Of course, new Laws passed then might do something to address this issue.<br><br>When a company is public listed, it is duty-bound to all her shareholders to increase profits. Whereas, a Public Service which is not privatised has no such obligation and aims to provide the services at cost.<br><br>What kind of Competition can reduce service prices lower than cost?<br><br>Based on the above logic, I see little sense in how Privatisation of the Public Services would reduce prices. It just doesn't tally up.<br><br>There, now we are back on track with the topic.<br><br></div>

Whereas they did contribute some degree of trouble, the use of the state apparatus to suppress them can be deemed excessive. Do not forget, that LKY himself aligned himself with them, and it was largely a political marriage of convenience. When they turned against him, he retaliated with his usual vindictiveness.
