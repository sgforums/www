            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has stressed that Singapore will go back to the days of where it started if it loses the system of government machinery that has evolved all these years.<br><br>In a wide-ranging interview with the International Herald Tribune, he explained that Singapore's leaders knew that if the country were like its neighbours, it would die as Singapore had nothing to offer against what they had.<br><br>Singapore had to produce something which was different and better than what its neighbours had, and that is, a system of government that is incorrupt, efficient, meritocratic and one which works.<br><br>Mr Lee noted that the Singapore system works regardless of race, language or religion. Otherwise, the country would have divisions.<br><br>He said: "We are pragmatists. We don't stick to any ideology. Does it work? Let's try it and if it does work, fine, let's continue it. If it doesn't work, toss it out, try another one.<br><br>"We are not enamoured with any ideology. Let the historians and the Ph.D students work out their doctrines. I'm not interested in theories per se."<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee also covered topics concerning the effects of global warming.<br><br>He said Singapore is already in consultations with Delft in Holland to learn how to build dikes.<br><br>He said: "It scares me, because many world leaders have not woken up to the peril that their populations are in. This melting ice cap. I expected great consternation!<br><br>"What would happen to this earth? But, no. Has it triggered off emergency meetings to do something about this? Earth warming, the glaciers melting away? Never mind the Swiss Alps and skiing resorts having to manufacture snow.<br><br>"When the glaciers in the Himalayas and Tibet melt away, the Ganges, the Yangtze, the Irrawaddy, the Mekong, may dry up, except for rainy seasons. What will happen to the hundreds of millions? Where do they go? Where can they go? This will be a very serious problem."<br><br>Mr Lee also touched on the economic challenges, with the rise of China and India. - CNA/ir<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Indisputable fact, Singapore Govt is incorrupt, in a court of law.<br><br>How can they be corrupt? Everything thing they do is legal. Firstly, PAP can change/enact laws, including the constitution. No one to challenge, PAP can just bulldoze through who ever speaks up against a constitutional amendment or bill? Whenever they need to do something new, they just enact new law to cover whatever they want to do. hence its a huge contributor to low or zero corruption.<br><br>Also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amakudari" rel="nofollow"> Amakudari</a> is not seen as corruption in Singapore. Of course no corruption.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote><br><strong>Amakudari</strong> is the institutionalised practice where Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high-profile positions in the private and public sectors. The practice is increasingly viewed as corrupt and a drag on unfastening the ties between private sector and state which prevent economic and political reforms.</blockquote></div>

FYI, independence was not the choice of the PAP. We were kicked out, and LKY was even distraught for a while after being kicked out.<br><br>Even before PAP came into power, singapore was already the economic leader in SE Asia. And in east Asia, behind only Japan and Hongkong.</div>
