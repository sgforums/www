              <p>be it a single ward or GRC, why dun they compete when the elections come? otherwise on earth are citizens and PR to cast their ballots at? I believe they are people who never ever gets to vote on election day, because its a walk-over at their ward. why? because the opposition did not contest at the ward?</p>
              <p>no wonder there is a saying, there are no opposition parties and there is only a single party in Singapore. is it because the opposition cant find enough candidates to challenge the incumbent or cant pay for the deposit?</p>
              <p>It would be better if they can form a coalition of sorts. I am not sure if I will ever get to see opposition parties winning at least 5-10 seats in parliament in my lifetime, never mind forming the government. even with 10-15 seats, they cant even oppose or obstruct laws passed by PAP in the parliament. that is why, technically speaking, PAP can pass any laws they want in parliament due to their overwhelming majority in parliament.</p>

              <p>Indeed, it is a good time for the opposition if the opposition can come up with good and workable proposals and they can convince the people with these proposals, not by election slogans, raising the issues only without any workable solutions and arouse emotions. People want to see workable solutions to the issues raised and they must be convinced that the opposition can implement these policies effectively.</p>
              <p>Hence, it is important that the opposition needs not only recruit people with oratory skills but also people with professional knowledge and expertise eg economists, lawyers, bankers, engineers, successful businessmen, teachers, lecturers,professors, retired high ranking officers, former high ranking civil servants and so on.</p>

              <p>Indeed, it is a good time for the opposition if the opposition can come up with good and workable proposals and they can convince the people with these proposals, not by election slogans, raising the issues only without any workable solutions and arouse emotions. People want to see workable solutions to the issues raised and they must be convinced that the opposition can implement these policies effectively.</p>

              <p>Foreign workers take over the jobs of dish washers, cleaners ?</p>
              <p>Indeed, it is true as these foreign workers (usually 20 - 35 years old) are cheaper, younger and can work work faster.</p>
              <p>If these foreign workers left, the dish washers, cleaners will go back to those Singaporeans in the 50s, 60s and 70s.</p>
              <p>Will Singaporeans then complain these workers are so slow, inefficient, more expensive, lazy ? We cannot blame these older workers to work slow as they are growing in age but the people will complain that these older workers cannot clean the tables and clear the trays etc quickly as these people are not patient especially during rush lunch hours.</p>
