            <div class='col-md body'>You can always take a budget flight to Thailand to buy your medicine what... (At the same time you can also buy cheap clothings, cheap food, etc)<br><br>When I went to USA, I noticed that many Americans travel into Mexico to buy prescription drugs, because the drugs in Mexico are cheaper than USA. (In Tijuana, a Mexican city next to the US border, most of the shops along the streets are pharmacies!)<br><br>However, when I went to Hong Kong, the situation is different... Hong Kongers are not so keen to go to China to buy drugs, because in China, anything can be fake (from fake Nike shoes and fake Gucci handbags to fake Viagra and fake milk powder). In fact, several years ago there was an incident when officials discovered that Chinese baby milk powder was mixed with ash. This created a panic, and many Chinese parents rush to HK to buy genuine baby milk powder, causing a shortage of milk powder in Hong Kong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Lowclassman:</div><div class="quote_body">The same tablet produced by the same manufacturer and in genuine packaging is easily available without prescription in Thailand for less than $0.80 per tablet.<br>The licensed manufacturer in India retails at $0.24 per tablet. Note this is not Â“copyÂ” tablet, which is sold at less than this amount.<br><br>To reduce patient cost, I suggest the Health Ministry (HM) allows patient to buy oneÂ’s drug and be held responsible for oneÂ’s consequences.<br>Why genuine drug in Thailand is so much cheaper than those Â“dispensedÂ” by the HM clinics? Are the traders making a large profit at the expense of patient? Should HM parallel import to give a run on those drug traders? Government is talking about free market and globalisation. Should such practice be available patients, the ultimate consumers? Patients and Govt are too worry of high medical cost Â… this is one good example in which cost can be reduced substantially.<br><br>Perhaps, patients should organise group purchase to demonstrate consumersÂ’ power.<br></div></blockquote>Thailand has introduced legislation for compulsory licensing of a number of drugs, bypasing the patent rights of the manufacturer. Whilst this benefits the patients, it also means that pharmaceutical companies would not invest in the country. Such a policy runs contrary to making the biomedical industry a pillar of Singapore's economy and will not work here.<br><br>Drugs are protected by patents for as long as 20 years...there are strict rules about parallel imports. If you are certain that a drug is genuine and is available in a foreign country, there is nothing to stop you from buying it there. If you end up with adverse effects from poor quality drugs or contamination, of course you may not be able to seek redress but that's your choice.<br><br>You can purchase for your own needs overseas. But if you try to buy in bulk and import it to Singapore, the pharmaceutical companies have the right to sue you. In addition, you cannot sell the drug to the public without a license and if anyone suffers harm as a result, you are liable, just like the Slim10 case.<br><br></div>
