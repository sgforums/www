            <div class='col-md body'>In July 2004, 12 drug manufacturers in China successfully challenged Pfizer's Viagra patent, in effect gaining the ability to make sildenafil citrate-containing drugs with impunity. A month later, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) bowed out from a dispute over the diabetes drug <strong>rosiglitazone (Avandia) </strong>after four Chinese manufacturers filed requests to invalidate their formulation patent. The manufacturers can now legally produce a version of the drug, although GSK retains the exclusive right to manufacture Avandia itself, as it holds patents on the manufacturing process and compound. "We saw the case was not that robust and decided it was sensible to withdraw," says GSK spokesman Chris Hunter-Ward.<br><br>Experts are following the two cases closely for indications of what this means for China's legal system, and its ability to protect patents. Pfizer launched an appeal in September 2004 with Bei-jing's First Intermediate People's Court. In March, a Chinese court adjourned a hearing on Pfizer's appeal and said a verdict will be delivered at a later date.<br><br>At the time of the decision, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive, Henry McKinnell, said the company was "extremely disappointed" and that the decision could discourage Pfizer from making further investments in China. Deputy US Trade Representative Josette Shiner described the challenge to Pfizer's patent as "particularly troubling" and the American Chamber of Commerce in China questioned China's commitment to respecting the intellectual property (IP) rights of foreign companies.<br><br>However, if Pfizer ultimately loses the case, it is unlikely to deter other drug manufacturers from the Chinese market, according to Alan Adcock, senior associate with IP consultants Rouse &amp; Co. International. "The market's too attractive," he says.<br><br>What it could do is push pharmaceutical companies to take patent protection in China more seriously, says Toby Mak, patent executive at international law firm Deacons in Hong Kong. "Chinese manufacturers are small, but if they can come together they have sufficient resources to play the patent game."<br><br>Arguably, grappling with patent infringement goes with the territory of staking an early claim to China's huge and growing pharmaceuticals market. Western medicine accounts for 67% of the total market, of which over 70% is in the form of generic drugs, according to China's State Food and Drug Administration. Last year, China's pharmaceuticals market was the fastest growing in the world, with sales up 28% to $9.5 billion (US), according to international pharmaceutical and healthcare consultants IMS. By 2010, it is expected to be worth $24 billion. That number is peanuts compared to the $466 billion market in the US, but still the fifth largest in the world after the United States, Japan, Germany, and France.<br><br>http://www.the-scientist.com/article/display/15489/<br><br>Cheap generics of this drug from China are available.
