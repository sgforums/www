I believe Australia should not accept any migrant who is not prepared to adapt him or herself to that culture/society.The same goes for us, no one will put out a welcome mat for someone to come into their house, then diss and rant about how incompatible our furniture is with him.</div></blockquote>I fully agreed with your comment and remarks. Once you are in other ppl country at least show some courtesy and try to get along and not asking the majority to follow and obey the minority.<br><br>We dont feel what the Aussie felt.
