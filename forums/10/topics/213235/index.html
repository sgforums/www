            <div class='col-md body'>For one thing i know, the aussies are very patriotic and they want to preserve the "aussie" culture, and they think what is ruining or might ruin this "aussie" culture is the influx of immigrants, and these immigrants, afraid to say, are muslims. Since the 911 attacks and the constant media attention on muslims, the hate now turns to muslims. In australian history, aussies used to hate "wogs" which are greek/italians, then they disliked asians, and had a political party promising to drive asians out. now its the turn of the muslims.<br><br>Australia is a free country and they have freedom of speech, and they really embrace their freedom of speech, however, the concepts of freedom and freedom of speech are  negated by the media's portrayal of muslims. and surely we singaporeans know that islam is peace?<br><br>but yea lar, the cartoons are distasteful. but we dont have that sort of cartoons here in western australia.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just a bit of a background info that I get from the Aussie "Today" show every morning. They are having some major debate in their immigration policy, a good deal of them thinks that Australia is "white people" country and there are values such as freedom of speech that should not be compromised. And they, just like some Singaporeans are quite pissed about having too many FT as well and therefore lots of squabbling whether they should tighten their immigration policy.  Then recently after the Pope said something that the Muslims don't like, some smart Aussie priest decided to backed the Pope and said something else that the Muslims don't like. The responds from the Muslim community there wasn't too good, same deal, asking for apology and stuff. The white Aussies, or at least some of them, aren't too happy and said that everybody has a freedom of speech, so don't need to apologiese. Some of their political commentater also feel that if they keep quiet about Muslims issue all the time, they are being too politically correct. And thus, all these strange comics.</div>

But you didn't realise that australia is an even more multi-racial country than singapore is. So lets not dig into other country's affairs since s'pore does not like others digging in its affairs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
