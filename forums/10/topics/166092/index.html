Why should one man or one party be given this authority?<br><br>Power corrupts and the longer you hold on, the more stubborn and twisted you become.<br><br>Such a society becomes a society of lemmings, where the leader points and the sheep follow.

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree totally about the part on concentrating power. I suggest Singapore should follow the ancient greeks, scrape elections and have a  post called dictator for life. Thinking about double standards and gold taps is too  hazardous for the health.  Having controlled information makes people happy. We should have a small elite that thinks for us and teach us how to live, our education curiculumn should also be controlled by the new dictator for life and our society will be more compact and there will be less unhappy people. Too much noise about unfairness will divide people and the country will eventually collapse in the long run.</div>

Politics is a dirty game, the old guard were "renewed" completely in 1984 leaving only one leader.The selfless contribution of the Old guard are no longer recognized in Singapore history - we are left with a Dear Leader. Reading comments of these Ex- old guard leaders of Singapore who have lost power gives me creeps.....<br><br>If a company and removes all the old experienced people leaving only one experienced leader,the power becomes too concentrated in one person. No doubt there are good people in the goverment, but how many? Under the current election system, leaders who has never been voted can continue for a long time in the goverment.<br><br>If our Dear leader did not put so many relatives in top position, i might have  probably still have supported them. The current system leaves too many questions to be asked<br><br>In the current goverment , there are no check and balances. What happens if a power struggle take place? Will Singapore become a fascist country?<br><br></div>

I can think of a few ways to increase the voting power of groups who are more likely to support the government:<br><br>1. Those who are contributing more to the nation deserve a greater say. So we will give additional votes to those who pay more than $10k in income tax each year, those who are in senior government service, those who have graduate qualifications, those who hold senior positions in government linked companies, those who hold senior positions in the uniformed services etc..<br><br>2. Permanent residents contribute to the nation's economy. So we give a vote to all permanent residents who are employed and have at least secondary education<br><br>3. To encourage scholars to return and keep our talent pool. We give additional votes to scholars and members of the elite<br><br>4. It is ridiculous that criminals who have evil intentions towards the nation should have the right to vote. So we strip voting rights from convicted criminals guilty of more serious offences..<br><br>I am not an elite. Doubtless the elite class can think of more innovative measures...</div>
