              If i don't remember wrongly there were about 3000 households who were in arrears in their utilities bills in early 2000s. Had PUB not been overcharging us in water and electricity, these households might not be in debts.

              Water conservation tax hard to swallow
              
              I REFER to last Saturday's letter ('Need for water conservation tax') by Mr Chan Yoon Kum, assistant chief executive of national water agency PUB, in response to my letter ('Shouldn't we pay less for consuming water?') on July 8.
              
              Mr Chan did not address the crux of my question, which was this: After many decades of conscientiously and successfully pursuing water conservation measures, is it necessary to continue using a hefty pricing mechanism to penalise consumers for some incremental reduction?
              
              What is the ideal limit of water consumption in our hot and humid climate without compromising basic hygiene that would convince the PUB to remove the water conservation tax and waterborne fees?
              
              According to a study in 2003, 'The water issue between Singapore and Malaysia: No solution in sight?', by Dr Lee Poh Onn, a Fellow of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore produced 1.3 million cubic m of water per day. The PUB revealed that by last year, the daily capacity had increased to more than 1.4 million cubic m, of which domestic households consumed half and the rest was sold for commercial revenues.
              
              The report quoted that our raw water processing cost was 25.3 cents per cubic m. Dr Lee summarised the production cost of imported water at 26 cents, Newater at 39 cents and desalination water at 78 cents (exchange rate of S$1 to RM$2.08 in 2003).
              
              By 2011, the PUB will be producing 1.33 million cubic m of water (0.68 million cubic m from catchments, 0.4 million cubic m from desalination and 0.25 million cubic m of Newater).
              
              Based on the 2003 study, the average cost would be 41.5 cents per cubic m. With a 20 per cent increase, the cost is about 50 cents per cubic m.
              
              There is hardly any justification for responsible consumers to pay $2.21 per cubic m of water quoting Mr Chan's example. The water tariff in Johor Baru is 36 cents (90 Malaysian sen), while that in Hong Kong is HK$4.15 (80 Singapore cents) per cubic m.
              
              Is it logical or reasonable for Singaporeans to pay over four times the recovery cost of drinking water - a basic human need?
              
              While it is laudable that Singapore proudly and unselfishly helps solve the water dilemma by sharing its drinking water technology with the world, the country's citizens should also share the benefits of Singapore's water success.
              
              It took us a long time to get to where we are now; where we are self-sufficient with less imported water if needed on a sustainable basis.
              
              Tax revenues and sanitary fees should cover the maintenance cost of the sanitation system. Hence, the water conservation tax and waterborne fees have lost their intended purposes. They can only become an extra burden on citizens.

              <p>In turn, PUB is to resell a minimum of 17 million gallons per day of treated water to Johor at $0.13 per 1000 gallons.</p>
              <p>If the PUB is selling treated water to Johor at 13 cents per thousand gallons - (when the cost of treating the water is 63 cents per thousand gallons), why is the PUB pricing the treated water higher to Singaporean consumers ?</p>
              <p>There is no reason for the PUB to justify higher prices even if it is to cover the cost for the new treatment plants to recycle waste water into <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pmo.gov.sg/News/Speeches/Prime+Minister/Speech+by+PM+Lee+at+the+Official+Opening+of+Keppel+Seghers+Ulu+Pandan+NEWater+Plant.htm">‘NEWater,’  </a>- as the NEWater is sold to the industrial users at $1.00 per cubic meter - with the cost of the treatment plant being amortized over a longer period of 20 years or more.</p>

              <p>My question is how much water does a family have to use for the water conversation tax to make a significant impact on living expenses.</p>
              <p>My home has 4 adults, 2 working and 2 working from home with the water bill + conservation tax comes up to around 20 dollars.</p>
              <p>Say we do reduced the water conservation tax, would it really help the poor families who already had low water usage to save money ? Or would families who could already well afford the tax be encouraged to waste more of it ?</p>
              <p>My standpoint is from a conservation point of view, so i don't really support the idea of removing or even reducing the water conservation tax.</p>

              <p><br>If we assume that one household consist of four to five persons - the following amount of water usage can be estimated based on a per person per day basis:</p>
              <p>Consumption: 2 litres</p>
              <p>Cooking: 3 litres</p>
              <p>Laundry: 5 litres</p>
              <p>General washing: 5 litres</p>
              <p>Personal Hygiene: 25 litres</p>
              <p>Toilet flushing: 30 litres</p>
              <p>Total: 70 litres per person per day</p>
              <p>Household of 4 will use 280 litres per day</p>
              <p>Household of 5 will use 350 litres per day</p>
              <p>Note that these are not absolute figures and are estimates based on assumptions of personal habits.</p>
              <p>The total water used per month will be 8,400 litres or 8.4 cubic meter for a household of 4 persons; and 10,500 litres or 10.5 cubic meter for a household 5 persons.</p>

              <p>What guideline should we use to determine what is to be the reasonable amount of water consumed per household ?</p>
              <p>Obviously the lifestyle of different income groups will affect the amount of water used, and the higher the costs of the water charged - it will affect the amount of water used by the lower income group more than it does to the higher income group.</p>
              <p>The next social costs to be considered is that if the lower income group should reduce the amount of water used to the extent that it affects hygiene standards - will it then increase the Healthcare costs to look after this group ?</p>

              <pre>ST Forum &gt; Online Story<br>
              Water conservation tax hard to swallow
              </pre>
              <p><span>I REFER</span> to last Saturday’s letter (‘Need for water conservation tax&amp;#8217<img title="Wink" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"> by Mr Chan Yoon Kum, assistant chief executive of national water agency <span>PUB</span>, in response to my letter (‘Shouldn’t we pay less for consuming water?&amp;#8217<img title="Wink" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"> on July 8.</p>
              <p>Mr Chan did not address the crux of my question, which was this: After many decades of conscientiously and successfully pursuing water conservation measures, is it necessary to continue using a hefty pricing mechanism to penalise consumers for some incremental reduction?</p>
              <p>What is the ideal limit of water consumption in our hot and humid climate without compromising basic hygiene that would convince the <span>PUB</span> to remove the water conservation tax and waterborne fees?</p>
              <p>According to a study in 2003, ‘The water issue between Singapore and Malaysia: No solution in sight?’, by Dr Lee Poh Onn, a Fellow of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore produced 1.3 million cubic m of water per day. The <span>PUB</span> revealed that by last year, the daily capacity had increased to more than 1.4 million cubic m, of which domestic households consumed half and the rest was sold for commercial revenues.</p>
              <p>The report quoted that our raw water processing cost was 25.3 cents per cubic m. Dr Lee summarised the production cost of imported water at 26 cents, Newater at 39 cents and desalination water at 78 cents (exchange rate of S$1 to RM$2.08 in 2003).</p>
              <p>By 2011, the <span>PUB</span> will be producing 1.33 million cubic m of water (0.68 million cubic m from catchments, 0.4 million cubic m from desalination and 0.25 million cubic m of Newater).</p>
              <p>Based on the 2003 study, the average cost would be 41.5 cents per cubic m. With a 20 per cent increase, the cost is about 50 cents per cubic m.</p>
              <p>There is hardly any justification for responsible consumers to pay $2.21 per cubic m of water quoting Mr Chan’s example. The water tariff in Johor Baru is 36 cents (90 Malaysian sen), while that in Hong Kong is HK$4.15 (80 Singapore cents) per cubic m.</p>
              <p>Is it logical or reasonable for Singaporeans to pay over four times the recovery cost of drinking water – a basic human need?</p>
              <p>While it is laudable that Singapore proudly and unselfishly helps solve the water dilemma by sharing its drinking water technology with the world, the country’s citizens should also share the benefits of Singapore’s water success.</p>
              <p>It took us a long time to get to where we are now; where we are self-sufficient with less imported water if needed on a sustainable basis.</p>
              <p>Tax revenues and sanitary fees should cover the maintenance cost of the sanitation system. Hence, the water conservation tax and waterborne fees have lost their intended purposes. They can only become an extra burden on citizens.</p>

              <p>Hi TS</p>
              <p>It all makes sense if you consider Singapore to be a 3rd world nation where there is a shortage of water like Afrika. Thats why water is so expensive here</p>

              <p>Your cynical views about the water conditions in Malaysia and Indonesia shows the typical ugly Singaporean habit of believing that all things Singapore is more superior than anyone can possibly have - and make comparisons with a condescending view.</p>
              <p>If the Malaysians and Indonesians have such bad water quality, there will be constant headlines that shout of high incidences of water-borne diseases - have you read any such occurrences that appear repeatedly through the years ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only stupid people like you will listen and believe LKY's guarantee that it is safe to drink directly from the tap when in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe that he will pay for your medical bills if you get sick when drinking directly from the tap ?</p>
              <p>If you are living in the HDB, do you know that the treated clean water from the PUB is pumped into the roof top storage tanks before being distributed to the individual units in the HDB block ?</p>
              <p>No-one knows what is inside the water tank, and if you will take the trouble to pass the water through any kind of filter - (even a fabric bag at the tap) - you will notice a layer of brown muck forming within a week.</p>
              <p>Even for private home dwellers, can anyone be assured that the main or subsidiary water pipe lines have got no foreign matters entering the supply pipes ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you think that the rivers that flow from the mountains and rain water will bring enough water to every villages, towns and cities in Malaysia and Indonesia ?</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the Klang Valley in Selangor is already facing water shortages during the dry periods every year. </p>

              <p>Your cynical views about the water conditions in Malaysia and Indonesia shows the typical ugly Singaporean habit of believing that all things Singapore is more superior than anyone can possibly have - and make comparisons with a condescending view.</p>
              <p>If the Malaysians and Indonesians have such bad water quality, there will be constant headlines that shout of high incidences of water-borne diseases - have you read any such occurrences that appear repeatedly through the years ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only stupid people like you will listen and believe LKY's guarantee that it is safe to drink directly from the tap when in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe that he will pay for your medical bills if you get sick when drinking directly from the tap ?</p>
              <p>If you are living in the HDB, do you know that the treated clean water from the PUB is pumped into the roof top storage tanks before being distributed to the individual units in the HDB block ?</p>
              <p>No-one knows what is inside the water tank, and if you will take the trouble to pass the water through any kind of filter - (even a fabric bag at the tap) - you will notice a layer of brown muck forming within a week.</p>
              <p>Even for private home dwellers, can anyone be assured that the main or subsidiary water pipe lines have got no foreign matters entering the supply pipes ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you think that the rivers that flow from the mountains and rain water will bring enough water to every villages, towns and cities in Malaysia and Indonesia ?</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the Klang Valley in Selangor is already facing water shortages during the dry periods every year. </p>

              <p>It all makes sense if you consider Singapore to be a 3rd world nation where there is a shortage of water like Afrika. Thats why water is so expensive here</p>

              <p>Have you stayed in a hotel in Indonesia and taken the trouble to find out where they get their water supply, or did you just listen to conversation from the people visiting your bar and talk when they are drunk ?</p>
