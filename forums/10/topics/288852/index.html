The traffic situation doesn't seem to improve. I think they must look at it more fundamentally, look from another point of view instead of increasing ERP."<br><br>Harry Soh, another motorist, said: "We are already financing a heavy petrol price right now so any increase in ERP, increases the burden of our so-called livelihood Â– we don't get a pay increment, but everything else is increasing!"<br><br>Some also have suggestions on how to ease the congestion on the roads.<br><br>"The COE should go higher, around S$80,000. The traffic is horrible, especially at the CTE and TPE. We must reduce the vehicle volume; there are just too many vehicles on the road," said Oh Boon Song, a taxi driver.<br><br>Janet Chee, another motorist, said: "If we can plan our route earlier or leave earlier, maybe it won't be so crowded. I don't know how we are going to expand the roads."<br><br>The ERP rate hike will be implemented on 5 November.<br></div>
