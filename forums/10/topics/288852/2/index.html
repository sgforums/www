The traffic situation doesn't seem to improve. I think they must look at it more fundamentally, look from another point of view instead of increasing ERP."<br><br>Harry Soh, another motorist, said: "We are already financing a heavy petrol price right now so any increase in ERP, increases the burden of our so-called livelihood Â– we don't get a pay increment, but everything else is increasing!"<br><br>Some also have suggestions on how to ease the congestion on the roads.<br><br>"The COE should go higher, around S$80,000. The traffic is horrible, especially at the CTE and TPE. We must reduce the vehicle volume; there are just too many vehicles on the road," said Oh Boon Song, a taxi driver.<br><br>Janet Chee, another motorist, said: "If we can plan our route earlier or leave earlier, maybe it won't be so crowded. I don't know how we are going to expand the roads."<br><br>The ERP rate hike will be implemented on 5 November.<br>[/b]</blockquote>This is a prime example of people making their own lives miserable. The purpose of ERP is to discourage people from driving their own cars and using the roads. Yet by complaining about the ERP charges and yet paying out of their own free will, these drivers are just showing the government that the ERP is not really working and that there is further scope for increase in charges as the people are still willing to pay.<br><br>It's time these drivers realise that in Singapore, having and driving your own car is a premium luxury. If they can't really afford it, they should just take public transport and stop complaining about the high costs of car ownership and usage.<br><br>And if you'd like to know I don't own any car and neither will I ever. I don't even have a driving license, as I think that car ownership in Singapore is just a bottomless pit for your money, and the benefits simply will not outweigh the costs ever.<br><br>Therefore, this is a prime example of how the Bear says Singaporeans are making themselves miserable by running the rat race and trying to "one-up" the next person in terms of status and ostentatious consumption.</div>

Those who increase are afraid that<br><br>they will close down in a matter of time. I was in Clementi when some of the stall after renovation closed. Another stall increased n later decreased back to original price. The victim hit hardest will be stall owner.</div>
