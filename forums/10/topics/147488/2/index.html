Cheok, told The Straits Times: '(The time given) is just too short. It happened so suddenly.'<br><br>It's the second blow to his 40-year-old practice, which has already seen patient numbers drop by 40 per cent since last year because of the Circle Line works nearby.<br><br>An apartment owner, Madam Ek Kim Chai, was at a loss what to tell her tenants, who still have about one year left on their lease.<br><br>'I hope the Government can help us compensate our tenants, since we'd have to break our contracts with them,' said the 60-year-old retiree. 'It's just too fast.'<br><br>Each owner will be given an ex gratia payment of up to $100,000 per unit on top of compensation, which will be determined by valuers.<br><br>The LTA's deputy chief executive, Mr Low Tien Sio, told the media last night the Government will also take into account the individual needs of owners when determining their compensation.<br><br>'We'll try our very best to help them,' he said.<br><br></div></blockquote>1) The timing was too quick, too much of a last-minute process and obviously just too adrupt and rude.

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : The Singapore Land Authority has worked out a compensation package of about $17 million to owners of the 35 units at Hock Kee House in Paya Lebar.<br><br>On Thursday, the owners were informed of the compensation under the Land Acquisition Act, which SLA says is pegged to the current market value.<br><br>But some owners say the amount offered to them is up to 40 percent less than the valuation by their private valuers.<br><br>Since the government informed owners of Hock Kee House of the need to move a month ago, eight have already done so.<br><br>Another 24 units have indicated that they will move out before October 3 deadline.<br><br>The SLA said it had taken into account reports by the state valuer, as well as submissions by owners in working out the compensation package.<br><br>The statutory compensation is over and above the $3.2 million Special Assistance Financial Package by the Land Transport Authority.<br><br>There is also an ex-gratia payment for those who may suffer some hardship because of the acquisition at short-notice.<br><br>Simon Ong, Director of Land Resource Business at SLA, said: "The principle of payment for this ex-gratia is hardship. By hardship, we looked at individuals' special conditions. Such as their medical conditions, their mortgage status and so on."<br><br>The ex-gratia payment is on a case-by-case basis, so not every owner will get it.<br><br>But that is not the only reason owners of Hock Kee House are upset.<br><br>Of the 35 owners, 26 say they are not satisfied with the compensation amount they have been offered.<br><br>Tan Oon Fei, house owner at Hock Kee House, said: "The compensation given by SLA today is $300K. But according to my valuer, the report was $522,000. The difference is so wide! With this $300K given by SLA, I cannot even buy a same unit as mine!<br><br>"If you want to be fair, you need to compensate me with market value. Compensate with an amount which I can buy on the market value. But this is not the case!"<br><br>Ng Chee Lye, Coffeeshop owner at Hock Kee House, said: "They pay me only $1 million. My valuer valued at $1.56 million. So I am in the loss, so even in the open market, I cannot buy a coffeeshop which has around 3,000 square feet!<br><br>"Also, we claim for the ex-gratia - it is not given to me. They just give me the valuation of one million dollars."<br><br>The owners have up to September 29 to lodge an appeal (with the Appeals Board). - CNA/de<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh... Valuations are subjective to a certain extent. What is a fair value is often debated not only informally but also in the courts. Just an example, pick up the phone now and call a few bankers. Tell them that you want to re finance your house but do not know the value. They will come back to you with differing values.<br><br>The report on ST today is damn funny.<br><br>Businessman L.K. Tan, 57 who owns a garment shop feels the same way. "Not much," he said of his $1.11million offer from SLA. " In the mid 1990s, we had an offer of more than $2million," he said in Mandarin.<br><br>Yup he said in right.... <strong>Mid 1990s</strong> even my 5-room HDB in AMK was worth $550,000.00 and now its only $330,000.00 How can we compare values of Real Estate in two time periods that differ so much in economic performance?<br><br>On the other hand, the last paragraph is the KILLER!<br><br>Several owners are expected to appeal for a bigger payout. They have two weeks to file an appeal. Such a move <strong>does not require them to stay put. They can appeal and still move out by Oct 3 deadline, said LTA</strong><br><br>So you can appeal the decision, but have nothing on hand to act as  a bargaining tool!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's a pity that the people living within the perimeter of building the MRT line circle would be affected. LTA gave them a month's notice to evacuate the place. Why one month notice? The government can give six months notice before general election starts. The management needs to do some statistics and compensate the tenants accordingly and valuate the area appropriately. One month notice is not enough to convince those tenants to move out. LTA should be convincing enough to give them time to find a location before moving out. I think the nicoll highway incident didn't give LTA a month notice, but, a sudden destruction. Management in LTA should shape up or Ship out.</div>
