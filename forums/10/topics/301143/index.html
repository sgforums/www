Pictures: SHIN MIN DAILY NEWS<br><br>But that was all it took to anger a teenager, who ended up punching a SMRT bus captain in the face.<br><br>This incident on New Year's Day is the most recent of three assaults on bus captains in the past week.<br><br>The drama that started on board bus service 961 played out before the eyes of some residents of a Bukit Timah condominium on Tuesday.<br><br>A ninth-storey resident, who wanted to be known only as Mrs Ong, 39, said her dinner preparations were disrupted at 7.40pm by loud shouting.<br><br>She looked out of her window and saw more than 20 passengers alighting from a bus that had stopped, in the process of pulling out of the bus bay.<br><br>The housewife said: 'There was a commotion at the bus stop. Five or six foreign workers had formed a ring around a boy to stop him from leaving.'<br><br>She said the workers left when the bus captain alighted from his vehicle.<br><br>Thinking the drama was over, Mrs Ong returned to her dinner. But that was when the confrontation escalated into blows.<br><br>An SMRT spokesman said the bus captain was 'injured in the eye' from punches thrown by the youth.<br><br>A police spokesman said the victim, a man in his early 30s, was later sent to the National University Hospital (NUH) with facial injuries.<br><br>The bus captain, who wanted to be known only as Mr Edward, told Shin Min Daily News that he had held the youth's arm to prevent him from leaving.<br><br>Quick as lightning, the teen swung his fist at the driver three times and hit him before breaking free from the latter's grasp.<br><br>'After the teen shook me off, I managed to grab his T-shirt, but he slipped it off and tried to leave,' Mr Edward said.<br><br>The problem began when the youth and a female friend stood too close to the rear door, preventing it from closing.<br><br>When the captain asked them to move towards the rear, the boy got angry.<br><br>VERBAL ABUSE<br><br>Mr Edward said: 'He started shouting vulgarities at me. He then walked up and asked if I was not happy with him.<br><br>'I asked him to calm down or I'd call the police to handle the matter.'<br><br>When the youth continued his verbal abuse, the driver called the police on his handphone.<br><br>The teen then alighted from the bus, but was prevented from leaving by the foreign workers.<br><br>Mrs Ong said she heard shouting again a few minutes after the workers had walked away.<br><br>'The bus captain had quite a big build and was taller than the teen, who looked about 18 or 19 years old. But the teen was very aggressive. He acted like a hooligan.'<br><br>She said when the shirtless teen walked away from the bus stop, the captain followed him and pushed his head.<br><br>'It was quite dangerous as they were pushing each other on the left lane of the road.'<br><br>The teen then hailed a taxi but the cabby refused to drive off after Mr Edward related what had happened.<br><br>The bus captain and teen then walked back to the bus stop.<br><br>After the police and paramedics arrived soon after, Mrs Ong saw the youth being taken away in a police car.<br><br>The police said investigations are ongoing.<br><br>Two SBS Transit bus captains were also assaulted in the past week.<br><br>Ms Tammy Tan, director of corporate communications, SBS Transit, said the assailants in both cases appeared to be drunk.<br><br>She said a passenger boarded SBS Transit service 240 at Boon Lay Way 'reeking of alcohol' last Friday at 7.35pm.<br><br>The man ignored bus captain Woo Chee Wha's requests to pay up at first, but did so eventually.<br><br>However, a few bus stops later, the man alighted from the rear door.<br><br>He then got on the bus again from the front entrance and, without any warning, punched Mr Woo.<br><br>Three other passengers immediately went to the captain's aid and stopped the man from fleeing.<br><br>The police arrived soon after, and an ambulance took Mr Woo to the NUH where he was given outpatient treatment for a 'swollen, bruised eye'. He is on six days' medical leave.<br><br>Ms Tan said: 'We know that there are many good Samaritans out there who have tried to stop such abuse. We thank them for their help.<br><br>'We continue to seek the assistance of all commuters to report such abuses to the police should they witness any.'<br><br>She said assaults on bus captains have nearly doubled from 14 cases in 2006 to 26 cases in 2007.<br><br>Bus captains have been 'slapped, punched and even kicked', she noted.<br><br>'Such brutish behaviour is inexcusable... since it is causing hurt to people who are just doing their job.'<br><br>In an incident last Saturday at 4.40pm, a young man was 'creating a racket' on board SBS Transit service 58, said Ms Tan.<br><br>Bus captain Tommy Yong asked the operations control centre for help as the passenger 'appeared drunk'.<br><br>But before the traffic inspector could arrive, the passenger had punched Mr Yong's nose, which started to bleed profusely.<br><br>By then, all the passengers had alighted.<br><br>A call was made to the police. An ambulance took the bus captain to Changi General Hospital.<br><br>He suffered a fractured nose and requires specialist medical follow-up treatment.<br><br>Ms Tan said SBS Transit will not hesitate to 'take action against... assailants where appropriate'.<br><br>She said: 'We... are dismayed at what some commuters have done to our bus captains, particularly during the festive season...<br><br>'The only saving grace is that the number of cases dropped in the second half of 2007 after we launched the Â‘Stop Bus Captain Assaults' campaign in June.'<br><br>The assault cases decreased from 18 in the first six months to eight in the second half of the year.<br><br></div>
