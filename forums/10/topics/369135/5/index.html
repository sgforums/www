              <div id="article" class="module-content">
              <p class="intro"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">WHEN American Chip Goodyear, the former chief executive of BHP Billiton, walked into the legal department of the Singapore government's $100 billion investment fund Temasek earlier this year, he looked around and saw files everywhere.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The chief executive in waiting, a 51-year-old urbane Ivy League graduate and international business executive, was not impressed.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Word went out across the organisation, which is one of the world's oldest sovereign wealth funds: tidy up your room in case Chip walks in.</p>
              <p>Singapore's business community was abuzz yesterday with the surprising news that Goodyear would not be taking over as head of the powerful investment agency as planned on October 1.</p>
              <p>The agency, which has stakes in most of Singapore's blue-chip companies including Singapore Airlines, Singtel, and Singapore power, has been run for the past 5 1/2 years by the low-key Ho Ching, the wife of Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>The official statement revealing that Goodyear would be pulling out of the job, less than six months after accepting and joining the Temasek board, said there had been "differences regarding strategic issues that could not be resolved".</p>
              <p>"In the light of the differences both parties decided that it was in their mutual interest to terminate (the) leadership transition process," the statement said.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Speculation about reasons for the split yesterday ranged from the idea that Goodyear may have found he did not have the freedom he wanted to run Temasek, to a possible rift caused by his US management style clashing with Temasek's public service-orientated culture. </strong></span></p>
              <p>One Singapore blog yesterday contained a spoof poster of the movie Runaway Bride, depicting Goodyear, dressed in a white wedding dress, lacing his running shoes and getting ready to escape from a cardigan-wearing Ho Ching. "Catch him if you can," it added.</p>
              <p>"Every one is talking about it today," American David Cohen, director of Asian economic forecasting for Action Economics, told The Australian. "I assume, at the end of the day, that he wanted to move in some direction and they (the Temasek board) insisted on telling him he couldn't do it.</p>
              <p>"It's a little embarrassing for them. It was a plum job for Goodyear. Jobs managing $100billion portfolios don't come along every day."</p>
              <p>The news in February that <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">someone of international standing was to become the first foreigner to run the agency, founded in 1974, was a sign of the board's desire to bring in fresh talent.</span></strong></p>
              <p>It was also seen as <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>a way of calming community concern about the losses incurred</strong></span> by Temasek, whose <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>assets fell from $US134 billion</strong></span> in March 2008 to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>$US84bn</strong></span> by the end of last year.</p>
              <p>Only last month, Singapore's founder, Lee Kwan Yew, was lauding Goodyear's appointment, saying: "We hired the best."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #333333;">But as Goodyear walked the corridors of Temasek's Singapore headquarters in the past few months, it became obvious that</span> <strong>he brought a very different management style to the organisation.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #333333;">Yesterday's Wall Street Journal noted that</span> <strong>Goodyear had been keen to instill a "tighter sense of discipline" in the organisation, fining people for turning up late for meetings and banning the use of Blackberries during meetings.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #333333;">A keen cyclist, Goodyear started an in-house cycling club in the organisation. </span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">He was known for walking around the organisation, entering offices unannounced and chatting informally to staff. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The culture gap between the Wall Street-honed executive who had never lived in Singapore and the complex, more bureaucratic approach of the government-owned agency was becoming apparent. Singapore is one of the Asian countries most open to Westerners, but there are many cultural differences that are not always immediately obvious to outsiders. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">"It would not have been easy for an outsider, particularly a Westerner, to come into a big Singapore Government-owned organisation," said one Singaporean academic yesterday. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">"He would have a lot of work to do to get used to the local politics, society and management culture." </span></strong></p>
              <p>With his strong background in the mining industry, there had been much speculation that Goodyear might cut back Temasek's extensive investment in international banks and finance houses to focus on commodities and natural resources. Goodyear, who joined BHP in 1999 as chief financial officer, was instrumental in building the company into the world's top mining company largely as a result of its merger with Billiton of South Africa.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Under Ho Ching, Temasek boosted its holdings in financial stocks to about 40 per cent of its total investment. It was a move that cost the organisation dearly in the wake of the global financial crisis. Temasek lost more than $US4 billion on its investments in organisations such as Merrill Lynch, Barclays Bank and Bank of America. Under Ho, the organisation also made its controversial investment in Shin Corporation of Thailand, the telecommunications company controlled by former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The embarrassing transaction provoked a storm of controversy, becoming one of the factors behind his demise as prime minister. Once known for its secrecy, Temasek has made steps in recent years to become more transparent. It began releasing annual reports and meeting with foreign journalists.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Its public relations staff have made several visits to Australia in the past few years to explain the organisation and its strategy and to stress its independence from the Singapore Government.</p>
              <p>But its attempts at openness have only gone so far.</p>
              <p>Asked to comment about Goodyear's departure, New Zealand-born businessman Simon Israel, who joined Temasek several years ago as an executive director, said: " Unfortunately, from time to time, chief executive succession does not work out, no matter how carefully it is prepared.</p>
              <p>"This is the case here and I wouldn't read more into it. Our press release has explained the reason for it and we are not going to elaborate further."<br><br><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/business/story/0,28124,25821574-36418,00.html">http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/business/story/0,28124,25821574-36418,00.html</a></p>

              <p>This unexpected down turn give Wall Street and outsider a peek at Temasek.......Its a messy portfolio with ill discipline habit.</p>
              <p>The other aspect is that the total asset valuation could be Worst/ in other word less than 84 Billion. and they are operating in RED.  The guy sees that he has no way of turning it around. The hole is probably bigger than we know.</p>
              <p> At the end of the day after all the foreign Talent Talk...........if there are no "Real" insider leadership no matter what foreign talent you bring in it will be messy.</p>
              <p>It maybe singapore loss that goodyear did not take up the job.  </p>

              <p>Is it any wonder why Temasek has lost so much money?</p>
              <p>Taking aside the cronyism that exists through the appointment of incompetent cronies and minions of the fascists running this regime, the risk management and liquidity issues confronting real-world financial institutions are non-existent in this utopian conglomerate.</p>
              <p>Then again, if you're going to have a virtually ceaseless inflow of cash (aka via the State treasury and the noble ponzi scheme known as CPF) with little accountability involved (yes, daughter-in-law reporting to husband and father-in-law with other state apparatus rubber-stamping all dynasty-mandated edicts is not accountable <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png">), what's the big deal in losing billions?</p>
              <p>Throw in the fact that liquidity issues are non-existent since this fascist-controlled conglomerate also holds sizable stakes in various money-making monopolies in several industries (from DBS to Singtel, Singapore Power to Starhub) - and has further backing of legislation to undermine market forces in undermining its stranglehold on such monopolies - all it needs to do to balance its books (or make it look more palatable to compensate for its investment losses) is increase the prices of the services provided by the aforementioned monopolies.</p>
              <p>Is it lost on anyone as to why the appointment of senior executives of all state-controlled monopolies which Temasek has a vested interest in invariably needs to be vetted by Temasek through its influence on the board of these state-run monopolies?</p>

              <p>Uncle,<br>why u always said that i work long hours and not enuf sleep...i sleep more than you lor, at least 9 to 10 hrs,...at nite, i work only about from 8 to 3am only mah..7 hrs only, and just collect money only. And i dun drink, i drink tea as brandy ok. And the most funniest and likeable part is that you still reply me..i like it!</p>
              <p>Ok, personal business aside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ang mo are professionals, you cannot deny that, hiring and firing for them is as simple as drinking water, there is nothing to loose or sad about getting sack for fired, unlike we asian, who really wants to keep the face, pride and reputation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No doubt ang mo come with a high price tag, be it working or leaving, they are sure to negiotate a retirement plan, bonuses and service paid. But remember that Goodyears is not yet a confirm CEO before 1 october, therefore i believe there will be no or little compensation. And as professional as they are, they are sure to stick by the silent period at this time of non disclosure and confidential.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And please bear in mind, the return of my Aunty Ho, is not a permanent basis, she is there temporary before the next CEO is appointed, be it a local or foreigner, she shall relinquish her position again. Such are the desparate situation in Temasek that without her, it is hard to function.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During my Aunty departure period, most of her top subordinates in temasek still working there with the same culture she created, in fact, they still listen to her advices. So much so that temasek do not allow these peoples to be changed by Goodyear can be a blockage for Goodyear to manage his team who are not loyal to him. And because of these people around Goodyear is unable to bring his troops in to take over fully. This is a State investment Corp, not some private corporation or conglomerates where a change of top management occurs once a while whereby the whole team change hand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Given that inflexibility and my Aunty Ho wittyness, Goodyear can kiss goodbye to a badyear here.</p>
