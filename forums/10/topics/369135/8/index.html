              <div class="articleBody" style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">SINGAPOREANS aren’t usually given to open criticism of the Lee family that has ruled them for half a century. Rightly or wrongly, some presume that in their tightly controlled island state, walls have ears, and one never knows who is listening.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">But this time it’s different. Singaporeans are deeply displeased with their Prime Minister’s wife, Ho Ching. She has run Temasek Holdings, the state-owned fund, since 2002, and has presided over a spectacular series of misjudgments that have lost Singaporeans billions.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">There was the murky $3 billion deal she made in Bangkok in 2006, to buy then Thai PM Thaksin Shinawatra out of his telco. <span style="color: #0000ff;">Ho’s massive plunges into European and American banks ended in tears last year when Temasek </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">lost a third</span></span><span style="color: #0000ff;"> of its $100 billion portfolio</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">In Australia, Ho lost Temasek’s entire $400 million stake she’d plunged into Eddie Groves’ ABC Learning Centres, among other missteps.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">So much for her much-lauded ‘‘Superwoman’’ smarts and vision when the state appointed her, even though her pre-Temasek record at Temasek-owned arms supplier Singapore Technologies was hardly Sorosesque. Today, Singaporeans are sick of Ho and have been for some time. They want her out of Temasek, lest she create any more financial havoc for them.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Except she’s not going. In a February ‘‘transition’’ — not a sacking, as Temasek spun furiously — Ho was supposed to hand over Temasek to Chip Goodyear, the 51-year-old American (and North Melbourne supporter) who pointed BHP-Billiton at China for four years and made billions.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The big idea was that Goodyear would fix the mess Ho made in banking and tilt Singapore into the booming China and India growth stories, which meant placing Temasek at the middle of big regional resources plays.</span> But that, too, has ended in tears, when Temasek last week cited ‘‘strategic differences,’’ announcing it was "mutually agreed" Goodyear would not become CEO.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">It seems clear that after five months hanging around the Temasek office, Goodyear has been paid millions for his life-long silence.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">But only a few days earlier, Goodyear was doing the rounds of Temasek satellites mapping out his vision. One CEO I spoke to expressed shock, saying he had been on the ‘‘same page’’ as Goodyear and was looking forward to working with him. The implication was clear: <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Goodyear was a genuine businessperson whereas Ho was not</span>.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">That was mid-July. A week later, Chip was chopped. Temasek’s board met the weekend before last, then announced Goodyear was gone. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">So what happened?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Government-controlled </span><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Straits Times </span></em><span style="color: #0000ff;">said Goodyear’s proposals to shake up Temasek were viewed as "too risky" by the board.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> <strong>Too risky?</strong> </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ho’s bad bets in banks lost Temasek around $30 billion.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> <strong>What could be riskier than that?</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">More likely is the take doing the rounds of Singapore’s banking and business communities. Local insiders, under few illusions that little happens at Temasek without Government say-so, say the Government has been spooked by the arrest in China of Rio-Tinto executive Stern Hu.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Temasek hired Goodyear because they wanted him to do for it what he had done at BHP, expertly play China, which is far more politically important for an Asian nation such as tiny Chinese-dominated Singapore than it is for a global mining giant. But after the Chinese Government arrested Hu and sent a message it was taking back control of its resources management, it wouldn’t do now, they say, for a foreigner who knows so much about Chinese resources to front mostly Singapore Inc’s ambitions in China.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The handling of Goodyear has deeply embarrassed Singapore and seems to give lie to the fiction that Temasek operates transparently and separately from Government policy</span>. And knowing how deep runs the anger among its readers that Ho has squandered a big chunk of their nest egg, even the normally lap-dog <em>Straits Times</em> was moved to ask how ‘‘private sector’’ can Temasek really be, commenting: <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">‘‘Like it or not, Temasek cannot get away from the fact that it is inextricably linked to the Singapore Government’’</span></strong>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">It’s shaken up the arcane world of sovereign wealth funds too, where Temasek liked to portray itself as the model for emerging wealthy states. Delegations from around the world made pilgrimages to Singapore to see how it was done, how their state’s strategic jewels can be packaged and managed into an investment vehicle that maintained the illusion it was somehow separated from the Government. Journalists describing Temasek as "Government-controlled" invited a welter of complaints to their editors from Temasek’s spinners who demanded it be benignly referenced as an "Asian investment company" with no references to the Government whatsoever, and certainly not to describe the family connections of Ho’s. Failure to comply would mean an outlet would be blackballed by Temasek, which in Singapore ultimately suggests a libel suit no media company has ever won there.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">East Timor decided the Temasek model wasn’t for them, and chose a Norwegian-inspired transparent route for its now $6 billion petroleum royalties pile.</span> In many respects, it’s actually a model for Temasek. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Certainly, the East Timorese fund made more money than Temasek has recently — it invested in boring US treasury bonds while Ho was plunging billions into Merrill Lynch.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Unsurprisingly, Temasek’s model appeals more to the more authoritarian and less democratic of states, such as Kazakhstan which, like Singapore, is run along family lines.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Now Singapore Inc is in a pickle. It said it wants to internationalise Temasek, and appointing the much-respected Goodyear was a huge – and widely welcomed – statement. Now it’s stuck with the bumbling Ho, for at least another year, which simply deepens the market’s conviction that dealing with Temasek is akin to de facto dealing with the Government.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Temasek says it is continuing its international search for a new boss. But after Goodyear’s bad year at Temasek, why would anyone want to go there?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: italic; font-size: 15px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Eric Ellis is a business writer based in Singapore</span></p>

              <p>In China, the CCP is a big party and corrupt local government officials are a parasitic presence that everyone hates but it is difficult to identify and root them out because of the system of patronage in Chinese culture. Yet, the Chinese accept that President Hu Jin Tao is against corruption which will doom China's development. Similarly, in the U.S, the people blame the politicians for their problems but accept that the current President is doing all he can to rectify the situation. Similarly in Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Why is it that Singaporeans find faults with the leadership of the Lee family for all of the nation's problems and ignore the dirty things that corrupt sections of the administrative elite are doing? Isn't administrative reform a more practical approach? An ex-senior manager with SPRING was recently charged with corruption when he tried to squeeze Hitachi Singapore for bribes. 1st question to ask is who are his friends that he can be so bold.</p>
              <p>Do people think that once the Lee family is gone that the interests of everyday Singaporeans will be better served by demagogue politicians or by puppets dancing to the tune of faceless bureaucrats? Putting aside any ethical or moral arguments, is it not in the selfish interest of the Lee family to see that Singapore as a nation, does well? That as many Singaporeans as possible are loyal to the country which nurtures them and the powers that govern them? Better for Singaporeans to ask, in whose interest is it that Singaporeans DO NOT do well? Singapore is suffering a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_by_a_thousand_cuts">death by a thousand cuts</a>, Singaporeans should wake up their idea. There is nowhere else to go, really everywhere else is the same or even worse. Defend your nation or see your children become slaves again. Look at the amount of money the government is pouring into building up educational facilities, what for the trouble if they're not interested in building up the people. Think la.</p>

              <p>Only in Singapore lah - u can fritter away money (which is not a small amount) and still be holding on to a job.</p>
              <p>Mat Selamat's escape and .... the Minister is still keeping his job.</p>
              <p>Most of our Ministers go around preaching about culture, citizenship , success and lots of crap and for good measure - its such a shame - they pat each other's backs lah - when the public should decide.</p>
              <p>As for the local media (all forms) - bo pakeh type lah - the filtering is ...we are left to chew on crumbs of 'truths'.</p>
