            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">I REFER to the Review article, 'A dash of tolerance and a big helping of smart power' (ST, Dec 7), by Dr Catherine Lim.<br><br>It was frustrating reading her oft-repeated thesis of an imagined 'Great Divide', first mooted in 1994, or 'disconnect' between the PAP Government and the people that therefore necessitates the Government to impose 'tight (political) control' in order to remain in power. Frustrating, because she offered no new evidence to support her arguments.<br><br>With the General Election in May this year giving a decisive 67 per cent victory to the PAP Government, the people of Singapore had categorically disagreed, again, with Dr Lim's understanding of their true feelings towards the Government.<br><br>Even Dr Lim admitted that Singaporeans have 'an unquestioning trust in and total dependence on the Government to continue to give them a good life'. She resented this by branding as 'politically naÃ¯ve' the vast number of Singaporeans who provided tremendous political support to the PAP Government by returning it to power repeatedly over the last 40 years.<br><br>Prior to the May election, the economy grew by 8.4 per cent and 6.4 per cent in 2004 and 2005 respectively, while unemployment dropped to 2.5 per cent last December.<br><br>I am therefore baffled by her logic that Singaporeans should have a distrusting, more critical and sceptical attitude towards an incorruptible government whose policies have created jobs and provided affordable housing, education and medical services as well as social peace and stability.<br><br>The PAP-people relationship has a solid, unbreakable unity of purpose and commitment to the national interests of survival and sustainable economic prosperity.<br><br>I would like to suggest that the relative absence of open and widespread political dissent in Singapore is the result of good government, instead of some sinister covert network of political controls.<br><br>More young people stood as candidates in the 2006 General Election, and also joined various political parties since.<br><br>The Straits Times Forum page, its Review section, and the many blog sites also reflect a great diversity of views from  Singaporeans.<br><br>It is difficult to reconcile Dr Lim's lamentation about the lack of political freedom with her two-page article appearing in the main pages of our major English newspaper, after her speech to a government-linked think-tank!<br><br>Dr Lim's numerous speeches provide the most conclusive rebuttal of her thesis on the lack of tolerance of political dissent in Singapore.<br><br>Michael Heng Swee Hai </span><br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:af0adc44ce77f010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD" rel="nofollow">ST Forum</a><br><br>If this article is a representative of the mindset of the majority, it is interesting to note that many would simply take figures at face value from the govt and use them on a whim.<br><br>Economic and unemployment figures for years have always shown improvements nearer general elections. Such growths have always been made public to create the impression of improvement.<br><br>What Michael Heng is doing is claiming 'one' contradicts the other, without actually analysing the accuracy of 'one'.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hat by <blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BillyBong:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: indigo;">I REFER to the Review article, 'A dash of tolerance and a big helping of smart power' (ST, Dec 7), by Dr Catherine Lim.<br><br>It was frustrating reading her oft-repeated thesis of an imagined 'Great Divide', first mooted in 1994, or 'disconnect' between the PAP Government and the people that therefore necessitates the Government to impose 'tight (political) control' in order to remain in power. Frustrating, because she offered no new evidence to support her arguments.<br><br>With the General Election in May this year giving a decisive 67 per cent victory to the PAP Government, the people of Singapore had categorically disagreed, again, with Dr Lim's understanding of their true feelings towards the Government.<br><br>Even Dr Lim admitted that Singaporeans have 'an unquestioning trust in and total dependence on the Government to continue to give them a good life'. She resented this by branding as 'politically naÃ¯ve' the vast number of Singaporeans who provided tremendous political support to the PAP Government by returning it to power repeatedly over the last 40 years.<br><br>Prior to the May election, the economy grew by 8.4 per cent and 6.4 per cent in 2004 and 2005 respectively, while unemployment dropped to 2.5 per cent last December.<br><br>I am therefore baffled by her logic that Singaporeans should have a distrusting, more critical and sceptical attitude towards an incorruptible government whose policies have created jobs and provided affordable housing, education and medical services as well as social peace and stability.<br><br>The PAP-people relationship has a solid, unbreakable unity of purpose and commitment to the national interests of survival and sustainable economic prosperity.<br><br>I would like to suggest that the relative absence of open and widespread political dissent in Singapore is the result of good government, instead of some sinister covert network of political controls.<br><br>More young people stood as candidates in the 2006 General Election, and also joined various political parties since.<br><br>The Straits Times Forum page, its Review section, and the many blog sites also reflect a great diversity of views from  Singaporeans.<br><br>It is difficult to reconcile Dr Lim's lamentation about the lack of political freedom with her two-page article appearing in the main pages of our major English newspaper, after her speech to a government-linked think-tank!<br><br>Dr Lim's numerous speeches provide the most conclusive rebuttal of her thesis on the lack of tolerance of political dissent in Singapore.<br><br>Michael Heng Swee Hai </span><br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:af0adc44ce77f010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD" rel="nofollow">ST Forum</a><br><br>If this article is a representative of the mindset of the majority, it is interesting to note that many would simply take figures at face value from the govt and use them on a whim.<br><br>Economic and unemployment figures for years have always shown improvements nearer general elections. Such growths have always been made public to create the impression of improvement.<br><br>What Michael Heng is doing is claiming 'one' contradicts the other, without actually analysing the accuracy of 'one'.<br></div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">It is pathetic that a supposedly well educated Singaporean will find the present monopolistic political control to be an illusion.<br><br>Is Catherine Lim such a daft observer of the Singapore political scene to justify such a skewered criticism that ignore reality - as if the real world will be made more palatable by dismissing its existence ?<br><br>Sadly, there are Singaporeans who will be naive enough to believe that by sitting next to the Devil, they can change the Devil's way from inside HIS den.<br><br>In sitting close to the Devil, it will not take long for these Singaporeans to forget their original mission of "changing the system from within" - and will be drawn into corrupt world of absolute monopoly in power.<br><br>Some of the recent post-65 junior ministers were "severe" government critique in their earlier days, but have since changed their tune after being recruited and offered the hard-to-reject Million Dollar Ministerial positions.<br><br>Catherine Lim has been a keen and outspoken observer, with an honest and uncolored view of Singapore Life and Events, and have drawn strong rebuke from the Government.<br><br>She must have said something very honest and true to have attracted such severe reprimand.<br><br>Can this Michael Heng even begin to write anything original other then to repeat all that has been said by the Political demi-Gods of Singapore ?<br><br>What can be their purpose to defend the system and deny the truth ?<br><br>Like all Empires, it will wane once its peak has passed, and the whole truth will be seen with stark honesty; despite all the desparate efforts of the Political demi-Gods to prevent that fateful day.<br><br>LKY had even recently dared to suggest that the SAF should attempt a coup, in the event a freak election result should place the Alternative Parties to form the next Singapore Government.<br><br>Is this an illusion of an attempt at total political control by the Ruling Party ?<br><br>This is indeed pathetic that LKY should leave behind a legacy of political institutions that will cause friction, deep set rivalries, and competitive political animosities.<br><br>It seems that he will miss the opportunity to create a Singapore institution  that will be robust enough to stand up to the political changes of different political parties forming different government - similar to the robust political institutions of the mature democratic states that form the European Community.<br><br>The British left us with a superior Parliamentary System which had served UK over several decades, and successive changes of government did not affect their political institutions.<br><br>It is a crying shame that this Ruling Party has changed the face of the inherited Parliamentary System and political institutions, and also corrupting the legislature and judiciary with partisan politics that leaves behind instability and political rivalries.<br><br>Was Catherine Lim wrong with her observation of political control ?<br><br></span><br><br></div>
