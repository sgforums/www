              <h1>800,000 households to get $106 million dollars worth of “rebates”</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">December 31, 2009</span></p>
              <span class="time">
              <p>In yet another sign that the next general election will be held sometime next year, the Ministry of Finance announced that “800 ,000 Housing Board households will receive $106 million worth of U-Save rebates.”</p>
              <p>The first payout, amounting to $60 million of utility rebates, will be made in January, while the the second payout will come in July. </p>
              <p>Th U-Save rebates are used to offset utility charges directly and are part of the GST Offset Package announced in Budget 2007 to help Singaporeans, especially low and middle-income households, cope with the GST increase.</p>
              <p>Electricity tariffs for households are going up by 5.4 per cent or 1.18 cents per kWh for the first quarter of next year due to “higher fuel oil prices”.</p>
              <p>Just before the 2006 general election, the ruling party unveiled a “progress package”, disbursing a couple of hundreds of dollars to each Singaporean.</p>
              <p>After it won the election, GST was raised to 7 per cent ostensibly to “help the poor” in the words of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>Since then, the income gap between the poor and rich has widened considerably. The cost of living has increased while the median wages of Singaporeans remain stagnant at $2,600.</p>
              <p>It is not known how the increase in GST has gone towards helping the poor. The issue was never raised again by the Prime Minister or any other leader.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should not be too happy at the latest cash handout by the ruling party. Before they even know it, the amount disbursed to them will be “recouped” via higher GST, ERP, fines and whatever in double quick time.</p>

              <p>CPF Life will be disbursing payouts of up to $1,000 monthly to about 10,000 Singaporeans aged 62 and above this year to those who have signed up for the scheme.</p>
              <p>They will get the payouts by the seventh working day of each month which will go on for as long as they live.</p>
              <p>The monthly amount depends on the Retirement Account savings they used to join the annuity scheme. There is no minimum amount required, but members with lower balances will get lower monthly payouts. The highest payout is reported to be $1,040 a month.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are not allowed to opt out from the CPF Life scheme though the money belongs to them. It will apply to all Singaporeans turning 55 from 2013 and who have at least $40,000 in their CPF savings.</p>
              <p>In an interview with the state media, one Singaporean Madam Siti Khadijah Abdullah, who turned 62 yesterday, had opted for the CPF Life Balanced plan.</p>
              <p>The plan will pay her $366 monthly, hardly enough for her to survive in Singapore. As her children do not give her a fixed allowance, Madam Siti is considering returning to the workforce.</p>
              <p><em>“There’s more security because I’ll be getting a regular allowance until the day I die. Even if I don’t work, I’ll still have money to survive,”</em> she added.</p>
              <p>The ruling party has been encouraging Singaporeans to work for as long as they can. Though Singapore is a first world country, its citizens enjoy few social welfare benefits unlike others.</p>
              <p>Most Singaporeans have to depend on their CPF savings for retirement. Before 2003, they are able to withdraw their CPF monies in one lump sum when they reach 55 years of age.</p>
              <p>Now, they have to keep a “minimum sum” in their CPF before they are able to do so. As of now, the minimum sum has been increased to $117,000.</p>
              <p>Unless one belongs to the top 5 per cent of the income group, it is almost impossible for ordinary Singaporeans to accure that amount in their CPF.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, a substantial amount of their CPF savings will be used to finance the mortgage loans of over-priced HDB flats. The ruling party claims that rising prices of public housing help to “create wealth” for Singaporeans, but that capital value will not be unlocked unless one migrates elsewhere.</p>
              <p>The monthly median wage of an average Singapore worker is only $2,600 compared to more than $150,000 for a minister and $250,000 for the prime minister of Singapore.</p>
              <p>It is an irony that Singapore is “wealthy enough” to lose more than $40 billion dollars of its reserves in failed overseas investments (Wall Street Journal, September 2009), but its people are struggling to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>The situation isn’t helped by the relentless influx of foreigners into Singapore which help to keep wages stagnant for the Singapore worker.</p>
              <p>The ruling party isn’t sympathetic towards the suffering of ordinary Singaporeans in the street. While PM Lee claimed in his New Year Day message that Singaporeans will remain a “top priority” for his government, his father MM Lee Kuan Yew urged Singaporeans to put up with the “tide” of immmigration which has since grown to become a “flood”.</p>
              <p>In a recent interview with the National Geographic magazine, Lee Kuan Yew continues to support the ruling party’s liberal immigration policies though he is aware that many Singaporeans are unhappy with the influx of immigrants.</p>
              <p><em>“Over time, Singaporeans have become less hard-driving and hard-striving. This is why it is a good thing that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants.” </em>Lee was quoted saying.</p>
              <p>Lee describes the country’s new subjects as “hungry,” with parents who “pushed the children very hard.”</p>
              <p><em>“If native Singaporeans are falling behind because the spurs are not stuck into the hide, that is their problem,” </em>he quipped.</p>
              <p>It has indeed become a big problem for Singaporeans that they are not having sufficient savings in their CPF for their twilight years, not that the ruling party led by its overpaid millionaire ministers cares much anyway.</p>
              <p>Minister in the Prime Minister Office Lim Swee Say who recently urged Singapore workers to be “cheaper, faster and better” once made the following famous remark:</p>
              <p><em>“Every month, when I receive my CPF statement, I feel so rich and the best part is, I know the CPF money won’t run away. CPF will still be around for a long, long time to come… Not only is it earning good interest, my capital is protected.”</em> </p>
              <p>Now that Mr Lim has successfully “upturned” the downturn, he and his colleagues can expect another round of pay hike to their salaries in the new year ahead and of course, he will feel richer with more contributions from Singapore taxpayers to his CPF.
