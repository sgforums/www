              <p>My dear Angel, I didn't lament about getting scolded by commanders and going back home crying. I already said: My men and me will willingly fight to the death for our countrymen if invaders try to take our land. My gripe is about dying and the very real risk from silly things like getting rolled over by the Land Rover and the like.</p>

              <p>You want to talk about accidents in Marine Engineering and the like? For your information, they have a choice. Conscripted soldiers like us do not. And they get paid more, at least enough to make them want to risk their lives for their jobs.</p>

              <p>Your grasp of the English language is atrocious and your understanding of our armed forces is superficial. As if I don't have brothers and Father who served in the SAF. Please read carefully.</p>

              <p>Nothing is proven until it happens, so dun talk big. On the contrary, you may be a hero, but others may not. Worst is that you get killed by friendly fire, even the Americans best commandos can shoot at each others out of chaos and panic situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You have a choice not to join NS too, just leave this country. So do you think that a workers in construction and Marine have much choices, they got a family to feed ok not a vegabond like you who can go here and there as you like.</p>
