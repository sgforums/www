              <p><img src="http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb111/atobe-album/SovereignWealthFunds.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> <span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 17px; font-size: 12px;">Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) are not a new idea. According to Wikipedia, the term<strong>Sovereign Wealth Fund</strong> was first used by Andrew Rozanov in an article entitled, ‘Who holds the wealth of nations?’ in the Central Banking Journal of May 2005. A SWF may be broadly defined as a state-owned investment fund composed of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, property, precious metals or other financial instruments.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; line-height: 17px;"> </span></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">Theoretically one can distinguish two types of SWFs. The first, and the oldest form of SWF, is one set up to manage revenues from an exhaustible resource such as oil, or one which derives its assets from government budget surpluses. An example of one based on resources, and arguably the first SWF was the Kuwait Investment Authority, a commodity SWF created in 1953 from oil revenues before Kuwait even gained independence from Great Britain. A more recent example is the Norwegian SWF which was set up primarily to ensure that the wealth represented by Norway’s oil reserves was not squandered on current consumption but turned into financial assets which would benefit future generations.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">Temasek could be said to be an example of the first type of SWF.  It was set up in 1974 to hold stakes in the various government-controlled companies, such as DBS, SIA and Singapore Technologies, that had previously been held by the Ministry of Finance. The Temasek Holdings website states that, “Our investments are funded through dividends we receive from our portfolio companies, our divestment proceeds, commercial borrowings, a maiden Yankee bond issue in 2005 and occasional asset injections from our shareholder, the Minister for Finance (Incorporated).”</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">The second type of SWF is one set up to manage a country’s excess foreign exchange reserves. GIC is probably an example of this type of SWF since it was set up in 1981 with the explicit objective of managing our foreign exchange reserves for long-term capital appreciation. I say probably, as there is very little transparency, so it is not clear whether it is also funded by capital injections from the Ministry of Finance in the same manner as Temasek. However a significant portion of its funding may come indirectly from the CPF which invests primarily in debt issued by MOF. No information is available on the current level of assets. The website states only that the investment portfolio is in excess of US$100 billion. However various estimates have put the level of assets at between US$250 and US$330 billion.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">Singaporeans need to be asking, particularly in the light of the recent investment losses, why Singapore even has not one, but two, SWFs. Singapore does not meet the criteria for the first type of SWF since we do not need to manage a windfall from any natural resources. If Singapore had expanded its domestic investment and consumption over the last 30 years it would have had smaller current account surpluses and thus smaller foreign exchange reserves needing management. MAS already has sufficient foreign exchange reserves necessary to manage  the Singapore dollar. No second SWF was needed to fulfil this function.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">Again without transparency we have no breakdown of how much government saving in the form of surpluses has contributed to both Temasek and GIC’s growth over the years. But we do know that the cumulative budget surplus over the last thirty years has been considerable.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">Where have these oft lauded budget surpluses come from in the first place. Well we all know how to save money. We cut back on expenditures. When a country cuts back on the absolute basics such as free education for its children then it creates a budget surplus. Let’s make no mistake here. No other First World Nation only has compulsory education up to the end of Primary school and even that only for a very short day and that minimal compulsory education not even free (although heavily subsidised). I am not advocating a welfare state but to put it bluntly, Singaporeans have helped to pay for our enormous overseas investments by forgoing free universal education to secondary level, a national health insurance system and other elements of a social safety net which are characteristic of most countries at Singapore’s level of development</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">The budget surplus, having been taken from the pockets of Singaporeans, then represents money that not only could have, but should have, been returned to the citizens of Singapore in the form of lower taxes, fees and charges. It could have also been used to finance much higher domestic investment in education or in health and welfare. Their website states that Temasek has achieved an annualized return of 18% since inception though that is based on the March 2008 asset figure of S$185 billion rather than on the current valuation of S$145 billion announced by CEO Ho Ching yesterday. Investment in our only natural resource, our people, could potentially have had a much higher internal rate of return, in the form of a more highly educated workforce, than that achieved by Temasek or GIC on their overseas investments.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">Instead of the Government investing our money to pick winners through an industrial strategy there could have been greater incentives for investment and R&amp;D in the private sector which might have led to faster productivity growth and higher levels of real incomes. And even if GIC has not been funded directly by the MOF, the growth of our foreign exchange reserves has come about through chronic external surpluses which represent domestic under-consumption and under-investment.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">As a final ignominy, CEO Ho Ching announced on July 29th at the Institute of Policy Studies that Temasek was thinking of allowing Singaporeans to co-invest alongside Temasek sometime in the next ten years. How kind of her. I thought we had already invested as outlined above.  The only positive side of this news is that it would presumably force Temasek to be much more transparent about its investment process and corporate governance. In any case any personal financial adviser (and I am not one) would not advise an investment in a company without sufficient transparency that required due diligence.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">As we all know, calls on the government for accountability and transparency in its sovereign wealth funds is not new.  However; I would go one step further! Many of you know that I gave a speech at the Foreign Correspondents Association lunch on the 2 July 2009. In answer to a question put to me after the lunch I went on record as saying that Singaporeans should be given a direct stake in our SWFs, either through their privatization and the issuance of shares to Singapore citizens or through the explicit linkage of part of the value of these assets to the welfare of Singaporeans, as is done in Norway through the Pension Fund.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">To counter one possible objection that our national “crown jewels” could end up being bought by foreigners the government could retain a golden share which would prevent this happening to Temasek’s portfolio of domestic GLCs. Longer term there is no reason for Singapore to continue to run large budget surpluses over the course of an economic cycle.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">In conclusion whilst I will not let up on calling on our government for greater transparency and accountability into how it manages our money, I would urge it also to look at credible new proposals such as mine, rather than confining itself to the limited steps outlined by CEO Ho Ching in her speech.<span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px; color: #333333;"> </span></p>

              <p>Uncle, may I lecture on you with some reverse pyschology effect on your thinking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, ask yourself, if currently you are the PM of singapore, you got the executive power to decide and execute you decision, and you seat on the highest chair in singapore politics, what will you do if you feel threatened by PAP, who in this play, their role is opposition. If you think that it is ok to let PAP mingle around and spread their evil and bad about you, i think you most likely can hold office for one term or less. But i guess with a smart mind like yours, you will had put all PAP supporters and gangs into ISD and more so, you would had make them disappear without a trace, you would had controlled the media, the monetary and the arm forces to align them toward your objectives, and the main objectives is to hold on to power as long as it last, you need to do pre emptive measurement, plan and action to uphold your status and power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And secondly, if there is anyone or any matters that block your way to success or downgrade your popularity and strength, you offer no other alternative but alien him/her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, PAP can be dirty, but dun you agreed that politic is dirty, if politics is not dirty, it is not politics, for these, LKY knows, he also know that if Opposition takes over, they will also play dirty politics, maybe even more dirtier, but at the end of the day, as dirty as it may be, if you bring peace and harmony with opportunity to prosperous and good living, you will be highly supported </p>

              <p>Uncle, may I lecture on you with some reverse pyschology effect on your thinking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, ask yourself, if currently you are the PM of singapore, you got the executive power to decide and execute you decision, and you seat on the highest chair in singapore politics, what will you do if you feel threatened by PAP, who in this play, their role is opposition. If you think that it is ok to let PAP mingle around and spread their evil and bad about you, i think you most likely can hold office for one term or less. But i guess with a smart mind like yours, you will had put all PAP supporters and gangs into ISD and more so, you would had make them disappear without a trace, you would had controlled the media, the monetary and the arm forces to align them toward your objectives, and the main objectives is to hold on to power as long as it last, you need to do pre emptive measurement, plan and action to uphold your status and power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And secondly, if there is anyone or any matters that block your way to success or downgrade your popularity and strength, you offer no other alternative but alien him/her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, PAP can be dirty, but dun you agreed that politic is dirty, if politics is not dirty, it is not politics, for these, LKY knows, he also know that if Opposition takes over, they will also play dirty politics, maybe even more dirtier, but at the end of the day, as dirty as it may be, if you bring peace and harmony with opportunity to prosperous and good living, you will be highly supported </p>

              <p>At least with opposition there is still a possibility that they won't be corrupt, with the current team, it's already a no brainer. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> How incorruptible a system is, depends on the checks and balances to curtail the power of those in power. Is there a system of checks and balances in the current system; or do we have a system of close family members in power checking each other's arses for shit and licking them clean before they show their arses to the public? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Is there any accountability in the current system? WKS's oversight and HC's punting with Singaporean's hard earned money. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you sure there is a reduction in poverty? Singapore's income distribution is even worse than USA, income distribution between the rich and the poor has increased significantly since 2000.</p>

              <p>Just because folks are queuing up to buy properties doesn't mean that the Singapore economy is not in shambles. What proportion of those property investors are overseas investors?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Protest doesn't equate to riot. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> When somebody accidentally steps on your foot, you get hurt, obviously you scream out in pain to alert the person of your pain, hoping that he will lift his foot from yours. In Singapore, you can't scream even if someone drives a spike through your foot, the government will determine if it's painful, most often they will deemed it painless and continue with the spiking. Think of the over supply of cheap foreign labour driving down wages of ordinary Singaporeans. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>It is bullshit about reduction in poverty.   It is happening, it is reality, now there are more people working more than one person's jobs and are lowly paid.   The ruling party condone this.   They have been so active to encourge exploiting Singaporeans this way.   CDC is brainwashing Singaporeans to overwork and get low pay, they claim it is the trend now.</p>
              <p>So with this going on, someone still say there is reduction in poverty, really there is something wrong with this person's brain, the brain must be sent for repair or just simply discard it.</p>

              <p>It is bullshit about reduction in poverty.   It is happening, it is reality, now there are more people working more than one person's jobs and are lowly paid.   The ruling party condone this.   They have been so active to encourge exploiting Singaporeans this way.   CDC is brainwashing Singaporeans to overwork and get low pay, they claim it is the trend now.</p>
              <p>So with this going on, someone still say there is reduction in poverty, really there is something wrong with this person's brain, the brain must be sent for repair or just simply discard it.</p>

              <p>His flat is more than $150,000.    There is no way to pay a complete sum for the housing loan with this kind of pay.    I am not sure of NEA, what I know of is some govt sectors don't even allow staff to do sideline.      If he is allowed to do sideline, may be there is still possibility he can pay full amount of loan on monthly basis.</p>
              <p>Either way one dies, this is the way of the ruling party.    WE are all living in the fence they set for us.  Seems they are making themselves very exclusive.    They are creating wider income gap.</p>
