              <p>Uncle, funny how you always said i am drunk and yet you reply to it, but i am perfectly ok, not drunk ya,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh, exactly, nobody can guarantee anything, that is why insurances are selling well, so on what basis can we guarantee that the oppositions is not corrupted when they become govt?? That is the point i am focusing, since you said PAP is corrupted and taking our rights etc etc, can you guarantee SDP would not do the same? Think hor, Singaporeans are not stupid hor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not a die hard PAP gal, nor am I a believers of their policies, i am neutral, but given the situation in singapore where there is peace and harmony and especially so with a good education system that even top foreign talents are flowing in and buying our assets or to be citizens of Singapore, yet you are here desputing on your dislike of your homeland. Usually people like you living within here do not appreciate what others looking upon us. And base on what ground that we need to change a govt?? base on what?? base on u got no money, no roof top of you, no education, no foods, no work, no medicine etc etc?? You name it, we got it or least better than those countries surrounding us. We are not said living in a comfort zone, why we are here is because we pre emptive planned for the future, we look forward before others do and we also know that we cannot satisfy everyone especially people like you. And the WE stands for we the young singaporeans entrepreneurs/students/professionals. WE want to take the challenge to live here, we want to be part of the next quantum leap of our generation, u do not know what our govt is planing, there is a big leap coming, so dun mess up the whole picture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our mind is global, no doubt our govt is alway the same but we keep constant change to suit the economy and the environment, the objectives is set, once reached, it change to the next objective, dun ever think we are seating frog in a well waiting for the rain to come.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, what does SDP got to offer beside internal reshuffling??</p>

              <p>i supposed Angel7030's view isn't new....it is probably a mere reflection of the practical nature of Singaporean in trying to secure the day 2 day lifestyle in an insulated environment of Singapore. Personally i think it is time to grow up. But i also think it is flaws.....to continue the same path and the same thinking that got us here. LKY himself asked "Are you smarter than your parents"</p>
              <p>Well i said maybe we should Change Parents. If Change is the only constant.  We have not see a changed in Govt for  40 odds years. We are a generation of clueless generation  who have loss the abilities to Speak/fight for our own right.   </p>
              <p>It is true that if SDP or any other party is in power there are no gurantee success, there are also no gurantee sucess for current PAP either. There are no gurantee that future even LKY can't gurantee that.   </p>
              <p>So why Change Govt..... what is the real test is that the current system must withstand Change. The current govt have self insulating themselved for their own good. Our civil govt branch have not work with a different political party before. It is time to Change Parent.    </p>

              <p>I believe it is not a matter of change govt and you will see a different, our last two generation did not see it that way either, so why should we, not just because of a global downturn and the lost in investment which typically most country also suffered more or less, we should not come into conclusion that the current ruling party is at faults, we have to be neutral that all of us losted, be it inflation or investment, it does afeect our lives. And if oppositions and SDP is targetting on the old and middle age peoples and refusing to hear our aspiration and needs by calling us drunkers and all those ugly terms they can use on us, I think they are going to loose misearably again, dun they ever learn that we are the leader of future, they should concentrate more on these ground.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Men have greed and the need for power, ego and pride, we respect that it is natural, we also agreed to weight the pro and cons if oppositon is to take over as the govt,  business will come into a standstill and jobless will increase, the focus of the nation will be a total different scenarios and the align of objective willl be very vague for the first few years. IT will takes sometime for SDP to settle down, get the trust from both the citizens and international relationship. And as said, you dun guarantee they will work, if not sold sentosa away. Now, why do we need that change of govt? just because we need a check and balance?? just because we some voices in the govt? I think that is a very lame excuses to champion you cause.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And as we progress, with multi business and jobs opportunities, upgrading, live in peaceful and harmony conditions that is condusive for family building, love and care for each other,  why should we change govt for the sake of change? </p>

              <p>Longinchjohn aka angel7030 is better off working as papasan / mamasan in the pub to provide entertainment to the clients rather than come here to contribute crap.</p>

              <p>I am not a die hard PAP gal, nor am I a believers of their policies, i am neutral, but given the situation in singapore where there is peace and harmony and especially so with a good education system that even top foreign talents are flowing in and buying our assets or to be citizens of Singapore, yet you are here desputing on your dislike of your homeland. Usually people like you living within here do not appreciate what others looking upon us. And base on what ground that we need to change a govt?? base on what?? base on u got no money, no roof top of you, no education, no foods, no work, no medicine etc etc?? You name it, we got it or least better than those countries surrounding us. We are not said living in a comfort zone, why we are here is because we pre emptive planned for the future, we look forward before others do and we also know that we cannot satisfy everyone especially people like you. And the WE stands for we the young singaporeans entrepreneurs/students/professionals. WE want to take the challenge to live here, we want to be part of the next quantum leap of our generation, u do not know what our govt is planing, there is a big leap coming, so dun mess up the whole picture.</p>

              <p>What is the basis of making such a statement with a tone of false expert authority ?</p>
              <p>Which age group are you referring to in your claim of the last two generations ?</p>
              <p>Your father's generation age between 30 to 40 years old, or your grandpa's generation in the age group of 60 to 80 years of age ?</p>
              <p>Your papa was a kid or not even born and knows nothing about politics when LKY and the PAP took over power in 1957; and your grandpa place his misguided trust in LKY and the PAP only to wake up too late to do anything else.</p>
              <p>If your grandpa was not supporting LKY and his PAP, your grandpa had no chance to change the events when LKY was smarter than your grandpa's generation in turning the legislative powers to the advantage of the PAP - by changing the Constitution and using the ISA and the Criminal Detention Laws to lock up without charges or trial -  anyone who dare to challenge LKY and the PAP.</p>
              <p>More then a whole generation was cheated at the one and only Referendum, which was purposefully skewed without any real options so as to get Singaporeans to back LKY's pipedream to have Singapore join Malaysia, even as there were many Singaporeans who objected the merger attempt.</p>
              <p>This left us with a political baggage that remained with us till posterity in our poorly managed relationship with Malaysia since being kicked out on 9 August 1965.</p>

IT will takes sometime for SDP to settle down, get the trust from both the citizens and international relationship. And as said, you dun guarantee they will work, if not sold sentosa away. Now, why do we need that change of govt? just because we need a check and balance?? just because we some voices in the govt? I think that is a very lame excuses to champion you cause.</p>

              <p>Can an Alternative Political Party forming the next Singapore Government be worst than the Financial Meltdown that the highly paid Singapore Ministers cannot prevent despite their loudly acclaimed super talented abilities ?</p>

              <p>This is the legacy of public institution that LKY has built for Singaporeans to resolve.</p>
              <p>This is his final time bomb to protect the interests of the PAP.</p>
