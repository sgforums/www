              <p>I believe it is not a matter of change govt and you will see a different, our last two generation did not see it that way either, so why should we, not just because of a global downturn and the lost in investment which typically most country also suffered more or less, we should not come into conclusion that the current ruling party is at faults, we have to be neutral that all of us losted, be it inflation or investment, it does afeect our lives. And if oppositions and SDP is targetting on the old and middle age peoples and refusing to hear our aspiration and needs by calling us drunkers and all those ugly terms they can use on us, I think they are going to loose misearably again, dun they ever learn that we are the leader of future, they should concentrate more on these ground.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Men have greed and the need for power, ego and pride, we respect that it is natural, we also agreed to weight the pro and cons if oppositon is to take over as the govt,  business will come into a standstill and jobless will increase, the focus of the nation will be a total different scenarios and the align of objective willl be very vague for the first few years. IT will takes sometime for SDP to settle down, get the trust from both the citizens and international relationship. And as said, you dun guarantee they will work, if not sold sentosa away. Now, why do we need that change of govt? just because we need a check and balance?? just because we some voices in the govt? I think that is a very lame excuses to champion you cause.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And as we progress, with multi business and jobs opportunities, upgrading, live in peaceful and harmony conditions that is condusive for family building, love and care for each other,  why should we change govt for the sake of change? </p>

There are many unforeseen problem solved with NS, dun take it lightly, without NS, we may be or might be invaded.

              <p>I objection. I understand what our men had gone thru, my Dad and brother went thru army too. Construction and Marine sector get about 50 over peoples killed per years, so how?? stop it?? Even pedestrian get killed more than NSmen per year, so how, stop walking on the road ah??</p>

              <p>You have never even being to war and you talk about nvr seen in war??? are you ok?? Just because of some punishment only, you cannot stand up as a soldier, a man of honor. Come ON soldier, who dun get punished in army?? Wha, lao! didn't know we got so lame soldier here, if war come, and i manage to get a rifle, me fire you first before you go tell enemy where we are.</p>
