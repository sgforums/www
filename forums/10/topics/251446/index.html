They claimed they need them as trash bags. (See report on facing page.)<br><br>He said: 'Most of these housewives have grown so used to getting these bags free from the supermarkets, so having to pay 10 cents a bag came as a shock,' he said.<br><br>Mr Foo couldn't quite keep up with the demand of plastic bags on BYOB Day when one customer strode in wanting 12 packs of trash bags.<br><br>'I was quite shocked, because people usually buy one or two packs at most. I didn't even carry that many packs in my shop and I sold him the only seven packets I had,' Mr Foo said.<br><br>The shop manager thinks that while saving the environment is important, he feels that many people are confused about the message behind BYOB Day.<br><br>He said: 'Instead of educating people, it is bringing out their kiasu side. They start stocking up on bags, thinking the prices are going up.'<br><br>At Bedok North St 1, some shoppers asked for extra free plastic bags with their purchases.<br><br>Mr Wong Lock Meng, 34, who works at a shop there: 'On BYOB Day, about 20 housewives came in asking for free plastic bags. They bought one or two things and asked for two or three big plastic bags.'<br><br>The same happened for a medical hall situated opposite the supermarket.<br><br>Owner Madam Chong said that on BYOB Day, about 15customers asked for two to three extra big carrier bags each.<br><br>She said: 'I gave them the bags even though they bought single, small items.'<br><br>Many families use plastic bags to hold household rubbish.<br><br>A plastic bag wholesaler at Victoria Wholesale Centre, who wanted to be known only as Mrs Chua, said many housewives buy plastic bags regularly for rubbish disposal and to store food.<br><br>CONVENIENCE<br><br>She said: 'BYOB Day is not effective because people like myself will simply avoid shopping on that day.<br><br>'Singaporeans want convenience. It is impossible to live without plastic bags.

I am not going to use fewer bags just because of BYOB Day.'<br><br>'It is only hurting my pocket because I have to pay for new plastic bags to use as trash bags,' she added.<br><br>Graphic designer Lindy Wan, 31, agreed: 'I cannot cut down because I need to bag refuse and dog poo, and take the trash to the chute outside.'<br><br>Wrapping the waste in newspapers is not an option, she said, because it will open up, spilling the rubbish.<br><br>'People who do that do not spare a thought for workers who clear the bins,' Ms Wan said.<br><br>According to figures provided by the National Environment Agency (NEA), Singaporeans use 2.5 billion single-use plastic bags yearly.<br><br>This translates to 625 bags per person a year.<br><br>This is alarmingly higher than in Japan, where the consumption rate is 260 bags per person annually, and in the US, where it is 333 bags per person a year.<br><br>The NEA said many of the bags here are re-used to bag household refuse, a good hygiene practice that the agency continues to promote.<br><br>However, what BYOB Day aims to address is the problem of plastic bags thrown away without being re-used. This is a waste of resources.<br><br>The message that the NEA would like to send out is to take only enough plastic bags and to re-use bags as often as possible to cut wastage.<br><br>The 10 cents charged for each supermarket plastic bag helps to fund the Singapore Environmental Council's activities.<br><br></div>

That has been lacking, maybe because we always depend upon import and export of trade as such we always look out rather than creating local solution.<br><br>Another 2 examples that could possibily be relevant to Singapore.<br><br>This has been shown on CNA.  ( creamated human bone ashes to carbonized into Diamond) I think this is a very relevant ideas especially space is a constraint in Singapore.  Don't have to pay storage at the temple.<br><br>Mangosteen husk has plenty of antioxident and we throw alway. Actually I saw company harvest it as juice.<br><br></div>
