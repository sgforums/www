PAP focuses on "happy" issues and it's just amazing after so many years that Singaporeans still fall for it - hook, line and sinker. HDB estates will be upgraded eventually, MRT stations/lines construction plans decided way in advance to coincide with projected election dates, little handouts here and there, etc.<br><br>Then the elections are over. Barely before the dust settles, everyone gets whacked with taxes and life in Singapore carries on as it is - with no improvement except perhaps nice juicy pay packets for those who have lost touch at ground level and don't realise that even $10 could make a difference to many Singaporeans.<br><br>Has there been marked improvement to life in Singapore since the ministers'  salaries were increased?<br><br>Singaporeans really have no one to blame but themselves. If you feel something has to be changed to bring on a better Singapore for everyone, why worry about a bunch of serial numbers recorded next to your name? I used to be one of those who'd vote PAP unless I was given the choice of another decent candidate. Now, I am sad to say, I no longer hold that view. Opposition is necessary, even for tiny Singapore. But for opposition candidates to increase in numbers and improve in quality, there needs to be encouragement from the people.<br></div>
