            <div class='col-md body'>Bringing in foreign talents is only <strong>part</strong> of a solution.  But with any other solution, it will only work when the appropriate measures are taken.  Synergy is important.  Adequate and insightful planning is necessary to channel the efforts... anything less than a complete solution is tantamount to negligence.  In fact you couldn't even call it a "solution", merely a "reaction".<br><br>Running a country's not the same as just running a business.  It's not just money at stake, but people's lives, their collective consciousness.. their culture.  It's more than just dollars and cents.  I think one of the biggest challenges Singapore faces is keeping our govt grounded and accountable.  If you cannot even correctly identify the problem (due to disconnect), or allow the problem to be identified (controlling the masses too tightly), how can you hope to solve it?<br><br>I suspect our greatest enemy will inadvertedly be from within.. we are using our resources to counter the wrong people here; our own people.. using the term "counter-insurgency" to describe how they want to handle alternative Singaporean views on the forums say it all.  When, and no tif, we collapse from within, there will be external powers waiting to reap the benefits.  No prizes for guessing correctly who will be the real losers when this happens.</div>
