            <div class='col-md body'>The "Foreign Talent" exhibit in the Singapore Arts Festival was accidently knocked down by a van. (Is it an omen?) It was placed near the Sir Stamford Raffles statue, to commemorate the contributions of the foreign talents towards the developement of Singapore. What a slur on Singaporeans who are born, bred and worked here. Are these Singaporeans parasites, that benefited from the efforts of the FTs?<br>I regret that the exhibit was not damaged beyond repair.</div>
