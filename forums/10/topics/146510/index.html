            <div class='col-md body'>The joker story below<br><br>Kuan joined JTC to boost chances<br><br>By Li Xueying<br>Aug 8, 2005<br>The Straits Times<br>IT WAS in 1999 - the year Mr S R Nathan was elected president - that Mr Andrew Kuan began to harbour the ambition of running for the highest office.<br><br>Two years later, he joined JTC Corporation as its group chief financial officer (CFO) in June 2001, in a calculated move to boost his chances.<br><br>He told reporters yesterday at his Tanah Merah apartment: 'I needed the exposure. I wanted to be involved in the machinery of the Government, to understand and to know more people, establish good relationships with people in the civil service, with political leaders as well as the rank and file.'<br><br>Mr Kuan has submitted papers to qualify him to run for president. The only people who qualify are those with at least three years' senior management experience in positions like chairman and CEO of big statutory boards like JTC or heads of ministries, or 'any other similar or comparable position of seniority and responsibility'.<br><br>Mr Kuan was CFO, not CEO, so it is uncertain if he will qualify. Candidates also need to be a person of integrity and good character as assessed by the Presidential Elections Committee.<br><br>Mr Kuan was in JTC for three years and one month. He said he helped it invest its surplus funds which yielded results 'way above what they used to get'. He also implemented a framework to measure JTC's economic productivity.<br><br>On rumours that he left JTC on an unhappy note, he said: 'I don't leave any place on a sour basis.'<br><br>He declined to give details about his campaign or his platform.<br><br>He did say one supporter, a senior officer in a real estate company, has already put up the $37,500 for the poll deposit.<br><br>Mr Kuan, who had offered the interview to the press, was eager to respond to a report in The New Paper yesterday which said he was ousted from his position as chairman of the management council of his condominium in May 2001 after members were not happy with his management style.<br><br>He said the conflict arose after he made a police report about a forged signature by a council member who later resigned.<br><br>He claimed the man's friends in the council were 'not happy' and tabled a resolution to remove him. Mr Kuan said he then resigned.<br><br>Yesterday evening, he made his first public appearance since announcing his presidential bid - as the guest of honour of a dog walk in West Coast Park to celebrate National Day organised by a pet boutique.<br><br>Some people expressed support, but others who shook his hand were bemused, apparently not knowing who he was<br></div>

Personally, i think his capability is irrelevent. You can't really do worse than nathan. Rather than letting nathan have a monopoly on the gravy train, i would rather let others have a go.

One of the checks is calling the previous employer to find out how was the candidate's performance in his/her previous job. Therefore, if Kuan is really as lousy as what JTC purported him to be, JTC must have LIED to Hyflux!
