              <p class="spIntrotext"><strong>An
              Amsterdam court ruled on Wednesday that populist Dutch politician Geert
              Wilders, an outspoken critic of Islam and maker of the anti-Muslim film
              "Fitna," should be prosecuted for hate speech.</strong></p>
              <p class="spIntrotext">Last year, a Dutch public prosecutor decided not to take legal action
              against politician Geert Wilders for his anti-Islamic statements, which
              included calling the Koran a "fascist" book and comparing it to
              Hilter's "Mein Kampf." Wilders, a member of parliament with the
              populist Freedom Party (PVV), made headlines around the world in March
              2008 with his film "Fitna," which juxtaposed verses from the Koran
              against a background of violent film clips and images of terrorism by
              Islamic radicals.</p>
              <p>Dozens of organizations and individuals in the Netherlands wanted
              to bring charges against the politician, but the prosecutor decided
              that while painful to Muslims, his remarks were not criminal.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, Amsterdam's Court of Appeal 
              <a title="Text of Dutch Court Ruling against Wilders" href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Actualiteiten/Amsterdam+Court+of+Appeal+orders+the+criminal+prosecution+of+the+Member+of+Parliament+of+the+Dutch+S.htm">disagreed and found</a> that there was a case of inciting hatred to answer for, both because of
              the content of Wilders' remarks and the way in which it was presented.
              The judges said they had weighed Wilders' anti-Islam rhetoric against
              his right to free speech and ruled he had gone beyond even the normal
              leeway granted to politicians.</p>
              <p>The court ruled that Wilders had personally insulted Muslim believers
              by attacking the symbols of Islam. The court found many of Wilders'
              comments to be offensive because they "harm Muslims in their religious
              esteem." The judges also described "Fitna" as being characterized by
              "biased, strongly generalizing phrasings with a radical meaning,
              ongoing reiteration and an increasing intensity as a result of which
              hate is created."</p>
              <p>The court ruled that it is in the public interest to prosecute
              Wilders because, in a democratic legal system, a clear line must be
              drawn between hate speech and public debate.</p>
              <p>Wilders said he was shaken by the court's decision. "I did not
              expect this, particularly as the prosecutor himself did not want to
              bring charges," he said. Wilders called the decision "an attack on
              freedom of speech."</p>
              <p>"This is a black day for everyone who has voted for me and for
              everyone who thinks you are allowed to criticize Islam," he said. "In
              this country, you are apparently allowed to criticize only if you are
              politically correct in how you express yourself."</p>
              <p>Wilders believes he will be acquitted of the charges if he is put on
              trial. "This will only lead to long legal procedures," he said. "And it
              will cost a lot of money, which I do not have."</p>
              <p>Gerard Spong, a prominent lawyer who joined Islamic groups in
              pushing for Wilders' prosecution, welcomed the decision. "This is a
              happy day for all followers of Islam who do not want to be tossed onto
              the garbage heap of Nazism," Spong told reporters in Amsterdam.</p>
