            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you 100% Drawer .<br>If I were you I would also be saying  - 'He can hide but he cant run away... from the truth.  And the truth of the matter is elementary.  Mr Goh was never completely in charge.  And you all jolly well know who IS!'<br><br>Let us all not pretend AND IGNORE what everybody, in fact the whole world,  aready knew.  And we all know that it is our dear old  leader's 50's &amp; 60's ideologies and policies that is  running our country  today.<br><br>That's why they call him a brilliant statesman - his fantastic ability to diguise and scheme his dictatorship.<br><br>Actually ah pek should now be looking after grandchildren and dogs,  and not continue to get involved ,  life is so pressurised, over-controlled AND EXPENSIVE  with him around.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On the contrary, I find that he did a good job. I wonÂ’t compare him against LKY cause he environment and priority when he took over are different. LKY focus on SG survival after  separation from Malaysia. While PM God talks about continuous growth. I think his tasks, at times, may be more difficult than LKY.<br><br>I truly admired and applauded the way he handled Malaysia allegation during the previous Economy crisis when they accused us of being profiteering from Malaysia currencies exchange. I am also deeply moved by the way he stand his stand when bigger countries like US or China true to pull rank on our domestic issue.<br><br>He definitely is a leader that SG people can be proud of.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr Goh has done much for us over the years...how can one doubt his passion for Singapore to succeed? And anyway while most have the impression that LKY still runs the show, I don't think that's completely true.

            <div class='col-md body'>PM Goh is externally a nice man, that I know too.  Mah Bow Tan is also  cute looking. And Chee Soon Juan is the court's joker - he  single handedly destroyed opposition's  reputation in last GE.<br><br>However there are not nice things about PM Goh's rule -<br><br>- government increasing GST at the worst time disregarding sentiments of it's people (when 100k Singaporeans were jobless).  If this sort of thing happens say in UK, the Government would have been sacked(remember the poll tax which got Magaret Thatcher into trouble?)<br><br>- high utilities charges (way too high - <strong>how much is PUB netting from each household</strong> - 300% or issit 500%)<br><br>- indecent huge reserves (Taiwan doesnt have much foreign reserves or  natural resources yet its people are more united and nationalistic than ours).  Remember,  <strong>we the citizens are paying for the reserves.</strong><br><br>- atrocious hospital charges (government milking our CPF-via medisave.  MOH could easily set prices to prevent charges from escalating but DID NOT)<br><br>- HDB upgrading (government milking our CPF savings)<br><br>- puzzling high cost of education for the common people<br><br>- over-priced HDB properties (government milking our CPF)<br>(there are vacant lands which government seized via land enactment act  from rural people 30 years ago <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and still left unused</strong></span>!  PAP A High handed government?)<br><br>- COE  (brilliant idea to milk Singaporeans savings) a simple quota for new car licences could have easily solved the car growth problem - COE is typical of government's greed and perpetual scheme to make Singaporeans work longer hours and contribute to government)<br><br>- CPF minimum sum (<strong>did we all agree to it?  </strong>how could government force us to give up our life savings to them? I mean, it's <strong>OUR MONEY </strong>man!)<br><br>- non-consultative style of PM Goh's rule.<br><br>- more bad years<br><br>- CPF board continues to encourage and entice Singaporeans to invest their CPF savings in unit trusts, bonds, stock exchange etc inspite of historical fact that more than 80% Singpaoreans lost their pants in past investments  ( government jealous of our CPF earnings ,  and trying to further milk citizens' CPF savings?)<br><br>- massive issuance of Work Permits and PR certs when 100K Siingaporeans are still hungry for jobs.  Not so nice to ignore Singaporeans plight leh.<br><br>Need I go on?  There are more to come....<br><br></div>
