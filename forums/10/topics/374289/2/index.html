              <p>After the separation, LKY did not go dishearted, one thing for sure is that most of the opposition politicians was gone and he got to take singapore all the way up, with the moving off of the British army forces, lots of peoples working for the british went jobless, and the whole country is in the dark..but he showed us that there is a light in the tunnel, and if today, if you will to ask him about the bleak days after separation, he will tell u that it was after all, a blessing in disguise</p>

              <p><br>Aiyo Humsup Uncle, i also study singapore history leh, what is singapore politics, comparing to taiwan politics, singapore is chicken feet lor. Taiwan politics immersed itself on mafia, corruption, espionage, betray, border tension, slapping and fighting. I have no doubt that not one of singapore minister can take on a taiwanese govt role. Before they walk out of the home, they might be shot dead.</p>

              <p><br>If you are so proud of the Taiwanese politics - and cannot appreciate the history of Singapore Politics - Go back to Taiwan.</p>
              <p>What is a "hum" like you doing on Singapore shores ?</p>
              <p>Do you think that a Taiwanese "hum" can survive in Singapore for more then a month in office ?</p>
              <p>It is obvious your Taiwanese familiarity with the life of a "hum" has got you stuck at that level of filth that you thrive in - what do you understand about the sophisticated methods of demolishing a political opponent ?</p>
              <p>Do we need to explore the mind of a "hum" for your adoration of LKY in his gangster methods used ?</p>
