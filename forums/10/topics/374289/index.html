              the above reports, the Straits Times goes to great lengths to depict
              the book as a definitive and objective account of PAP's history,
              supported by interviews with its opponents - including former
              communists now exiled in Thailand and leftists <em>(a catch-all byword for staunch anti-colonialists)</em> who had left the PAP to form the breakaway Barisan Sosialis.<br><br>But
              remarkably, the two full page report mentions not a single whiff of
              Operation Coldstore, the infamous 1963 mass arrests that decimated the
              entire leadership of the political opposition to the PAP.<br><br>Another
              glaring omission was how the writers failed to contact two founding PAP
              members, Dr Poh Soo Kai and Dr Lim Hock Siew, who were arrested under
              Operation Coldstore and detained without trial for periods of up to 19
              years. Along with Said Zahari, Lee Tse Tong and Ho Piao, both of them

But like many of his anti-colonialist
              colleagues of the PAP, Lim broke away from the PAP and formed the
              opposition <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barisan_Sosialis">Barisan Sosialis</a> in 1961. On 2nd February 1963, he was arrested and detained under
              Operation Coldstore. Even after Singapore's independence in 1965, Lim
              continued to be detained under the Internal Security Act by Lee Kuan
              Yew's government. On 6th of September 1982, he was finally released,
              capping a 19 years 8 months incarceration - making him Singapore's
              longest-held political prisoner after Chia Thye Poh. Dr Lim has
              confirmed with me that he was never contacted by the writers of Men In

              and hundreds of others were arbitrarily arrested on the 2nd of
              February, 1963. Many are still in prison. Ever since that day, we were,
              and are, unjustly and arbitrarily detained in prison without any kind
              of trial whatsoever for over 9 years. We have gone through various
              kinds of persecution, struggles, hardships and difficulties during this
              very long period of over nine years of detention in prison. Recently an
              unusual development took place. On the 13th of January, 1972, I was
              taken to the Headquarters of the Special Branch at Robinson Road where
              I was detained for 40 days together with my brother, Lim Hock Koon.<br><br><em>Two
              high-ranking special branch agents of the P.A.P. regime indicated to me
              that if I were to issue a public statement of repentance, I would be
              released. </em>They told me that 9 years had passed since the date of
              my arrest and that it was time that my case be settled. They admitted
              that 9 years was a long time. I told them that it was pointless to
              remind me of this long period.<br><br>A week after my transfer to the
              Special Branch Headquarters, the same two high-ranking employees spelt
              out the conditions of my release. <em>They demanded from me two things.</em> They are as follows: -<br><br>(1)
              That I make an oral statement of my past political activities, that is
              to say, "A security statement." This was meant for the Special Branch
              records only, and not meant for publication.<br><br>(2) That I must issue a public statement consisting of two points : -<br>(a) That I am prepared to give up politics and devote to medical practice thereafter.<br>(b) That I must express support for the Parliamentary democratic system.<br><br>I
              shall now recall and recapitulate the conversation that took place
              between me and the same two high-ranking Special Branch agents during
              my detention at the Special Branch Headquarters.<br><br><strong>Special Branch</strong> - You need not have to condemn the Barisan Sosialis or any person. We
              admit that it is unjust to detain you so long. 9 years is a long time
              in a person's life; we are anxious to settle your case.<br><br><strong>Dr Lim Hock Siew</strong> - My case will be settled immediately if I am released unconditionally.
              I was not asked at the time of my arrest whether I ought to be
              arrested. Release me unconditionally and my case is settled.<br><br><strong>Special Branch</strong> - The key is in your hands. It is for you to open the door.<br><br><strong>Dr Lim Hock Siew</strong> - To say that the key is in my hands is the inverted logic of gangsters
              in which white is black and black is white. The victim is painted as
              the culprit and the culprit is made to look innocent. Four Gurkha
              soldiers were brought to my house to arrest me. I did not ask or seek
              arrest or the prolonged detention for over 9 years in prison without
              trial.<br><br><strong>Special Branch</strong> - You must concede
              something so that Lee Kuan Yew would be in a position to explain to the
              public why you had been detained so long. Mr Lee Kuan Yew must also
              preserve his face. If you were to be released unconditionally, he will
              lose face.<br><br><strong>Dr Lim Hock Siew</strong> - I am not
              interested in saving Lee Kuan Yew's face. This is not a question of
              pride but one of principle. My detention is completely unjustifiable
              and I will not lift a single finger to help Lee Kuan Yew to justify the
              unjustifiable. In the light of what you say, is it not very clear that
              I have lost my freedom all these long and bitter years just to save Lee
              Kuan Yew's face? Therefore the P.A.P. regime's allegation that I am a
              security risk is a sham cover and a facade to detain me unjustifiably
              for over 9 years.<br><br><strong>My stand on the Making of a Secret Oral Security Statement for the records of the Special Branch</strong><br><br>I
              cannot and will not make any statement to condemn my past political
              activities. My past political activities were absolutely legitimate and
              proper. Whatever I had done or said was in the interest of and in the
              service of the masses of our people and of our country. Even an accused
              person need not say anything to incriminate or to condemn himself. Why
              should I who am arbitrarily detained without any kind of trial for over
              9 years be coerced to act as an agent to the Special Branch by making a
              secret deal behind the backs of the masses? I resolutely reject this
              demand. Furthermore, I have not the slightest obligation to account my
              past political activities to Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br><strong>A. My Stand on the Demand of Making a Public Statement</strong><br><br>I
              completely reject in principle the issuing of any public statement as a
              condition of my release. This is a form of public repentance. History
              has completely vindicated my position. I was arrested for opposing
              merger with "Malaysia" because I held the view that "Malaysia" was a
              British sponsored neo-colonialist product and the creation of
              "Malaysia", far from uniting our people and our country, would cause
              greater dis-unity and dissension among our people. I believe that the
              formation of Malaysia would be a step backward and not forward in our
              struggle for national unity.<br><br><em>I have nothing to repent, to
              recant or to reform. If anything I have become more reinforced in my
              convictions, more reaffirmed in my views and more resolute to serve the
              people of Malaya fully and whole-heartedly. I have nothing to concede
              to Lee Kuan Yew. By right, he should make a public repentance to me and
              not I to him.<br></em><br><strong>B. My Stand on the Demand that I must give up Politics in Exchange for my Release</strong><br><br>I
              hold the view that these two demands are self-contradictory, because if
              there is democracy, I need not give up politics. The fact that I had
              been detained for over 9 years in order to coerce me to give up
              politics is proof enough that there is no parliamentary democracy. The
              question of taking part on politics is a fundamental right of the
              people.<br><br>An indirect offer was made to me to leave Singapore for
              further studies. I have replied to the P.A.P. regime that if I had to
              leave the country at any time, it must be on my own free volition and
              not under coercion by the P.A.P regime.</p>
              <br><br><strong>C. My Stand on the Demand for support for Parliamentary System</strong><br><br>I
              hold the view that to support the P.A.P. regime's so-called
              parliamentary system would mean giving the public and the masses a
              false impression that there exist today a genuine parliamentary
              democratic system in Singapore Island. It is an undeniable and
              unforgettable fact that comrade LEE TSE TONG who was elected by the
              people of Singapore in the 1963 General Elections, was arbitrarily
              arrested and detained without trial <em>soon after</em> he was
              elected. Subsequently, he was deprived of his citizenship and he is
              still under detention as a so-called "banishee" in prisoner's clothes
              in Queenstown prison. The arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention of
              Comrade Lee Tse Tong affords concrete proof that the so-called
              parliamentary democracy is a cruel mockery. It does not exist in
              Singapore Island. Giving support to such a sham parliamentary system
              means complete betrayal of the people. I will never betray the people
              of my country under any circumstance. <em>Bitter sacrifice strengthens bold resolve.</em><br><br>Parliamentary
              democracy does not mean merely casting of votes once in 5 years during
              election time. Far more important than this is the freedom of thought,
              the freedom of expression, the freedom of association, the freedom of
              organisation everyday during the 5 years period and continuously
              thereafter. I was arrested when the Barisan Sosialis was actively
              participating in the parliamentary system. For such participation, the
              colonial government, the Lee Kuan Yew and Rahman regimes had rewarded
              me with over 9 years of imprisonment. This again amply indicates the
              utter shamness of the so-called parliamentary democratic system. After
              over 9 years of detention, I am now asked to give support to their
              so-called parliamentary system in order to secure my release. I firmly
              refuse to give my support for the sham and illusory democracy in
              Singapore Island.<br><br><strong>My Stand on the Request by the Agents of the P.A.P. Regime to Concede something to save Lee Kuan Yew's Face</strong><br><br>Since
              history has fully vindicated my stand and my position, Lee Kuan Yew
              should openly and publicly repent to me and to all other political
              detainees, now unjustifiably detained in prison. By right a just and
              proper base for my release from my prolonged and unjustifiable
              detention (and this equally applies to all political detainees now
              under unjustifiable detention) should be : -<br><br>(a) Our unconditional and immediate release from detention and the complete restoration of all our democratic and human rights.<br><br>(b)
              Payment of adequate compensation to me and to all other political
              detainees for the prolonged and unjustifiable detention in prison.<br><br>(c) The issuance of public apology by Lee Kuan Yew to me.<br><br>We
              are willing and prepared to concede the last two conditions as listed
              above. We do not believe that an arrogant man like Lee Kuan Yew will
              apologise or to compensate us.<br><br>On the first condition that is to
              say, our demand for unconditional and immediate release from detention,
              and for the complete restoration of all our democratic and human rights
              - we must resolutely say : WE WILL NEVER CONCEDE, BITTER SACRIFICE
              STRENGTHENS BOLD RESOLVE.<br><br>+ + + +<br></blockquote>

              <p>Should we be surprised that MM had so willingly endorsed the book ?</p>
              <p>He would have justified his actions by saying what he had said at the recent forum -</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>'You look at our record and the moves we've made. Let me put it simply like this. First, we maintain a system which gives any opposition the opportunity to displace us peacefully. We allow the system: we've not interfered with the civil service, the judiciary, parliamentary procedures, the police and so on.</em></p>
              <p><em>If you can win an election, so be it. If at some point we are not able to find a team which can equal an opposition team, on that day we deserve to be out. If we become corrupt, inefficient, can't deliver, we're out.'</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is ironical that he should claim that "<em>we maintain a system which gives any opposition the opportunity to displace us peacefully</em>". considering the viciousness that he has allowed his system to persecute those whom he feel so insecure with.</p>

              <p><br>Given a book written for the purpose of those white cloth PAP glory, do you think they are going to write about fishy and political prisoner cases?? Aren't you too childish to comment on such a book knowing that it is meant for PAP and supporters and hopefully youngster like us?? We can sympathize those ex political prisoners, but what to do, at that time the British and Tengku also play a hand on it, why must it be PAP LKY, he saw the gain in unification but others dun see it, therefore to get a full consenous, the Brit move in and settle the messy political scene once and for all. So, i bet that in 1963, life will change for many, depending on which boat you are on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My respect to those opposition political prisoners for their persistence and believing in their principles, but as the chinese say, in a mountain, there can only be one Lion King, so that is it, either you bow to him or you get lost. In fact, these old opposition people are real stupid, if given a chance to apologise and be set free, go ahead and apologise, then leave the country and work from outside in to crumble LKY, but they choose to stay inside there just because they have those communist mindset of never surrender and therefore suffered the consquences. Too bad.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>I am of opinion you have framed it incorrectly. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The conventional view is that the left wing of the PAP took the initiative to break with the party. (Thus your question why did left-wing split from the PAP to form the Barisan Sosialis.) There has been no convincing evidence to support this view.<br></strong></span><br>The left-wing leadership had <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>campaigned on a genuine anti-colonial, democratic platform. They had called for an end to arbitrary arrest and continued detention, an end to the restrictions on freedom and for observation of human rights, and an end to the obstructions put in the way of trade union unification.<br></strong></span><br>It had invited the government to :<br><br>- Release immediately all political detainees;<br>- Assist in the speedy unification of the trade union movement;<br>- Grant the right of citizenship and franchise to all those loyal to the anti-colonial struggle;<br>- And to allow freedom of the press, speech and assembly and organisation.<br><br>Of note is that <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>they regarded themselves as part of the PAP. There was no talk of a structural split. Harry Lee had threatened to resign if he lost Anson.</strong></span> The unionists said that was his business. A tougher tone than the statement before Hong Lim by-election.<br><br><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The PAP leadership before the 1957 annual genaral meeting had decided to discard its powerful left wing.</strong></span> The issue was how, when and the consequences. Consequences both from the Singapore electorate and the Tungku who would much like to replace him.<br><br><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>By 1961 secret negotiations for merger and "the grand design" were well underway between Harry, Tungku and the Colonial masters. The PAP leadership grasped the safety line of merger initiated by the British. He decided to discard his powerful left wing,</strong></span> but the fight was now shifted from release of detainees, freedom, etc to that of merger. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The initiative for the split thus was from the PAP leadership, not from the left-wing</span>.</strong></p>

              <p><br>Given a book written for the purpose of those white cloth PAP glory, do you think they are going to write about fishy and political prisoner cases?? Aren't you too childish to comment on such a book knowing that it is meant for PAP and supporters and hopefully youngster like us?? We can sympathize those ex political prisoners, but what to do, at that time the British and Tengku also play a hand on it, why must it be PAP LKY, he saw the gain in unification but others dun see it, therefore to get a full consenous, the Brit move in and settle the messy political scene once and for all. So, i bet that in 1963, life will change for many, depending on which boat you are on.</p>

              <p>My respect to those opposition political prisoners for their persistence and believing in their principles, but as the chinese say, in a mountain, there can only be one Lion King, so that is it, either you bow to him or you get lost. In fact, these old opposition people are real stupid, if given a chance to apologise and be set free, go ahead and apologise, then leave the country and work from outside in to crumble LKY, but they choose to stay inside there just because they have those communist mindset of never surrender and therefore suffered the consquences.

              <p> </p>
              <p>In 1965, history rewrite itself, the LKY and the chinese was a threat to tengku and malaysia, LKY was a good speaker, good motivator and good leader with a clear vision whereas the tengku was a lazy bum, drink and wine with gals and was being treated like a king in malaysia, therefore tengku see the threat of his position at stake, after discussing with the British, the British agree to abandon Singapore and collaberate with tengku to kick out Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After the separation, LKY did not go dishearted, one thing for sure is that most of the opposition politicians was gone and he got to take singapore all the way up, with the moving off of the British army forces, lots of peoples working for the british went jobless, and the whole country is in the dark..but he showed us that there is a light in the tunnel, and if today, if you will to ask him about the bleak days after separation, he will tell u that it was after all, a blessing in disguise</p>
