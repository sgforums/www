Because with longer lifespans you cannot retire at 55 and live until 80 or 85 or 90," Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a speech on state television to mark the city-state's national day.<br><br>Like governments in developed nations such as Germany and Japan, Singapore's leaders worry about the long-term implications of an aging population - higher pension costs, a shrinking workforce, and slower economic growth.<br><br>"As lifespans go up you have to <span style="color: red;">work longer </span>and then have <span style="color: red;">not too long a period of retirement</span> at the <strong>end of your life</strong>," said Lee, son of the city-state's founding premier Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>In February, the government introduced an income-support scheme called "workfare" aimed at providing financial support to older, low-income workers as part of the 2007/08 budget.<br><br>The Southeast Asian island's government wants to boost the workforce by increasing its population to as much as 6.5 million from 4.5 million over the next 40 to 50 years by allowing more immigrants into the country.<br><br>Singapore, the wealthiest country in Asia after Japan in terms of gross national income per capita, is already the world's fourth most-densely populated country - with more more than 6,208 people per square km.<br><br>By 2050 that is expected to rise to 6,497 people per square km, leaving it 176 times more crowded than the United States, and nearly as packed as Hong Kong, according to the United Nations.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the raising of draw down age (DDA) is to retain more money in the system, because with all the bad investments they are making, they run the risk of inflation with increases in the money supply.<br><br>Progressively, the P4P will tell the people that the average life expectancy of Singaporeans are 100 y.o. and they should raise the draw down age to 80 y.o.<br><br>With the current trend in marriage statistics and birth rates in Singapore, there is no doubt that a substantial portion of the population will have no children when they die, so nobody to bequeath the CPF savings to. So naturally, this will all return to the government.<br><br>The P4P has done well not to promote the growth of it's existing citizens, but chose instead to import citizens from 3rd world countries like India and China to make up for the shortfall in future population.<br><br>Wise up fellow Singaporeans!<br><br></div>
