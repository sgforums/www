And it is also possible that figures reported by other countries could also be diluted with influx of migrants. For example Switzerland is know for many multl millionaire "immigrant" who migrate there for enjoy the low income tax.<br><br>What I couldnt understand is why in countries like Switzerland or Finland where quality and standard of living is so much better than Singapore still have such a high suicide rate.<br><br></div>
