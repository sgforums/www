But with more voices in parliament, the voices of common Singaporeans would be heard. It's only a 5 year term for him, but this change can do a lot of good for the people of Singapore, because during this period more Singaporeans will step up to join politics as the grip of the dominant party is reduced.<br><br>If you think that CSJ is not good and you are better than him, then you should have the guts to stand for elections, else what's the point of talking and complaining. I admit that CSJ is not very wise at times, but at least he has the balls to stand up against authority.

In my mind I am thinking, when will we ever have opposition with good paper qualification, nobody with good paper qualification would want to join the opposition for fear of legal suits.<br><br>Only when we have overcome the initial obstacles of winning a majority representation, will we ever have the opportunity to entice more talents into the opposition camp.<br><br>Either that or dissolve the party political system, let individuals representations be based on their own merits. In which case, any bills introduced into parliament will have a non party political bias. Everyone will be elected on their own merits, if their performance is sub-optimal, electorates will ensure the end of his political career. For this to happen they should also remove their current unfair practice of Group Representation Constituency.</div>
