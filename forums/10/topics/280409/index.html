            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>SINGAPORE: By year's end, all adult male patients admitted to hospitals will be asked if they would like to take a HIV-screening test.<br><br>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan told Parliament on Tuesday he is also changing the Infectious Diseases Act soon so that no one will be able to claim ignorance of one's HIV-positive status as defence against charges of high-risk behaviour.<br><br>He said: "All individuals who engage in high-risk sexual behaviour must go for regular HIV-testing. The Infectious Diseases Act makes it an offence for someone who is HIV-positive to have sex without informing his sexual partner of his HIV status. I will soon come to this House to amend the Act to clarify that ignorance of one's HIV status will not be a defence for those who engage in high-risk sexual behaviour."<br></blockquote>Trust our "Opt-Out" Minister to come up with such an idea.<br><br>What next?<br>I predict in response to the headline "60-year-old woman is 8th person to die from dengue this year", he will say "Ignorance of <strong>dengue </strong>is no defence".<br><br>Next, if your kid goes to school and catches <strong>chickenpox</strong>, don't worry! "Ignorance of chickenpox is no defence!!" Follow the example of our health minister and sue the pants off the other child's parents for letting him go to school.<br><br>And when you catch a <strong>flu</strong> from your sniffling colleague.... you guessed it!!! "Ignorance is no defence!!" Sue your company as well too, even if they didn't know he was sick. After all, remember the motto of the day - "<strong>Ignorance is no defence</strong>!!".</div>

So you punish them because they are unlucky enough?<br><br>you need not always pay for sex. expecially for females.<br><br>even if its no chance. still theres the in between period. like say you check once a month, maybe its a responsible period to you or you feel once a week whatever, lets assume it is.<br><br>so lets say you always screen on the 29th of the month. but 5 or 6 months ago you did the act on the 30th and got it. so for the remaining about 30 days you don't know but can infect. how?<br><br></div>
