            <div class='col-md body'>here is the message for those who opposed the law.  Think about why such talk about law being introduce.<br><br>Unfortunately, SG self help group are small and weak, funding are low,  and of course people generally do not pay attention to issue that they do not want to hear, it is such a social disgrace to even contracted HIVs.. All the HIV awareness program probably fall on deafear.  So at the end of the day it is our ignorant and arongant that lead to this sorry state of implementing another "Law" .<br><br>I think at this point population who are HIV postive has climb tremendously. The funding for Aids patient care are  continue to climb but at minimum. Social acceptance of HIV positive individual are closed to Zero.<br><br>Here are some of the actual social issue that happen to HIV individual in SG.  if you are tested HIV positive and contracted aids.<br><br>1) Your family will throw you out think that they will get infected by person living at home.<br>2) You are a social outcast in SG u can't get jobs.<br>3) there are already 2nd generation of HIV baby<br>4) Age contracted ages from from 20s to 60 ah pei and aunty because their husband go out and have unprotected sex and infect their old age wife.<br>5) young girls got aids because boy friends from NS go out and have unprotected sex<br>6) taking the cocktail of drugs is a daily affair it will prolong your life but how much u have to pay for the drugs? Let's just say it is more than the cost of your daily meal.<br>7) chances of HIV positive individual will not be able to get into another relationship.<br><br>If u really care about it go volunteer. Good luck.<br><br></div>

Conviction could lead to a prison term of up to seven years, while communicating for such a purpose could bring up to two years in jail, the bill says.<br><br>Similar offenses committed abroad would attract the same punishments, it says.<br><br>Local media have reported that some Singaporeans travel to the nearby Indonesian island of Batam for sex with teenage girls.<br><br>In another new provision, making travel arrangements intended to facilitate under-age commercial sex abroad would bring up to 10 years in prison, the bill says.<br><br>The revised penal code, still to be passed into law by parliament, also broadens the scope of an offense against unlawful assembly.<br><br>An assembly of five or more people would be illegal if the group's common objective is to commit "any offense," the bill says, broadening the definition from mischief and trespass.<br><br>Singapore's laws against unlawful assembly gained prominence during last year's meetings in the city-state by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.<br><br>Pro-democracy activist Chee Soon Juan engaged in a three-day standoff with police, who stopped him and a small group of followers from marching to the meeting venue after police rejected his application for a permit<br><br></div>
