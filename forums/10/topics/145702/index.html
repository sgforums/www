            <div class='col-md body'>Not long ago, there was this case of a Chairman of a taxi company who beat up a young driver because of road rage. Remember?

            <div class='col-md body'>Many of our taxis are definitely nuisances on our roads. There are countless accidents involving them or caused by them. A large number of taxi drivers are hot tempered and are emotionally unstable and I am sure most of us have encountered bad experiences with them either as passengers or road users.<br><br>As part of our country's excellence and continuous imrpovement programme to move up the ladder as a world class city, we should introduce more stringent tests for new and existing taxi drivers. At the moment taxi licences are issued liberally like free tickets, and are easily acquired as a back-up for unemployment by many people.<br><br>Besides knowing our roads which is the main test carried out today, they should be tested on their driving skills at a higher level, and also on their emotional temperament , behavior, and mannerism. This is because they are in control of a killer machine on our roads all day long. Poor driving skills and any instability in their emotional state can be disastrous.<br><br>A taxi licence should be a prized possession accorded only to drivers who are not only well versed in quality service but who are of sound and stable mind just like pilots because lives are in their hands.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>KNNBCCB, just when I say that Taxis are not that bad, I just kena one idiotic taxi driver on my way home.<br><br>It was at a traffic light controlled X- junction. I was in the middle lane and he was in the right lane side by side waiting for the lights to turn green. When the lights changed, I started to move off straight but I realise that the taxi beside me is coming in slowly into my lane. It was very squeezy as there was another car in the left most lane. What piss me off is that this taxi driver did not even signal his intention. So I honked at him. But he continued his slow cutting in motion.<br><br>I had no choice but to let him in. I over took him on the right, and looked at him. He actually stared at me. Then later, he overtook me on the right and honked at me!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Can anyone tell me what company these white coloured taxis belong to?
