              <p>it works by this theory, given the situation in singapore, they will be also realise that its not as rosy as they initially thought it was, due to the quality of life found here, so what happens is that they realise they holding a little red book called the singapore passport which is the stepping stone to other countries. Psychology will tell u that  when stuck in a sticky situation, u will look for the next best thing and the best resource u have to achieve that.</p>
              <p>U come out of the desert to be stuck in a dark cave and heave a sigh of relief for a little while till  reality starts to grab u . U realise that though the cave is better than the desert, u still find your self in a similar situation. and u only have some matches at hand at this time, u will 100% sure to light up those matches to find your way out not back into the desert but to another place called oasis where its teeming with life, much better than the desert and cave.</p>

              <p><br>I suggest that you go to Singaporeexpat forum to ask how many of them are actually living on expat package and please also go read some HR journal to find out more about Singapore pay package.</p>
              <p>I believe the main reason why you make such baseless assumption is because you are born to become a white dick sucker and thats why you always believe that they are a threat to your livelihood when they visit Singapore. And somehow I think that has also motivated you to migrate to Australia because you believe that one day you will  become more superior than Singaporeans and will return as an expat.  </p>
              <p>Btw, care to share with us, what TALENT do you have that Singapore cant replaced?</p>

              <p>Please lah...MBA holder is of no use if he dont have with at least 10 years of managerial experience and hold a position of at least a senior manager.
