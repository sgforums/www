              <p>The Singaporeans who truely migrated to Australia and any other countries are those who took out their CPF money and gave up singapore citizenship.

              <p>Those you mentioned secretly take up Aussie citizenship and still holding on to their Singapore citizen as a back up plan, this I believe some are doing so.     But those I know of who migrated to Australia do not belong to this category.    However, I know my cousins are holding on to their Singapore citizenship and now become PRs in US.  </p>

              <p><br>There is nothing to be surprise actually. What many Singaporeans are doing is that when they reach a retirement age of about 60 years old, they will give up their citizenship, withdraw their CPF and buy a landed house in Malaysia for retirement.</p>

              <p>I believe most people who gave up their Singapore citizenships are those who wants to withdraw the CPF monies for retirement or to live a "comfortable" life. Some have made the right move, while there are those who regretted it.  </p>
              <p>One example is a Singapore lady who married an Australian, when her husband passed away, she couldnt return to Singapore because she would have to return back all the CPF monies she has withdrawn.  </p>
