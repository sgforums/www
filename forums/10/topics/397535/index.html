              <p>Singaporeans have the highest pension contribution rate in the world at 34.5% for the CPF scheme but one of the lowest net balance among developed nations.</p>
              <p>Why? Because of high HDB prices. We contribute so much into CPF so that the govt may use our money. On paper, we have an asset which is worth a lot but it's pretty useless unless you cash it out.</p>

              <p>Sian they take our CPF money go do stupid investment. When investment fails, they increase the age required to withdraw the money so as to buy time for them to earn back the money that they lost. If investment success (wont happen one) - they earn lor they happy . If fail, they tell citizen "wait ar, I later than pay back u wait first."</p>
              <p>Got alot of money in CPF no use. It its as good as the government write you a piece of paper saying "I own you S$<em>XXX</em>. You will get <em>Y</em> amount of money every month when you reach <em>Z</em> years of age." KNN after I reached <em>Z</em> years of age I wont live long enough to completely take out my money!</p>

              <p>Govt really takes care of us? lol. Your houses are much cheaper
                  in relativity to your incomes, even after deducting for tax which
                  ensures that you have intensive health benefits when you
                  retire.</p>
              <p>So how long have you been an ex-Singaporean? And any idea how
                  much our HDB flats cost now?</p>

              <p>our earliest HDB flats were erected since the 1960's, the isnt even half of 99 years yet, and we have since witnessed alot of people who lived in old estates moving into the newer ones.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Still the homes are not permanent, because we need it for redevelopment, furthermore, if we have a freehold on HDB flats, who knows what may  happen to prices? do take note that singapore is land scarce,</p>

              <p>I think you should be thankful as SIngaporean as your government really take care of you. AT least you have paper showing that you have asset. I am ex Singaporean now living in Canada. Do you know that we have to pay income tax every month? So, our Canadian government get our income tax monthly as compared to Singapore government deducting your CPF so that you can pay your HDB or whatever condo... Here we pay real cash on monthly basis for mortgage inaddition to monthly tax. Which is better? At least PAP scheme allows you to have a house to call your own. Though i am not a fan of PAP, but this CPF scheme is really a good one. Be thankful :)</p>

              <p>Of course the comapny will have to pay us the 14.5% back in bonus and wage increment back. Those companies not doing so will lose employees. Singapore has a unique system of highest savings rate in the world but its a significant propotion citizens cannot retire.... All thanks to CPF paying "risk free rates" peg to 10 yr bonds for longterm funds.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans have the highest pension contribution rate in the world at 34.5% for the CPF scheme but one of the lowest net balance among developed nations.</p>
              <p>Why? Because of high HDB prices. We contribute so much into CPF so that the govt may use our money. On paper, we have an asset which is worth a lot but it's pretty useless unless you cash it out.</p>

              <p><br>On paper, yr pathetic HDB flat price also increased alot, and as a owner, you should be happy that you can use your CPF to live on a house worth more than what you paid. Stop grumbling.</p>
