              <p>Justin,</p>
              <p>for anybody to understand your questions, you need to first let us know if your friend is a Singaporean, on contract working overseas, or an FT, on contract working here?</p>
              <p>Secondly, who are the employers, the Singapore government, SME, MNC? What kind of contract is he having with his company? Not all contracts governed by labour laws in Singapore, and there is no Singapore policies for ALL organization, especially one that help anybody to work less and pay more! even for employment of maids, there are different starting salaries, day offs....</p>
              <p>Whatever the situation, your acquiantance, if he were an FT,  should have checked before coming here, or may be he thought Singapore is still a UK colony, should offer 6 weeks patenity leave? The best person who can help him is his PR manager.</p>

              <p>Justin - there are alway 2 side of a coin. You just been presented one side.</p>
              <p>On government companies - a lot of them pay better and even have bonus - compare to outside companies. <br><br>Expats and " international contracts"  are pay a lot much better then local - if you want to bark like a dog on little things like day off ... fxxk off - they can bloody well go home !!! no one force them to sign the contracts. Use your brain and think why they come here in the first place - $$$ of course.  </p>
              <p>Your acquaintance didn't have time to be a good husband or father - it is his choice !!! He can pack up and go home and be a good husband and father not like we singapore kidnapped him and force him to work here as slave !!! <br><br>Look at a local worker - he work as hard as your acquaintance and same long hours. he also will not have time to be a good husband or father and will be a poor father while your acquaintance will be at least a rich father.</p>

              <p>As a foreigner coming here to work he would or should have scrutinised the contract throughly before signing. And as a foreigner he would also have negotiated hard the terms and conditions. </p>
              <p>Therefore he should not complain if he is not getting benefits that are not in there, but is in UK.</p>
              <p>Everyone has problems with getting off from work and attending to famiily and personal matters, even Singaporeans. Not every situation can be covered by the T&amp;C.</p>
              <p>You mention "why the company" this is rather impersonal. Although the company is an legal entity, it is not a person. Matters regarding special arrangements is best discussed with people in the company. People in the company are normal people like you and me. Things can be sorted out. Privately griping about unfair situation to colleagues will not bring about a solution.</p>
              <p>Its a solution that is wanted, not an airing of grivences.</p>

              At least your acquaintance is paid well for "overworking".
              
              Those Asians who "overwork" washing dishes in the back allys of restaurants in uk don't even get a decent time off, much less to be a good father.
              
              Fts everywhere around the world made their choices to work overseas for more money. They should know what they are getting themselves into, so quit bitching.

              <p>IMHO after having worked in many places,working in SG is woring in China/India but about 200% better(Pay+ Life balance). Working in US is about 200% better than SG(Pay/Life is not so good). Working in EU(good company and good contract) is about 300% better(less pay but a good life balance).</p>
              <p>Of course an expatriate/Intl. contract kicks ass.</p>

              <p>Also, I feel that your version of an 'open-door' policy (The door is open; leave if you want) is inhumane. Yes, he *could* leave if he was unhappy but you have to understand that circumstances don't always allow it. I mean, they're working for you; you should at least care about them.<br> <br> I wouldn't know the details about his pay as I've never personally asked but I'm pretty sure all lecturers are paid handsomely.<br><br>@mancha<br>Yes.. He should have and he may or may not have done that but the thing is, the sudden cut in days of leave was unfair in my opinion. I know that this does not only affect him. Does anyone recall when such 'cuts' were issued and the general reaction to it?<br><br>Like a date or article? I can't seem to find it.</p>

              <p>SG used to be a good place to work for locals and the Foreigners. Once they opened the gates for foreigners it's simply destroyed. They should have allowed only immigrants with very high income or those who studied in SG to remain there.I know many escorts who are PR under Talent section.</p>
              <p>When I was in SG a few years ago I saw people struggling to get into bus/MRT more like animals brought for slaughter and I couldn't take it any more and left.</p>
              <p>Moral of story its a sunk ship. The Govt doesn't care about their own people IMHO. If you have a very good contract may be it's worth it. Normally the companies has only 15 days holidays and if you are sick you need to see a Doc before 10AM and inform the company etc. Very barbaric.</p>

              <p>Also, I feel that your version of an 'open-door' policy (The door is open; leave if you want) is inhumane.

              <p>"Matters regarding special arrangements is best discussed with people in the company. People in the company are normal people like you and me. Things can be sorted out. Privately griping about unfair situation to colleagues will not bring about a solution.</p>
              <p>Its a solution that is wanted, not an airing of grivences."<br>Hmm, Thanks for the info.<br>I'll try asking if he's already done that.</p>

              <p>@NewAgeSensitiveBoy<br>And those people wash dishes because they're too young for other kinds of work or not skilled enough (or a host of other unfortunate circumstances).<br><br>It is only natural for a person to want to be cared for.<br>This is not 'bitching', he merely told me about what's been stressing him and I, as a curious individual, decided to poke around and figure out why the current system works this way; I just want to know the reasons behind the choices.<br><br>@Punggol<br>"This is personal"<br>Yes, I understand that but it occurred to me that he isn't the only foreigner that would have this problem.<br>And policies should be based on what..

              <p>Justin,</p>
              <p>you are not sure how things are run but you "guess it's the government for the sudden cuts in days of leave and the company for the paternity leave" ----- Wrong. How many days off for your paternity leave varies from company to company, you can also get day off if your boss is generous. Lecturers are quite sinnang during school holidays, but during school terms, when you go on leave than somebody will have to take your class, fair or not???</p>
              <p>"And policies should be based on what.. "satisfies" the employers and employees.. Right?------Wrong. Policies are made by the company to protect the employers first!</p>
              <p>you talk about 'open door' policy and " I mean, they're working for you; you should at least care about them." ------ Wrong, they work for the company, not for me or Singapore.</p>
              <p>It is his choice to come, he made his commitment by accepting the contract, and is paid handsomely, now he is bound by what he agreed and signed. So he just can't walk away? Right, nothing inhumane about.</p>
              <p>For a lecturer to mourn to you, a 17 year old, about his paternity leave, ....hmmmm...something not very right. your acquantance from where? Philippines, China or India???</p>
              <p>you can be ignorant, but don't be naive.<br></p>

              <p>If you are Justin beiber or timberlake, I guess no problem, you sure to get good employment benefits, but unfortunate you are not, you are just a 17 yo Justin dunno who the shit is...</p>
              <p>Anyway, under contractual employment, if you had agreed and sign on the rules and regulations, the benefits, the entitements and of cos the pay. YOU SIGN WITH YOUR EYES OPEN. The employment Act of singapore do cover the minimium requirement, most companies will provide much better than the employment Act inorder to attract peoples/talents or peoples like your frens. If the contract goes below the employment Act, you can sue the company. Period</p>
