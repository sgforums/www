He deserves recognition for what he did. And the younger generations Â– both in Indonesia and in the world Â– do not remember where Indonesia started. I do. That's why I came here to visit him.<br><br>"He gave Indonesia progress and development. He educated the population. He built roads and infrastructure. And from Sukarno's konfrontasi and other foreign policy excesses, he stabilised international relations, cooperated in ASEAN and made ASEAN more successful than SARC in South Asia. And today, we have a stable Southeast Asia."<br><br>Despite the growth and prosperity that Mr Suharto brought, the former military general has come under heavy criticism for abusing his power.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "Yes, there was corruption. Yes, he gave favours to his family and his friends. But there was real growth and real progress. I think the people of Indonesia are lucky. They had a general in charge, had a team of competent administrators Â– including a very good team of economists to build up the country."<br><br>Mr Suharto was forced to step down from office in 1998, soon after the Asian financial crisis that derailed the Indonesian economy.<br><br>Many had put the blame on the former president. But Mr Lee put the developments in perspective.<br><br>He said: "From '67 when he became president right up to '97, the economy grew and Indonesia was on the point of taking off the economy. It didn't take off not because of his fault (but) because bank Indonesia's interest rate was too high, and so the companies borrowed in USD for low interest rates. When confidence was lost after the Thai baht crisis and people wanted to pull their money out, the whole thing collapsed. It was not his fault."<br><br>Comparing Mr Suharto to former Myanmar leader Ne Win, who came to power almost at the same time, Mr Lee said Indonesia is doing better now because of Mr Suharto's leadership.<br><br>Through decades of formal ties established as leaders of two neighbouring countries, it is clear that a strong bond exists between the two former heads who played a significant part in the growth and development of their respective countries as well as within the region.<br><br>- CNA/so</div>

He was in Jakarta yesterday to visit the critically-ill Mr Suharto.<br><br>Speaking to the media after he left the hospital, Mr Lee said Mr Suharto is not getting the recognition he deserves.<br><br>Adding that he came to pay tribute, he said: "I feel sad to see a very old friend with whom I had worked closely over the last 30 years not really getting the honours that he deserves. He deserves recognition for what he did. And the younger generations Â— both in Indonesia and in the world Â— do not remember where Indonesia started. I do.<br><br>"He gave Indonesia progress and development. He educated the population. He built roads and infrastructure. And from Sukarno's konfrontasi and other foreign policy excesses, he stabilised international relations, cooperated in Asean and made Asean more successful than SARC in South Asia. And today, we have a stable South-east Asia.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">"Yes, there was corruption. Yes, he gave favours to his family and his friends. But there was real growth and real progress. I think the people of Indonesia are lucky.</span></strong> They had a general in charge, had a team of competent administrators Â— including a very good team of economists to build up the country."<br><br>Mr Lee went on to put the developments in perspective.<br><br>"From '67 when he became President right up to '97, the economy grew and Indonesia was on the point of taking off. It didn't take off not because of his fault but because Bank Indonesia's interest rate was too high."<br><br>Mr Suharto's condition worsened yesterday, two days after he suffered multiple organ failure, doctors said.
