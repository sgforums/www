I mean he wanted my view. So I said proceed, it's not going to be popular, you're not going to win votes with this. But proceed."<br><br>Mr Goh explained the increase is necessary: "I want to emphasise that the Ministers are less concerned about their own salaries. Of course one can argue that the salaries must be pegged to those at the top. But the Ministers are not too concerned because their salaries I would say is quite attractive. But we are concerned about the civil servants now and the next generation of people whom we are trying to target to become Ministers."<br><br>He cited the example of former Minister of State Cedric Foo who has returned to the private sector on better terms.<br>Mr Goh, who is also Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said he has seen the Board lose its talents to banks, and even the SGX.<br><br>He also noted that this increase does not lessen the sense of public service.<br><br>SM Goh said: "First, can we earn more than this? I'm prepared to say I can earn more than this. Even in today's context,...the Senior Minister's pay is not too bad, it's over S$2 million. But if I were outside, I can earn more than this. I am confident I can earn more than S$3 million. But over the years, sense of public service, because we do get satisfaction in producing growth, wealth for other people."<br><br>Mr Goh also noted that, in this review, Singapore is not comparing itself with other countries. - CNA/ch</div>
