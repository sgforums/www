Will it bring about change? Change which the ruling party is so eager to preach but so resistant to themselves? Do they even sift through the letters and complaints from citizens who voice legitimate concerns in writing. Will anyone address them seriously?<br><br>The feedback channel is more the result of an increasing number of people raising issues, thus the need for more channels of communication between the govt and the people. But whether they will be adequately used by those behind the scenes is another question.<br><br>To that end, people have the right to be skeptical.</div>

The government is like a horse which will only run unless it's given a bloody big whack on its back. So this "bloody big whack" can be protests &amp; demonstrations. It's so common in Hong Kong, regardless of whether they're young or old. Feedback no use 1, it's just a pathetic piece of faeces.

            <div class='col-md body'>I sent this email to Mr Tharman today.<br><br>__________________________________<br><br>Dear Mr Tharman,<br><br>(-gives my name, school and such-)<br><br>Recently the education landscape in Singapore had undergone many much needed changes, and freeing up of the rigid post-secondary government institutions' admissions policies. I had previously feedbacked to MOE on this.<br><br>I am overjoyed that the situation had changed for the better. Literally thousands of students who, like me, failed to meet entry requirements would have another chance instead of blindly rejected by the purely-by-grades policy.<br><br>This year, I got rejected from Singapore Polytechnic's Architecture course all because my 'O' Level Mathematics grade missed entry requirements by 1 single grade. The other of my grades, I would consider quite satisfactory. But, if a candidate fails to meet entry requirements in English, he/she might be allowed in.<br><br>I had appealed 3 times, each level higher than the previous one, but was still rejected. I did not appeal to go in the course at first attempt, but appealing to get just a simple interview to prove myself to SP. After first rejection, I appealed through my MP, Kebun Bahru's Mr Inderjit Singh. Finally, I appealed to the highest authority I think could logically help me. MOE. But still, the rigidness of the admissions system hit me with another blow.<br><br>I called SP to enquire. The operator for Architecture got the person in charge for Admissions on the line. And she told me something that shocked me. She said "we only interview those who meet entry requirements". That's killing all chances of those who do not meet entry requirements. I was not even given a chance!<br><br>I have no other choice but to go (-name of school-) and retake my math, and wasting a year.<br><br>I do not know if the new entry system allows for this, but I would like to suggest to you, and MOE, to allow all students rights for course admissions interviews. Give them a chance to show their talent, hidden behind the facade of grades. Give them a chance to prove themselves, to impress the interviewers that they have the talent, aptitude, interest and skill. It's unfair to reject a student all because of their grades. Like judging a book by it's cover. What's most important is the contents. In this case, the talent or aptitude.<br><br>Many people I know are not able to get into the course they wanted because of their grades. I would like to suggest every course holding open interviews for those who were intially rejected, but have talent, aptitude or strong keen interest in the course. That should be the case, and the real purpose, instead of only interviewing those who meet entry requirements.<br><br>Epitome Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein. When they were young, they were considered 'stupid' and rejected from schools. But later, they become world famous and respected in their respective fields, not shown intially in youth, and not shown in academic grades. Also, there are cases of those intellectually less fortunate, or those with mental disablities showing skills in areas like mathematics or talents in their own fields.<br><br>In the decades of rigid purely grades based admissions, makes me ponder how many potential Edisons or Einsteins had the system smothered. How many dreams had been shattered. How many futures ruined. Does academic grades mean everything?<br><br>I hope the MOE would take this into serious consideration. Give all students the right for course admissions interviews. I hope to hear some positive news soon.<br><br>Thank you for your time.<br><br>____________________<br></div>
