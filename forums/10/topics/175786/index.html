He said Hamas had won about 70 seats, enough for a majority in the 132-seat parliament.<br><br>The outcome, if confirmed, would mean that Hamas will form the next Palestinian government and could jeopardize the Mideast peace process.<br><br>Officials with Fatah also said that Hamas had won about 70 seats, which would give the Islamists a majority in the 132-seat parliament. They spoke on condition of anonymity because counting in some districts was continuing.<br><br>Palestinian officials delayed the release of official results from the Palestinian legislative vote until the end of the day. Results, initially scheduled to be announced at 9 a.m., will now be released at 7 p.m., the Palestinian Central Election Commission said. It gave no reason for the delay.</span><br><br><a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/P/PALESTINIANS_ELECTION?SITE=ASIAONE&amp;SECTION=TOP_STORIES&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT" rel="nofollow">http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/P/PALESTINIANS_ELECTION?SITE=ASIAONE&amp;SECTION=TOP_STORIES&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT</a><br><br>Latest from middle east is likely to send shivers down the spines and possibly more confrontational face-offs with the interim Israeli government.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Whoa...an indignant and typically defiant reply from HAMAS:</strong><br><span style="color: indigo;">Jan 28, 9:22 PM EST<br><br>Hamas Considers Using Militants in Army<br><br>By SARAH EL DEEB and RAVI NESSMAN<br>Associated Press Writers<br><br>RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- The leader of Hamas suggested Saturday that the Islamic group could create a Palestinian army that would include its militant wing - responsible for scores of deadly attacks on Israelis - in the aftermath of its crushing victory in parliamentary elections.<br><br>Israeli officials condemned the plan, demanding that Hamas renounce violence. Palestinian security officers, including loyalists from the defeated Fatah Party, said they would never submit to Hamas control.<br><br>"Hamas has no power to meddle with the security forces," said Jibril Rajoub, a Palestinian strongman.<br><br>The Hamas chief, Khaled Mashaal, reiterated that Hamas would not recognize Israel. He also indicated attacks on Israeli civilians would continue, accusing Israel of targeting Palestinian civilians. "As long as we are under occupation then resistance is our right," he said.<br><br>Angry police stormed the parliament building in Gaza and armed militants marched into Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas' compound in Ramallah to demonstrate their rejection of Hamas' authority. Their defiance raised fears of a spike in violence between Palestinian factions.<br><br>Clashes have already broken out between the two sides. Hamas gunmen wounded two policemen in Gaza early Saturday in what authorities said was a roadside ambush. The attack came hours after another firefight wounded a Hamas activist and two police officers, one of whom was in a coma Saturday.<br><br>Hamas won 74 out of 132 seats in parliamentary elections Wednesday to Fatah's 45. The militant group's victory threw the fate of international aid to the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority in doubt and darkened the chances for a peace deal with Israel.<br><br>Speaking from his base in Damascus, Syria, Mashaal insisted his group would not disarm and said Hamas' military wing, estimated at nearly 5,000 gunmen in Gaza alone, could be merged into a Palestinian army.<br><br>Internal Palestinian tensions are spilling over after the Hamas election win.<br><br>"We are ready to unify the weapons of Palestinian factions, with Palestinian consensus, and form an army like any independent state," he said.<br><br>Israeli officials demanded that Hamas look for peaceful solutions to the conflict.<br><br>"If Hamas wants to be considered a partner in peace, it's very clear what it has to do. It has to renounce terrorism, disarm, accept Israel's right to exist and support political solutions to issues rather than pursuing violent jihad," Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said.<br><br>Mashaal also said Hamas would abide by existing agreements with the country "as long as it is in the interest of our people."<br><br>Israel and the Palestinians have a host of agreements dealing with everything from administration to peace frameworks. Mashaal did not say which agreements he was referring to.<br><br>Israeli officials have said repeatedly that they would not deal with Hamas, and Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz said Israel would not rule out targeted killings against Hamas leaders if they attack Israel. Israeli airstrikes in 2004 killed Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and his successor Abdel Aziz Rantisi.<br><br>"Whoever stands at the head of a terror organization and continues to carry out terror attacks against Israel is not immune," Mofaz told Israel's Channel 2 television.<br><br>Mahmoud Zahar, an incoming Hamas parliamentarian and one of the group's top leaders in Gaza, told "CBS Evening News" that Hamas would be satisfied only if Israel withdrew from the land it has occpied since 1967, including Jerusalem.<br><br>"Why not withdraw from West Bank and Jerusalem and to release our detainees and after that - after that everybody will look at how to continue the process," he said.<br><br>Hamas' victory shocked Fatah, which dominated Palestinian politics for four decades. Abbas ordered an investigation into why his party lost so badly.<br><br>Marwan Barghouti, the jailed Palestinian uprising leader who was Fatah's top candidate and led efforts to reform the party, appealed for Fatah to hold a general conference to elect fresh leadership, according to a statement released by his wife, Fadwa.<br><br>He also congratulated Hamas and said Fatah would peacefully transfer power.<br><br>"We will respect the democratic process and its results and help those who won the confidence of our people," he said.<br><br>But many in the 58,000-member security force were less conciliatory and rejected any Hamas control.<br><br>"The security institution is a red line. We will not allow anyone to tamper with it," Gaza police chief Ala Hosni said. "It will remain a powerful and impartial arm that carries out the decisions of the presidency (Abbas) and that stops any infighting or civil war."<br><br>Dozens of armed police officers briefly stormed the parliament building in Gaza City, demanding the security forces remain in Fatah's hands and calling for Hamas members who killed police in fighting in recent months to be brought to justice.<br><br>In Ramallah, hundreds of Fatah activists, including gunmen and security officers, marched into Abbas' compound and prayed at the grave of Yasser Arafat.<br><br>"We came to you Abu Amar to forgive us for what happened," they chanted, referring to Arafat by his nickname.<br><br>Abbas' security force prevented the activists from approaching his office. Militants outside the walled compound shot in the air.<br><br>"We'll show them hell as an opposition, and we will turn the Palestinian Authority security forces into armed militia led by Al Aqsa," Ramzi Obeidi, a leader of the Fatah-allied Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, told the crowd.<br><br>Other Fatah activists staged angry protests throughout the West Bank, including in Nablus.<br><br>"We are now no longer part of the cease-fire," an Al Aqsa gunman, Nasser Haras, told the crowd, referring to a year-old truce with Israel.<br><br>In Tulkarem, gunman Ibrahim Khreisheh warned against cooperating with Hamas. "Whoever will participate in a government with Hamas, we will shoot him in the head," he said.<br><br>Abbas has said he would ask Hamas to form the next government and Hamas officials said they wanted to meet him Sunday. Hamas, with no experience in government, reached out to Fatah to form a coalition, but Fatah officials said they preferred to be in opposition.<br><br>Outlining his group's plan for the future, Mashaal said it would work to reform the corruption-riddled Palestinian Authority and continue its resistance to Israel.<br><br>In a move likely to anger Israel, Mashaal said Hamas would release Ahmed Saadat, leader of the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. He is being held at a Palestinian jail under Western supervision for ordering the assassination of an Israeli Cabinet minister in 2001.<br><br>President Bush told "CBS Evening News" on Friday that the United States would cut aid to the Palestinian government unless Hamas, which the U.S. lists as a terror group, abolishes its militant wing and stops calling for Israel's destruction.<br><br>Speaking at the World Forum in Davos, Switzerland, former President Clinton suggested Saturday that the West should be more open to eventual talks with Hamas.<br><br>"You've got to find a way to at least open doors ... and I don't see how we can do it without more contact," he said. Hamas might "acquire a greater sense of responsibility, and as they do, we have to be willing to act on that."</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body">The State of Israel was born out of Zionist Political Violence during the 1940s in which Zionist Terrorism was a common feature in its fight against British Colonial Rulers, UN Officials, and the Arabs residents of the land known as the British Palestine Mandate.</div></blockquote>The 2-state solution and the current political stalemate is the result of the British two-timing both the Jews and Palestines in the 1940s.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lwflee:</div><div class="quote_body">Because Hamas builds schools, hospitals and provide welfare to the palestinians. Something the previous government could not/would not do.<br></div></blockquote>Hamas deserves the electoral victory. It is definitely undemocratic of the United States to not recognise that Hamas won the election.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lwflee:</div><div class="quote_body">Wonder how the US will proceed now. Last I heard they wanted Hamas to change is policy drastically - The same policy on the back of which they were elected to power!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Silly yanks.  IT seems the yanks have not yet learnt the lesson the rest of the world were taught in the last US election: that a democracy does not always vote the way you want them to. </div></blockquote>The US and the UK intends to use foreign aid as a bargaining chip to handle the new Hamas government. In fact, the current official stand of the EU is to stop european foreign aid into Palestine. To punish the new government, the ordinary people of Palestine must suffer. So much for the moral "high" ground depicted by the United States since the beginning of the "War Against Terror".<br><br>Given Hamas engagement in the democratic process and its committment to the ceasefire agreement with Israel, the new government should be greeted with good faith by the international community. Would this not be a good opportunity for the organisation Hamas to step back from violent terrorism and engage in regional diplomacy and domestic politics. Perhaps, the Palestinians can finally take a breath of relief from their daily dose of insecurity and work towards a sustainable future..</div>
