            <div class='col-md body'>Tok abt prostitutes what you ppl think abt the recent news abt china luohan meimei coming to the heartland?<br><br>I have a theory, previously they used to hangout at geylang doing their business lor.<br><br>Then apparently the licensed "chicken shops" there started complaining to police that these unlicensed meimei stealing their business illegally.<br><br>Also the media spotlight turned to focus on geylang like that stupid Diana Ser "get real" series. If you notice in singapore if unwanted attention or bad publicity ever reaches the media, the government will immediately lock down.<br><br>So the AV started raiding the streets of geylang with a vengence, after that everytime a meimei tries to solicit a customer on the street, in she goes to the chicken cage. It was  observed that it came to a point whereby geylang was "spotlessly clean" of Meimei.<br><br>As a result meimei became afraid to do business in geylang but they evolved and started migrating en-mass to the heartland neighbourhoods. These days they are become more mobile, started doing home "massage" services on call basis. Harassing after old men at Toa Payoh bus interchange.<br><br>In other words the AV outdone themselves and unknowingly pushed china chicken into the heartlands.</div>
