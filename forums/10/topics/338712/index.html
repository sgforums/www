              <p>Where are the clowns?</p>
              <p>LTN or _ee _ong _ge is a person obsessed with power and control.</p>
              <p>Outwardly, he looks like a kind and generous person while inwardly, he is actually a false, insincere, despicable, mean and narrow- minded person!</p>
              <p>His existence is merely a waste of food (Lang Fei Liang Shi)!</p>
              <p>He is the scum of the earth (Ren Zha, Bai Lei)! He is a scoundrel (Hun Dan)! He is a misbirth (Wu Sheng)! He is the seed of evil (Nie Zhong)!</p>
              <p>His ancestors must have done a lot of wicked deeds while they are alive. That explains why they have a mother f***** as descendant!</p>
              <p>He looks like a walking skeleton with flesh stuck onto it!</p>
              <p>He is the scum of the earth (Ren Zha, Bai Lei)! He is a scoundrel (Hun Dan)!He is a misbirth (Wu Sheng)! He is the seed of evil (Nie Zhong)! His ancestors must have done a lot of wicked deeds, that explains why they have the seed of evil (Nie Zhong)as descendant!</p>
              <p>KL or _athleen _ee is a person who enjoys making noises and creating havoc. (Xin Feng Zuo Lang)!</p>
              <p>Outwardly, she looks like a kind and considerate person while inwardly, she is actually a false, insincere, despicable, mean and narrow- minded person!</p>
              <p>Her existence is merely a waste of food (Lang Fei Liang Shi)!</p>
              <p>Her ancestors must have done a lot of wicked deeds while they are alive. That explains why they have a potential Pro as descendant!</p>
              <p>Even if she were to lose her job one day, she won’t remain unemployed for long! There is a job which is most suitable for her, that is, being a griever (Xiao Nu)! Alternatively, she could also consider going to Geylang to work. After all, both jobs required the person being able to make noises!</p>
              <p>One advice though, she is unsuitable for providing ‘special services’, because she is likely to squash the ‘banana’!</p>
              <p>She looks like an old Pro plying her trade!</p>
              <p>EL or _mily _im is a person who enjoys making noises and creating havoc. (Xin Feng Zuo Lang)!</p>
              <p>Outwardly, she looks like a kind and considerate person while inwardly, she is actually a false, insincere, despicable, mean and narrow- minded person!</p>
              <p>Her existence is merely a waste of food (Lang Fei Liang Shi)!</p>
              <p>Her ancestors must have done a lot of wicked deeds while they are alive. That explains why they have a witch as descendant!</p>
              <p>Even if she were to lose her job one day, she won’t remain unemployed for long! There is a job which is most suitable for her, that is, being a griever (Xiao Nu)! Alternatively, she could also consider, becoming a witch or going to Geylang to work as a pimp (Gui Po) or an old Pro. After all, both jobs required the person being able to make noises!</p>
              <p>One advice though, going for an old Pro like her is simply a waste of time, money and energy. To make things even worse, it will make the guy look like a very desperate man!</p>
              <p>She looks like an old Pro plying her trade!</p>
              <p>PL or _atrick _ee is a person who is a ‘wolf in the sheep’s clothing’</p>
              <p>He is the scum of the earth (Ren Zha, Bai Lei)! He is a scoundrel (Hun Dan)!He is a misbirth (Wu Sheng)! He is the seed of evil (Nie Zhong)! His ancestors must have done a lot of wicked deeds, that explains why they have the seed of evil (Nie Zhong)as descendant!</p>

              <p>Wei Ji Wang Guo, Wei Le Nu Ren Da Zhong Guo!</p>
              <p>While a person could spend a lifetime with the person of his/her desire, he/she can’t spend a lifetime with a wild beast! Even if you are both registered with ROM and applied for a HDB flat, you should do the right thing and forfeit the deposit for the flat rather than choosing to spend a lifetime with a wild beast!</p>
              <p>As for the wild beast, he will no doubt suffer a double loss!</p>
              <p>What do you call that?</p>
              <p>Pei Le Fu Ren You Zhe Pin!</p>
              <p>Lose the Lady and the soldiers!</p>
              <p>I wonder why is it so difficult to find a girlfriend that fulfils my criteria?</p>
              <p>My criteria is very simple- not based on looks or figures but on inner beauty!</p>
              <p>So far, 5 have failed!</p>
              <p>While it is true that looks and figures are considered ‘bonuses’, they are not the decisive factors! Inner beauty is considered the basic fundamental!</p>
              <p>In fact, out of the 5 who failed, one of them (who go by the initials KK or KCS and the name _elly _ong or _ong _hiew _uen) was not bad-looking and has a figure that is not too bad either, but unfortunately, she has an ugly heart! Her ancestors must have done a lot of wicked deeds, that explains why they have a shameless pro as descendant! She is cheap and shameless! Jian Huo!</p>
              <p>It doesn’t matter whether you are driving a sports car or a saloon car, because when you are stuck in a traffic jam, it became a stationary car!</p>
              <p>It doesn’t matter whether the girl has good looks and nice figure, because when she has an ugly heart, it is an outright failure!</p>
              <p>Beside her, another two people were involved in this matter. They are the two ATs.</p>
              <p>The first one (who goes by the initials AT and the name _deline _an) plays the role of supporter. Even if she were to lose her job one day, she won’t remain unemployed for long! There is a job which is most suitable for her, that is, being a griever (Xiao Nu)! Alternatively, she could also consider going to Geylang to work. After all, both jobs required the person being able to make noises! Her ancestors must have done a lot of wicked deeds, that explains why they have a 'griever' as descendant!</p>
              <p>A guy (who goes by the initials LTW and the name _ee _ing _ei) plays the role of supporter and instigator. He actively stir up the sentiments of the abovementioned person (who go by the initials AT and the name _deline _an), agitating the person to take drastic actions, effectively using the person as a tool to achieve his own selfish aims.He is the scum of the earth (Ren Zha, Bai Lei)! He is a scoundrel (Hun Dan)!He is a misbirth (Wu Sheng)! He is the seed of evil (Nie Zhong)!His ancestors must have done a lot of wicked deeds, that explains why they have the scum of the earth (Ren Zha, Bai Lei) as descendant!</p>
              <p>Wei Ji Wang Guo, Wei Le Nu Ren Da Zhong Guo!</p>
              <p>The second one (who goes by the initials AT or TKH and the name _ndy _an or _an _im _uat) plays the role of supporter and instigator. He actively stir up the sentiments of the abovementioned person (who go by the initials KK and the name _elly _ong), agitating the person to take drastic actions, effectively using the person as a tool to achieve his own selfish aims. His nickname includes: Hao Dai, Si Hao Dai, Gon Da Tai, Da Tou Dai, Hao Lam, Si Hao Lam! He is the scum of the earth (Ren Zha, Bai Lei)! He is a scoundrel (Hun Dan)!He is a misbirth (Wu Sheng)! He is the seed of evil (Nie Zhong)! His ancestors must have done a lot of wicked deeds, that explains why they have the seed of evil (Nie Zhong)as descendant!</p>
              <p>While a person could spend a lifetime with the person of his/her desire, he/she can’t spend a lifetime with a wild beast! Even if you are both registered with ROM and applied for a HDB flat, you should do the right thing and forfeit the deposit for the flat rather than choosing to spend a lifetime with a wild beast!</p>
              <p>As for the wild beast, he will no doubt suffer a double loss!</p>
              <p>What do you call that?</p>
              <p>Pei Le Fu Ren You Zhe Pin!</p>
              <p>Lose the Lady and the soldiers!</p>
              <p>This coming Chinese New Year, I wonder what these clowns are planning to do! Busying visiting graveyards and check out prospective sites for themselves?</p>
              <p>I have waited for ONE month! ONE ROCK SOLID MONTH!</p>
              <p>So far, they only managed to make one failed attempt to ‘entertain’ me!</p>
              <p>Why are these clowns so useless?</p>
              <p>Are these clowns LTN or _ee _ong _ge, KL or _athleen _ee, EL or _mily _im and PL or _atrick _ee still alive?</p>
              <p>Or have they gone to sell salted duck eggs?</p>
              <p>Perhaps the clowns were slapped until they are blurred, that explains why they fail to ‘entertain’ me successfully within a month!</p>
              <p>1 month</p>
              <p>(Oops, I did it again! I did it again! I did it again!)</p>
              <p>OLE! OLE! OLE! OLE! OLE! OLE! OLE! OLE! OLE! OLE! OLE! OLE! OLE! OLE! OLE! OLE!</p>
              <p>+300</p>
              <p>Shui Chang Chuan Gao!</p>
              <p>As the water rises, the boat rises as well!</p>
              <p>These clowns are really ‘No one good f***’!</p>
              <p>I hate to say this but unfortunately it is the brutal truth!</p>
              <p>These clowns have to justify their existence by wrecking havoc (Liu Xia Lai Zuo Zhong)! They will have to show that it is the law of the jungle- not the rule of law- that prevails! They will have to prove that their existences are not a waste of food (Lang Fei Liang Shi)!</p>
              <p>Usually, when a state is doomed, the evil things will start to appear!</p>
              <p>I wonder how this statement is!</p>
              <p>I really enjoyed being ‘entertained’ by the clowns as it is ‘intellectually stimulating’! During ordinary times, extraordinary talent is of not much use! It is during extraordinary times that extraordinary talent could be put to good use!</p>
              <p>My time’s not up yet! Thus I hope that the clowns will put their best foots forward as this will be a long drawn out process!</p>
              <p>BRING IT ON!</p>
              <p>(Wherever you go, whatever you do, I will be right here waiting for you!)</p>
              <p>"I am what I am. I undertook this task without anybody asking me. It was an impulse. It was driven by my own convictions; what I went through. And having undertaken the job, I had to make it work." (ST 07 Aug 2007, "Don't expect one sweet progression up to the heights")</p>
              <p>ACS EXE</p>
              <p>As long as I could get my hands on vital resources, the war will go on!<br>It is victory at all costs!</p>
