              <p>28. Following an initial asset injection of some <span style="color: #ff0000;">S$350</span> million when
              Temasek was set up, the Minister for Finance Incorporated – as
              shareholder – has from time-to-time made additional injections into
              Temasek. Since inception, we have received a total injection of a
              little less than<span style="color: #ff0000;"> S$30</span> billion in assets and cash.</p>
              <p>29.
              Growing with our blue chip companies and our direct investment
              activities, Temasek now owns a <span style="color: #ff0000;">net </span>portfolio of about <span style="color: #ff0000;">S$185 billion</span> at
              market value as at 31 March 2008. Singapore and Asia account for nearly
              75% of Temasek's investments. Developed markets such as the U.S. and
              emerging economies across the world account for the rest and are a
              growing part of our portfolio. Our total shareholder return measuring
              changes in shareholder funds, including dividends paid and excluding
              new capital, is a<span style="color: #ff0000;"> healthy 17% co</span>mpounded annually since inception. <strong></strong>This
              reflects the healthy performances of our portfolio companies and the
              realized gains from our direct investment activities over the years.</p>

              <p>I disagree.</p>
              <p>You will always make a profit if you run a monopoly or quasi monopoly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you make losses, all you have to do is to raise prices.</p>
              <p>Alot like our transportation system, they made losses, therefore they raise prices to make profits again. How else in the world can a business continually make supernormal profits. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Normal businesses makes losses and profits from year to year.</p>

              <p>maybe we shouldn't be so negative about our government yet... they must have certain reasons or plans to even support the foreigners. if USA fall into severe depression, the whole world will be affected. even if Asia does not suffer greatly due to the emerging power of China and India, we as a financial hub will still suffer as we have close connection with the financial status of the US. <br><br>our government is well known to be shrewd businessmen. they have already made plans to profit out of it... no one in their sane and shrewd mind will go into a money losing proposal or action. next, Temasek Holdings may be government backed but they are afterall a private company. you can have all the details as long as you are one of the shareholders... you know, annual report... i think they have a public annual report but being you, you'll probably scrutanized every details...</p>
              <p>next, even if they profit from singaporeans... what can we do? SMRT always publish their annual profit and loss and the last time i read, it was more than $100 million profit. did Dr. Chee make any noise on that issue? not that i remember... somethings are very obvious yet no opposition made any noise. i also remember reading that only singapore's public transport actually made profit... all the rest of the world's public transport actually loses money to provide for the citizens... why no opposition made that comment during the last election? that's why end of the day, i realised that our opposition is just "for show"... Dr. Chee is only "for show"... nothing concrete... nothing that is really helping Singaporeans... so asking me to support the opposition who is only "for show"? i rather support the Pay and Pay regime who can make Temasek Holding into one of the biggest and richest corporation in the world.</p>

              already made plans to profit out of it... no one in their sane and
              shrewd mind will go into a money losing proposal or action. next,
              Temasek Holdings may be government backed but they are afterall a
              private company. you can have all the details as long as you are
              one of the shareholders... you know, annual report... i think they
              have a public annual report but being you, you'll probably
              scrutanized every details...</p>
              <p>next, even if they profit from singaporeans... what can we do?
              SMRT always publish their annual profit and loss and the last time
              i read, it was more than $100 million profit. did Dr. Chee make any
              noise on that issue? not that i remember... somethings are very
              obvious yet no opposition made any noise. i also remember reading
              that only singapore's public transport actually made profit... all
              the rest of the world's public transport actually loses money to
              provide for the citizens... why no opposition made that comment
              during the last election? that's why end of the day, i realised
              that our opposition is just "for show"... Dr. Chee is only "for
              show"... nothing concrete... nothing that is really helping
              Singaporeans... so asking me to support the opposition who is only
              "for show"? i rather support the Pay and Pay regime who can make
              Temasek Holding into one of the biggest and richest corporation in
              the world.</p>

              <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The bull
              market tide goes out, leaving the lion city’s sovereign wealth
              firm gasping on the shore</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p>Nearly
              five months after its March 31 year-end, Singaporeans should be
              eagerly looking forward to the publication of the report of the
              guardian of so much of the national wealth, Temasek Holdings. The
              sovereign wealth fund run by Ho Ching, wife of Prime Minister Lee
              Hsien Loong, is not the biggest repository of money collected by the
              state on behalf of the people, but it is at least semi-transparent
              compared with its big brother the Government Investment Corp.</p>
              <p id="bhu617">The
              lengthy wait for results could possibly be connected to issues of how
              to treat a series of rather spectacular disasters that Temasek faced
              last year, and that are continuing into the current year.</p>
              <p id="bhu621" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Even in
              2006-07, when world markets were booming in unison, Temasek had to
              report a 29 percent profit fall. Neither chairman S. Dhanabalan nor
              Ho Ching were on hand at the press conference when these dismal
              results were delivered. So who will deliver any bad news for the
              latest year?</p>
              <p id="bhu623" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p id="bhu625">Of course,
              the bottom line for the year to March 2008 may be saved by the sale
              just before year-end of power station Tuas Power to China’s
              Huaneng Group for S$4.2 billion which should enable it to book a
              hefty capital profit. But selling local assets and buying foreign
              ones may not be such a smart idea, particularly if you are the kind
              of Singapore bureaucrat who has implicit faith in the masters of the
              universe on Wall Street.</p>
              <p id="bhu629" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Under Ho
              Ching’s leadership Temasek had supposedly been taken from being
              a safety-first bureaucracy to a smart, profit-oriented outfit,
              selling some assets and investing heavily overseas, particularly in
              the fast-growing emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. Almost
              fool can make money in a global bull market so for awhile Temasek
              seemed to prosper under Ho Ching’s dynamic leadership. But
              Temasek also swallowed plenty of bait on offer from Wall Street
              types.</p>
              <p id="bhu631" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p id="bhu633" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In
              particular the government-owned investment vehicle vastly expanded
              its finance sector portfolio, buying banks and even setting up a
              Special Purpose Vehicle, Astrea, which borrowed US$810 million to
              invest in a slew of private equity and buyout funds.</p>
              <p id="bhu635">It is hard
              to imagine that Astrea has avoided the hammering suffered by almost
              all buyout and private equity funds, some of which have had to close
              with large losses.</p>
              <p id="bhu639" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">But
              Temasek seems to have compounded bull market errors by continuing to
              have faith in Wall Street deceptions when memory of the Asian crisis
              and the Japanese experience should have made it particularly aware
              that financial-sector problems almost always go deeper and last
              longer than those in other sectors. Temasek was keen to show how
              important it was so was among the first to jump in with equity
              bail-outs for distressed western banks, firstly with US$5 billion for
              Merrill Lynch at $48 a share.</p>
              <p id="bhu641" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p id="bhu643">The Merill
              shares are now worth about half that, and although under the terms of
              the deal Temasek has been partially compensated with additional
              shares it has had to also to put in new money – and must wonder
              just how long and deep the US financial crisis will be. Although it
              had recently increased its stake in the UK’s Standard
              Chartered, it also put  â‚¤1 billion into Britain’s
              Barclays, a financial institution whose equity base remains
              perilously small compared with the weight of assorted instruments it
              carries and whose share price has fallen much further since the
              Temasek injection.</p>
              <p id="bhu647">But it is
              not just the finance sector and in the west that gung-Ho Temasek has
              hit rough waters. The Shin Corp mess in Thailand may now be a thing
              of the past. But troubles elsewhere are many. In Indonesia it is
              being required to sell off its stake in Bank International Indonesia
              (BII) because it already owns Bank Danamon. But Malaysia’s Bank
              Negara (central bank) has vetoed an attempt by Maybank to buy the BII
              stake. Bank Negara evidently agreed with opinion in the market that
              Maybank was offering a silly price.</p>
              <p id="bhu651">The best
              piece of luck Temasek has had was actually evidence of its own
              willingness to pay top dollar. Only the myopic greed of shareholders
              in China Eastern Airlines and hopes of a counter offer from China
              National Aviation Corp thwarted a generous joint offer by Temasek and
              Singapore Airlines for a 24 percent stake in the Hong Kong-listed
              company at HK$3.8 a share. They now trade at HK$1.80.</p>
              <p id="bhu655">Real
              estate is not looking too hot either. Last month CapitalLand (part of
              the Temasek group)  had to promise to inject A$300 million into its
              ailing listed Australian 54 percent owned subsidiary  Australand
              Property. Without a huge capital injection, deeply indebted
              Australand might have gone under.</p>
              <p id="bhu659">Temasek
              has also leaped heavily into one of China’s highest profile,
              and perhaps more vulnerable, property developers, Country Garden.
              When it went public in Hong Kong in April 2007, Country Garden was
              the second largest IPO in Hong Kong history, with Temasek joining
              local tycoons Lee Shau Kee and Robert Kuok as key investors.
              According to the mainland financial magazine Caijing, a subsequent
              S$800 million convertible bond issue in Singapore in February this
              year was made on terms which suggest the company is very stretched
              and badly needs to keep its share price from falling. It  is now
              little more than half its initial price and down 75 percent from its
              peak.</p>
              <p id="bhu663">Australia,
              once seen as a safe if unexciting location for Singapore cash, has
              also attracted top of the market deals from Singapore Power. Already
              well-established in Australia, it paid heavily in cash for the
              eastern Australia assets of pipeline company Alinta but with values
              in decline they have been unable now to flip them into their 51
              percent owned local subsidiary SP Ausnet leaving SP meanwhile saddled
              with huge borrowings.</p>
              <p id="bhu667">Even on
              home ground, things are looking sick for important parts of the
              Temasek empire. Chartered Semiconductor Industries has seen its
              shares fall more than 40 percent and its debt ratings have been cut
              so that its bond are no longer investment grade – otherwise
              known as junk status. Chartered has long been a state effort to make
              Singapore a semiconductor manufacturing leader but has never managed
              to keep up with the likes of Taiwan and Korea in technology and now
              also faces Chinese competition.</p>
              <p id="bhu671">These
              various problems have not entirely dulled Temasek’s appetite
              for acquisitions. Its associate Neptune Orient Lines (NOL) is bidding
              to buy Germany’s Hapag-Lloyd   just at a time when some
              commentators forecast huge problems looming for container lines. This
              time Temasek may be saved by German nationalism – Hamburg
              business is ganging up to keep it in local hands.</p>
              <p id="bhu675" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">It remains
              to be seen who, if anyone, takes responsibility for Temasek’s
              blunders. Last year it was chief investment officer Jimmy Phoon who
              found he had better things to do, as did Jackson Tai at DBS,
              Temasek’s main banking investment, and the finance director of
              SembCorp who had landed the group with US$300 million in foreign
              exchange losses.</p>
              <p id="bhu675" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p id="bhu679">Meanwhile
              US former food and consumer products executive Simon Israel,
              appointed two years ago,  remains CEO in conjunction with Ho Ching.
              And, despite everything, faith in Wall Street types is as strong as
              ever – Michael Dee from Morgan Stanley was last week been
              appointed managing director for international investments.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Share of investments in Singapore is less than half but the profiteering is so great it can pay for the massive billion dollars losses supporting foreigners and by selling Singapore profit making assets (Tuas Power) to China’s Huaneng Group for S$4.2 billion a foreign firm.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Despots, forever FAKING it to make themselves look good while Singaporeans pay and pay for it while they take and take massive amounts of public money and put into their own pockets.</span></p>
              <p>SINGAPOREANS WAKE UP (SILLIPOREANS GO AND DIE) GCT's wife was right. Compare to what they take, TT Durai was taking peanuts.</p>
              <p><strong>Tak Bolah Tahan! Dr Chee protests against the cost of living, price increases to make Temasek look good, and the despots send him to jail!</strong></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The readers of this thread should read the article by Dhanabalan in today's newspaper. Find out how Temasek is set up and operated, as well as its performance since inception. Fools like Andrew who spread baseless rumours and fears are the reason why the government has been reluctant to allow more political debate. A small handful of brainless idiots with an axe to grind against the government can create a riot with a small group of brainless idiots but the adverse impact will be felt by the majority of Singaporeans. </p></div>
