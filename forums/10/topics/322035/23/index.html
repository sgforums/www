              <div class="quote_body">
              <p> I have been careful not to call everyone who had left
              'quitters'. Personally I have many friends and relatives who
              had migrated and never have I ever called them quitters. We can
              have hours of talking kock during coffee or golf either in
              Singapore or their new place, never doubt each others loyalty
              to where we belong, and the respect for where we came
              from. No cursing and swearing ..... </p>
              <p>Immigration policies change every now and then for countries
              such as Canada and Australia. When rich immigrants came in from HK
              and other part of Asia a dacade ago, the local Canadians were
              happy cause whatever properties they held simply appreciated and
              they just cashed in and went on retirement.</p>
              <p>Today, just look at Vancouver, richmond, the wealthy suburb has
              become a mini HK, shopping malls there were duplicate of that in
              HK, even with name such as aberdeen. Surrey, another suburb is now
              punjabi... Singaporeans all stay in coquitlam...switch on channel M
              you will hear news in Mandarin, Cantonese and Punjabi...If you live
              in these areas, you don't have to speak or read English, or
              Canadian for a thousand years. If you need to deal with the
              government on official matters, they are obliged to find an
              interpretor for you. now the presence of PRC is
              everywhere, moving further East to Calgary...You can imagine how
              the young native Canadians think, but then, who are the natives,
              the Red Indians or the Whites? If you live in Canada, you can
              verify if what I wrote above is true.  </p>
              <p>Will Singapore be spared from having immigrants? No, and who are
              the native true Singaporeans, the people from the the Sumatran
              Srivijaya empire in the 2nd century, the Malay from Johore,
              the Chinese from China, or the Indian from Madras? What really
              important in Singapore is the recognition of Singapore as our
              home. We have established our way of life and even our
              Singlish. It is important that all immigrants come in and
              adapt to our way of life rather than the other way round. Singapore
              has our own identity. If we can't avoid immigrants, we got to know
              what we want and what is important.</p>
              <p>Those who cannot differentiate between politics and
              nationhood, between Singapore and PAP do not help in
              anyway the protection of the identity of Singapore, but they are of
              great help to the PAP for running down the oppositions, especially
              those who are cursing and swearing... a failure in the education in
              Singapore.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>This I agree... and it works both ways.</p>
              <p>Supporters of PAP are more vicious in their attacks.</p>
              <p>Although.. two wrongs no make one right.</p>
              <p>"especially
              those who are cursing and swearing... a failure in the education in
