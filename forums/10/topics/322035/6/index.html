It depends on whose point of view as well.  Its not possible to ask these people at the top to know what is happening down below when all the information they get through their kah-kia who beautify the details and mask out some of these things from them. EG: when the "transport minister" takes the train, the whole train is booked for him and its totally empty. How will he ever know how its like during peak hour? It was not until LHL saw the state of the trains when he was travelling to an event that he saw for himself the over packed trains that he told the transport service to do something about it.</p>
