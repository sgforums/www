              <p>Ordinarily if this happened to others I would not have sniggered or gloated over his immediate family's demise. But there is precedence to this sniggering, he has sniggered over his political enemies predicament before, so I guess it's alright to snigger at him. Even when I snigger, I am only sniggering at him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I wonder if CSJ is sniggering at him now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Political ideologies aside. I am no supporter of CSJ, but I think it's just despicable that LKY sniggered at CSJ when CSJ told him that he is a bankrupt and with 3 children to look after.</p>
