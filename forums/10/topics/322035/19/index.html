              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Thank god that despite their Elitist views, the Ruling Elites still have 99% inspired imagination that differs from a wanna-be Elite in a 'dearHunter' with a 1% inspiration.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Does the 1,000 loss per annum amount to 2.4% - or should you not read the following extract before making another hasty assumption based on your bag of gas.</span></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/An_Interview_With_Lee_Kuan_Yew_2008_999.html">“An Interview with Lee Kuan Yew – February 2008” nbsp;</a></p>
              <blockquote>”I fear the future for my grandchildren may not be as good as ours was. In Singapore, we now have in our physically limited space 4.5 million people, 3.2 million of them our citizens, the rest foreigners who came to work here. Our planners are projecting 6.5 million. Our planners and demographers can already see 6.5 million. I said to them, "Look, go slow. It can't be done in our small city state."
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>At the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">top end</span>, about 1,000 a year</strong>. <strong>That's a loss of 4 percent or 5 percent</strong>. But compensating that, we have Chinese and Indians coming here looking for better prospects. So on balance, we're still gainers. But the day will come when China, in 30 or 40 years, will offer better prospects than any country in the world.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Only the stupidity of a uninspire thinker as a 'dearHunter' can willingly accept the loss of presumptious 2.4% - when the actual loss is 4 or 5 percent from the top crust of Singapore society - and to willingly embrace foreigners of questionable talents and loyalty into our midst. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even the Great Mentor Shepherd is aware that towards the future - as the economies of China and India advances, they will attract the present migrants from Singapore to return to their home countries.</span></p>
              <blockquote>These 1000 who leaves should be glad that they have this freedom to do so, freedom of which some here constantly harp on being denied. </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Only a deluded 'dearHunter' will hear voices that no one can hear - did any of your audience hear of Singaporeans not having the freedom to migrate ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This is a clear example of the creativity of a dearHunter's 1% inspired mind can cook up new fantasies of Singaporean complaints about life in Singapore - which literally amount to the exercising of his brilliantly thought out "Freedom to Slander" that is so artfully practised by his Great Mentor Shepherd with absolute impunity and immunity.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Furthermore, they had used some of our tax contributions thru subsidization during their formative years, and yet we ask nothing back from them.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">"<em>They had used some of our tax contributions thru' subsidization..</em>" - did you use 99% perspiration to produce this brilliance nonsense which do not recognise that they have not paid their dues - in the form of taxes or other forms - whether paid by them or their parents ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">From their contributions that result in the present infrastructures that are built and left behind by their migration - are you not the one with the remaining Singaporeans to benefit from their foregone contributions ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With your condescendingly cheap and thoughtless statements made - are you not seeking some gratitude from the Singaporean migrants for your tax contributions used during their formative years ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Personally, i wish them well, and may they have a better grasp of the world and politics. In time, they will return, as some of them did. We may not be the best, but we are a loser society, where the strong will never abandon the weak, but protect them. Let them have a taste of a winner society, where only the strongest survive and the weak left to die homeless on the streets.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With your narrow views of the World seen through the opening of your $27 garbage bin, it will do yourself some good if you keep some of your wishes for your own beneift to have a better grasp of the world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It will also benefit your audience if you should decide to keep out of politics until you learn to depend on more then 1% inspiration.before wasting your 99% perspiration to endlessly re-arrange your political garbage in your tight Made-in-North Korea garbage bins.</span></p>

              <p>sgdiehard,</p>
              <p>it actually does matter. The reason is simple. Singapore is the singapore today because of our ancestors that worked this land. Those who came to singapore from other countries after singapore have become developed just come here for an easy ride. Borned, breed and decended from long generations of singaporeans do deserve better rights because what our ancestors contributed to the land. Its our birth right.</p>
              <p>If you are not born in singapore, but a singapore citizen. Please remember, your ancestors didnt work in this land to make it as it is today. So just live with it. No need to try and convince others that you are of our ranks.</p>

              <p>Some of those citizens might not come back. It is their loss as well as us, from a citizen's point of view. But they do have their freedom of choice, which we as a society will not force them.</p>
              <p>We can only try our best to make our country better, within our abilities to overcome our limitations of size and economy, not by strife and civil unrests, lies and half truths some spout of the like here, but through genuine care, concern and participation by citizens so that none will be left behind.</p>
              <p>Easier said than done i know, but if we can build spore to what it is today, so too can we build our tomorrows. But we need co-operation, not divisions, within our country and well led by our political representatives, no matter what group so long as capable. </p>

              <p>it actually does matter. The reason is simple. Singapore is the singapore today because of our ancestors that worked this land. Those who came to singapore from other countries after singapore have become developed just come here for an easy ride. Borned, breed and decended from long generations of singaporeans do deserve better rights because what our ancestors contributed to the land. Its our birth right.</p>
              <p>If you are not born in singapore, but a singapore citizen. Please remember, your ancestors didnt work in this land to make it as it is today. So just live with it. No need to try and convince others that you are of our ranks.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the article. However, the truth of that matter is that the real reason most leave are for economic reasons. I had a friend working in an MNC in China. She received a call from a Sg headhunter for a recruitment discussion. She longed to return to Singapore and when the headhunter offered her salary of $8,000 a month, and asked how much she is getting in China. Her reply was "US2,000", but before she could finish, she heard sniggering from the headhunter, but she smiled and continued her sentence, "per day, for a 2 years contract. The headhunter was never heard again.</p>
              <p>As hard as we try to match international salaries, our size and economy are limitations for foreign investments. Our society knows and will not hold them back.</p>
              <p>However, the opposition and anarchists within our society would always despicably blame it on alleged oppressions. repression, and whatever they can dream up to destablise our society. And some of those that left, more so those chickens who wish to escape military service, will more than happy to use such illogical reasons to make themselves look like heroes.</p>
              <p>Thus, at the end of the day, each and everyone of us best open our eyes and ears to look around, are we to destroy our country to serve someone's else political ambition or hate, or should we protect and preserve what we have and make it better constructively.</p>

              <p>If you are representative of the quality of opposition we have in spore, that uses insults, slanders, lies, and half truths than use relevant facts, then i guess i will not be seeing more opposition MPs in our parliament, or even the next few generations.</p>
