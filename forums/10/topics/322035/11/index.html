                      Door, Dr. Maurice Rawlings' first book (1978), focused on his observations of people 
                      in the process of being resuscitated after clinical death. In it, he recounted 
                      story after story of near-death experiencers describing unpleasant or 
                      threatening scenarios: being surrounded by grotesque human and animal 
                      forms, hearing other people moaning and in pain, violence and demonic 
                      types of torture. He thought that because he was present when the phenomenon 
                      actually occurred, he was able to obtain pure and unrepressed reports. 
                      This led him to formulate his theory that at least half of the near-death 
                      cases begin as hell-like, then become heaven-like as the episode proceeds, 
                      with the average individual able to remember only the heavenly part once 
                      revived.</span></p>
              <p>Having suffered another massive <span>haemorrhage suggests that she did not experience the heavenly part. </span></p>
              <p><span>Her fear and anxiety after having a hellish NDE must have caused her massive </span>haemorrhaging.</p>

              <p>I respect your stand and hope that you will be able to discern between rationality and the rubbish spouted by the rabid louts here. You can safely ignore them, for despite their numerous hate filled posts, it would take a miracle for sane people to believe their words.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To Fireice:</p>
              <p>If indeed you are going to visit the great lady and wish to pass on messages, I hope you will pass my message to her.</p>
              <p>" I wish her speedy recovery in her health. On behalf of my previous generation and myself, i would also like to take the opportunity to thank her for her unfailing support to be by MM LKY's side. If without her support of a loving home environment, MM LKY would be stressed out to govern our country, more so by those self centred selfish louts eager to tear him down using dirty tactics such as slander and lies.</p>
              <p>I also wish to apologise for taking so much of her husband's time to take care of our needs, denying her his companionship to the family. But she bore it all uncomplaining, knowing where the priorities lie - to the nation first.</p>
              <p>I also wish to thank her being a role model to our women, being an intelligent, capable lady, a homemaker as well as bearing several new citizens to our country, fine young men and ladies who had help society in many ways, espacially PM Lee HL, who had proven himself a good man, rising thru the ranks in the army based on merit, doing his service to his nation unlike some other more priviledge families who hide their sons from performing service to the nation.</p>
              <p>I am thankful for your family guidance to our PM when he was child, and had grown up solid and never forgetting the roots of the common citizens, incalculated during following his father's walkabouts in our early independence days. And now having been groomed to the job and had measured up beyond expectations for his hands in various portfolios in the service to our nation, he has our unwavering support to take the nation to greater heights.</p>
              <p>He has the power to crush, but he had shown he will always use the softer option, to consult and discuss before taking action, the mark of a true People's leader.</p>
              <p>So rest and get well, great lady. May you see more sunrises to enjoy more days with your grandchildren. Do not worry about the gibbering stupid louts. Sane and rational men's hearts and minds will always be won over by rationality and logic. As for these irrational louts, we only need to grab them by their balls, and their hearts and minds will follow. </p>

              <p>Corrections here - he actually went through OCT course {that was the name for OCS in his time}, and actually graduated as a 2LT as his other mates in the course.</p>
              <p>How could he not graduate - when the CO of SAFTI had to supervise every Live Fire exercise that involved LHL, with the Coy OC and 2I/C assisting his Platoon and Section Commanders ?</p>
              <p>One wonder if these officers even stood by him and helped carry his water bottle and picked up a misplaced M-16 ammo magazine, or dropped bayonet during the course of the run up 'Motar Hill'.</p>
              <p>His SAF training seems to be that not of a junior officer, but given the rudiments of officer command from a helicopter perspective of the exercises.</p>
              <p>Would any officer risk his life charging up a hill with 10 or more other M-16 firing live bullets up the slope of a hill; or even allow him to throw a live hand grenade ?</p>
              <p>Probably it is safer to have him fire a GPMG from a tripod at a fixed position, and observing the entire exercise from some hill, and appreciate the nuances of fire and movement - instead of being a Dog Soldier actually charging up the hill.</p>
              <p>Was he trained to be an Officer, or already trained to be a General with a helicopter command view of the execution of a planned military exercise.</p>
              <p>He was fast tracked through the ranks by his appointments held in the Artillery Battalion - as he would not have been asked to carry the base plate of the 120mm motar on route marches.</p>
              <p>The attainment of his rank as BG was fast tracked through a period of about three years after his promotion from Major to Lt Colonel; <strong>Lt Col to Colonel and BG all occurring in less then ONE Year</strong> - and with him "resigning" from an SAF career within six months after attaining his BG rank, and ceremoniously given a "good riddance" parade out of the camp gate by his Arty Unit.</p>

In 1980, he was made the CO of the Artillery Gun Battalion, and subsequently, promoted to assistand chief of General Staff ( operations) in 1981, then Chief of Staff in 1982, to director, JOPD with the rank of BG in 1983. He was PUBLICLY COMMENDED for his role in coordinating the Sentosa cable car rescue ops in 1982. He was also credited for 2 achievements within SAF - unification of SAF's 3 services and modernization of its weaponry. He resigned from SAF by 1984, so that he could serve the nation better in better administration, with the skills and opportunities learnt in organisation and modernisation of our arm forces, respected by many in the world.</p>

              <p>I am thankful for your family guidance to our PM when he was child, and had grown up solid and never forgetting the roots of the common citizens, incalculated during following his father's walkabouts in our early independence days. And now having been groomed to the job and had measured up beyond expectations for his hands in various portfolios in the service to our nation, he has our unwavering support to take the nation to greater heights.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How much is PM LHL rooted to his community, when he has grown up in a world isolated by bodyguards and servants, and not even allowed to watch TV by his parents ? Did any of his face appeared with the father's walk-about after his father was pushed into a monsoon drain in the early 1960s ? Or was it not a fact that he only accompanied his father to attend the safer opening ceremonies of factories - away from the uncontrolled hordes whom his father referred to as "minions" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can a son not be influenced by such political thinking of a man, who believe that it is better to be feared than be liked ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Only a deluded and ambitious liar will continue to propagate a lie, hoping to get some crumbs that fall from the fringe of the main table - whether by accident or by design, does it matter to a willful carpet beggar ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Papa is still teaching him the use of the Judiciary to accomplish the political self-interest, and he is still learning the ropes of twisting and perpetuating a slanderous lie from the father - which you seem to have a greater propensity to be than LHL.</span></p>

Sane and rational men's hearts and minds will always be won over by rationality and logic. As for these irrational louts, we only need to grab them by their balls, and their hearts and minds will follow. </p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Would you not remind LHL about his statement in not wasting resources to prolong the agony of the Life that has reached its determined end ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why will you not remind LHL to pull the plug and let the love one go in peace instead of vainly prolonging the suffering - as he had shown so much leadership in saying this to his minions ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was LHL being sane and rational in making this recommendation not so long ago - in his chastising piece to the Singaporean minions for wasting precious hospital resources to illogically prolonging Life that has already reached its logical end ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As usual, it takes a 'deerHunter' to imagine himself to be 'Rambo' - when the best he can be is to rumble past all the rubbish from his beloved mansion in his $27 garbage bin.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Like the fated Gazelle - only a 'deerHunter' will be attracted to the familiar underside of any person. With the Gazelle attracted to sniffing the finer fabrics of a friend's sister, and the 'deerHunter' not quite circumspect to either gender - as long as he can grab whatever his hands can reach for his nose - as his vision is through a scope that is focus so far ahead that he cannot see whatever is in front of him.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What was the meritous service that LHL achieved in justifying his rapid rise through the ranks in eight years - according to your dates from 1974 to 1982 - when more experienced armies have seen an officer becoming a Battalion CO only after a minimum service of 15 years at least ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it not a fact that given the bureaucratic nature of a politicised military structure, any solid ideas from anyone else will be vetted to death before gaining any semblance of acceptance for further development ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The advancement of the artillery unit - and current dependence - on digital instrumentation was brought up even before LHL's appointment as a unit CO, as the Chief Arty Officer had already proposed this even before LHL came into the scene.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> Its introduction was delayed due to more pressing budget constraints.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This is similar to the IR Projects that were first brought up during PM GCT's term in office, but was rejected and decision postponed till PM LHL came into office.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it LHL's own initiative, when those from others before him were already gone and forgotten ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">His promotion from Lt. Colonel to Brigadier General in a period of less then 12 months, and quitting the SAF to enter politics must be the butt of military jokes discreetly circulating in the SAF and the neighboring countries.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even JBJ brought up this issue in Parliament, questioning the SAF role in politics by helping LHL to gain some credentials before his time, and damaging the reputation of the SAF's Officer Corp.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely there is enough garbage spewed out by you from your $27 garbage bin to slander the many others who are more qualified, and more circumspect to be involved in the kind of dirty politics that only a petulant juvenile will shamelessly perpetuate in blind and unquestioning faith.</span></p>
