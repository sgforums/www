              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Can you understand the phrase - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.answers.com/figure%20of%20speech">”figure of speech”  </a>?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How did you qualify to be a "sgdiehard" - if not protecting the SG image that is moulded according to the dictates of the Lee's ?</span>  </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you being a little naive to be expecting the qualities of "warmth or kindness, or any humanity" to exist in someone who is seething to the teeth in making a curse ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is Tan Tock Seng such a bleak hospital after millions have been spent in building this new and modern hospital ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How do you know that she is "<em>under critical life support system, with multiple tubes going into her body</em>" - or have you been watching too many emergencies on TV ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For all you know, LHL may have pulled the plug on his mother, given his emphasis on materialistic values over moral values.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You may wish to compare yourself with the Dogs, but I doubt you know enough of human behavior when confronted by barking dogs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will you seriously "go down on all fours" and bark back at the dog, when one barks at you - or as a Human, will you not throw stones or find something more solid to scare the dog away ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why should a dog bark at a dying dog ? Have you seen dogs having no qualms in eating a dead dog ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You are correct in understanding that dogs are not cold-blooded - but you fail to understand that they are not humans, and are animals - with their own animal instinct in becoming the "cold-blooded" Alpha-Dog.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will you consider the mistresses of those dictators as their wives ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hitler's companion had to suffer the same fate as himself during the last moments in the Bunker - as he knew the consequences that will befall on her, and preferred her suicide then being captured.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Italian mob hung both <a rel="nofollow" href="http://members.aol.com/Custermen85/ILDUCE/Mussolini.htm">“Benito Mussolini and mistress”. </a>without any qualms.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do women play any role in the traditional Japanese culture ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Does Premier Tojo take any advise from his wife or mistress, in the same manner that Mussolini and Hitler submit themselves to their mistresses ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Before making any speculative comments, you should read LKY's memoirs to find out how much of government policies have been influenced by his discussions with his wife, and what contributions his wife made in polishing up the legislations that he wished to get through Parliament.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you think that the quality of your common sense is comparable to that of everyone - especially to LKY's ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With so little time to be together, do you seriously think that they do not talk politics over dinner ? If not dinner, how about over breakfast, or lunch ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If one do not care enough about anything, why should one go to the extent of being emotional and curse ? Obviously, both you and M13 cared enough to do what was done in your individual ways.</span></p>
              <p>Does it make you "more right" if M13 was told the same ?</p>
              <p>He can read as well from here, and will post his response if in disagreement.</p>

              <p>Singapore without LKY might have even ended up surpassing that of Hong Kong. Hong Kong faced the same resource constraints as Singapore in the 1960s. Did Hong Kong ended up with uneducated, ended up as maids and labourers overseas? Without LKY, the sun will still rise from the east and set in the west, the world still revolves around the sun.</p>
              <p>I surely didn't vote for him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Having direct knowledge about his evil doings is different from those who voted for him as a result of his brainwashing propaganda. His family has private knowledge, while the public relying on news and TV propaganda don't.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You are too modest with your own efforts in this SgForums with your love for Singapore - not necessarily for the Ruling Party or the First Family.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do not be so quick to dismiss that the SG image is not moulded by the Lee's - now that LHL is the PM.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">During the last 43 years since kicked out of Malaysia, almost nothing is done by the PAP Government without LKY's stamp of approval or some contributing input; and LHL has similarly been groomed by LKY to have omni-present control of the entire Government. Unfortunately, it seems that LKY admitted that LHL is made differently from himself as LHL needs more sleep than himself; and since LHL's recovery from cancer - it required LHL to take things at a slower pace.</span></p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">It is quite troubling to note that even yourself - a reasonable thinking person - will believe that there is only 30% of Singaporean population who didn't vote for the PAP, when the statistics showed that only 56.6% of the entire population had participated in Election 2006.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> The 66.6% that was said to be won by the PAP had represented only less then 35% of the entire population of citizens only. Trying googling Election 2006 results from wikipedia, and you can work out the numbers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was the problem of equating PAP and country originated from people like myself - as you claimed ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Or has it not been a fact that the PAP has propagated this lie, and it is people like myself who is attempting to shred this lie by attacking the eye of the lie ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The injustice of your remarks - to put it mildly - in drawing M13's mother into the discussion that concerns Mrs Lee.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is Mrs Lee not invovled in Singapore Politics ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mrs Lee is involved in the politics of Singapore as she is married to LKY - and according to LKY's memoirs, she has been an inspiration to him, she was considered as his intellectual equal, - could she not be involved in the ideas that LKY has found inspirations with ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In his memoirs, LKY had written that he had depended on his wife to polish and draft some of his legislations before these are presented to the parliament. She was even praised by LKY for her astute abilities in assessing the people whom he picked.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Having been praised by LKY for her role in his life, surely she could have restrained LKY to be a gentler and more magnanimous elder statesman, instead of the petty and vindictive politician that he has become - at the expense of the broken families of his political challengers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you spared a thought for the mothers and wives of Chia Thye Poh, Francis Seow, Tang Liang Hong, JBJ, CSJ, Tan Wah Piow, Teo Sung Lung, and those whom he accused for being members of a communist cell in the Catholic Church - and the countless and nameless many whom he had used the ISA to be removed ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Under such circumstance, how could you compare Mrs Lee with M13's mother - for the views of M13 ?</span></p>

              <p>In my opinion this thread is in a bad taste.</p>
              <p>It is immoral to be so happy and congratulate each other when an old lady is in critical condition.</p>
              <p>You may not agree with LKY, PAP, and so on, but dont be so extreme that u hate the wife of LKY and even jubilate when she got seriously ill.</p>
              <p>I had a grandmother.</p>
              <p>She recently passed away, not more than 1 year or so.</p>
              <p>She also experienced critical conditions and several near-misses, and finally passed away one day, at home, not at hospital.</p>
              <p>I think people who are jubilating here are forgetting one thing.</p>
              <p>LKY wife is a real person, and a real dying person, possibly.</p>
              <p>If you disagree with LKY, can I give u a suggestion...?</p>
              <p>Try to be a little more understanding and a little more patient.</p>
              <p>He is 80+ already, of course his thinking is very different than yours.....why dont u try to talk to your grandparents who are 80+ and see what kind of differences they have with you?</p>
              <p>He did in fact contributed some good things to Singapore, but I know the younger generation now want to have some reforms and see him as an obstacle.</p>
              <p>So you say he is autocratic, dont care about people's opinions...let it be....that is his style. But be a little patient, he is a product of his times, the newer generation will take over and be more in tune with your ideas.</p>
              <p>And dont forget, whether they have a different ideology than yours, or whether they have a wonderful ideology matching yours completely 100%, everybody is just the same, so please retain a little bit humanity and decency in your heart.</p>

              <p>I shudder at the thought of the simpletons we have here that actually think Mrs. Lee is NOT involved in politics. Once you marry a politician, you are effectively in politics, unless you don't sleep with him/her, don't reside in the same house, don't communicate with each other.</p>
              <p>I suppose his son and daughter in law are not involved in politics too. Then how do they get their positions as CEO of GICs? Meritocracy? You probably believe that the Lees are the only intellectuals on this little island.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Like the wife of Thaksin (ex-PM of Thailand) who is also NOT involved in politics.</span></p>
              <p><strong>BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN)</strong> -- The wife of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra arrived in Thailand Tuesday morning to face corruption charges, promising to fight the accusations, her attorney said.</p>

              <h2>Thaksin's legal team hit over Bt2-million 'gift'</h2>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p><br class="clear-all">The Supreme Court yesterday sentenced three attorneys for ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra and his wife Pojaman to six months in prison for attempted bribery.</p>
              <p>The court ruled that the three had conspired to undermine the judiciary's reputation and integrity by stashing Bt2 million in cash in a snack box handed to a court official on June 10.</p>
              <p>According to the presiding judge at yesterday's trial, the bribery attempt was "a serious matter" and "grave" action that insulted the highest court.</p>
              <p>It was also likely have a "repercussion" on the on-going trial involving Thaksin and his wife in the Ratchadaphisek land purchase, in which the ex-premier is accused of abusing his power while in office for a sweetheart deal with the government.</p>
              <p>Thana Tansiri, the lawyer who delivered the snack box stashed with Bt1,000 notes worth around Bt2 million, was not present at yesterday's sentencing.He had asked for a trial postponement, claiming health reasons, but the judges dismissed the request on grounds that his health problems didn't appear to be serious.</p>
              <p>The court then ordered police to issue an arrest warrant for the lawyer.</p>
              <p>The two other convicted lawyers were Pichit Chuenban and Suphasri Sriswat.</p>
              <p>"I'm certain [of my innocence]," said Pichit, head of the legal team. Pichit said he didn't know why Thana, who is on his team, did not show up.</p>
              <p>On June 10, Thana was found guilty of trying to bribe ML Thitipong Chompoonuch, a legal officer at the Supreme Court's Criminal Division for Holders of Political Positions, and his colleagues by handing the paper bag containing the snack box stuffed with some Bt2 million in cash.</p>
              <p>According to the presiding judge, who read out the verdict, Thana told Thitipong: "These days I have to come [to the court] often and I feel sorry for the officials who have to work hard, so I have something for you people."</p>
              <p>Thana had argued in his earlier testimony that it was a mistake, as his driver got the wrong box for him to deliver to the court official.</p>
              <p>The "wrong" box contained money intended for a land purchase, while Thana's wife was said to have filled another bag with chocolate candy.</p>
              <p>However, the judges ruled the argument unlikely, saying that if Thana really intended to give chocolate he could have done it in the open in the presence of other officials, not privately with Thitipong alone.</p>
              <p>According to the judges, Thana didn't mention any other "chocolate bag" while court staff took photographs of the snack box filled with cash.</p>
              <p>The court believed Pichit and Suphasri were also "working closely" with Thana as all of them appeared at the court on that day.</p>
              <p>"They kept talking to one another prior to Thaksin's and Pojaman's arrival at the court, and thus they must be regarded as one team."</p>
              <p>When Pichit learned about the return of the snack box, he only made a phone call to Thitipong to apologise and didn't appear to have reprimanded Thana. "It shows that they collaborated with one another ... were aware [of the matter] and divided their role in this attempted bribery," the court said. </p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">President Bill &amp; Hillary Clinton's Whitewater controversy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large; color: #293158;">I</span>t all started with a little real estate deal 20 years ago. In 1978, then-Arkansas Attorney General Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, joined a partnership with James and Susan McDougal to buy 220 acres of riverfront land and form the Whitewater Development Corp.</p>
              <p>The goal was to sell lots for vacation homes. But the partnership did poorly and finally dissolved in 1992, leaving the Clintons reporting a net loss of more than $40,000.</p>
              <p>James McDougal also owned a savings and loan association, for which Hillary Clinton did legal work. Due in part to a series of fraudulent loans, McDougal's Madison Savings and Loan was one of many thrifts that went bust at taxpayer expense in the 1980s.</p>
              <p>Some Clinton associates clearly broke the law during the Arkansas years. The McDougals, most notably, were both found guilty of fraud.</p>
              <p>Over time, the investigation known as "Whitewater" grew well beyond allegations related to the Clintons' financial and legal dealings in Arkansas. It also encompasses the Clintons' responses to the allegations – and such unrelated events as the firing of White House travel office clerks.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/whitewater.htm">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/whitewater.htm</a></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">The youngest son of former Indonesian President Suharto has formally appealed against a court ruling sentencing him to 18 months in prison on corruption charges. </span></span>
              </p><p> </p>

              <p></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Lawyers for Hutomo Mandala Putra, known as Tommy, lodged a 31-page document, urging the Supreme Court to review the judgement it handed down last month, the Antara news agency said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Tommy Suharto was sentenced after being found guilty of illegally enriching himself through a $10.8m property scam involving the state's logistics agency, Bulog, in 1997.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You are too modest with your own efforts in this SgForums with your love for Singapore - not necessarily for the Ruling Party or the First Family.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do not be so quick to dismiss that the SG image is not moulded by the Lee's - now that LHL is the PM.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">During the last 43 years since kicked out of Malaysia, almost nothing is done by the PAP Government without LKY's stamp of approval or some contributing input; and LHL has similarly been groomed by LKY to have omni-present control of the entire Government. Unfortunately, it seems that LKY admitted that LHL is made differently from himself as LHL needs more sleep than himself; and since LHL's recovery from cancer - it required LHL to take things at a slower pace.</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">It is quite troubling to note that even yourself - a reasonable thinking person - will believe that there is only 30% of Singaporean population who didn't vote for the PAP, when the statistics showed that only 56.6% of the entire population had participated in Election 2006.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> The 66.6% that was said to be won by the PAP had represented only less then 35% of the entire population of citizens only. Trying googling Election 2006 results from wikipedia, and you can work out the numbers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was the problem of equating PAP and country originated from people like myself - as you claimed ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Or has it not been a fact that the PAP has propagated this lie, and it is people like myself who is attempting to shred this lie by attacking the eye of the lie ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">One maybe able to think but is it necessary that common sense exist in the thoughts ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is common sense so common in everyone.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you intend to be in politics, it maybe wise if you take Sun Tzu's advise of understanding your opponent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even if you have no interest in politics, there is not much worth in wasting your time understanding the Man.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you no mother of your own to attack his mother ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you no brother, sister or a familiar friend of your own to attack M13 ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you not been angry towards another without even thinking if you have anyone in your family that maybe identical to the person you feel such deep anger ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is there for me ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The injustice of your remarks - to put it mildly - in drawing M13's mother into the discussion that concerns Mrs Lee.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is Mrs Lee not invovled in Singapore Politics ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mrs Lee is involved in the politics of Singapore as she is married to LKY - and according to LKY's memoirs, she has been an inspiration to him, she was considered as his intellectual equal, - could she not be involved in the ideas that LKY has found inspirations with ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In his memoirs, LKY had written that he had depended on his wife to polish and draft some of his legislations before these are presented to the parliament. She was even praised by LKY for her astute abilities in assessing the people whom he picked.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Having been praised by LKY for her role in his life, surely she could have restrained LKY to be a gentler and more magnanimous elder statesman, instead of the petty and vindictive politician that he has become - at the expense of the broken families of his political challengers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you spared a thought for the mothers and wives of Chia Thye Poh, Francis Seow, Tang Liang Hong, JBJ, CSJ, Tan Wah Piow, Teo Sung Lung, and those whom he accused for being members of a communist cell in the Catholic Church - and the countless and nameless many whom he had used the ISA to be removed ?</span></p>
