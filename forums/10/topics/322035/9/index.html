              <p><br>Singaporeans are sad cases, those who worship LKY and his dominions thinking that he is the messiah to bring them to the land of milk and honey.</p>
              <p>For the suffering and harm he has caused his political opponents, I think it's only fair retribution is effected on him and his family in poetic justice.</p>
              <p>Most of us here are commoners, we are neither saint or messiah like LKY and his dominion. So don't expect saintly affections from us, such saintly affections are also lacking from him when he persecuted his political opponents. So many families destroyed because of this fallen angel.</p>
              <p>If you need spiritual comfort, you can approach a pastor or priest in a church to give your blessings to his family. Seriously, I too now wish them a long life, one that is protracted from the hospital bed.</p>
              <p>Whatever that happens now is all Karmic Justice.</p>

              <p>read thru so many post.. i don't feel anything about her illness or whatever.. Im not gloating over it, but I'm not supporting the ppl who gloat as well..</p>
              <p>if her illness is a form of karma of LKY's political tyranny, then it's a sad truth, that the wife have to suffer the husband's deeds.. I'll rather he himself go, not because he caused us shit, but because singapore will have a better future..</p>
              <p>no point of gloating over the woman's illness when the damage has already been done..</p>

              <p><br>not want her dead.</p>
              <p>Is want her to NOT have speedy recovery so that mr lee and family will finally get to suffer pain and agony.</p>
              <p>But then again, i think mr lee wont feel sorrow as his heart is made of stone. In fact, I think he is feeling proud that he is gonna outlive his spouse.</p>

              <p>Of course he is human, nobody is denying this fact.  GEt your facts right, this human is evil, he will do harm to anyone that he thinks is a threat to him.   he is evil over the extreme and is constantly exploiting people for his selfish gain.</p>
              <p>Well, I guess you will be neutral to someone who breaks your rice bowl too because that someone is human.   What sort of crappy logic is this?</p>
