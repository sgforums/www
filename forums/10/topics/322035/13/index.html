              <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
              <p>Back at independence days, majority of sporeans were poor. Even our ministers used to live in SIT flats. I was from the kampongs. My parents couldnt even afford SIT flats back in those days, as were many others.</p>
              <p>But what made many of us leapt from kampongs to private housing was education. It help many to obtain jobs and contribute back to society thru taxes.</p>
              <p>It was not easy. I am from the old school of success - 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. It's not about just working smart, but working hard, even now.</p>
              <p>But in time, with knowledge, anyone can make that leap just as many others did. You too, can make that leap in our society, that discriminates against no one and reward those who are capable, whether they work for people or are entrepreneurs. What is needed are determination and skill.</p>
              <p>I fully understand your middle class squeeze, neither poor enough to receive subsidies or rich enough to be without subsidies. Let's face up to reality, and cut down on expenses as much as we can, learn to live within our means. Times are currently not as good as we would like them to be, for situations are outside of our control.</p>
              <p> If you are still young, your future is still bright so long as you seek and open your eyes to opportunities. But if you have children, try to help them in their studies and get bursuries. And if not possible due to high family income status ( more than $1500), you can approach our CDC centres for help on kids for education. It is one thing our society will NEVER compromise on.</p>
              <p>I am sure it would help - your MP would be in a  better position to help, or even represent your views to Parliament to be debated, if it is worth the merit and he can't on the ground give you a solution.</p>
              <p>Our society is not a winner class, where the strongest survive and leave the weak to die. We are singaporeans, and all are losers, for the strongest will protect the weak and will never abandon them. So if your post was meant that the poor are being maginalised, rest assured, they will never be turned away from our CDC centres, so long as they are prepared to want help, within our society's ability. If you do know anyone who needs help, do direct them to CDC centres. Some may not even be aware of it.</p>

              <p>But what made many of us leapt from kampongs to private housing was education. It help many to obtain jobs and contribute back to society thru taxes.</p>
              <p>It was not easy. I am from the old school of success - 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. It's not about just working smart, but working hard, even now.</p>
              <p>But in time, with knowledge, anyone can make that leap just as many others did. You too, can make that leap in our society, that discriminates against no one and reward those who are capable, whether they work for people or are entrepreneurs. What is needed are determination and skill.</p>
              <p>I fully understand your middle class squeeze, neither poor enough to receive subsidies or rich enough to be without subsidies. Let's face up to reality, and cut down on expenses as much as we can, learn to live within our means. Times are currently not as good as we would like them to be, for situations are outside of our control.</p>
              <p> If you are still young, your future is still bright so long as you seek and open your eyes to opportunities. But if you have children, try to help them in their studies and get bursuries. And if not possible due to high family income status ( more than $1500), you can approach our CDC centres for help on kids for education. It is one thing our society will NEVER compromise on.</p>
              <p>I am sure it would help - your MP would be in a  better position to help, or even represent your views to Parliament to be debated, if it is worth the merit and he can't on the ground give you a solution.</p>
              <p>Our society is not a winner class, where the strongest survive and leave the weak to die. We are singaporeans, and all are losers, for the strongest will protect the weak and will never abandon them. So if your post was meant that the poor are being maginalised, rest assured, they will never be turned away from our CDC centres, so long as they are prepared to want help, within our society's ability. If you do know anyone who needs help, do direct them to CDC centres. Some may not even be aware of it.</p>

              <p>well crafted, full of sentimental alludes but insincere at best.</p>
              <p>the `nobody owes you a living' mantra applies to everyone, everywhere, not just singapore. for a country that made that leap from a swampy backwater small island to a so-called first world country; singapore is still a juvenile society, its maturity stumped no less by the so-called `master' you so worshipped so unconditionally. </p>
              <p>you are a child that's grown up to be a young adult, capable of knowing what's right and wrong. yet your guardian insists on baby-sitting you and watching every step of the way with strong punitive measures if you step out of line, in accordance to their uniquely singapore rule of law.</p>
              <p>the politics of fear that is employed today to great advantage by the ruling party is a great disservice to the country. it is as if only they have singapore interest at heart and the rest of us who do not agree with them are out to destroy the country. what an insult to singapore. </p>
              <p>you may wish to be continue to be treated like a kid, but don't drag the rest of us down your path. you have been brainwashed and you are brain dead.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It was made known by Dr Chee that he was a lecturer in the NUS, where the Head of his faculty was a Dr Vasoo - who is a Ruling Party stalwart -  and who had invited Dr Chee to join the Ruling Party.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It was to Dr Chee's credit that he believed in the cause of the Alternative Party and did not approve of the political agenda of the Ruling Party - and joined the SDP.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Regretably, the Ruling Party saw his decision to join the Alternative Party as a serious threat, and pre-empted further professionals and highly qualified Singaporeans from following his actions. </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you certain that your parents could not afford SIT flats back in those days, when those flats were heavily subsidised by the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning_in_Singapore">‘Singapore Improvement Trust {SIT}’</a> that was set up by the Colonial Government to address the housing issues ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it not a fact that many Singaporeans prefer to live in landed property - even in the rural farms - then living in high rise apartments, even when the high rise was no more then 3 or 4 storeys high ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Who are you kidding as a juvenile 'deerHunter' to claim that your parents had lived during the days when S.I.T flats were built and offered to Colonial residents living in Singapore - and not even called Singaporeans then ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If your parents had lived during those S.I.T days then you must be now between 20 to 30 years of age, or at worst in the late 40s - depending when they decide to belatedly create an individual that is capable of only 1% inspiration ? It seems that the 99% perspiration of your parent to create you has been done with little inspiration too ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely your audience is being abused by the 99% perspiration of a juvenile that has only 1% inspiration for anything ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For one who claims 99% perspiration, and only 1% inspiration, it has clearly shown your uninspiring efforts to attract the Elites can only fail - which explains for your continued useless efforts at pandering and propagating the sycophantic lines of the Ruling Elites.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it any wonder that you have no original ideas of your own to be claimed - when all you have is only a 1% inspiration ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can you even hope to know how those who lived happily for generations in kampungs would want ot continue to live in the rural areas of Tampinese, Nee Soon, Chong Pang, Sembawang, Seletar, Punggol, Changi, Geylang, Bedok, Pasir Panjang, Bukit Panjang, Lim Chu Kang, Chua Chu Kang, and the outlying islands ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If not for the resettlement schemes, and the mass eviction of the rural folks, to build the new townships of Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio, Yishun, Bedok - these people would have happily continued to live a life of initiative and self-reliance - with such low Cost of Living.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Compared to living in the HDB flats, where everything needed has to be purchased, and has resulted in a new resettled population being made dependent on the services of the Government - paying for every big and small necessities in life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Fortunately, the rudimentary living standards of kampung life had steeled several generations of Singaporeans to be community leaders, whom the Ruling Party tapped and used for their own political agenda, until another generation grew up living in the middle class districts of Serangoon Gardens, Seletar Hills, Sixth Avenues, Holland Close, Tiong Bahru, and Orchard Road.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you simply speculating with your claim that the Ruling Elites had their origins in kampungs - whatever their ethnic backgrounds ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But in time, with knowledge, anyone can make that leap just as many others did.

What is needed are determination and skill.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is obvious that the 'deerHunter' is drunk from his salivating on the lollipop sweetness in propagating the 99% inspirational dreams of the Ruling Party - which he is incapable of performing - and is using his 99% perspiration in convincing his imaginery audience to his bastardised version of the original message from his Master.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tell the graduating Class of 2006 onwards - that they can buy a private property by studing more - and work harder - and you will see how much more perspiration you will have to put up with in getting their answers.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I fully understand your middle class squeeze, neither poor enough to receive subsidies or rich enough to be without subsidies. Let's face up to reality, and cut down on expenses as much as we can, learn to live within our means. Times are currently not as good as we would like them to be, for situations are outside of our control.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How can you understand the middle class squeeze when you were decidely from the kampungs and with parents who could not even afford the heavily subsidised flats built by the Colonial S.I.T ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you expecting Singaporeans to tell their kids that PAPa cannot help any more, we have to use the funds for their school ECA to feed them, or else they will have to eat porridge and ikan belis everyday ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even monkeys have bananas, can Singaporeans afford the expensive bananas that have to be imported with the high fuel prices, and high property development costs that add up to the price of bananas sold in the super-markets ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> If you are still young, your future is still bright so long as you seek and open your eyes to opportunities. But if you have children, try to help them in their studies and get bursuries. And if not possible due to high family income status ( more than $1500), you can approach our CDC centres for help on kids for education. It is one thing our society will NEVER compromise on.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you are truly of the generation from the S.I.T era in the 1950s, and have failed despite your 99% perspiration - how can you advise anyone with your 1% inspirational abilities ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I am sure it would help - your MP would be in a  better position to help, or even represent your views to Parliament to be debated, if it is worth the merit and he can't on the ground give you a solution.</p>
              <p>Our society is not a winner class, where the strongest survive and leave the weak to die. We are singaporeans, and all are losers, for the strongest will protect the weak and will never abandon them. So if your post was meant that the poor are being maginalised, rest assured, they will never be turned away from our CDC centres, so long as they are prepared to want help, within our society's ability. If you do know anyone who needs help, do direct them to CDC centres. Some may not even be aware of it.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why do you not continue with your effort to speak on behalf of the MIW MPs - since you have put in 99% perspiration in getting this far ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is there any merit on the part of your 99% perspiration that gets you no where, and you will expect the sole MP to get somewhere with your 1% inspiration on the issues to be presented in Parliament ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is the worth of debating and leaving stones unturned - is it not a waste of public money in keeping the aircon and lights burning in Parliament ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are the poorest in Singaporean society not already marginalised, when their existence in Singapore are denied by MM LKY - that in Singapore there are no beggars, no homeless, and no destitutes ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If those who are poor are unaware of the existence of the CDC, it is due to the fact that the Government has only 1% inspiration to make this known to the many in Singapore who needs help.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In the minds of the Ruling Elites - dio you think that it is more important to spend the million dollar as a crutch to support the very poor in Singpore; or should the million dollar budget be used as a crutch for the ambitious Ruling Elites from getting corrupted ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With only a 1% inpirational ability from a 'deerHunter' - you will need 99% perspiration to arrive at an answer - which your audience will have the immense patience to learn from your esteemed ability at idiot-logy.</span></p>

              <p><br>are you any better to curse his mum, use your brain.   I don't care about the lee family though I don't curse the old woman.   I don't curse her does not mean I believe she has no hand in any evil deeds of the husband.  I am giving her the benefit of doubt.  She earns so much from the people already, did she return the society any favour?   She earns million, billions from the people thru the taxi company she owns, and the lee and lee.    </p>
              <p>She is so old and moreover her condition is so critical.  She is more critical than my beloved late godma (a stroke patient) the same age as her so whether there are curses or not she will not survive not.   She is so much better than my late godma - my late godma was diagnosed stroke but TTSH refused to let my late godma admitted to  neuro ward.    Drs there refused to prolong her life and said leave her there, whereas now they are doing every bit to prolong this old woman's life.  So what say you about this ?   What f is that f son of hers doing now and last year the incompetent cold blooded ah kua loong said don't waste time, resources to prolong life, now isn't he allowing the drs to prolong his mum's life?  So can you explain why the double standard.  F O, lee hsien loong,   even if your cancer recur nobody who are for righteousness  is going to wish you well.  Lee hsien loong, u see chao.  </p>
