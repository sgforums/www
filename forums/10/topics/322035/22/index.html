              <p>jjb is correct, singapore is welcoming `quiters' in droves here into its fold. these people come for the same reason singaporeans are leaving. the only difference is the inbound `quitters' probably have it easier to settle in because the government here has little or no bar in screening these people. just look around us, there is no need to rely on data to find out what's on the ground.</p>

              <p> I have been careful not to call everyone who had left 'quitters'. Personally I have many friends and relatives who had migrated and never have I ever called them quitters. We can have hours of talking kock during coffee or golf either in Singapore or their new place, never doubt each others loyalty to where we belong, and the respect for where we came from. No cursing and swearing ..... </p>
              <p>Immigration policies change every now and then for countries such as Canada and Australia. When rich immigrants came in from HK and other part of Asia a dacade ago, the local Canadians were happy cause whatever properties they held simply appreciated and they just cashed in and went on retirement.</p>
              <p>Today, just look at Vancouver, richmond, the wealthy suburb has become a mini HK, shopping malls there were duplicate of that in HK, even with name such as aberdeen. Surrey, another suburb is now punjabi... Singaporeans all stay in coquitlam...switch on channel M you will hear news in Mandarin, Cantonese and Punjabi...If you live in these areas, you don't have to speak or read English, or Canadian for a thousand years. If you need to deal with the government on official matters, they are obliged to find an interpretor for you. now the presence of PRC is everywhere, moving further East to Calgary...You can imagine how the young native Canadians think, but then, who are the natives, the Red Indians or the Whites? If you live in Canada, you can verify if what I wrote above is true.  </p>
              <p>Will Singapore be spared from having immigrants? No, and who are the native true Singaporeans, the people from the the Sumatran Srivijaya empire in the 2nd century, the Malay from Johore, the Chinese from China, or the Indian from Madras? What really important in Singapore is the recognition of Singapore as our home. We have established our way of life and even our Singlish. It is important that all immigrants come in and adapt to our way of life rather than the other way round. Singapore has our own identity. If we can't avoid immigrants, we got to know what we want and what is important.</p>
              <p>Those who cannot differentiate between politics and nationhood, between Singapore and PAP do not help in anyway the protection of the identity of Singapore, but they are of great help to the PAP for running down the oppositions, especially those who are cursing and swearing... a failure in the education in Singapore.</p>
