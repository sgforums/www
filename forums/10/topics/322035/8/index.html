              <p> </p>
              <p>Once, there was a conference for all SE-Asians PMs to attend. After that long and tiring conference, one of the PM suggested to other PMs to look for whores to relax. All agreed!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the brotel, they promised to meet up at the lobby straight after that f***ing session. A few hrs later, all PMs gathered at the lobby and shared their experiences but only one PM was missing. Then they found out that its the old-fart that was missing and they went to his room to look for him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When they reached the main door of the room where old-fart was in, they heard a female voice singing...as their ears lean closer to the door, they can cleary hear her sing... <strong>"Stand up for Singapore! Do the best you can!"</strong></p>

              <p>It does not matter what i think. I should have the freedom to look on the bright side of life. I am just tired of complaining about the current govt and it serves no purpose. Its not as if we will ge to vote and what is more likely to happen is walkovers. Its a LPPL situation. It does not matter if LYK wife is dying and whether she realised her faults and support for the kind of things her husband does. What matters more is what my heart is thinking about these people no matter how mean and bad they have been to me. In a world full or hate, hate will not go away with more hate. In a world full of misery, it will not go away with more misery. I feel the need to protect myself against such negative thinking and try to be grateful even for these people who might not have been good. Because they teach us real lessons about ourselves. In this world, said buddha, that the only way to remove hate, fear, greed and all the negativity, is with love and acceptance. as everyone said, karma is fair.  So its not in our place to worry about the Lee's karma. Worry about our own is more healthy.</p>

              <p>It does not matter what i think. I should have the freedom to
              look on the bright side of life. I am just tired of complaining
              about the current govt and it serves no purpose. Its not as if we
              will ge to vote and what is more likely to happen is walkovers. Its
              a LPPL situation. It does not matter if LYK wife is dying and
              whether she realised her faults and support for the kind of things
              her husband does. What matters more is what my heart is thinking
              about these people no matter how mean and bad they have been to me.
              In a world full or hate, hate will not go away with more hate. In a
              world full of misery, it will not go away with more misery. I feel
              the need to protect myself against such negative thinking and try
              to be grateful even for these people who might not have been good.
              Because they teach us real lessons about ourselves. In this world,
              said buddha, that the only way to remove hate, fear, greed and all
              the negativity, is with love and acceptance. as everyone said,
              karma is fair.  So its not in our place to worry about the
              Lee's karma. Worry about our own is more healthy.</p>
