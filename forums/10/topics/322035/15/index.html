              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you being a little naive to be expecting the qualities of "warmth or kindness, or any humanity" to exist in someone who is seething to the teeth in making a curse ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is Tan Tock Seng such a bleak hospital after millions have been spent in building this new and modern hospital ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How do you know that she is "<em>under critical life support system, with multiple tubes going into her body</em>" - or have you been watching too many emergencies on TV ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For all you know, LHL may have pulled the plug on his mother, given his emphasis on materialistic values over moral values.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How do you think Singaporeans should react to such cold-blooded advise for Singaporeans to pull the plug on their loved ones as it is a foregone conclusion that there is no hope for a U-turn in recovery- and hospital equipment and resources should not be wasted in such useless efforts ?</span></p>
              <p>I do not deny that such advice are "cold-blooded", but I am seeing is that when the dog barks, many would go down on their hands and legs to bark back. And even a dog would not bark at a dying dog, oh, I forgot, dogs are not cold blooded.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You may wish to compare yourself with the Dogs, but I doubt you know enough of human behavior when confronted by barking dogs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will you seriously "go down on all fours" and bark back at the dog, when one barks at you - or as a Human, will you not throw stones or find something more solid to scare the dog away ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why should a dog bark at a dying dog ? Have you seen dogs having no qualms in eating a dead dog ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You are correct in understanding that dogs are not cold-blooded - but you fail to understand that they are not humans, and are animals - with their own animal instinct in becoming the "cold-blooded" Alpha-Dog.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will you consider the mistresses of those dictators as their wives ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hitler's companion had to suffer the same fate as himself during the last moments in the Bunker - as he knew the consequences that will befall on her, and preferred her suicide then being captured.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Before making any speculative comments, you should read LKY's memoirs to find out how much of government policies have been influenced by his discussions with his wife, and what contributions his wife made in polishing up the legislations that he wished to get through Parliament.</span></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you think that the quality of your common sense is comparable to that of everyone - especially to LKY's ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If one do not care enough about anything, why should one go to the extent of being emotional and curse ? Obviously, both you and M13 cared enough to do what was done in your individual ways.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you certain that your parents could not afford SIT flats back in those days, when those flats were heavily subsidised by the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning_in_Singapore">‘Singapore Improvement Trust {SIT}’</a> that was set up by the Colonial Government to address the housing issues ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it not a fact that many Singaporeans prefer to live in landed property - even in the rural farms - then living in high rise apartments, even when the high rise was no more then 3 or 4 storeys high ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Who are you kidding as a juvenile 'deerHunter' to claim that your parents had lived during the days when S.I.T flats were built and offered to Colonial residents living in Singapore - and not even called Singaporeans then ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If your parents had lived during those S.I.T days then you must be now between 20 to 30 years of age, or at worst in the late 40s - depending when they decide to belatedly create an individual that is capable of only 1% inspiration ? It seems that the 99% perspiration of your parent to create you has been done with little inspiration too ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely your audience is being abused by the 99% perspiration of a juvenile that has only 1% inspiration for anything ?</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">It clearly shows that you are creating a make beleive world of your own in this printed threads simply to create empathy towards your own vanity in being one with everyone.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For one who claims 99% perspiration, and only 1% inspiration, it has clearly shown your uninspiring efforts to attract the Elites can only fail - which explains for your continued useless efforts at pandering and propagating the sycophantic lines of the Ruling Elites.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it any wonder that you have no original ideas of your own to be claimed - when all you have is only a 1% inspiration ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can you even hope to know how those who lived happily for generations in kampungs would want ot continue to live in the rural areas of Tampinese, Nee Soon, Chong Pang, Sembawang, Seletar, Punggol, Changi, Geylang, Bedok, Pasir Panjang, Bukit Panjang, Lim Chu Kang, Chua Chu Kang, and the outlying islands ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If not for the resettlement schemes, and the mass eviction of the rural folks, to build the new townships of Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio, Yishun, Bedok - these people would have happily continued to live a life of initiative and self-reliance - with such low Cost of Living.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Compared to living in the HDB flats, where everything needed has to be purchased, and has resulted in a new resettled population being made dependent on the services of the Government - paying for every big and small necessities in life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Fortunately, the rudimentary living standards of kampung life had steeled several generations of Singaporeans to be community leaders, whom the Ruling Party tapped and used for their own political agenda, until another generation grew up living in the middle class districts of Serangoon Gardens, Seletar Hills, Sixth Avenues, Holland Close, Tiong Bahru, and Orchard Road.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you simply speculating with your claim that the Ruling Elites had their origins in kampungs - whatever their ethnic backgrounds ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is obvious that the 'deerHunter' is drunk from his salivating on the lollipop sweetness in propagating the 99% inspirational dreams of the Ruling Party - which he is incapable of performing - and is using his 99% perspiration in convincing his imaginery audience to his bastardised version of the original message from his Master.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tell the graduating Class of 2006 onwards - that they can buy a private property by studing more - and work harder - and you will see how much more perspiration you will have to put up with in getting their answers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How can you understand the middle class squeeze when you were decidely from the kampungs and with parents who could not even afford the heavily subsidised flats built by the Colonial S.I.T ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you expecting Singaporeans to tell their kids that PAPa cannot help any more, we have to use the funds for their school ECA to feed them, or else they will have to eat porridge and ikan belis everyday ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even monkeys have bananas, can Singaporeans afford the expensive bananas that have to be imported with the high fuel prices, and high property development costs that add up to the price of bananas sold in the super-markets ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you are truly of the generation from the S.I.T era in the 1950s, and have failed despite your 99% perspiration - how can you advise anyone with your 1% inspirational abilities ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why do you not continue with your effort to speak on behalf of the MIW MPs - since you have put in 99% perspiration in getting this far ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is there any merit on the part of your 99% perspiration that gets you no where, and you will expect the sole MP to get somewhere with your 1% inspiration on the issues to be presented in Parliament ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is the worth of debating and leaving stones unturned - is it not a waste of public money in keeping the aircon and lights burning in Parliament ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are the poorest in Singaporean society not already marginalised, when their existence in Singapore are denied by MM LKY - that in Singapore there are no beggars, no homeless, and no destitutes ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If those who are poor are unaware of the existence of the CDC, it is due to the fact that the Government has only 1% inspiration to make this known to the many in Singapore who needs help.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In the minds of the Ruling Elites - dio you think that it is more important to spend the million dollar as a crutch to support the very poor in Singpore; or should the million dollar budget be used as a crutch for the ambitious Ruling Elites from getting corrupted ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With only a 1% inpirational ability from a 'deerHunter' - you will need 99% perspiration to arrive at an answer - which your audience will have the immense patience to learn from your esteemed ability at idiot-logy.</span></p>

              <p><br>Atobe, having dealt with you on a daily basis, I see no point in rebutting you for you will never accept or listen to any views, save your own clouded, bias, slanderous twisting and insulting views.</p>
              <p>Your way of hiding or accepting reality is to twist others views into questions, and thereby insulating yourself from blame in the event you are proven wrong and blame the other for assuming. You would even twist others opinions whom you agree into creating the belief that it originally came from you. Thus, you are nothing more than a sicko and a waste of time for me, a deadweight i have to bear as long as you hold our citizenship ( which i hope you dont).</p>
              <p>The only truth that you had told from your numerous atrocious chicken view is this, and in her OWN WORDS too:-</p>
              <p>"Are you bitten by the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">same bug that made CSJ an 'attention seeking whore' "</span></p>
              <p><br>Defined lucidly in your own words:-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">whoring ways as a dishonest political commentator</span> ?"  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As if not enough, you further trample him:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Even if you cannot side with CSJ or his cause, there is no reason for you to trample a fallen person deeper into <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the rut that he got himself into</span>."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If anyone had been long here, they would have realized why her previous rabid and fervant ass kissing support of CSJ had stopped. Her motormouth had finally got the better of her.</p>

              <p>Correction for you:-</p>
              <p>1.) Insincere - only to you and your biased belief system</p>
              <p>2.)Maturity stumped, only due to time, and not anyone. It was already a miracle that by the 1980s, we made that jump, all due to good governorship of Singapore, led by a strongman MM Lee and the hardwork of our previous generation, who believe in action than mere talk of 'freedom of speech' mouthed by the spoilt and self centred bourgeois elements of that earlier society. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">you are a child that's grown up to be a young adult, capable of knowing what's right and wrong. yet your guardian insists on baby-sitting you and watching every step of the way with strong punitive measures if you step out of line, in accordance to their uniquely singapore rule of law.</span></p>
              <p>Correction:- There are even 70s year old who breaks the law of our society. Being adult does not mean you will not commit wrongs. Thus laws are there as a guide for everyone to know and be ensured where the line is. And our laws are not oppressive in anyway, only there to ensure our uniquely multicultural society may live in peace with one another.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">the politics of fear that is employed today to great advantage by the ruling party is a great disservice to the country. it is as if only they have singapore interest at heart and the rest of us who do not agree with them are out to destroy the country. what an insult to singapore.</span></p>
              <p>Correction:- What 'politics of fear' are you alluding? You certainly had not shown any fear voicing your opinions here. And there are even opposition MPs in parliament. Thus, your logic on 'Politics of fear' holds no water, but only an insidious lie to stir resentment on the uninformed. We always had freedom of speech but NOT freedom to slander. No sane person would want to be slandered against by unsubstantiated allegations, not even the common man. And that is a graver insult by far  </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">you may wish to be continue to be treated like a kid, but don't drag the rest of us down your path. you have been brainwashed and you are brain dead.</span></p>
              <p>Correction:- You are the one who is behaving like a kid here, stubbornly rejecting truths and reality, and not only brainwashing yourself that our society is out to 'harm' you, you are even attempting to brainwash others by using the term  'rest of us'.</p>
              <p>For you and your kind's sake, do grow up. It's already tough to provide for you brain dead kids without your kind making it difficult for society to help you lot realistically and pragmatically.</p>

              <p>I empathise with your plight, but:-</p>
              <p>Ruling party ( Voted Government Help)</p>
              <p>1. AMK Council - by that you meant AMK Town council.</p>
              <p>2. TTSH - A Government hospital. They helped.</p>
              <p>3. Govt called? And did you seek for further help or assistance?</p>
              <p>All these facts while important, is not as important in obtaining assistance for your dad. Actually, the govt is already helping you in several areas. Personally, i would have like to help, but how much can we seriously offer that you can be satisfied?</p>
              <p>1. You salary is low.</p>
              <p>2. Your dad has a stroke and the cost for cures are high</p>
              <p>3. You are only 1 person out of an est 3,500,000 citizens</p>
              <p>OUr society would like to help all, but are you aware how much it would cost the country? Many billions of which we don't have. We have no other revenue than tax revenues. CPF monies have to be returned with interests. The only way society can help is to increase GST, and you know how much some of these overfed and selfish people will scream and the opposition parties to take advantage of the situation, and lead pointless tak boleh tahan street demostrations that serve no other purpose than achieve their own political ambitions?</p>
              <p>My solution to you is:-</p>
              <p>a. Continue to bombard your MP,town councils, CDCs for help. You cannot expect the govt to keep track, there are many old persons in our society and will continue to grow. You are just 1 of many.</p>
              <p>b. Upgrade your skills at nights if you can and be a better value worker to your boss, so that he can justifiably increase your salary.</p>
              <p>c.CDCs can also direct you to NGOs(non governmental organisations) to seek for funds.</p>
              <p>d. At the national level, our govt will continue to seek and find solutions to help our citizens. Already they had done alot and will continue to do more if you were know. We could have been like our neighbours out of jobs and facing starvation with inflation.</p>
              <p>I admire and respect your care for your father. Do not give up, and society will not give up on you and your father too. </p>

              <p>if u reliase many poor have already given up on the goverment cause in national TV they wouldsay " we care" 'we love" but behind the meaning its always mean  "we care about the $$$ in our own pockets" " we love our $$$ in our own pockets" the goverment never help us in anything when we seek their help</p>
              <p>the only few that help my family are</p>
              <p>1 Jin An Chun - they would sent us some vegitable every monday (my dad when to them to seek help) they sent some1 to check on us</p>
              <p>2 AMK Council Help Line at BLk 445 (same my mum(when alive) and my dad seek help themselves by going there) they sent council to check on us</p>
              <p>3 and a TTS hospital when my mum was admit into the hospital for cancer(she have pass away) we submit our total house details and wait 2 months be4 the help us</p>
              <p>all of them help us when we seek them although some take longer time</p>
              <p>while the goverment only gave us a call and that the last we heard from them , thet dont even sent some1 to check on us to see our suitation</p>
              <p>for me im standing strong with wat i have but my dad is having trouble accepting wat we are that Y he seeking any help he can find.</p>
              <p> but for me i already gave up on PAP</p>

              <p>Hope things will change for the better for you and your dad.   PAP is running sg like a business, so anything that does not help to make profits they don't care.    Just do your best to cope with the living costs and see if there are any temples, charitable organisations which are able to help you to lighten your load.</p>

              <p><br>That's the problem with society as it progresses economically, the social unit becomes smaller, we become less cohesive with our neighbours. Folks become less involved with the plight of others, they become more reclusive living in their own constructs.</p>
