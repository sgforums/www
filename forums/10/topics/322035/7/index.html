              <p>Yesterday i was watching Brainiac on Art Central. They tried to prove whether a pretty girl or a dumpy girl gets help on her heavy luggage. The guys simply offer help to the pretty girl every single time while no one bothered to help the ugly one. </p>
              <p>If your family is sick, you also will do your best to get better treatment to your family than others.  I see that kind of behaviour everyday in everyone. People just wanting the best for themselves and their family. Who can justify if its right or not? It depends on whose point of view as well.  Its not possible to ask these people at the top to know what is happening down below when all the information they get through their kah-kia who beautify the details and mask out some of these things from them. EG: when the "transport minister" takes the train, the whole train is booked for him and its totally empty. How will he ever know how its like during peak hour? It was not until LHL saw the state of the trains when he was travelling to an event that he saw for himself the over packed trains that he told the transport service to do something about it.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #339966;">I don't agree totally with you on the above.   I have seen my own godmum's family and other families who wish quick death for their loved ones and these people just don't bother to allow the loved ones treatment to let them survive.   </span></p>
