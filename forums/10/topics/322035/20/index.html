              <p>Any country and society would be concerned with brain drain, not just ours. But at the end of the day, we have to be practical and be more concerned about the big percentage that stay, and give them the best administration one can, and work on solutions that will give the next 1000 leavers better economic reasons to stay, afterall, most of them are chinese, and be honest, no $ no talk.

              <p>sgdiehard,</p>
              <p>it actually does matter. The reason is simple. Singapore is the singapore today because of our ancestors that worked this land. Those who came to singapore from other countries after singapore have become developed just come here for an easy ride. Borned, breed and decended from long generations of singaporeans do deserve better rights because what our ancestors contributed to the land. Its our birth right.</p>
              <p>If you are not born in singapore, but a singapore citizen. Please remember, your ancestors didnt work in this land to make it as it is today. So just live with it. No need to try and convince others that you are of our ranks.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Birth right? what right as a Singaporean do you think you have inherited from your father, or your ancestor? Your ancestor could demonstrate against the colonial government and go on strike but now you can't even hold a peaceful demonstration.</p>
              <p>The constitution of Singapore give special rights to Malay Singaporean, born in Singapore, Johore or anywhere. Chinese, Indian, Eurasian...Singaporean, by birth or nationalization, are all equal in every right. I don't have to convince anybody that I have the right of Singaporean. What better right do you think you have?</p>
              <p>While I respect all who have stayed in this land, it must be clear that Singapore began its development only after its independent from Malaysia. If the LKY's party, including Goh Keng Swee, Toh C C, Rajaratnam....did not lead Singapore out of Malaysia, Singapore would not be what it is today. Don't blow too much about what your ancestors do for this land before then, they were probably just working for their colonial master.</p>
              <p>What really is important for Singaporean today is what they intend to do for the land, especially those who don't like the present government or system. If you are among those who would migrate, let it is clear that you are not of my ranks.    </p>

              <p>yes, i have seen it with my own eyes; frens and colleagues who became PR overnight. unfortunately, noneof whom i have spoken to have the intention to stay on. they will contribute productively during their stay here but they are pretty sure they will return home. these are the white collar workers holding executive positions.</p>
              <p>so, it is up to one how they want to read this. one could argue that when they are here, they are a productive unit to the well-being of singapore, but they will eventually leave and be `replaced' by another FT. whether singapore's social integration, patriotism to the country and other aspects that defines nation building matures and remain intact remains to be seen.  </p>

              <p>Birth right? what right as a Singaporean do you think you have inherited from your father, or your ancestor? Your ancestor could demonstrate against the colonial government and go on strike but now you can't even hold a peaceful demonstration.</p>
              <p>The constitution of Singapore give special rights to Malay Singaporean, born in Singapore, Johore or anywhere. Chinese, Indian, Eurasian...Singaporean, by birth or nationalization, are all equal in every right. I don't have to convince anybody that I have the right of Singaporean. What better right do you think you have?</p>
              <p>While I respect all who have stayed in this land, it must be clear that Singapore began its development only after its independent from Malaysia. If the LKY's party, including Goh Keng Swee, Toh C C, Rajaratnam....did not lead Singapore out of Malaysia, Singapore would not be what it is today. Don't blow too much about what your ancestors do for this land before then, they were probably just working for their colonial master.</p>
              <p>What really is important for Singaporean today is what they intend to do for the land, especially those who don't like the present government or system. If you are among those who would migrate, let it is clear that you are not of my ranks.    </p>

              <p>Nobody would say they leave for the sake of leaving. I've heard people migrating because they don't want their children to be subjected to the tough competition in the education system here, especially learning Chinese. Some parents believe with the education here, their children can go anywhere in the world after that.</p>
              <p>Migrating today is much easier than it was before, from the point of preparation, not in terms of acceptance by the host countries. Last time many people migrated to the UK or Australia only after 1 visit. Today people can do all kinds of preparations before they go. I would say earlier migrants were taking much greater risk than we do today.</p>
              <p>In the past, people migrated with no plan to return. Today people leave their CPF money behind, leave their HDB flat or other properties behind, just in case.</p>
              <p>Singapore is never a place to be migrated to, because it is small and vulnerable. This factor alone is making many people think hard if they should convert their PR to citizenship. The question is how far Singapore can continue to go. Political stability, its ability to survive among the neighboring countries (don't tell me this is PAP propaganda), just a few questions. In Australia, if the local whites and the lebonese riot on the streets in the gold coast, you go to Sydney, and when the bush fire come, you move to Perth. In Singapore, a major incident in Geylang, we go on the boat if the situation is not contained. Don't tell me this is PAP propaganda.</p>
              <p>But what me and my family experienced so far is that my parents made the right choice. The people (those older ones) of Singapore were united and determined to build a nation, my parents trusted them and decided to be part of this nation building.</p>
              <p>Leaving is indeed a difficult decision requiring complicated deliberation, it is not just about LKY.</p>

              <p>If my grandchildren were "true" singaporean like you, I would be ashamed.</p>
              <p>People who work for their master work to please their master, in return they were given 3 meals a day. The bangladeshi, PRC, indian, philippino here are working hard to build on this land, will their grandchildren be considered "true" Singaporean? No. But these workers are here as "FT" (as a respect to them), they do the work no Singaporean, especially the young ones are not capable of doing and they worked for their employers, not their master.</p>
              <p>Who get an easy ride? only those who live on the inheritance from their parents.</p>
              <p>Let me confirm again, you are not of my rank.</p>

              <p><br>too bad for your "honour".</p>
              <p>FTs may work here, have jobs that no s'porean youths want. But at the end of the day, they would think of going back to their homeland. Retire in india, phillipine or wherever they came from. At the end of the day, they would go back. Ask any maids, or bangladesh or china nurses etc. Would they want to retire and live in singapore? Of course not, they family is back in their homeland. They are just here to work. If singapore is at war, would they defend it? Most likely they would go home.</p>
              <p>If they stayed and worked on this land, then of course, their children would be considered as "true" singaporeans.</p>
              <p>"True" singaporeans deserve our birth rights. That's what our ancestors did, came here and build a future for their decendents.</p>
              <p>Of course, i am not of your rank. You are lower than me. I wont want to "dirty" myself.</p>
