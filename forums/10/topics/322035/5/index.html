              <p>Ordinarily if this happened to others I would not have sniggered
              or gloated over his immediate family's demise. But there is
              precedence to this sniggering, he has sniggered over his political
              enemies predicament before, so I guess it's alright to snigger at
              him. Even when I snigger, I am only sniggering at him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I wonder if CSJ is sniggering at him now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Political ideologies aside. I am no supporter of CSJ, but I
              think it's just despicable that LKY sniggered at CSJ when CSJ told
              him that he is a bankrupt and with 3 children to look after.</p>

              <p><br>I understand what you getting at, it's what I firmly believe in to. But for LKY and his immediate family, it just does not apply to me. Birds of a feather flock together, it's their just deserve. You do not show mercy to Satan and his dominions.</p>
              <p>What do you think of LKY sniggering at the plight of CSJ elaborating the facts that he had to take care of his 3 young children despite being a bankrupt?</p>
              <p>I always have this policy of returning in kind the deeds or misdeeds that others commit against you. Though the misdeed of sniggering wasn't commited against me, but I felt compassion for CSJ's children. Perhaps the passing of LKY and his regime will bode well for the young children of CSJ. It's heavens way of exacting justice to a dictator.</p>
