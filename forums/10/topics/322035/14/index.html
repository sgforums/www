              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Your stance on issues regarding Singapore is not one of an enlightened individual. Your stance is, even if Singapore sinks, you will sink with it and not bail ship. The natural instinct for humans is self preservation, if a person has not the intellect to bail ship to seek personal safety, what more can we say about the intellect of such a person.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Seriously, do you it's humane for the Lees to do what they do to their political opponents. How many families have they wreck? It's only poetic justice that they suffer for their past atrocities. If Mrs. LKY was any other ordinary individual or politician, such curses would not be in order. But it's the way the Lees inflict damage on all their political opponents that calls for the greater karmic justice. They inflict harm on their political opponents, it's all about causing harm to obtain their selfish desires. My wishes are more selfless, I wish them prolong suffering for the suffering they caused all their political opponents, I do not wish any selfish benefits for myself.</span></p>

              <p>I do not deny that such advice are "cold-blooded", but I am seeing is that when the dog barks, many would go down on their hands and legs to bark back. And even a dog would not bark at a dying dog, oh, I forgot, dogs are not cold blooded.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dogs are not cold blooded? You specifically referring to P4P dogs? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> As humans we give credit when credit is due, we give compassion when compassion is due. Do we need show compassion to Satan and his dominion? Like I said before, we are commoners here, not saints, let god show them the compassion that they desire.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mrs Lee may not be in politics, do you think that any of the government policies proposed in public by LKY did not involved Mrs Lee, or received her contribution ?</span></p>
              <p>There were many tyrants, dictators and despots in the history of mankind all over the world, but none of their wives ever had to account for what their husbands did. Neither did the wife or mistresses of Hitler, the Japanese war criminals, ...were ever even put on trial for what their husband did. Unless, there are people who hide under their bed and heard something we don't. Its scary that one who curse for something he think....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes, the policies imposed would definitely have involved some form of discussion between LKY and his wife, afterall his wife is also a lawyer. What makes you think that there are no discussions in the closed doors of the Lee family? You are so naive! Like I used in another previous example, if Mrs. Lee knows of the deeds that LKY committed, imprisoning his political prisoners for decades, bankrupting his political opponents therefore destroying the lives of whole families, torturing political prisoners in ISD. What innocent and compassionate person who stand by while evil is being committed? Therefore she is not an innocent party. She benefited from the status by acquring large amounts of fortunes. If she was an innocent party, she would have long divorce the old man and not benefited from his status.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How certain are you that LKY's family does not influence his politics ?</span></p>
              <p>My common sense tells me that it is difficult for any family member to influence any old man who is used to power. I don't even think LKY would talk politics over dinner. I am not certain, and I don't care. You must be so certain that you curse.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Are you 100% sure? You have dinner with the Lees every night? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> You sleep on the same bed with Mr and Mrs. Lee? It's not uncommon for husbands and wives to discuss issues about friends, work, etc in the bedroom. If you don't sleep together with them or dine with them. How can you be 100% sure? It's only guesses, guesses are subjected to errors from emotions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Two wrongs do not make anyone Right.</span></p>
              <p>You are absolutely right. Tell this to M13.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Two wrongs definitely don't make a right, but two deaths will certainly make it all right.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Have you not followed the link posted by another forumer, in that poll about 90% of participants wanted to see Mrs. LKY dead. I think we should go with popular opinion.</span></p>

              <p><br>First of you there is a difference between my mom and LKY's wife. My mom plays no part in the lives of ordinary Singaporeans, LKY's wife has played a major part in making the lives of Singaporeans difficult. Don't tell us that LKY's wife has nothing to do with politics, if your husband is in politics the wife also plays a part. Does LKY's wife go to political functions with him? Do they discuss issues of politics in the chambers? I guess you would also say that the President's Wife (First Lady) in the US has no part to play in politics?</p>
              <p><strong>If none of the family members had any part to play in politics. Do you think LHL &amp; LHY would be BGs in such a short time span? Do you think LHL would be PM? Do you think LHY would be CEO of Singtel then now F&amp;N and DBS? Do you think the wife could acquire WT? Do you think that HC would be Temasek's CEO?</strong></p>
              <p>You need to do more objective thinking, instead of emotional thinking, I know you have been brainwashed since young, but the majority of forumers here aren't.</p>
              <p>Anything that befalls them is their just deserve.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you considered what LHL had said about Singaporean wasteful use of public resources by expecting hospitals to prolong the struggle of their loved ones to Life when it is a foregone conclusion that it will all be in vain ?</span></span></p>
              <p>As much as LHL is heartless in his remarks, is there any warmth or kindness, or any humanity in anybody who curse the old lady to live a long long life in the room of a bleak hospital under critical life support system, with multiple tubes going into her body?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Seriously, do you it's humane for the Lees to do what they do to their political opponents. How many families have they wreck? It's only poetic justice that they suffer for their past atrocities. If Mrs. LKY was any other ordinary individual or politician, such curses would not be in order. But it's the way the Lees inflict damage on all their political opponents that calls for the greater karmic justice. They inflict harm on their political opponents, it's all about causing harm to obtain their selfish desires. My wishes are more selfless, I wish them prolong suffering for the suffering they caused all their political opponents, I do not wish any selfish benefits for myself.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How do you think Singaporeans should react to such cold-blooded advise for Singaporeans to pull the plug on their loved ones as it is a foregone conclusion that there is no hope for a U-turn in recovery- and hospital equipment and resources should not be wasted in such useless efforts ?</span></p>
              <p>I do not deny that such advice are "cold-blooded", but I am seeing is that when the dog barks, many would go down on their hands and legs to bark back. And even a dog would not bark at a dying dog, oh, I forgot, dogs are not cold blooded.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dogs are not cold blooded? You specifically referring to P4P dogs? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> As humans we give credit when credit is due, we give compassion when compassion is due. Do we need show compassion to Satan and his dominion? Like I said before, we are commoners here, not saints, let god show them the compassion that they desire.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mrs Lee may not be in politics, do you think that any of the government policies proposed in public by LKY did not involved Mrs Lee, or received her contribution ?</span></p>
              <p>There were many tyrants, dictators and despots in the history of mankind all over the world, but none of their wives ever had to account for what their husbands did. Neither did the wife or mistresses of Hitler, the Japanese war criminals, ...were ever even put on trial for what their husband did. Unless, there are people who hide under their bed and heard something we don't. Its scary that one who curse for something he think....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes, the policies imposed would definitely have involved some form of discussion between LKY and his wife, afterall his wife is also a lawyer. What makes you think that there are no discussions in the closed doors of the Lee family? You are so naive! Like I used in another previous example, if Mrs. Lee knows of the deeds that LKY committed, imprisoning his political prisoners for decades, bankrupting his political opponents therefore destroying the lives of whole families, torturing political prisoners in ISD. What innocent and compassionate person who stand by while evil is being committed? Therefore she is not an innocent party. She benefited from the status by acquring large amounts of fortunes. If she was an innocent party, she would have long divorce the old man and not benefited from his status.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How certain are you that LKY's family does not influence his politics ?</span></p>
              <p>My common sense tells me that it is difficult for any family member to influence any old man who is used to power. I don't even think LKY would talk politics over dinner. I am not certain, and I don't care. You must be so certain that you curse.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Are you 100% sure? You have dinner with the Lees every night? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> You sleep on the same bed with Mr and Mrs. Lee? It's not uncommon for husbands and wives to discuss issues about friends, work, etc in the bedroom. If you don't sleep together with them or dine with them. How can you be 100% sure? It's only guesses, guesses are subjected to errors from emotions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Two wrongs do not make anyone Right.</span></p>
              <p>You are absolutely right. Tell this to M13.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Two wrongs definitely don't make a right, but two deaths will certainly make it all right.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Have you not followed the link posted by another forumer, in that poll about 90% of participants wanted to see Mrs. LKY dead. I think we should go with popular opinion.</span></p>

              <p>I read about her demise.   I checked CNA for verification but nothing at all.   Majority of the people hate the lees so much.   People even talk about how to celebrate when lky dies.     NObody in his right mind will believe that it is by chance that the sons and daughter in law are holding high positions in PAP's controlled organisations.</p>
              <p>If a PM can talk against prolonging life and yet he supports prolonging life, can we trust and rely on this PM?   He is slapping himself on the cheek.  In fact, this is just one good example of him practising double standard.    If anyone can ruin Singapore, it gotta be lky's beloved son LHL.    It is a disgrace for singaporeans to have such an idiotic, incompetent, arrogant PM.</p>
