              <p><br>Actually you can't really blame them, folks these days need to work long hours to bring in the bacon. They have so little left after GST, Taxes, Electricity, ERP, Petrol, Housing and Medical. Where do they find time to socialise? In Singapore, it's work work work and more work, they do their best to keep the folks working so that they don't have time to think and criticize the government's policy.</p>

              <p>I stay in Serangoon so most of the time my family use TTSH. Very crowded and I always seek second opinion when it comes to illness requiring operation. Don't know much about SGH. Too far.</p>

              <p>Your way of hiding or accepting reality is to twist others views into questions, and thereby insulating yourself from blame in the event you are proven wrong and blame the other for assuming. You would even twist others opinions whom you agree into creating the belief that it originally came from you. Thus, you are nothing more than a sicko and a waste of time for me, a deadweight i have to bear as long as you hold our citizenship ( which i hope you dont).</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Could it be that your dishonest, hollow and flippant views have exposed the weaker side of yourself in your inability to hold your position in any possible ways except to be debunked ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The facts of my response to your previous reply have been posted according to your own admission that you are capable of only 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration - how have I so cleverly twist that clear facts into exposing your weaknesses ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Could it be that you are basically what you claim you are - that you are truly an uninspiring person - with only 1% inspiration, and hopelessly perspire 99% of your time heading in some clueless direction ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For one who claims to see no point in rebutting my points - it is not so amazing to see your juvenile efforts with 99% perspiration in repeating your mischevious mis-quoting of my post in other thread to suit your characteristic unispired and unimaginative way of rebuttals.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Are you certain that your parents could not afford SIT flats back in those days, when those flats were heavily subsidised by the </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning_in_Singapore"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Times New Roman;">‘Singapore Improvement Trust {SIT}’</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> that was set up by the Colonial Government to address the housing issues ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Was it not a fact that many Singaporeans prefer to live in landed property - even in the rural farms - then living in high rise apartments, even when the high rise was no more then 3 or 4 storeys high ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Who are you kidding as a juvenile 'deerHunter' to claim that your parents had lived during the days when S.I.T flats were built and offered to Colonial residents living in Singapore - and not even called Singaporeans then ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If your parents had lived during those S.I.T days then you must be now between 20 to 30 years of age, or at worst in the late 40s - depending when they decide to belatedly create an individual that is capable of only 1% inspiration ? It seems that the 99% perspiration of your parent to create you has been done with little inspiration too ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Surely your audience is being abused by the 99% perspiration of a juvenile that has only 1% inspiration for anything ?</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">For one who claims 99% perspiration, and only 1% inspiration, it has clearly shown your uninspiring efforts to attract the Elites can only fail - which explains for your continued useless efforts at pandering and propagating the sycophantic lines of the Ruling Elites.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Is it any wonder that you have no original ideas of your own to be claimed - when all you have is only a 1% inspiration ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Can you even hope to know how those who lived happily for generations in kampungs would want ot continue to live in the rural areas of Tampinese, Nee Soon, Chong Pang, Sembawang, Seletar, Punggol, Changi, Geylang, Bedok, Pasir Panjang, Bukit Panjang, Lim Chu Kang, Chua Chu Kang, and the outlying islands ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If not for the resettlement schemes, and the mass eviction of the rural folks, to build the new townships of Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio, Yishun, Bedok - these people would have happily continued to live a life of initiative and self-reliance - with such low Cost of Living.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Compared to living in the HDB flats, where everything needed has to be purchased, and has resulted in a new resettled population being made dependent on the services of the Government - paying for every big and small necessities in life.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Fortunately, the rudimentary living standards of kampung life had steeled several generations of Singaporeans to be community leaders, whom the Ruling Party tapped and used for their own political agenda, until another generation grew up living in the middle class districts of Serangoon Gardens, Seletar Hills, Sixth Avenues, Holland Close, Tiong Bahru, and Orchard Road.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Are you simply speculating with your claim that the Ruling Elites had their origins in kampungs - whatever their ethnic backgrounds ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is obvious that the 'deerHunter' is drunk from his salivating on the lollipop sweetness in propagating the 99% inspirational dreams of the Ruling Party - which he is incapable of performing - and is using his 99% perspiration in convincing his imaginery audience to his bastardised version of the original message from his Master.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Tell the graduating Class of 2006 onwards - that they can buy a private property by studing more - and work harder - and you will see how much more perspiration you will have to put up with in getting their answers.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">How can you understand the middle class squeeze when you were decidely from the kampungs and with parents who could not even afford the heavily subsidised flats built by the Colonial S.I.T ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Are you expecting Singaporeans to tell their kids that PAPa cannot help any more, we have to use the funds for their school ECA to feed them, or else they will have to eat porridge and ikan belis everyday ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Even monkeys have bananas, can Singaporeans afford the expensive bananas that have to be imported with the high fuel prices, and high property development costs that add up to the price of bananas sold in the super-markets ?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If you are truly of the generation from the S.I.T era in the 1950s, and have failed despite your 99% perspiration - how can you advise anyone with your 1% inspirational abilities ?</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can we expect any further iota of honest response from a juvenile 'deerHunter' who has been debunked time and time again, and the only defense you can return with is to claim that your post has been subjected to slanderous twisting and insulting views ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Could it be that your dishonest, hollow and flippant views have exposed the weaker side of yourself in your inability to hold your position in any possible ways except to be debunked ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The facts of my response to your previous reply have been posted according to your own admission that you are capable of only 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration - how have I so cleverly twist that clear facts into exposing your weaknesses ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Could it be that you are basically what you claim you are - that you are truly an uninspiring person - with only 1% inspiration, and hopelessly perspire 99% of your time heading in some clueless direction ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For one who claims to see no point in rebutting my points - it is not so amazing to see your juvenile efforts with 99% perspiration in repeating your mischevious mis-quoting of my post in other thread to suit your characteristic unispired and unimaginative way of rebuttals.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: ;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Your inability to come up with any new ways to rebutt my replies is understandable, given your admitted abilities of only 1% inspiration; and for your constant efforts with 99% perspiration to make some clueless response.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: ;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Having spent 99% perspiration in re-editing my last reply to you - are you certain that you cannot rise above your 1% inspiration to give some reply to regain your credibility to give advise to others ?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: ;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even without any 1% inspiration, have you so easily given up your credibility by not putting some of your 99% perspiration to redeem your self-worth ?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: ;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not concerned that your vanity will by punctured when your wider audience will see only the pathetic side of a twisted and dishonest 'deerHunter' - when you spent 99% perspiration to edit out your own passages that were broken up to receive my point-by-point rebuttal of your crap.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Living in a $27 garbage bin, it is obvious that the 'deerHunter' will have liitle choice but to say - "<em>I don't mind a cleaner as a wife...</em>" </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Unfortunately, with his declaration of being dependent on only "<em>1% inspiration</em>" in everything that he does, it is doubtful if he can get his "<em>99% perspiration</em>" to work.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He may just as well be left sniffing to figure forever if any women is of any good, or can ever be a good companion in his life in a $27 garbage bin. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is boy-boy 'deerHunter' no longer infatuated with his "Aunty" - and prefer to spend his time with Gazelle the sniffer - to share his no-more secret fantasies ?</span></p>

              <p>Agree.   These days there are more to take care of and the constant rising costs can add stress to life.    Back in the kampong days life was much simpler.    It would help a lot if we have a govt who implement good, applicable policies to make life better.  Unfortunately  .   .   .   .   .   .</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">well crafted, full of sentimental alludes but insincere at best.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">the `nobody owes you a living' mantra applies to everyone, everywhere, not just singapore. for a country that made that leap from a swampy backwater small island to a so-called first world country; singapore is still a juvenile society, its maturity stumped no less by the so-called `master' you so worshipped so unconditionally.</span></p>
              <p>Correction for you:-</p>
              <p>1.) Insincere - only to you and your biased belief system</p>
              <p>2.)Maturity stumped, only due to time, and not anyone. It was already a miracle that by the 1980s, we made that jump, all due to good governorship of Singapore, led by a strongman MM Lee and the hardwork of our previous generation, who believe in action than mere talk of 'freedom of speech' mouthed by the spoilt and self centred bourgeois elements of that earlier society. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">you are a child that's grown up to be a young adult, capable of knowing what's right and wrong. yet your guardian insists on baby-sitting you and watching every step of the way with strong punitive measures if you step out of line, in accordance to their uniquely singapore rule of law.</span></p>
              <p>Correction:- There are even 70s year old who breaks the law of our society. Being adult does not mean you will not commit wrongs. Thus laws are there as a guide for everyone to know and be ensured where the line is. And our laws are not oppressive in anyway, only there to ensure our uniquely multicultural society may live in peace with one another.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">the politics of fear that is employed today to great advantage by the ruling party is a great disservice to the country. it is as if only they have singapore interest at heart and the rest of us who do not agree with them are out to destroy the country. what an insult to singapore.</span></p>
              <p>Correction:- What 'politics of fear' are you alluding? You certainly had not shown any fear voicing your opinions here. And there are even opposition MPs in parliament. Thus, your logic on 'Politics of fear' holds no water, but only an insidious lie to stir resentment on the uninformed. We always had freedom of speech but NOT freedom to slander. No sane person would want to be slandered against by unsubstantiated allegations, not even the common man. And that is a graver insult by far  </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">you may wish to be continue to be treated like a kid, but don't drag the rest of us down your path. you have been brainwashed and you are brain dead.</span></p>
              <p>Correction:- You are the one who is behaving like a kid here, stubbornly rejecting truths and reality, and not only brainwashing yourself that our society is out to 'harm' you, you are even attempting to brainwash others by using the term  'rest of us'.</p>
              <p>For you and your kind's sake, do grow up. It's already tough to provide for you brain dead kids without your kind making it difficult for society to help you lot realistically and pragmatically.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For the only one who prefer to buy a $27 garbage bin and prefer a "<em>cleaner for a wife</em>" - then an "Aunty" whom you can learn from - it certainly shows your 1% inspiration is not even for learning.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can you even hope to make it on 99% perspiration with a "<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>cleaner for a wife</em></span>" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With the 99% perspiration producing garbage, it will not be long if the "<em>cleaner will not want to be your wife</em>".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did your 99% perspiration knocked your memory to forget your 1% inspired advice not to make any effort to respond to my points ?</span></p>

              <p><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">For once, the tripwire has made a mature, sound and solid observation and given a 'dearHunter' good advice - "<em>that there are many people like that one.... </em><em>due to different background, information and experience</em></span><span style="color: #0000ff;">"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Should you not also continue to keep an open mind and search the open archives for the restricted information of Singapore's past - some of which remain inaccessible in Singapore ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is interesting to note your fear of the unknown, lacking in your own confidence how to deal with the "new" information exposed by others, and falling back into your own seemingly secure and limited environment - preferring to remain stunted in growth rather then seek a new path out of your own morass.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There are many others who have given the better part of their lives for Singapore, not to see an Autocratic System destroy the legacy and public institutions simply to promote his own political agenda and perpetuate his style of politics at the expense of Singaporean's interest.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>'Rabid virus'</em> ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you even know what that is before you use it so lightly in tainting the principles and legacies of others who are more honorable in their politics ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For one who accepts the belief that there others with different backgrounds and experiences - that far exceed yours - it is disappointing that you fail yourself after making a promissing start with your reply.</span></p>
