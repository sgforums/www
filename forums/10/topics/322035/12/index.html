              <p><br> There will always be lies and half truths. Some will not tell you
              everything to hide their despicable agendas to slander against
              someone.</p>
              <p>PM Lee's stint with the army started in 1971 when he was awarded
              the SAF scholarship ( BASED ON MERIT). In 1974, he was assigned to
              an artillery division after OCS. In 1980, he was made the CO of the
              Artillery Gun Battalion, and subsequently, promoted to assistand
              chief of General Staff ( operations) in 1981, then Chief of Staff
              in 1982, to director, JOPD with the rank of BG in 1983. He was
              PUBLICLY COMMENDED for his role in coordinating the Sentosa cable
              car rescue ops in 1982. He was also credited for 2 achievements
              within SAF - unification of SAF's 3 services and modernization of
              its weaponry. He resigned from SAF by 1984, so that he could serve
              the nation better in better administration, with the skills and
              opportunities learnt in organisation and modernisation of our arm
              forces, respected by many in the world.</p>
              <p>Therefore, PM Lee is not a lightweight. He has the brains and
              capability to take our nation far, furthermore groom by our
              founding fathers for the job. Can any in the opposition measure up
              to him? None. Enough said.</p>

              <p><br>He was a top student at Catholic High School, bilingual in English and Mandarin, as well as Malay and Russian. His pre-U was at NJC and in 1970, awarded the President's Scholarship as well as the SAF scholarship in 1971 for Cambridge to study mathematics. In 1974, he grad with 1st class honors in maths and a diploma in comp science with distinction there.</p>
              <p>In 1978, he attended the prestigious US Army Command and Staff College and a year later at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard Uni, he received a Master of Public Admin degree in 1980.</p>
              <p>This is not an ordinary man. He was one groomed to help and guide our People to greatness. He could have lived the life of a priviledged son, but yet he was committed to the People of Spore. Even when strickened with cancer, he could have gave up, but he never did. He fought long and hard, so that he could share his talent and knowledge to uplift our lives, and had done so during his service to the nation in public admin.</p>
              <p>Despite attempts to smear him, he never gave up his service to the others who didnt. If you have a conscience, calm down and think if you alone could have led our People to greatness and not down the path like our neighbours.</p>

              <p><br>It's ok if you don't believe. No one will expect you to, unless you reconcile yourself to facts. First of all, are you one of the poor? If you are, then are you handicapped or incapable of work? If you are, then do go to our CDC centres for help. Our society don't have much money to spare without bankrupting our future, but we will do all we can to help, even give you money to take bus for job appointments. I know it may not be a job you like, but at the present circumstances, stick to it first. At least it will guarantee you wont go hungry. Later on, when times are better, you will get promoted. At the same time, if you can, do attempt to upgrade your skills so that your abilities will match up with a better job.</p>
              <p>However, if you are not poor, but just despicably using the poor to stir up resentment, i would suggest you study what our govt had done to help those who are willing to help themselves. Those who don't and insist on whining, they will have to rot, for our society can only help within our ability if they want help.</p>

              <p><br> He was a top student at Catholic High School, bilingual in English
              and Mandarin, as well as Malay and Russian. His pre-U was at NJC
              and in 1970, awarded the President's Scholarship as well as the SAF
              scholarship in 1971 for Cambridge to study mathematics. In 1974, he
              grad with 1st class honors in maths and a diploma in comp science
              with distinction there.</p>
              <p>In 1978, he attended the prestigious US Army Command and Staff
              College and a year later at the Kennedy School of Government at
              Harvard Uni, he received a Master of Public Admin degree in
              1980.</p>
              <p>This is not an ordinary man. He was one groomed to help and
              guide our People to greatness. He could have lived the life of a
              priviledged son, but yet he was committed to the People of Spore.
              Even when strickened with cancer, he could have gave up, but he
              never did. He fought long and hard, so that he could share his
              talent and knowledge to uplift our lives, and had done so during
              his service to the nation in public admin.</p>
              <p>Despite attempts to smear him, he never gave up his service to
              the others who didnt. If you have a conscience, calm down and think
              if you alone could have led our People to greatness and not
              down the path like our neighbours.</p>
