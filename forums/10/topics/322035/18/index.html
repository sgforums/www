              <p>my dad appear on the national TV (the stroke uncle crying in TV seekign help) asking them for help cause i was the only 1 in the house (income $1400 Gross income with take back $1100 )im trying very hard to mantain this family to survior onwith wat i have, well they take my dad particulat down and 3 month later some1 from the GRC call us ask us how we getting on and that the last we ever hear from them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if u reliase many poor have already given up on the goverment cause in national TV they wouldsay " we care" 'we love" but behind the meaning its always mean  "we care about the $$$ in our own pockets" " we love our $$$ in our own pockets" the goverment never help us in anything when we seek their help</p>
              <p>the only few that help my family are</p>
              <p>1 Jin An Chun - they would sent us some vegitable every monday (my dad when to them to seek help) they sent some1 to check on us</p>

              <p>Nohole bitch, can you please make some sense please? I
              plead you, you are losing your rationality with that post. Do a
              re-write first, then i can thrash your nonsense properly, otherwise
              i would be blamed for taking on a village idiot that you really
              are.</p>

              <p>Some of the PR just want to use Spore as a stepping stone to other countries. Some refused to let their son served full time NS n sad to say they are also paying \</p>
              <p>same schooll fees as the local. There were also 150000 locals in other countries. MM Lee is quite worried that they might not come back.</p>

              <p>Some perhaps, but we cannot afford to generalize and say ALL of them, right?</p>

              <p>Some of those citizens might not come back. It is their loss as well as us, from a citizen's point of view. But they do have their freedom of choice, which we as a society will not force them.</p>
              <p>We can only try our best to make our country better, within our abilities to overcome our limitations of size and economy, not by strife and civil unrests, lies and half truths some spout of the like here, but through genuine care, concern and participation by citizens so that none will be left behind.</p>
              <p>Easier said than done i know, but if we can build spore to what it is today, so too can we build our tomorrows. But we need co-operation, not divisions, within our country and well led by our political representatives, no matter what group so long as capable. </p>
