            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...<br><br>i hv been away for a year.... came back recently for chinese new year... but i m still not sure what i would like to do in the future.... whether to come back to singapore or to continue staying in UK till my visa runs out..... i have always considered myself a 'heartlander'... true blue chinese singaporean..... very 'channel 8', speak singlish, play mahjong, makan at kopitiam or hawker centre, go si bei lor pray pray at times during the chinese new year....<br><br>living in UK for a year has it pros and cons..... i realised how narrow-minded we have always been (wah lao! south africa is not a very poor state which consists of only black people!!)... how we have always been taking things for granted (do u know the name and dosage of any medication that your doctor gives u?? ha... in UK, b'cos the doctors are not so efficient, everyone will know and find out about the medication that their doctors prescribed!!... have we always been accepting things as they have been told!!??).... i cycle to work in UK (transport too ex in UK!!) but have never been honked by UK drivers... but here, just went cycling in west coast and genna honked by singapore drivers on my way from clementi to west coast park!!! piang.... so sad....<br><br>that's not all... there are just too many things that make me think... i agree that we should not have a welfare state (people DO abuse the system there), but i also agree on the statement once made, 'in singapore, can die but cannot fall sick....' have we done enough for the less fortunate? is it their fault that they are not able to make ends meet or that their situation does not allow them AT ALL to make ends meet?<br><br>no.... i am not saying that the grass is greener in UK.... there are a lot of inefficiencies, stupid strikes, unreasonable prices/taxes and high crime rates there.... on the other hand, there are also more polite people there (they DO say thank you to the bus drivers there), more family-oriented working culture (always been 5 working days, 36 hrs per week and i knock off zun zun at 5pm.... just like all my other colleagues) and of cos better recognition of my profession there......<br><br>since my return to singapore, many have asked me whether i will be coming back to singapore.... i really dunno.... i am really taking one step at a time now and just see how things go.... i guess whatever will b, will b.......<br><br>what say u?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since you're still considering, you're probably quite aware of the pros and cons of either scenarios e.g.while EU may offer you the kicks and opportunities, Singapore may offer you the stability etc etc..<br><br>In any case, since you've only been there for a year, make full use of it by learning as much as possible. Get the exposure and experience you need to help you make a more informed choice down the road. Your view may very well change in a couple of years or so....<br><br>Most importantly, enjoy your time there.<br><br></div>
