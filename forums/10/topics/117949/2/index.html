So, stay there if you feel comfortable. Live it for a few years. Then decide what is the life you want. There is a lot of non-political, non-economical consideration when it comes to migration.

There are pros and cons in every country and every society. We learn to adapt, or we choose where we want to go. We decide, not the society nor the government.<br><br>I stayed 4 yrs in HK and 3 yrs in Shanghai as expat, wow, I had lots of fun. But, I was very miserable, especially during weekend, when I spent three months in Germany, with everything paid for by the company, because I had only a few friends. But I still prefer Singapore because of my children's education and my wife is gainfully employed here. So, it is not about government or social engineering, it is where you can make money and where you have friends, the choice is yours. You don't go anywhere because you like the government!!</div>

YOU WILL GET USED TO IT PRONTO.<br><br>living in UK for a year has it pros and cons..... i realised how narrow-minded we have always been (wah lao! south africa is not a very poor state which consists of only black people!!)... how we have always been taking things for granted (do u know the name and dosage of any medication that your doctor gives u?? ha... in UK, b'cos the doctors are not so efficient, everyone will know and find out about the medication that their doctors prescribed!!... have we always been accepting things as they have been told!!??).... i cycle to work in UK (transport too ex in UK!!) but have never been honked by UK drivers... but here, just went cycling in west coast and genna honked by singapore drivers on my way from clementi to west coast park!!! piang.... so sad....<br><br>NOW YOU KNOW...BEEN BACK FOR 7 DAYS IN SINGAPORE AND COULDNT WAIT TO GET BACK BECAUSE MY MIND JUST STARTED TO SHIFT TO 3RD...2ND AND 1ST GEAR. I ATTRIBUTE IT TO THE HOT WEATHER AND THE ULTRA STATE OF STABILITY OF SINGAPORE. NO EXCITEMENT AND RISK, SO NO NEED TO BE ALERT 24/7.<br><br>that's not all... there are just too many things that make me think... i agree that we should not have a welfare state (people DO abuse the system there), but i also agree on the statement once made, 'in singapore, can die but cannot fall sick....' have we done enough for the less fortunate? is it their fault that they are not able to make ends meet or that their situation does not allow them AT ALL to make ends meet?<br><br>no.... i am not saying that the grass is greener in UK.... there are a lot of inefficiencies, stupid strikes, unreasonable prices/taxes and high crime rates there.... on the other hand, there are also more polite people there (they DO say thank you to the bus drivers there), more family-oriented working culture (always been 5 working days, 36 hrs per week and i knock off zun zun at 5pm.... just like all my other colleagues) and of cos better recognition of my profession there......<br><br>since my return to singapore, many have asked me whether i will be coming back to singapore.... i really dunno.... i am really taking one step at a time now and just see how things go.... i guess whatever will b, will b.......<br><br>what say u?</div></blockquote></div>

In this regard, I rate the PAP very poorly. I'm sorry but I will not be patriotic when it comes to this.<br><br>When I think of my future and my own personal future family, I don't think abt patriotism. I think about the happiness of my family, how well balanced the financial aspects, how is the future education policies are, the children's social lives and their stress levels are etc. I wouldn't subject my family to the PAP social engineering policies and the outdated social rules imposed by the conservative members of the S'pore society in general.<br><br>The S'pore society is flawed- and while all other societies are also flawed- Singapore society is very much more flawed than the majority of the rest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You'll know when the time comes.  Though I was born in Singapore, I am now a citizen of another country.  The decision was a very natural one.  I lived overseas for about 9 years and then went back to Singapore to try to see if I could adapt to the weather, culture and lifestyle again.  I was miserable everyday for about 8 months.  Should have given myself more time to adapt, but I would have killed myself by then.  Anyway, the decision to leave Singapore permanently then came naturally.  You don't have to think about that now.</div>
