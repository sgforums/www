Sounds like Hawaii? Haha<br><br>U see, Gohkatkat, u have ur personal experience here. I'm really sorry to hear of it. U probably will think twice or even thrice abt migration again. As the saying goes, "Once bitten, twice shy"<br><br>Is ur judegment of migration then also clouded by this personal experience?<br><br>There are places where u migrate, u face discrimination. There are also places where u mingle well. Sometimes when discrimination is deep rooted in a particular country, it can't be helped even if u "do as the Romans do". But there also places where ur integration depends on one's personal character, isn't it? Subjective</div>
