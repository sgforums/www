No ? So lets get started shall we.<br><br><blockquote>There will be obviously more demand for cars than the quota set by Gov, and they will end up giving the cars with the highest bidder again. <strong>If Gov decide to release 500 cars tis month but 50000 cars r being bidded, how is gov going to decide who get who win the bid</strong>, other than who bid a higher price again ? </blockquote>First from the paragraph, MY QUESTION IS HOW DO U DO YOUR SELECTION IF THERE WAS OVERBIDDING AT GOV SIDE.<br><br>Wat is your reply then ?<br><br>What is the objective of DEMAND side quota (COE), or SUPPLY side quota ?<br><br><blockquote>If 5000 vehicles can only benefit 5000 BUYERS only, does it really matter if this 5000 vehicles (divided into whatever smaller lots) benefit whatever numbers of dealership ?<br><br>Someone has to loose out on the opportunity to buy a car, so does it matter if some dealership sell more, or sell nothing at all ?<br><br>If fairness is to be done, then divide into smaller quota lots of 25 or 50 vehicles per quota permit, so as to allow more dealership to have its share. </blockquote>NOW, has it answer MY QUESTION ?

Is there any method of SELECTION from the reply ?<br><br>From your reply above, I get the picture "any dealer can get the COE, it doesn't matter". Well, it matters to me, HOW R U GOING TO SELECT THEM ? It is important to tell specifically how u going to select.  U break up into 25 and 50, THEN WAT ? Use ballot box or wat ?

Here is an illustration : If the dealer used to sell 5000 cars tis month, while on average he only get 800 COE, tat means every month there will have 4200 people tat cannot get the cars. If u cannot get your car tis month from him, the odds is tat u will have to wait VERY VERY VERY long, maybe YEARS to get the car. Isn't tat forcing them to buy other cars ? Tis is especially so if u had used the overcharging policy. </blockquote>If u think u can wait for a few years then please carry on.<br><br><blockquote>Are you aware that during this OCTOBER 2003, the present COE system has resulted in the LOWEST COE PRICES over the last ten years; and yet NOT all the AVAILABLE COE are taken up by Buyers.<br><br>In simple English, during OCTOBER 2003, there is a SURPLUS of COE Certificates even when COE Prices is at the LOWEST LEVELS for the last TEN YEARS. </blockquote>Again I have answered tis reply too. 15th Oct 0146<br><br><blockquote>I got to pose tis question, not all the AVAILABLE COE are taken up by buyers, <strong>isn't it because of the high cost of present COE</strong> tat contribute to tis phenomenon ? If it is lesser than the quota, than it just shows <strong>the effectiveness of the present COE</strong>. If there is no COE, the price will definitely climb down a LOT. Simple economy, if price go down, demand will rise</blockquote>And again 15th Oct 0711<br><br><blockquote>First, I will talk about the buyer side first. If Atobe supply side idea worked, then the price of COE will goes down, since tat is the main objective of supply idea. The overall price for owning a car will goes down, there will be an increase in numbers of buyers for a car. (Simple economy theory : Lower price, higher demand) Atobe attempt to show the Oct statistic tat the actual demand for car in Singapore is low, however <strong>tat is mainly because of the present COE system which forced the car price up, lowering the actual demand. </strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">I believe it is general knowledge tat there r a lot of people who wanted to have their own car but cannot afford it in Singapore. For everyone who actually owned a car in Singapore now, one can easily find 3 others who desired a car yet cannot afford it. </span></blockquote>U think is fair to give figures after the effective cutting off of demand from the PRESENT COE ? U got any friends tat WANT to have a car but CAN'T afford to buy it ? Or r u going back to your <strong>old slime </strong>tactics and totally ignore the replies I had given u ?<br><br><blockquote>Are ownership of COE transferable ? Can one actually bid for a COE and resell it at a higher price ? </blockquote>The present system, nope. COE is not transferable. However after the implementation of your STUPID idea, it <strong>has</strong> to be. It has to be in the name of the dealer first before he can sell it back to the buyer. Then isn't COE transferable or wat ??<br><br>Now let me give u a challenge, go back and read the post on 15th Oct 0711. Lets see wat great answer our 'Mighty Atobe' is going to be. Opps, another mistake written again ! I guess Atobe is gonna mentioned he is Mighty everytime he write down his name from now on. Tat will be revolting isn't it ?<br><br></div>

THE METHOD of SELECTION, NOT THE END EFFECT !<br><br><blockquote>12th Oct 0812<br><br>Wat I am asking is if there is an over demand from GOV side, then wat is your selection proces !!</blockquote><blockquote>How does a dealership SELLS 5000 Cars THIS MONTH when he is getting an AVERAGE of only 800 COE per month ? </blockquote>AT PRESENT, the dealer do not have to care about bidding for COE. The BUYER bid themselves. After the buyer had the COE, they can choose which car to buy, thus for tis Dealer, 5000 customers will approach him every month IF the present COE is continued. However after YOUR model set in, the DEALER has to bid for the COE themselves. If there is OVERBIDDING from Gov side, he cannot get ALL the cars he needed per month. If every month he BID for 5000, or 50000 cars, yet manage to get only 800, then won't it be a dynamic FIGURE in terms of RATE. Every month only 16% of the interested buyers tat month get to have the car. Tis does not include the INTERESTED BUT FAILED TO GET the CAR buyers from the previous months. Doesn't tat means the buyer has to WAIT for a long time ? Isn't tat forcing them to buy cars from OTHER make and model ? Is tis more clearer to u now ?<br><br>I use another method to explain. A Dealer manage to capture 10% of market share. Tat mean if 100 buyers want to buy a car, 10 will choose him. <strong>Presently</strong>, whoever get to have the COE doesn't matter to the dealer. If Gov released 5000 COEs tat month, tat just means 500 of them will buy his car. However <strong>after your MODEL </strong>is implemented, the number of cars he can sell depends GREATLY on the number of COEs he managed to successfully bid. IF no matter how hard he tries, he manage to get only 6% of the totalled released COEs, then won't it affect his business a lot by 40% ? Won't tat be a dynamic figure for the peopel tat want to buy its car ?<br><br>You are brilliantly testing my patience to exasperation.<br><br><blockquote>Are you then contradicting yourself by ignoring the fact that PRICES of Vehicles have dropped to a ten year low by saying that the Present COE system forced the car price up and has LOWERED actual Demand ? </blockquote>Tat is because of economy NOW. Prices r dropping at a 10 year low, however remember ECONOMY is also dropping to a 10 year low. Since people r getting poorer, the EFFECTIVENESS of the present COE using dynamic market equilibrium make it such tat the prices for COE also go down too. If the COE remains stubbornly at 10 years ago rate, then IT FAILS to be effective.<br><br>It is using PRICE to balance supply and demand. If people cannot afford cars now, COE will itself GOES DOWN to again control the number for supply and demand. In short, no matter wat economy status we in, COE will set itself to the appropriate price level to regulate supply and demand.<br><br><blockquote>If COE system has forced car price up and lowered actual demand, then why do you oppose the idea of a SUPPLY SIDE Quota Control System - which comes at a lower price (your supposed CHEAPER COE) that should be a welcome relief ? </blockquote>I have no problem with tat, provided it WORKS. Has u proven tat it works to me ? No ! U haven't give an appropriate method of solving overbidding from DEALER to Gov side in your MODEL. (cheez.. tat is a lot to write to make it politically correct)<br><br><blockquote><br>My friends are more practical then to indulge in desiring a car that they CAN'T afford - so what is the point of even asking ? </blockquote>Why don't we have a vote then ? I will start a thread in the Car category at sgforums, and see wat is their response. The question will goes<br><br>" If COE drops to $5000, while all other factors remain the same, will u buy a car ?"<br><br>Wat do u think the response will be like ?<br><br><blockquote>To update you with a little information from the Real World Order, even in the Present COE system, the Dealer is allowed to bid for COE on behalf of Buyers, as well as submit bids for COE to be issued with a status of <strong>temporary COE for the sale of dealer's own stock of vehicles that has NO PRESENT BUYERS</strong>. </blockquote>Tat is good, it shows tat some stocks r being held by Dealers every month to facilitate sales. I guess u will say I am as slippery as a snake for using your quotes to attack u again.<br><br>I got to ask u tis again. It is in my response 15 October 2003 Â· 07:11 PM<br><br><strong><blockquote>He(Dealer) can easily eliminate the cash flow problem by loans from bank, whose fees will be passed on to the buyers. The bank will act as a buffer, paying the COE fees first while waiting for the dealer to collect it back from the buyers. In the end, the dealer may act as just a middleman, one tat never even need to pay a single cent out from his pockets. Loans will even be made easier if the owners chose advance booking, since the contracts that they will signed with the dealer will add as a safe guard for the bank. </blockquote></strong><br><br>Then I got to ask u, if dealer used the method, <strong>wat difference does your model make ? </strong> Please try not to act as a slimy slug and refuse to answer tis question.<br><br>Also since I have answered your 4 questions, maybe u can come up with a method to do DEALERS OVERBIDDING the GOV's set QUOTA. I do not wat the end effect, I WANT THE ACTUAL SELECTION method.<br><br>I have said wat should be said in this reply. Lets see your next response.</div>

The COE is a quota system by itself, by limiting the MONTHLY Quantity of Vehicles allowed to be sold Per Month. (It is NOT a Tax System - and is unfortunately not a fair way as what you think).<br><br>2. Anyone is allowed to submit a bid for a COE and there is NO AGE LIMIT, EXCEPT that the insurance certificate must cover the successful bidder who is the certified driver and owner of the vehicle.<br><br>3. The COE price is NOT determined by the TOP VALUES of ALL COE received, but taken from the LOWEST VALUE of the last REJECTED BID PRICE - (which LTA termed as "Reserve Price" ) .<br><br>4. COE is awarded by a complex system of accepting the APPLICANTS submitting the TOP VALUES, but they need to PAY ONLY the price of the LAST REJECTED BID PRICE.<br><br>For example, if there are only 5000 COE available for this month:<br><br>First group of 3000 Persons (Buyers or Dealers) submit bids of $10,000<br>Second group of 2000 Persons submit bids of $11,000<br>Third group of 1000 Persons submit bids of $12,000<br>Fourth group of 1000 Persons submit bids of $15,000<br>Fifth group of 1000 Persons submit bids of $20,000<br>Sixth group of 1000 Persons submit bids of $50,000<br>Seventh Group of 1000 Persons submit bids of $60,000<br><br>The 5000 applicants submitting the TOP VALUES will be awarded, and those people from the Third Group to the Seventh Group - each of 1000 persons will be the successful winner.<br><br>However, they DO NOT PAY the values of what they have submitted, as the COE Price is determined at the LAST UNSUCCESSFUL BID PRICE - which is the value submitted by the SECOND Group at $12,000.<br><br>LTA will charge $12,000 PLUS $1.00 - (GST to be separtely paid).<br><br>This is the mechanism in which COE determine who amongst a LARGE group of BUYERS will be awarded with a limited quantity of COE.<br><br><strong>Is this a fair system that allows the highest bidders to be awarded with the COE but based on the Lowest Price from the nearest Reserve or Bid Price ?</strong><br><br>In a SUPPLY SIDE Quota System, the same mechanics can be used, EXCEPT that -<br><br>(a) the bids will be made by DEALERS<br>(b) there will be a MINIMUM Bid Price fixed by LTA<br>(c) the bids will be for a group of allowed vehicles to be sold, but are divided into Quota Lots<br>(d) the Bid Price PER QUOTA Lot is determined from the average bid price determined at a Median from all the bidders<br><br>See the model which I had given in my post on Page 3 - 15 October 2003 - 01:44A.M.</span><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>Secondly, did you not complain that I did not answer your question, and now you are complaining that I answer your question with "an ANSWER (Dealer overbidding) for something else" ? </blockquote>I have written a short story on your method of ignoring the question.

Doesn't tat means the buyer has to WAIT for a long time ? Isn't tat forcing them to buy cars from OTHER make and model ? Is tis more clearer to u now ?<br><br>I use another method to explain. A Dealer manage to capture 10% of market share. Tat mean if 100 buyers want to buy a car, 10 will choose him. <strong>Presently</strong>, whoever get to have the COE doesn't matter to the dealer. If Gov released 5000 COEs tat month, tat just means 500 of them will buy his car. However <strong>after your MODEL </strong>is implemented, the number of cars he can sell depends GREATLY on the number of COEs he managed to successfully bid. IF no matter how hard he tries, he manage to get only 6% of the totalled released COEs, then won't it affect his business a lot by 40% ? Won't tat be a dynamic figure for the peopel tat want to buy its car ?<br><br>You are brilliantly testing my patience to exasperation.<br><br><blockquote>Are you then contradicting yourself by ignoring the fact that PRICES of Vehicles have dropped to a ten year low by saying that the Present COE system forced the car price up and has LOWERED actual Demand ? </blockquote>Tat is because of economy NOW. Prices r dropping at a 10 year low, however remember ECONOMY is also dropping to a 10 year low. Since people r getting poorer, the EFFECTIVENESS of the present COE using dynamic market equilibrium make it such tat the prices for COE also go down too. If the COE remains stubbornly at 10 years ago rate, then IT FAILS to be effective.<br><br>It is using PRICE to balance supply and demand. If people cannot afford cars now, COE will itself GOES DOWN to again control the number for supply and demand. In short, no matter wat economy status we in, COE will set itself to the appropriate price level to regulate supply and demand.

Do u not see road being made ? Do u not see police and army working in a efficient manner ? Do u not see tat Old Folks Home and Ophanage is HEAVILY subsidised ? If Gov do not have money, can he do all these ?<br><br><blockquote>Do seriously believe that cars can only benefit a fraction of the whole population of Singapore ?<br><br>How small is your "fraction of the whole population in Singapore ? </blockquote>Are u trying to tell me tat there r 4 millions singaporean in singapore, and singapore can allow ALL of them to have cars ? I do not know the exact figures, but the vehicles on the rd must certainly be below 1 million. Even for tis 1 million cars, we already used up 16% of land (16% land were used on residential too) for roads. 1 million cars is already causing Jams at the City almost everyday. WE CANNOT AFFORD EVERYONE TO HAVE CARS. Thus if u want  to force me to give the fraction, I can only give 10-20 percent of population get to have cars. I do not have the figures so tis is just guess on my part.<br><br><blockquote>With the Present COE system, in the manner that it is formed today, it will be quite unfair even to the rich, let alone the poor - see my posting on the present LTA vehicle COE bidding price. </blockquote>Wat is unfair ? They bid tat sum of money without anyone forcing them to. Please elaborate<br><br><blockquote><br>That is what you think the Government is doing, but is this based on another speculation and not from substance ? </blockquote>Wat do u think is wrong with tat statement ? If u wanna ask Gov direct, they will give u a more politically correct and lenghty explanation only. It is true I came up with the above conclusion, but so u see any flaws in it ?<br><br><blockquote>Are you not being quirky here ?<br><br>You talk about Gov taxing the rich by using the COE to spend on the Poor on the one hand, but you prefer that I "don't tell me more Gov expenditure facts tat u already said before". When did I speak about "Gov expenditures"; other then to rebutt your idea that COE is used to the road systems.<br><br>Interesting that you should declare that the Question in this discussion is whether it is an appropriate tax ?</blockquote>U already question on whether "old folks home" get any money isn't it ? I have said tis before<br><br>Gov will spend the same amount of money every year, whether COE was present or not. If u remove COE, then Gov will look into other way to get back tis offset. How do they do it ? They may raise property tax or raise GST, making living worse for everyone.<br><br>On touching COE, only a small fraction of the whole Singapore population get to have cars. We have to decide who get to own the car who can't. Gov method is to let the rich people get to be the ones having the convenience of the cars, but they must do it with a price. The price of COE and other road tax.<br><br>Hasn't tat been fair to both the rich and the poor, in the sense tat the Rich get to pay more Tax, while the Poor cannot have the luxury of the car. Let say considering only on tis aspect, do u think tis is fair ?<br><br><blockquote>It is easy to speak of someone but until you show how I have done anything that you have accused me of doing, the fact remains quite clear that you have been dishonest in the manner that you have selectively misquoted from my posts, for the simplistic objective of scoring points in an argument that you refused to conduct in a sensible manner. </blockquote>Tat is very interesting, please elaborate.<br><br><blockquote>Must I also help you to understand that you are fit only as a wharehouse supervisor, and not as a Financial Planner. Must I also make some marketing strategies and planning so as to help you live up to your credo too ? </blockquote>Tat is again very interesting. I have stated before<br><br>1. Can u 100% say tat ALL cars are sold by advance orders NOW, INCLUDING <strong>2nd Hand cars Dealers </strong>?<br><br>2. Do u not think tis is an added value if I can let u OWN the car the <strong>minute u want to buy it</strong> AND NOT having to wait for a full month ?<br><br><blockquote>But r u sure u will only bid for 323 exact, without leaving any extra COE to play with ? R u sure the whole of next month there won't be any buyer tat buy cars within a shorter time of thinking ? I can see the possibility of potential people just go over to a show room, test a car and decided to buy it straight. Since there r willing buyers willing to book for a month before getting the car, isn't it better to tell them tat they can drive away with the car they want without having to wait at all.Tis can only be achieved since the company has the extra COE with them. Won't an extra stock of COE help to facilitate such transaction and bring convenience to the buyers ? </blockquote>Clearly u consider yourself to be a fiancial whiz, but lack any clue on <strong>sales nor stock keeping</strong>. I guess u can just stick holding tat title if u like to belittle other while bloating up your face so much.<br><br></div>
