U again choose to ignore tat question as U HAVE NO GOOD ANSWER TO IT.  I will ignore other points till u come to senses and answer the question I wanted u to answer. Since u r so brain dead, I will use a more child like approach to explain the situation to u<br><br>Once upon a time, there was a small kingdom in the far east. The kingdom is small, as stated in the previous sentence, thus decided to employ SIngapore way of controlling cars, which is COE. The COE gradually rises to a very high level due to the high demand for cars in the kingdom.<br><br>Then came a stupid senseless consultant named Atobe and use the "supply" control method of controlling vehicles. The blur and good hearted king decide to use it, and "fine tune" its policy according to Atobe and inform all its citizen about the new changes.<br><br>The traffic advisor suggested to open up no more than 5000 COE tat month to establish normal growth, thus king decide to use 5000 as its quota for tat month.<br><br>The bidding day come after much anticipaton. To the king surprise, 50,000 bids came in for the 5000 slots available for tat month. The king now do not know [b]how to choose who is getting how much COE </strong>available, and he approach back Atobe for the solution.<br><br>Imagine u r tat Atobe, how r u going to advise the king on how to select which 5000 bids will get the COE ?  [/b]</blockquote>Having a very good day and a very good night of entertainment, I will try to humour you, to get the message through to a personality that believes in a "world of reverse order" by living in the practise of being " stupid-is-smart ".<br><br>Firstly, you are assuming that the King has to deal with 50,000 bids, which maybe true in your infatuation with the present COE system that was shown in your flow path:<br><br>Present system: Gov -&gt; Buyer<br><br>Secondly, if you are desperate to recover from your last posted embarrassing position, by telling the story of a "Once upon a time, there was a small kingdom.... " and include Atobe as a Consultant, who has promoted the idea of SUPPLY SIDE Quota Control, then at least be accurate by understanding the concept first.<br><br>Thirdly, do you not feel at all embarrass to tell a story of the SUPPLY SIDE Quota Control when you cannot even tell it accurately as already described by Atobe for the last 48 hours ?<br><br>Fourthly, I am not sure for your insistent hang-up that there will be a huge demand for vehicles, when there has been at least three COE exercises, in which there are LESS application then there are COE available. (In simple straight English, there are less buyers and more COE available, which resulted in the excess COE being carried over to the subsequent months).<br><br>Fifthly, if DEMAND exceed SUPPLY - meaning 50,000 buyers to only a small quota of 5,000 - is the "King" dead and cannot respond by increasing the Quota ? This has happened with the present COE system, in which the Government adjust the quantity of COE to meet rising demands.<br><br>Sixthly, figures are not just DEAD and FIXED.<br><br>Back to SUPPLY SIDE Quota Control - to answer your question of 50,000 interested buyers to buy a quota of 5000 vehicles for the month of OCTOBER 2003.<br><br>The 50,000 interested buyers will book their commitment fee with the 100 dealership (if you like more then 100, or less then my 100, just replace this 100 with whatever suits your fancy - I will not hanker with you over it).<br><br>If each of the 100 dealers equally receive 500 bookings from a total of 50,000 buyers, then the 100 dealers will each apply for a quota of 500 vehicles.<br><br>If the "King" decides to have a Quota Lot of 50 cars - priced at a base price of $5000 per car for the First Successful Bid. The Dealers will then place their bids OVER or BELOW this base price - (i.e. $5000 PLUS 10 PERCENT) (or another Dealer may bid $5000 MINUS 10 PERCENT).<br><br>Price for 1st Successful Bid - Quota Lot - 50 cars x $5000<br><br>Each Dealer that need more then ONE Quota Lot, will have to pay a premium of 10% more over their successful bid price.<br><br></div>

Clearly one tat had  known tat is the biggest loop hole in his solution. If u refuse to answer tis one question, then talking more doesn't mean anything as tis is one of the fundamental element in your solution, and u have no solution to it. I will treat all those comments insulting my IQ level as a way of u trying to escape notice, and will treat u no greater than a naughty boy trying to avoid answering a question by creating distractions. </strong></blockquote>Why should I avoid or refuse to answer your question ? Your questions are not difficult to address, and as the records have shown, in which I have even taken the trouble to print out the answers to your question in the referenced dates of October 9, 10, 11, and 12.<br><br>The problem is with your infantile reading and understanding of the events and issues that are being discusssed; and I am not too surprised in the way your "thought process" has developed when you adopt a credo such as being " stupid is smart ".<br><br>Now I hope that you will at least change this belief so as to help yourself to understand the issues better.<br><blockquote><strong><br>If u think I am speechless about all your other points, then think again. I want u to be focus on tis one question and tis one question only. ANSWER IT PLAIN AND SIMPLE. </strong></blockquote>You have not shown yourself to be speechless about all my points posted, and instead you seem to have displayed a dense degree of frustrations in how your positions have been exposed to be untenable.<br><br>If you can only handle one issue at a time, I will definitely oblige you, as you have already shown a very industrious capacity to diverge into so many different positions in one subject.<br><br>Hopefully, my straight forward response to your effort at a kindergarten level story telling will help you to understand an issue for Adults Only.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good, u have finally answer the question. Now it is finally my turn to shoot<br><br>"""<br>Fifthly, if DEMAND exceed SUPPLY - meaning 50,000 buyers to only a small quota of 5,000 - is the "King" dead and cannot respond by increasing the Quota ? This has happened with the present COE system, in which the Government adjust the quantity of COE to meet rising demands.<br>"""<br><br>First of all, from the above paragraph, u suggested tat there is no fixed quota level per month. In other words, if there r 50000 bidders, the king will eventually give out 50000 COE, though they may be charged at a higher price. Then in such a case, where is the control mechanism for the number of cars on the road ?? Gov may adjust the quantity, however the percentage change is not great, as descibed by<br><br>""<br>Thirdly, in a SUPPLY SIDE Quota System, it is important that the Quota per month be kept firm at a decided level, but moderated according to the situation.<br>""<br><br>If in your case, then since the COE is "cheaper", as u hope to achieve, then more people can afford to have cars. Assume the city can only support 1 million cars. In the past, only about 1 million people can afford to have them. Since COE is cheaper now, then 3 million can afford to have cars. Hence there is a 3 times over capacity.  In the end, we will turn out to be the same as Bangkok or other congested roads in cities. There is a reason why there is a cap on the number of cars on the road.<br><br>""<br>If the "King" decides to have a Quota Lot of 50 cars - priced at a base price of $5000 per car for the First Successful Bid. The Dealers will then place their bids OVER or BELOW this base price - (i.e. $5000 PLUS 10 PERCENT) (or another Dealer may bid $5000 MINUS 10 PERCENT).<br><br>Price for 1st Successful Bid - Quota Lot - 50 cars x $5000<br><br>Each Dealer that need more then ONE Quota Lot, will have to pay a premium of 10% more over their successful bid price.<br>""<br><br>Tat is another stupid assumption u had made in tis. If I am dealer, who have 500 orders, and I had to pay extra after 50 lots, then I will ask my relatives to bid for me, as explained in IC method. In other words, if all the dealers do such, then it will turn out to be 100X10=1000 dealers, each with bids of 50. How is your overcharging going to work then ? How r u going to proceed on with selection again ?<br><br>Even if u manage to curb tis probelm, tat will pose another problem. U r forcing people to buy in a variety of cars rather than the one they like. Lets say car A manage to sell 500 per month while car B only sold 2. If we implement your stupid idea, than car A can only sell 50 per month, unless owners r willing to pay for overcharging fees while car B suddenly manage to sell 50 too due to your implementation. We r talking about dyunamic rate here, u cannot just "wait" now since we r increasing 450 "waiting pesonal" for tis particular car every month. U r forcing car owners to buy cars they do not like, and u r forcing car market to turn upsaide down.<br><br>If u going to use cost to diminish the demand, then wat difference had u made relatively to the past COE ? Only tis time u r removing the option of letting car bidders bid themselves without passing through the dealer channel.  U have also added the problem of investment opportunity in the COE.<br><br>""<br>Or it can be modified to allow the median bid price to be established from all the prices offered, and the groups of application closest to this median price will be awarded the quota.<br><br>If first group of 20 Dealers submit offers at $5000 + 10% = $5,500 per car.<br><br>2nd Group of 20 Dealers submit offers at $5000 + 15% = $5,750 per car.<br><br>3rd Group of 10 Dealers submit offers at $5000 + 20% = $6,000 per car<br><br>4th Group of 20 Dealers submit offers at $5000 + 25% = $6,250 per car<br><br>5th Group of 10 Dealers submit offers at $5000 + 30% = $6,500 per car<br><br>6th Group of 15 Dealers submit offers at $5000 + 40% = $7,000 per car<br><br>The average median price will be $6,200.<br><br>All the 20 dealers in the 4th Group will get their application for the FIRST Quota Lot of 50 cars at $6,200 per car.<br>"""<br><br>Tis is another failed method above. Hence as the way u put it, only 20 dealers get to have their FULL bid while the other dealer LEFT with 0. In such case, then u have already MIXED luck inside the formula, which will end up with 1 BIG monopoly dealer. He will charge a HIGHER price for the COE he had successfully bidded, since he hold the market now and for tat month, and we can see their cars sell like hotcakes. Mean time we can see all the other dealers starve to death. They EARNED 0 tat month since they can't get any COE. If they r so unlucky not to be able to win any bid for 10 months, u have forced them to go bust.<br><br>Since no one can guess the median of tat month easily, then u had already RELIED on LUCK to distribute the COE. If tat is the case, then why not use the BALLOT box from the start ? Why not cancel out the dealer and use consumers themselves bid if u insist on using "median" ? Tis is more efficient than your stupid idea in the sense tat dealer r not involved in the loop neither is there any "investment" aspect from the selling of the COE.<br><br>Since all your method of selection fail as discussed above, lets see wat other method can u come up with.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tis is to reply the previous mail u have sent already. From now onward, I will cut down on remarks against other author, and just focus on talking about their points in the  argument. I can do nothing to the other party if he still decide to put in additional comments, but it is just a matter of courtesy.<br><br>''<br>If a dealership is lucky enough to get 1 million buyers to buy his 300 cars in stock, the best way to get more publicity is to conduct a ballot.<br><br>What is your problem with this ? It is like a Lucky Draw ! Everyone likes surprise win !<br>""<br><br>If tat is the case, why don't we start with balloting from the Gov to the buyer directly, removing the link of dealer directly ? Wat is the role of dealer in tis case ? If in the end everything is decided on using the ballot box, there will be no use of dealer, as u suggested in the role of buying COE.<br><br>""<br>What is the difference whether if it is the Government who decide which Dealer is lucky to get the 5000 cars to sell,<br><br>OR<br><br>whether it is a Dealer deciding which BUYER is lucky to get the 5000 cars to buy ?<br>""<br><br>As the same argument again, why need to go through the dealer at all ?<br><br>Wat is the difference if GOV decide which BUYER get to buy the 500 cars, while the dealer just focus on selling their cars.<br><br>Tis is wat I had suggested in Oct 11 1135<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The gov will hold a ballot for the owner themselves to ballot it out. The application form for each ballot come in $100 or watever the gov want, and the people, if they wanna increase their chances, can buy more application form and try out their luck (tis is to prevent people from using other people IC to ballot). Of course if they got the ownership, they cannot transfer their ownership and have to get a car by tis month. (to avoid investors since it is only to themselves, tis time). There can be another alternative to those who must absolutely get their car within tis month. They get to pay the full COE, or a fixed min price fixed by gov. </span><br><br>Why not tis method cutting off problem of transfering ownership, cutting link of dealers ?<br><br>"""<br>For some sensible lessons of stocking vs financial cost, you need to abandon the idea of " stupid-is-smart " , because if you insist in your position there is nothing can be further said without endless cycle of assumptions that are made based on a whimsical speculation<br>"""<br><br>Then I have to propose tis question to u. Can u surely say tat ALL the cars sold by ALL the dealers, including 2ND hand car dealers, must sell their cars by advance booking, and can only pass the cars to the buyer after bidding day ? If your answer is yes, then I have nothing to say.<br><br>If your answer if no, then I have to ask, then shouldn't he keep at least some minimun stock of COE with him ? U can still say anything u want about fiancial planning, but fact is tat in such a business environment, one must stock up some "raw" materials to remain in business.<br><br>""<br>Based on the present soft economic situation, do you think it is wise to use the Sales Figures of 912 from October 2002 ?<br><br>As a responsible Financial Person, would you commit anything huge into stock, over and above the 323 buyers who have committed with Booking Fee ?<br>""<br><br>I am just giving u the figures u need. If u do not want to use the data from last year, it is okie. But r u sure u will only bid for 323 exact, without leaving any extra COE to play with ? R u sure the whole of next month there won't be any buyer tat buy cars within a shorter time of thinking ? I can see the possibility of potential people just go over to a show room, test a car and decided to buy it straight. Since there r willing buyers willing to book for a month before getting the car, isn't it better to tell them tat they can drive away with the car they want without having to wait at all.Tis can only be achieved since the company has the extra COE with them. Won't an extra stock of COE help to facilitate such transaction and bring convenience to the buyers ?<br><br></div>

Hence as the way u put it, only 20 dealers get to have their FULL bid while the other dealer LEFT with 0. In such case, then u have already MIXED luck inside the formula, which will end up with 1 BIG monopoly dealer. He will charge a HIGHER price for the COE he had successfully bidded, since he hold the market now and for tat month, and we can see their cars sell like hotcakes. Mean time we can see all the other dealers starve to death. They EARNED 0 tat month since they can't get any COE. If they r so unlucky not to be able to win any bid for 10 months, u have forced them to go bust.<br><br>Since no one can guess the median of tat month easily, then u had already RELIED on LUCK to distribute the COE. If tat is the case, then why not use the BALLOT box from the start ? Why not cancel out the dealer and use consumers themselves bid if u insist on using "median" ? Tis is more efficient than your stupid idea in the sense tat dealer r not involved in the loop neither is there any "investment" aspect from the selling of the COE.

            <div class='col-md body'>If u want me to go through point by point from your previous mail, it can be done.<br><br>The first, second and third point, which is 1/2 of your points given r just personal insults, I see no point in touching on them.<br><br>For the 4th,<br><br>"""<br>Are you aware that during this OCTOBER 2003, the present COE system has resulted in the LOWEST COE PRICES over the last ten years; and yet NOT all the AVAILABLE COE are taken up by Buyers.<br>"""<br><br>I got to pose tis question, not all the AVAILABLE COE are taken up by buyers, <strong>isn't it because of the high cost of present COE tat contribute to tis phenomenon ? </strong>If it is lesser than the quota, than it just shows the effectiveness of the present COE. If there is no COE, the price will definitely climb up a LOT. Simple economy, if price go down, demand will rise.<br><br>More explanation on why there will be a rising demand below, using all your proposed models<br><br>Lets say tis example. If COE is considered as part of the cost price of a car, then if your method is successful to make the COE into 10% of its usual price, won't tat increase the number of people tat will buy cars ?There are a lot of people tat will want to buy cars, but can't afford the price of it. I think we can go around and ask people regarding to tis aspect. Ask a friend of yours with no cars tis question. If the cars is more affordable than before, will they want to buy a car ? In your case, if it is successful, the car is now cheaper, there will have occurances of OVERWHELMING increase in demand to the dealer side.<br><br>Suppose the dealer has taken your approach of using advance booking. Of course to prevent the owner from running away after the dealer manage to get the COE, they will have to sign a contract to legally bind them to pay for the COE and other costs. After signing of such a contract, then wat will be the significant of<br><br>"the DEALERSHIP that will have to bear the cost UPFRONT for the bid value that is being submitted. "<br><br>They just have to approach a bank, and the bank will readily  provide the fund since it is relatively safe and profitable. (The dealer have the contracts) In tis case, then the bank will act as a buffer to the dealer, and DEALER DO not have to come out a single cent THROUGHOUT the whole exercise. The bank will PAY for the "cost UPFRONT" to the Gov directly. The profits/interest made by the bank will go directly to the buyers themselves.<br><br>Hence all the OVERWHELMING response will go up the chain and pose the OVERBIDDING situation on the Gov side. Tat is why the very important question, How r Gov going to resolve who get how much of the COE.<br><br>For point 5<br><br>""<br>Fifthly, if DEMAND exceed SUPPLY - meaning 50,000 buyers to only a small quota of 5,000 - <strong>is the "King" dead and cannot respond by increasing the Quota </strong>? This has happened with the present COE system, in which the Government adjust the quantity of COE to meet rising demands.<br>""<br><br>Tis is from your previous mail too<br><br>""<br>In all my postings I have consistently indicated that whether it is the Present COE system, or my proposed SUPPLY SIDE Quota System, BOTH serve the same OBJECTIVE to control the Growth of the Vehicle Population.<br>""<br><br>SInce in such a case, to effectively control cars, the quota can only be +- 10 from the original bid. Tat is, the limit of number of quota given tis month will be 5500, if the original quota number is 5000. If in such a case, then isn't it clear tat the "living" king cannot raise the figures up. In tis case , then the selection of the Gov on who will take the quota became a big issue.<br><br>Tis is my question posted to u previously too<br><br>""<br>In other words, if there r 50000 bidders, the king will eventually give out 50000 COE, though they may be charged at a higher price. Then in such a case, where is the control mechanism for the number of cars on the road ??<br>""<br><br>I hope tis will answer your query why there cannot be an increase in the number of COEs according to demand.<br><br>""<br>How can we come to the situation of BANGKOK traffic condition, when either the COE or the SUPPLY SIDE Quota System only allow a FIXED Quantity of New Vehicles to be sold PER Month ?<br>""<br><br>In tis reply, I assume u know of the fact tat the QUOTA cannot be raise at all. If tis month is 5000, it will remain stubbornly at 5000+-500 no matter how much is the demand for COE. Tis is to counter your point 5 again. Then I have to ask again, how r u going to select who get the COE ?<br><br>"""<br>As was previously posted, even in the Present COE system, there are buyers who are unable to be successful in getting the car that they desire to get in October 2003, as the Dealer has run out of available COE for this month, and the Buyer will just have to wait until the next exercise.<br>"""<br><br>Tis is not a static figure, it is dynamic figure tat goes for every month. Here is an illustration : If the dealer used to sell 5000 cars tis month, while on average he only get 800 COE, tat means every month there will have 4200 people tat cannot get the cars. If u cannot get your car tis month from him, the odds is tat u will have to wait VERY VERY VERY long, maybe YEARS to get the car. Isn't tat forcing them to buy other cars ? Tis is especially so if u had used the overcharging policy.<br><br>In the present COE, it will be more fairer to the dealers and customers in the sense tat the buyers get to buy watever cars they want if they get the COE. Tis is especially so to the dealers since the people get choose the cars because they like the cars, and not because of external reasons. Tis will be a more healthy trend compared to "spreading" the buyers to dealers with the COEs<br><br>""<br>Do you think that in a SUPPLY SIDE Quota System, the same preventive regulations cannot be done ?<br>""<br><br>Obviously u can't, since it has to change names from dealers to buyers. If u say the dealer have to put down the buyer name from the start due to your advance booking method, then u r forcing dealers to go 0 on COE on tis month, which I do not agree due to "storage vs fiancial" argument we made. I believe especially 2nd hand car dealers sold most of their car within days or hours and not have to made them wait for a month.<br><br>""<br>Why did you make only a partial quote from my post (print in Blue) and LEFT OUT the critical part (shown in Red) that should have been read as a COMPLETE WHOLE ?<br>""<br><br>Pardon me for making tat mistakes, I agree tat is an oversight, but the result will still be insignificant. According to your theory, then the other dealers get only 50 COE tat month, a pale 10% compared to the 500 they can normally earned. If a business man has its profit reduced to 10%, don't u think tis is still a big blow to tat dealer ? In this aspect, they will still starve to death eventually.<br><br>Tis is a reply I had made then<br><br>""<br>Since no one can guess the median of tat month easily, then u had already RELIED on LUCK to distribute the COE. If tat is the case, then why not use the BALLOT box from the start ? Why not cancel out the dealer and use consumers themselves bid if u insist on using "median" ?<br>""<br><br>Why not cancel out the dealer if luck is decided to be used ? Won't tat be fairer to all the party involved, ESPECIALLY to the dealer. The policy u made r mostly unfair to the dealer, asking them to pay COE upfront, asking them not to bid too much with overcharging policy, sizing up their market share etc. They r providing us a service in giving us the cars. We should be fair to all 3 sides, Gov, Dealer and Consumer when we consider a change in COE structure. Tis also removes problem of transferring of ownership etc.<br><br>"""<br>Why do you try so hard to discredit the SUPPLY SIDE Quota System, when all it does is to IMPROVE on the Present COE - (as said by you to be a CHEAPER COE) - by allowing a LOWER 4-digit valuation as a Base Price for bidding to begin ?<br>"""<br><br>The reason is simple, it cannot work. I am not against any good idea to replaced tat the one we r having, however tat idea must at least be feasible in the first place. I meant cheaper, if it had worked at all. But frankly at tis point of time, I don't think so. U haven't even clearly stated how does Gov settle the problem of overbidding from Dealer ? How can it be workable then ?<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>From the look of his previous reply, I believe Atobe will not be back to reply anymore. Hence I decided to write a conclucion here. I believe tis will be an important end for tis discussion. To those who hate me, no harm in taking a look since, treat it as just  for entertainment sake.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">First</span>, I will talk about the buyer side first. If Atobe supply side idea worked, then the price of COE will goes down, since tat is the main objective of supply idea. Since the overall price for owning a car goes down, there will be an increase in numbers of buyers for a car. (Simple economy theory : Lower price, higher demand) Atobe attempt to show statistic tat the actual demand for car in Singapore is low, however tat is mainly because of the present COE system which forced the car price up, lowering the actual demand.<br><br>I believe it is general knowledge tat there r a lot of people who wanted to have their own car but cannot afford it in Singapore. For everyone who actually owned a car in Singapore now, one can easily find 3 others who desired a car yet cannot afford it.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Secondly</span>, I will talk about the dealership perspective. From Atobe previous replies, he suggested tat the dealers had to pay for a huge sum of money to buy in all the COE they needed immediately. Tis will cause cash flow problem to the dealer. Thus tis becomes his main argument.<br><br>10th Oct 0254<br>""<br>The Dealership will have to weigh his sales potential, his cash flow position, present stock levels vs additional stocks, financial cost of holding vehicles in stock for too long a time, competitor's pricing, and a whole host of consideration pertaining to their specific industry.<br>""<br><br>However, the number of bids made by the dealer will mainly concern themselves with the <strong>SALE VOLUME</strong>. i.e. If a dealer can sell 500 cars a month, whether from advanced booking or sale on the spot, he will not lower tat number to 50. If I can sell 500 cars a month, thus earning the commision for the 500 cars, why reduce this number to 50 ?<br><br>He can easily eliminate the cash flow problem by loans from bank, whose fees will be passed on to the buyers. The bank will act as a buffer, paying the COE fees first while waiting for the dealer to collect it back from the buyers. In the end, the dealer may act as just a middleman, one tat never even need to pay a single cent out from his pockets. Loans will even be made easier if the owners chose advance booking, since the contracts that they will signed with the dealer will add as a safe guard for the bank.<br><br>12th Oct 0741<br>""<br>Certainly, the Dealership will plan their preferred quota lot size according to how many cars they sell per month Â– (as you and I have mentioned).<br>""<br><br>In tis case, since the number of buyers for a car increased (from point 1), the number of cars the dealers will sell also increase. This increase will not be low, probably 30% or 40% more than during the present COE. This will move up the rung of ladder and pose the problem of overbidding to the Gov.<br><br>I mentioned the crux of this point again, <strong>Dealer based the number of bids they made mainly on the sale volume, and sale volume will increase due to the more affordibilty of cars. Thus in the end, the DEMAND volume will be higher than the Quota volume</strong><br><br><span style="color: orange;">3rd</span>. Now we come to the Gov. Since from the above, this problem will be passed on to Gov. This is the one thing I have been trying to say for many times, OVERBIDDING on GOV side.<br><br>Frankly, watever answer Atobe give for tis problem, I can easily counter it with asking "Why is there a need for dealers to be involved in the transaction ? Why don't the Gov distribute COE directly to the buyers, using the new method tat u came out instead ?"<br><br>Because of tis, I believe it is hard for him to give a reply to tis question. Why do I ask tis question then ? Tis is to show the idea of involving the dealer is redundant.<br><br>I do not know if Atobe will rely to tis reply. Frankly tis discussion has go on for too long. Especially so since tis is just a hypothetical solution tat has never been tested and never will be implemented. If there is no reply on his side, I will probably stop here.<br><br>PS: To Lazer51088,<br><br>I wonder if anyone, including Lazer will ever read untill here. Anyway increasing the tax for prtrol is not a good solution since tat will increase business costs and standard of living in Singapore. Thus all the prices for almost everything here will increase, hurting everyone. Taxi driver will not be affected unless the tax is also applied on diesel (taxi used diesel).<br><br>To me, COE may not be popular, however it is a good method for taxing rich people. If Gov doesn't collect COE, they will still spend the same amount of money, and will try to raise tax from other areas such as GST etc. Tis will then affect all the people and businesses, making life harder for everyone.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason I chose to talk not about COE and rather about stupidissmart's lack of intelligent behaviour stems from several reasons. Firstly I believe that the topic has already been covered in depth by those who have been posting on it. Secondly, I find stupid's amazing ability to ignore reason and spin his own reality of kiddish stories and frog-in-the-well mentality worth dissecting for all to see.

His replies have no substance in it. Try an experiment, u replace the name "stupidissmart" with, lets say "Atobe", and u will find tat the passage still remain perfectly logical ! But one must be amazed at his ability at written abuses. Tis is probably his only talent in writing forum.

Since your suggestions is about a method tat is not tested, not implemented with no history to go about, the only way to find find your suggestions inappropriate is to go inside your model and argue on it. The main objectives of your argument is on the price of COE being cheaper, hence I had to assume the initial phase had worked, it will still pose a problem overall.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi socrates<br>Suffice to say that it is not surprising in the series of this sgForums, that anyone, who had the experience of crossing words with the character behind the name " stupidissmart " , have all ended up with the same opinion of a character who debase logic beyond any possible intelligence. This must set him out to be quite an achiever in this sgForums.<br><br>If anyone care to revisit the issues printed over the last few torturous days, one will see how issues keep constantly changing to suit new positions being adopted in the pursuit of demolishing the Proposed SUPPLY SIDE Quota System as posted by the brilliance of being " stupidissmart "<br><br>The idea of the SUPPLY SIDE Quota Control - as an ALTERNATIVE to the Present COE system - is basically to REMOVE the financial benefit to the Government, and this position is CONVENIENTLY IGNORED by "stupidissmart".<br><br>The Proposed SUPPLY SIDE Quota Control is to challenge the Government to respond, based on their declarations as follows:<br><br>(1) COE is a tool to control the Growth of the Vehicle Population.<br><br>(2) COE is NOT intended to be a tool of Revenue Collection.<br><br>(3) With the ERP in place, COE will be removed, and at the same time Road Taxes will be reduced from its more then 150 percent increases over the taxes imposed during the early 1980's.<br><br>" stupidissmart " is NOT WRONG in calling it a CHEAPER COE, as for all intent and purposes, the SUPPLY SIDE Quota Control System had set out to <span style="color: red;">remove the heavy financial burden</span> to any prospective vehicle owners.<br><br>This is accomplished with the proposal that a 4-digit value be set as a base price, which I had indicated as $5000 from which all bids PLUS or MINUS will be placed.<br><br>With the SUPPLY SIDE Quota Control, it is to achieve TRANSPARENCY on the part of the Government (through the LTA), and also to remove the element of wild speculations by Dealers, who have generally acted on behalf of most Buyers - with the Buyers having LITTLE or NO INFLUENCE to the supposedly BID PRICES.<br><br>In this SUPPLY SIDE Quota Control, it was intended that the Dealers will decide which Quota Size (with the allocated number of vehicles) to bid for, and how many Quota Lots to bid for - with each successful Quota Lot awarded available at a higher premium to be paid - so as to prevent "complete" monopoly.<br><br>In addition, the Dealer will have to pay UP FRONT the total value of the Bid Price for the Quota Lot required.<br><br>All of which is intended to prevent the available quota from being manipulated in price and in monopolisation.<br><br>It was repeated that there is LITTLE DIFFERENCE in the mechanism that operates the Present COE and the Proposed SUPPLY SIDE Quota Control - except for the changes described above.<br><br>The bidding methods of paper or electronic submissions, the manner of awarding for the SUPPLY SIDE Quota System is the same as the Present COE.<br><br>This was clearly described in my post 14 October 2003 - 05:01 A.M. in reply to the persistent clamor for the mechanics.<br><br>Yet in the stupendous reply from " stupidissmart " prefer to IGNORE the main parts that clearly allay the negative concern of only ONE Dealer benefit from the Proposed SUPPLY SIDE Quota System, and prefer to quote "out-of-context" to misrepresent my posts in a wild attempt at rebuttal and self-justification.<br><br>I am surprised that "socrates" can contradict your own position in your observation that - " I do have to say <span style="color: red;">some points </span>written by SIS indeed does <span style="color: red;">sound illogical and silly</span>. Yet his arguments are not totally without merits. <span style="color: red;">On certain issues, I believe his arguments does make sense</span>"<br><br>It will be interesting to view how you come to this self-contradicting position, when his position is being advanced as a <span style="color: red;">SINGULAR and COMPLETE WHOLE </span>to rebutt my <span style="color: blue;">SINGLE IDEA of a SUPPLY SIDE Quota Control.</span><br><br>Impressions of "scolding" and "jeering" are but the perceived views of the bystander or reader, of the jousting between two deeply engrossed verbal gladiators, who maybe oblivious to the world at large.<br><br>In any debate, the choice of words will normally reflect the circumstance and the intensity of the occassion.<br><br>When one side does not respond to logic and prefer to rely on blatant dishonesty - to move from one position to the next, and ultimately resort to blatant misrepresentation of other's postings, the outcome can only be total exposure of the despicable act of the party concerned.<br><br>This is quite different from "flaming".<br><br>This is nothing new in Politics - if POLITICS is what this place in sgForums is all about.<br><br></div>

Tis is probably his only talent in writing forum. If u do not believe me, if he ever reply, it will be something similar to all the mails he had written on tis discussion thread.

Brilliant form at work.<br><br>By calling my Proposed SUPPLY SIDE Quota System as a "CHEAPER COE" - which you recognised as being "The main objectives of your argument is on the price of COE being cheaper" - will it not be SAFE for anyone to say that you have recognised my proposal to be as what you say it is - a CHEAPER COE ?<br><blockquote><strong><br>Yet u clearly ignore tat fact and kept using tat one line as an advertisement, despite my elaboration.
