I do not have the statistics on personal income<br>tax rates in Singapore or elsewhere, although I do have a general<br>ballpark knowledge of the comparative personal income tax rates of<br>Singapore as compared with some countries such as US, UK and<br>Australia, etc. But since I am merely proposing a new way to look at<br>Singapore's personal income tax rate, I am sure readers will be able<br>to judge the correctness and accuracy of the points I am going to<br>make, and, with their more informed knowledge, be able to confirm my<br>observation.<br><br>First, let me define 'personal income tax' in general terms, that is,<br>that Singapore's 'income tax' is the tax monies that we pay to the<br>Government based on how much we earn.<br><br>Thus, if you are prepared to agree with me that our 'income tax' is<br>all the monies that are taxed from our income and given to the<br>Singapore Government, then you are going to be very shocked by my<br>observation.<br><br>First, many wage earners in Singapore do not pay income tax. Or so it<br>seems. That is, they do not even earn enough to fall under the income<br>tax rates. But nevertheless, as I will show, even these low income<br>wage earners are paying income tax [in the general sense of the term]<br>and at a very high rate, too.<br><br>Furthermore, for those who fall into the income tax brackets, they not<br>only pay their usual income tax [up to the highest marginal personal<br>tax rate of 26%, I believe] but they, like their poorer Singaporeans,<br>pay another income tax on top of the usual one, that is also very<br>high.<br><br>What is this 'additional income tax'?<br><br>Well, it is the CPF-HDB Great Ripoff Scheme.<br><br>Let me explain.<br><br>We all know that when we are having a salary, 40% [for most years in<br>the past, now 36%, I believe] of every single wage earner goes to his<br>CPF. I repeat, every single Singaporean has his/her wages deducted by<br>36% every payday, without exception.<br><br>You may say, Oh! That's OK because it goes into OUR CPF and not the<br>greedy Singapore Government. So, it is not another income tax, right?<br><br>Wrong. Because the CPF allows you to use your CPF funds to pay for<br>your HDB flat.<br><br>So what, you may say?<br><br>Ah, here comes my observation.<br><br>Now, the Government takes 36% of every single wage earner's pay every<br>month and puts it into the CPF, under your name and 'ownership' BUT<br>TAKES IT OUT TO PAY FOR YOUR HDB FLAT. AND BY INFLATING THE PRICE OF<br>YOUR HDB FLAT, THE GOVERNMENT THEREBY TAKES AN EXORBITANT AND ALMOST<br>ILLEGAL PORTION OF YOUR CPF, THAT IS, YOUR MONIES, THUS ALMOST<br>DIRECTLY FROM YOUR INCOME EVERY MONTH.<br><br>Now, again, you may say that that is OK because the HDB flat will be<br>yours after you have finished paying for it.<br><br>True, that is, if your flat can be sold at the same or higher price<br>than when you paid for it. Or, if selling were an option -- if you<br>sell, where could you live? So selling is not really an option.<br><br>We now come to the point of HDB flat prices.<br><br>It is now irrefutable fact that a 4-room HDB flat costs less than<br>$30,000 to build. We have seen direct tender prices by contractors to<br>build HDB flats and we know that flats cost less than $30,000 to<br>build. BUT THE PRICE OF A 4-ROOM HDB FLAT IS ABOUT $280,000 [my wife's<br>colleague paid that]. Thus the HDB makes a massive profit, which goes<br>to the Government. Even if we have to pay for the administrative costs<br>of the HDB organisation, each 4-room should not cost more than<br>$80,000. The extra $200,000 is simply obscene profit.<br><br>Thus, we now have a clearer understanding how this evil scheme works.<br><br>First, the Government, by law, forces every single wage earner to put<br>36% of his salary [or income] into his CPF. Then, it 'allows' these<br>CPF monies to pay for your HDB flat. And by inflating the price of<br>your flat to obscene levels, it takes most of your CPF and puts it<br>into the Government kitty.<br><br>Thus, this CPF-HDB combination directly takes your income monies [via<br>the CPF Board] and credits it into the Government coffers. Is this not<br>a ripoff? Is this not another income tax? That is, a direct tax on<br>your income?<br><br>Another point. Precisely because 36% of our wages goes into the CPF,<br>which we cannot withdraw, we are 'prepared' to pay higher prices for<br>our flats than would be if we had to pay in cash. If everyone had had<br>to pay cash for their flats, the HDB could never have raised prices to<br>such obscene levels.<br><br>Thus the CPF Home Ownership Scheme is merely a sleight of hand to take<br>our income and transfer it to the Government coffers. Through the<br>indirect means of our HDB flat.<br><br>We own the flat, no? True. But if there were no such CPF Home<br>Ownership Ripoff, we would have rebelled against paying $280,000 for a<br>tiny flat.<br><br>But the Government spends its obscene profits wisely, no? That is<br>another issue for another day. But look at all the spanking new<br>Ministerial Buildings, the new Durians on the Esplanade, etc, the high<br>spending on the military, to the tune of US$4 billion a year, and ask<br>yourself if you can trust the Government to spend the money wisely,<br>and back on the people. [Most of the GIC funds are invested overseas,<br>creating jobs and opportunities for foreigners; hardly any is spent<br>locally to benefit Singaporeans]. The list goes on...<br><br>And what do we get for paying these highest income taxes in the world?<br><br>No social security. No free health service. No unemployment benefits.<br>No everything.<br><br>We pay more than the developed countries in income taxes and get<br>nothing like what they enjoy. To hazard a guess, our income taxes [as<br>I have discussed above] probably exceeds 40% of our incomes, counting<br>both the normal income tax and this abnormal tax on our income.<br><br>On top of that, we also pay GST, etc.<br><br>Any wonder why Singaporeans are poor while the Government is rich?<br>Exactly as Machiavelli advised. Any wonder why Singaporeans have so<br>little money to spend that the retail sector is hurting and has been<br>hurting for at least a decade? Any wonder why the velocity of money in<br>Singapore is stagnant? Any wonder why there simply isn't enough money<br>in the economy to oil the wheels of commerce and trade as well as the<br>economic engine?<br><br>And who to blame for this sorry state of affairs?<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew and his cronies. They cannot blame the US slowdown or the<br>world moribund economies, or SARS, etc. This has been one of the<br>factors contributing to the crisis Singaporeans are facing.<br><br>Blame the 80 year old senile minister who refuses to go even though a<br>majority of Singaporeans in a poll wanted him to go.</span></div>

It was based on gov's plan to use EPR-type technology prior to 90's to control car USAGE, NOT ownership. Hence Singaporean bought gov's reasoning that COE is a temporary exercise to control vehicular population. Now over gov back-track on this and admit more than ever, they depend on COE mony to upkeep their extravant spendings for most of 90s.<br><br>Did you ever wonder why gov is so prepared to invest such expensive EPR systems on our road while there are much cheaper and low-tech way of controlling road usages ?<br><br>Some countriies, like the France and Italy requires certain registered no. cars to be on the road on certain specified days.<br><br>I don't think i'll be a problem in implementing this simple law in law-consicous Singaporeans.<br><br>Question now is, has EPR and COE provided such rich source of income that the gov is not  prepared to let public transport become an altenate form of transport ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If the Government is truly interested in the control of the vehicular population, there are many ways other then using the PUNITIVE MONETARY approach to regulate.<br><br>The availability of vehicles can be regulated by a quota system WITHOUT the financial impact of the COE that is entirely wasteful to the Singaporeans, and build onto the insatiable appetite of the Government to soak or suck up any and every available funds from the Singapore Citizen.<br><br>The COE system can be modified by having the Car Dealerships to bid for a regulated quota of IMPORT PERMITS for the cars to be sold to the Singapore Consumer. Instead of regulating the RETAIL end, why not regulate the SUPPLY side ?<br><br>If any one Dealership overbid and is stuck with more quota and stock of cars, then it will be financially burdensome on the dealership. Should the Dealership decide to pass on the added cost of an overbid to the Car Buyer, it will make the retail price unattractive when compared to Competitive Makes.<br><br>With an extended ERP system that covers every major road arteries in the City and the Suburbs, the price of operating a car becomes even more prohibitive when also considering the high price of fuel that is being sold in Singapore.<br><br>There are many other creative ways of REGULATING the growth and the physical size of the Vehicle Population in Singapore, other then using the punitive fiscal approach that directly hurt the Singaporean car buyer.<br><br>Try to think " out-of-the-box " , instead of being trapped in Government Propaganda about the need to use punitive fiscal measures that affects the Singaporean pocket directly and in massive blows.<br><br>If the COE policy is truly meant to regulate the car population, why does the Government limit it at 10 year interval, with the need of having to pay for another COE for a second 10 year - that is worth ZERO value at the end of the second 10 year period ?<br><br>As GUN had mentioned, the previous Minister of Communications Mah Bow Tan had so boastfully said that COE will be a temporary measure and which will be removed when ERP is in place to regulate the ECONOMIC USE of Road Space.<br><br>He also said that the 150 percent increases in Road Tax - (that was implemented before the COE was introduced) - will also be reduced when the ERP system is fully implemented.<br><br>Conveniently, Minister Mah Bow Tan was moved out of the Ministry, and the entire matter was "forgotten", and the Singaporean's short memory was further dulled and distracted by all kinds of Singapore Shares mixed with additional fiscal measures such as the GST.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now the COE is also determined by market demand isn't it. If there is a great demand for cars, price go up and if there is poor demand for cars, price go down.<br><br>Wat is the difference if u control from the supply side ? There will be obviously more demand for cars than the quota set by Gov, and they will end up giving the cars with the highest bidder again. If Gov decide to release 500 cars tis month but 50000 cars r being bidded, how is gov going to decide who get who win the bid, other than who bid a higher price again ?<br><br>Supplier will try to see and predict the trend in the price of COE and bid for prices then. In tis way, the price of COE will still go up because as u say it, all people wanna have cars. The real demand is much higher than the supply allowed by gov and only with the increased price can they force the demand to go down.<br><br>In your case, COE turn out to be transferable, as before. In the past, u can transfer COE ownership between different owners. Now u can't because Gov realise there r people tat "invest" in COE. They buy a lot of COE when it is cheap. Keep them and sell them when price go up. The normal people turn up giving "COE" to investors instead. In tis way, the loser is the Gov and consumers while the gainers r investers.<br><br>Anyway planning roads is no easy task... U can say about minor "jams" yet forgeting tat most of the time, at most places in Singapore, everything is going smoothly. If everything goes smoothly, no gratitude, when something unexpected blew up u blame them for everything. I guess u should be glad tat the problems we face now r considered minor. U cannot expect a PERFECT road condition anywhere in the world.<br><br>I guess it is good to say do not think little of other people achievement or problems unless u have walk a mile in their shoes.<br></div>

The system can be fine tuned to the point that any second quota allotment awarded to a previously successful Dealership, will carry a Premium Value added to the bid price.<br><br>Unlike the present COE bidding system - which has now become an additional financial collection system for the Government Treasury - the SUPPLY side quota will see a definitely fixed quanity of vehicles being allowed to be sold on a monthly basis.<br><br>There are more then this few suggested ways of tweaking the SUPPLY side quota allocation to control the size and growth of the Car Population in Singapore, without the need of implementing financially punishing direct and indirect taxes called under different names.<br><br>Let us not forget that the objective is to regulate the growth and size of the vehicle population in Singapore, and this entire exercise is NOT about generating additional Cash for the Government Treasury.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe u have not answer the possibility of people bidding over the quota level. Who will have priority then ? If there r 10 people wanting to buy 1 car ownership from a car dealer, then who will be given priority as to who get the ownership ? I don't see why won't the dealer buy in as much ownership as possible, since the actual level of demand is tat high. I don't believe u can safely say tat it won't happened.<br><br>If u force car user to stock in in great quantities, then there will have lesser dealers buying the cars, resulting in easier monopolisation and a trend tat only the big companies can afford. There are more than 50 car companies selling used or new cars. If u split up into bigger shares, maybe into 10 groups, then some companies may end up with 0 cars ownership meaning they can't sell any cars within tat month. 5 million may mean a big amount to u and small corporation, but it is peanuts to big companies.<br><br>Since ownership can be transferable, how do u prevent people from "investing" in COE ? Will it end up like shares or trading commodities where people buy in at cheap proces and sell it when it goes up ? If I can't sell them off at a good price tis month, I am sure I will keep them for another few month before selling it. It will be like trading commodities in the sense tat they have 'expiry' dates.<br><br>Please answer these question if u ever want to argue about controling supply chain again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway if each month gov bring in 5000 cars. If u split it into 500 each, then only 10 groups will have the ownership. If u split into 1000 slots each, then only 5 groups will have it. How do u prevent 100 smaller players to formed a party together to buy in 1000 or 500 shares ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Last point:<br><br>If COE does get overhaul, then cars will be cheaper for people, tat is true. However the revenues of Gov will be lower. In tis sense, they will have to increase tax to counter balance tis, which means they may introduce higher GST, higher income tax, increase fares of public transport etc.<br><br>In such sense, I believe tat COE can be considered a tax, a tax for the rich or otherwise the desperate for cars. This seems to be a fairer way of tax as it will affect the rich directly. It will also moltivate people to work harder to own a car of their dream. If u scrape it, u only end up hurting the poor</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is the objective of DEMAND side quota (COE), or SUPPLY side quota ?<br><br>If 5000 vehicles can only benefit 5000 BUYERS only, does it really matter if this 5000 vehicles (divided into whatever smaller lots) benefit whatever numbers of dealership ?<br><br>Someone has to loose out on the opportunity to buy a car, so does it matter if some dealership sell more, or sell nothing at all ?<br><br>If fairness is to be done, then divide into smaller quota lots of 25 or 50 vehicles per quota permit, so as to allow more dealership to have its share.<br><br>With each quota applied for, the price of the next quota can be made available at 20 percent higher; or at whatever an amount higher, so as to make it financially demanding to prevent greedy bidding to buy out all the quota by any single dealership.<br><br>The problem with the COE system is that it is the BUYER that is punished for its insatiable appetite to own a vehicle. The dealership is not hurt in anyway. With most of the COE bidding being made through Dealerships, the price of the COE can be manipulated by unnecessary biddings at higher prices.<br><br>With SUPPLY side quota control, any Dealership will have to think hard before committing capital into holding the stocks that it has planned to sell within a certain period.<br><br>Obviously, with the cost of the quota being made lower, the fiscal collection numbers will be much lower, since the DECLARED Primary Objective is to control the growth of the vehicle population, and not as a fiscal measure that allow the Government to have a regular windfall.<br><br>The other declared Government statement was that when ERP is in place, COE, ARF, PARF and any other fiscal measures to limit car growth will be removed.<br><br>The Government is aware of the impact of such a move, but have got themselves addicted to the large amount of money collected with every COE bid.<br><br>This SUPPLY side quota control mechanism will actually benefit the Government by not losing out completely when it removed its other fiscal measures (COE, ARF, PARF) to control the growth of the vehicle population.<br><br>The figures or quota lot size are not dead figures and can be adjusted. This idea can be tweaked further.<br><br>This is only a suggestion that may not necessarily be the final solution, but it sure beat the ridiculous Singaporean craze in paying up to $50,000 and more, for a COE that is not worth the piece of paper that it is printed on.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As I say, tat idea is stupid. I ask again, if 50000 bid and there is only 5000 for tis month quota, then how ? Who get to have the car ?<br><br>U wanna talk about  a method to prevent gov to make money, u might as well suggest people go to ballot for it. IF 50000 apply for 500 slots, then u will have a 1% chance of getting the car. Isn't tat more simple and fair ?? Controlling supply side is silly as in the end everything will be the same.<br><br>As I say, tis is a fair way to tax the people. If u want to deprive the Gov from collecting COE, they still have to earn tat money and they will employ ways to get it back by taxing on other areas. They do announce tat COE money go into the budget right ? They announce it together with their other tax. Don't u think tis is better than raising property tax or GST ?</div>
