When did I speak about "Gov expenditures"; other then to rebutt your idea that COE is used to the road systems.<br><br>Interesting that you should declare that the Question in this discussion is whether it is an appropriate tax ?</div></blockquote>U already question on whether "old folks home" get any money isn't it ? I have said tis before<br><br>Gov will spend the same amount of money every year, whether COE was present or not. If u remove COE, then Gov will look into other way to get back tis offset. How do they do it ? They may raise property tax or raise GST, making living worse for everyone.<br><br>On touching COE, only a small fraction of the whole Singapore population get to have cars. We have to decide who get to own the car who can't. Gov method is to let the rich people get to be the ones having the convenience of the cars, but they must do it with a price. The price of COE and other road tax.<br><br>Hasn't tat been fair to both the rich and the poor, in the sense tat the Rich get to pay more Tax, while the Poor cannot have the luxury of the car. Let say considering only on tis aspect, do u think tis is fair ?<br><br>This question had been dealt with later.<span style="color: darkred;">I guess you cannot possibly be a vehicle owner, let alone having a driving license.<br><br>As was mentioned in the preceding page, with the Present COE System, the Rich can afford to submit prices at the very highest - just to guarantee themselves a place.<br><br>However, it is the "Not-so-Rich" and the "Poor", who will lose out, as their bid prices may not be sufficiently high to win them a place at the top of the pile.<br><br>Ironically, the prices submitted by the "Not-so-Rich" and the "Poor" will be used as the ACCEPTED COE Bid Price.</span><br><br></span></div>

Can u 100% say tat ALL cars are sold by advance orders NOW, INCLUDING <strong>2nd Hand cars Dealers </strong>? [/b][/quote]<br><span style="color: darkred;">How "advance" before you no longer accept it as "Advance Orders" ?<br><br>Most Car Salesmen will demand a commitment fee or deposit to be paid at the time of order, especially when most cars are now packaged with a COE included.<br><br>This is to give all Buyers the convenience of One-Stop-Convenience to obtain COE, Car Insurance, as well as supply or upgrading of accessories.<br><br>Even Second-hand car dealers are also working along the same lines.</span><blockquote><strong><br>2. Do u not think tis is an added value if I can let u OWN the car the [b]minute u want to buy it</strong> AND NOT having to wait for a full month ? [/b]</blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Unfortunately, from the assumptions that you have made about car ownerships, it is wishful thinking on your part, and it looks like you have never own a car before.<br><br>For your information, even when you order a car, you will have to wait at least a minimum of three to four days.to have several issues resolved. Without any complications, the earliest that a Buyer can take over possession of his car, will be at least three days.</span><br><blockquote>Originally posted by stupidissmart:<br><strong><br>[quote]But r u sure u will only bid for 323 exact, without leaving any extra COE to play with ? R u sure the whole of next month there won't be any buyer tat buy cars within a shorter time of thinking ? I can see the possibility of potential people just go over to a show room, test a car and decided to buy it straight. Since there r willing buyers willing to book for a month before getting the car, isn't it better to tell them tat they can drive away with the car they want without having to wait at all.Tis can only be achieved since the company has the extra COE with them. Won't an extra stock of COE help to facilitate such transaction and bring convenience to the buyers ? </strong></blockquote><strong><span style="color: darkred;">Look again at the financial cost of holding high price COE, or high cost vehicle stocks that are financed by the Banks, and you will note that a new scheme will have to be thought out for the car industry.</span><br></strong><blockquote><strong>Originally posted by stupidissmart:<br>[b]<br>Clearly u consider yourself to be a fiancial whiz, but lack any clue on [b]sales nor stock keeping</strong>. I guess u can just stick holding tat title if u like to belittle other while bloating up your face so much.<br>[/b]</blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">I guess we cannot assume to be "jack of all trades and master of none"; either one is good at one thing, or in attempting to be good at more then one thing, we may end up being useless in both.<br><br>Try harder to be an expert in sales and stock keeping, and it will be a wonder how you will make any money in the real world.<br><br>To help you along the way, use alot more common sense, logic and a positive open mind, then perhaps you will reach the nirvana of knowledge. Unfortunately, those that proscribed in the World of Reverse Oder may not be too adapt at such rudimentary skills of common sense, logic, and having an open mind.</span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think that, even in a supply side quota, the prices will still be as high.<br><br>the problem with such auction style balloting, is that there wil always be people with too much money to spend, and those are the ones that will keep the prices high.<br><br>even if like you said, that the dealer has to pay upfront the price of the COE 1st, there are 2 ways to circumvent this, the easier of which would simply be to 1st sell the car together with an estimated bid price. where refunds would be made if there was any left over from the bidding.<br><br>the other would be to get a bank loan, which wouldn't be too hard too, as they can use their stock of cars as collateral. the banks would also be rather willing to offer such loans, as they're short term based, even at 15% per month, they would still be earning quite a sum, considering that it'll be a constant flow of income every month.</div>

I think I better rewrite it in NUMBER form otherwise your failed interpretation will result in u sliming away from the direct line of fire.<br><br>1. If u r using median approach, why not let the buyer bid for it directly and CUT off DEALER in this chain ? The dealer just concentrate on selling cars and buyer has more flexibility. And using your method, the DEALER still has to use ballot BOX again to determine who is the lucky buyer again. Thus u r using 2 steps while mine involves only 1 step.<br><br>2. Median approach is making use of luck. It has a lot of loopholes like monopoly. Example, Gov want to release 5000 COE tis month. I want to buy in ALL the COE tis month so tat I can control the market. Tis is how I bid<br><br>Amount       Number<br>$100 ------- 5000<br>$101 ------- 5000<br>$99 --------- 5000<br>$102 --------- 5000<br>$98----------- 5000<br><br>I just carry on, in the end, I will GET ALL THE 5000 COE paying only $100 for each. I only need to spend $500 000, which is just 10 COE in the present.<br><br>3. Thus in view of the above loophole, why not use the BALLOT BOX ? Tat is more superior than the MEDIAN isn't it ?<br><br>U better try to answer the above question. IF u still wanna use your old past replies, please cut it out and paste it on the following number. Don't be a slimeball again and ignore answering tis huh. If u do, I will PASTE the whole portion above everytime I reply to u.

I am saying tat presently the highest 5000 bidders get to have the COE. And the price in your NEW model will still be the same as the PRESENT model. If it isn't the same, YOUR new idea will charge the BUYER higher. So it is important for u to tell me a foolproof Gov method of selection. As I see above, u fail to come up with any.<br><br><blockquote><br>Your concern again, is based on speculation, and on your concept that is suited in a test laboratory - which can only experiment a market environment based on your limited understanding of the real world dynamics that you have only a superficial concept in</blockquote>Tat is very funny, wat is wrong with it ?

DEALERS BID in the number of CARS they believe THEY will SELL within tat MONTH. If they can't sell off ALL the COE tat month, then they will just have to bid LESSER for the following month. In tat case they won't have SURPLUS stock of COE holding up for too long. And they do not even have to FORK out a single cent since they can borrow directly from the BANK. If I buy in the COE, and may risk to hold it at most 2 months, then I will SET THE ADDITIONAL BANK FEES TO ALL THE buyers for 2 months.<br><br>Hyptothetical figures.

Lets say I bid for 300, and tis month sale is bad again, I sell of 550 again. But then I had already cleared off the 400 COE I had bought last month. Take note tat I AM CHARGING FOR 2 MONTHS interest when I sell it off to the buyer. Hence in the END, I turn out to be making a profit instead of a loss.<br><br>Tis is in the belief tat I will get the EXACT number of cars I bid from the Gov. If I use median method or something else, I may get LESSER number of COE tat month. If I DO NOT get tat amount, In other words, I bid for 900 on Oct but get only 300, won't tat just clears up my COE surplus faster. If I use advance booking as wat U suggested, meaning the buyers have to bid in ADVANCE, then the RISKS involved GET lower again.<br><br>So in the end, WAT HAS YOUR IDEA CONTRIBUTED ? Wat CONTROL mechanism has it achieved ? </blockquote><blockquote>If in a market of 5000 car buyers, all able to obtain 5000 COE, enabling them to go to whichever Dealerships - (note the Plural in this case, and not your constant SINGULAR terms) - do you think that in a SUPPLY SIDE Quota System, the same 5000 car buyers cannot already confirmed their interests with whichever DEALERSHIPS that they have decided on ?<br><br>With the confirmed orders in hand, do you think that the DEALERSHIPS will not have got ACCURATE DATA to decide the actual Quota Lots size to bid ? </blockquote>Again u have fail to understand my question. U r using your MEDIAN method right ?

I thought the <strong>comp from LTA</strong> will reject "him" aside and ask him to bid for 5 figures COE ?<br><br>My explanation : If u explain tat he got $50 is because he is lucky, then tat means the whole system is clean.

Tat is strange, u finally accept tat when price drops, demand increases. However Demand is from BUYER side isn't it ? Thus if they bid in 800, if demand increases, then they manage to sell 900.

This is because she had made her purchase with an open category COE that month.<br><br>This category is valid for six months and some car dealers offer it if a customer wants a car in a hurry or can't be bothered to bid for a COE.<br><br>But the value of an Open Category COE is based on the COE for a car of that size in the month in which the customer buys the car.<br><br>Usually, the difference is small.<br><br>But for Mrs Ng, 50, the difference turned out to be nearly $27,000.<br><br>She had bought a 1.6-litre Mazda 323 hatchback, and that month's COE for a car of that size was $101.<br><br>And that was all her COE would be worth.<br><br>She said she didn't even know about this till now as she had just returned to Singapore then, after 11 years in Papua New Guinea on business.<br><br>She claimed no-one told her anything about the implications of owning an open or Category E COE.<br><br>It was only when she wanted to buy a new car last month and tried to sell the old one that she found out.<br><br>The dealer she wanted to buy the new car from informed her that her old car's resale value would be affected because its COE was now virtually worthless.<br><br>A furious Mrs Ng went to Mazda Motor to demand an explanation.<br><br>She said she bought the Mazda because the price of $86,000 seemed attractive and she had to wait only two weeks for it.<br><br>She claimed no-one at Mazda had told her the COE would be an open category one. She felt the company was to blame for the situation.<br><br>When asked if she should have taken more responsibility for what happened, she said she had assumed that Mazda would do what was necessary to safeguard her interests.<br><br>She said: 'The lady who sold the Mazda car to me told me I had to bid for a COE, but she never said it was going to be an open category one. I told her I had just returned to Singapore after 11 years, but she still didn't explain the implications to me.'<br><br>But Mazda Motor says it is not responsible for her predicament. (See report below.)<br><br>Mrs Ng claimed the dealer's general manager told her it was not his company's responsibility to educate buyers about COEs.<br><br>'Nobody at Mazda apologised, they pushed all the responsibility to LTA (Land Transport Authority). That's what makes me so angry,' added Mrs Ng.<br><br>She then approached LTA. In a letter sent to her, LTA explained the workings of the vehicle quota system and informed her there was nothing it could do to help her recover the lost sum.<br><br>She claimed she was told that more than 300 car owners were in the same position, but LTA would not confirm this.<br><br>LTA told The New Paper that such an extreme situation is unlikely to occur again, with the current open bidding system.<br><br>With the previous 'closed' system, buyers submitted bids without knowing what others were bidding.<br><br>This led to rare but extreme discrepancies in price such as the July 2001 bid of $101 and a December 1997 bid of $50.<br><br>Now, buyers can see how much others are bidding and adjust their bids accordingly.<br><br>This transparency has helped to stabilise COE prices.<br><br>Mrs Ng's car was bought using an open category COE that Mazda had purchased in June 2001.<br><br>Now, it's worth $76 after two years of depreciation.<br><br>Now, her only alternative is to keep a car she can't wait to sell.<br><br>'Even my car insurance company has told me that if anything major happens to my car now, they will only pay according to the COE value of $76,' she said.<br><br>'It's so stressful to drive this car now.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>WHAT MAZDA MOTOR SAYS:<br><br>MAZDA Motor's marketing manager told The New Paper that it was the responsibility of the Land Transport Authority to inform the public about the different types of COEs.<br><br>Declining to be named, he said: 'LTA has the social responsibility to do that, and it has done so in many relevant publications.'<br><br>He reiterated the company's stand that there are just too many regulations on the sale of a car to explain everything.<br><br>'We try as much as possible to explain things at the point of sale, but there's no standard list of points that we follow.'<br><br>He claimed that at the time when Mrs Ng bought the car, she was informed her COE would be an open category one. That was the reason why she got her car in about two weeks.<br><br>'It's not like we bought the COE at $101 and charged her $27,048 for it. We bought it at that price too.'<br><br>Out of six car dealers The New Paper approached, only two were willing to comment on whether their sales teams are trained to inform buyers of the different COEs.<br><br>Borneo Motors, which sells Toyota vehicles, said its staff members tell buyers about the different COEs but declined to elaborate.<br><br>Kah Motors, dealer for Honda vehicles, said it had not met an incident like Mrs Ng's so far.<br><br>Its marketing manager, Mr Ricky Teo, said he understood 'a high percentage of people don't know about the open category situation'.<br><br>He added: 'COE information is open, it's just that a lot of people don't pay enough attention to it.<br><br>'LTA should highlight it more clearly. Even on their website, it's not very evident.'<br><br>Mr Teo said that as a standard procedure, his staff members explain the different COEs to buyers, and ask them which category they want to bid for.<br><br>The buyer's choice is then reflected in a written pre-sales contract.<br><br>Mr Andy Lau, sales consultant for used car dealer Car Times Automobile, said the value of Mrs Ng's car would definitely be affected by the COE, although he did not say by how much.<br><br>LTA's spokesman confirmed there wasn't anything they could do for Mrs Ng as COE values are the result of a transparent system determined by market forces.<br><br>She added that out of the 1,340 people holding the July 2001 open category COE, only those owning cars with an engine capacity of 1600cc or below would be severely affected.<br><br>That was the category in which the $101 bid was made.<br><br>Information on COEs can be found on LTA's website at www.onemotoring.com.sg.<br></div>
