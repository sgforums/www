            <div class='col-md body'>Hi "stupidissmart", so we cross path again.<br><br>If 50,000 people were to demand from a Dealership that has dared to only successfully bid for a quota allocation of 500 cars - in a SUPPLY side scheme - do you think it will be a good PR exercise for the Dealership to get around this Â“difficultyÂ” by holding a balloting exercise to determine who will be the lucky 500 new owners ?<br><br>Like I mentioned, this idea and the solutions offered may not be the final and best approach, but at least it beats the stupidity of paying the peak price of $50,000 PLUS for a piece of paper called COE, just to own a vehicle for only TEN YEARS.<br><br>Is it so difficult to stretch the STUPIDITY of this idea - of SUPPLY side control - with a SMART change in perspective ?<br><br>Why do you insist on having to participate in a COE bidding system that is NOT TRANSPARENT, and with the bid prices being suspiciously manipulated when convenient or to suit some agenda ?<br><br>Have you not noticed that each time when a fleet of taxis - (from any one of the GLC owned taxi companies) - is due for replacement, the COE will co-incidentally come sliding down to levels that are up to $10,000 lower then normal.<br><br>If you believe that being Â“stupid is smartÂ” surely this stupid idea is also a smart idea as an alternative to the COE system ?<br><br>Or do you believe that being honest and admit the creativity of a new idea can damage your credo of Â“stupid-is-smartÂ” ?<br><br></div>

Wat if tat store is the only store tat sell mercedes, or watever brand and model in Singapore ? They will then have more flexibility in charging the price of COEs isn't it ?<br></strong></blockquote>The difference with the COE system is that the buyers money is involved while the Dealership only pay a token fee at bidding time. In a SUPPLY SIDE situation the Dealership will have to pay for the FULL AMOUNT UP FRONT when the quota is awarded.<br><br>Who is to stop the Dealership from making a quick buck with the SUPPLY SIDE quota bid price ? At least, the mark-up will be from a lower base price instead of 5-digits being paid for a COE.<br><blockquote><strong><br>5) wat if again 5000 potential car owners wanna buy the 500 COE from a dealer.

In such a situation, speculative instinct will be moderated, as the interest paid on capital spent for the quota bid price will have to be considered. What is there to prevent the bid price from falling (similarly in the COE system) ? Will the Dealership dare to speculate with a SUPPLY SIDE quota control system ?<br><blockquote><strong><br>7) And lastly, another thing which u avoid to answer, is why deprive Gov from collecting COE ? They in the end will spend the same and will seek to increase tax from other areas which will affect everyone, including the poor.

How sure are you that every cent collected goes to pay for all the good of all Singaporeans ?<br><br>Ask again if the COE was intended to be a TAX COLLECTION MECHANISM when it was first initiated ?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>If it is a lousy idea, face it and humbly step down. </strong></blockquote>Glad to see that you no longer address this idea as being "Stupid" but have promoted it to a level of being "Lousy", not so sure if it is being "smart" on your part to do so.<br><br>Like I have mentioned, this is not the FINAL and END-ALL SOLUTION, but an alternative idea to the COE system which is NON-TRANSPARENT, and is now being manipulated by the Government against its ORIGINAL OBJECTIVE of using it to CONTROL THE GROWTH OF THE CAR POPULATION in Singapore.<br><br>The Government is increasing the COE Quota with every exercise, because the revenue collected is so lucrative.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think u r the one tat fail to read clearly bah, from your stupid reply of telling me your idea again. If u really like to personally attack my nick, and if u really seems to have nolstagic for the word 'stupid' , I will peppered the use of it up in here so tat it is more suitable for u<br><br>First, wat make u think the dealership r so poor as they can't afford to buy in the cheaper version of COE ? They can afford to buy in cars, they can afford the many squre feet of showroom and people, wat make u think they cannot come up with $50,000, or $100,000 if need be ? I think their renovation come up to at least a 100 thousands ! As I have said, they will buy according to how much cars they <strong>sold per month</strong>. If they sell 700, they will order 800 COE isn't it ? They have to raise tat money through bank through loans watever if they really do not have the cash. Don't tell me because if they can't afford it, then buy in only 50 right ! Isn't tat stupid ? Then they just had to work for 3 days tat month and close shop as they sell out all the COE,and had to wait till the next COE bidding day !!!<br><br>All your stupid crap just keep rotating about tis big <strong>assumption</strong> tat u have. The demand will be lesser than the supply set by quota. Can u <strong>100% </strong>say tat it will always happen ? Wat fiance sort of crap is just plain crap as wat I have explained earlier, they fixed the number of COE bought by their <strong>sale volume</strong>. <strong>If </strong>quota cannot fulfil the demand of bidders, which it highly likely will, then wat is your solution ? Please don't come up with answer such as "it won't happened lah because bla bla bla". Lets say it happened already, wat r u going to do ? Answer it to the point ! How does Gov do its selection !<br><br>In the end, if without using the ballot box, the quota sent to Gov will still rise due to high demand, and in the end they will charge a high price to dealer and in the end they will pass the cost to the consumer. Wat u have done is just add another link to the chain, another rung of ladder for the consumer. U in fact just increase the complications and the coffers of the dealer. Tis will make other poeple invest in COE too, which they will push up the price,increasing the demand of COE. Gov will have to raise the price again since demand is greater now. Wat have your stupid idea come to ? Higher COE !<br><br>U better read point 2 again. If I need to buy in more quota lot, I will not just use my name but my relatives', employees' name, my spouse name to buy ownership too. Then won't it forfeit your <strong>stupid </strong>idea of charging more for additional lots u buy ?<br><br>Another argument against your stupid fixed quota size. If a brand mitsubishi sell 700 cars a month, and he deicded to buy only 500 COE because they will be "overcharged" from your great idea previously, while BMW sell 300 a month and force to buy 500 COE as there aren't any other smaller denominators suggested by u again. Suppose I wanted to buy a mitsubish. But in the end I was turned down as it has ran out of COE, I will be forced to buy BMW tat month isn't it ? Does your fixed quota make any sense then ?? If I am importing Porche, importing a or 2 car per month, how much lots should I buy then ?<br><br>Read point 5 carefully again,<br><br>Why will dealer ever choose balloting when he can go for aunctioning tat will give him more profit ? They r profit orientated isn't it ? Business is meant to make money, they r not here doing charity. Only can Gov to do such things direct to car owners,as wat I have suggested previously.<br><br>U really underestimate the potential of dealing with COE. Singapore definitely will have people buying cars right ? And the demand will be much greater than the quota given by Gov. The real price will definitely be higher than the "proposed" lower price u want the gov to set. The demand for COE will be the push factor for maintaining the price. Paying upright may be very difficult to u, but there r tons of rich guys around in Singapore using money to buy property, shares and etc. If your only deterent is just having a large capital, then I have to say it won't work. If the return is high, no matter how much the price is, people will invest in it. In the case u r really stupid, there r people investing hundreds of thousands to a mere business plan just to have the hope of getting back the money in a matter of many years, and the risk of losing it all is very great. I don't see why they will not buy the relatively safer COE for investment instead. If Gov quota is 5000, and each cost $1000, I think it is easy to monopolise the market using the many relatives' IC approach, needing only just $5 million dollars in capital. U again think tat is huge ? Then u really have to start work in a fiance company boy.<br><br>Why is the COE not open and transparent to u ? The price is really paid  by how much they bid, and the expected price is shown on the net everyday. Wat part is invinsible to u ? R u going to ask from Gov for something not practical again ?<br><br>The idea is not about how the Gov spend tax money, it is about if Gov should use tis method to gather tax money. Do u think tis is a bad way of taxing ?<br><br>U feel tat the money is not well spent by Gov when it collect COE as tax. U think u will do a better job ? From your stupid suggestion for COE, I can see how good your problem solving ability is. Your suggestion has no value added in it, creating more problems and u refuse to face tat point. Go back, read my 7 points again and reply instead of re-telling everyone wat your idea is all about again. Please answer my first point. This is third time I ask u to reply tat question.<br><br>Frankly I can not even see a single advantage nor any feasibility compared to the old COE method. Too much loop holes and not well thought, I think u better start from formula again.</div>

There is nothing personal about your nick, except that the position that you have adopted Â– time and again Â– seems to be that you are living up to your credo (that being stupid is really smart ! ) .<br><br>Why do you say "First, wat make u think the dealership r so poor as they can't afford to buy in the <strong><span style="color: red;">cheaper version of COE </span></strong>?" Are you referring to my SUPPLY SIDE quota as the CHEAPER version of COE ? Are you objecting because it is cheaper than what you are accustomed to pay for NORMAL COE ?<br><br>No where in my post have I suggested that the dealership will be too poor (nor will they ever be so un-resourceful not to follow the creative methods that you have listed to obtain the funds) Â“to buy in the cheaper version of COEÂ” Â– (which I presume that you are reluctant to mention as SUPPLY SIDE quota system ? ) .<br><br>However, if you read my points again, I did say that they will have to consider their bid prices very carefully, as they will have to pay up front Â– (on successfully being awarded the quota lot according to their successful bid price) Â– when compared to the present situation where the Dealership need only pay $100 for the application form, and pay the balance of the COE price on completion of the car transaction.<br><br>There is little risk on the side of the Dealership for the COE prices that they bid on behalf of the Car Buyer.<br><br>Certainly, the Dealership can afford to buy in cars, pay for showrooms, and employ dozens of sales persons, and come up with more funds to pay for the quota in a SUPPLY SIDE quota system.<br><br>The point is that this time around, every quota lot that is successfully tendered by a Dealership will have to be paid for UPFRONT, which will add to the cost of the cars that are brought into stock.<br><br>Certainly, the Dealership will plan their preferred quota lot size according to how many cars they sell per month Â– (as you and I have mentioned).<br><blockquote><strong><br>If they sell 700, they will order 800 COE isn't it ?

There is little or no transparency as to which fools have placed the bids at such high prices of $50,000 PLUS (as had happened before) .<br><br>If a Dealership sell 700, and they will order 800 cars in a SUPPLY SIDE quota system, then they will run the risk of having to pay IMMEDIATELY the cost of the quota for the ADDITIONAL 100 cars to be brought into stock Â– over and above the 700 that they would normally sell per month.<br><br>Will any Dealership risk doing so, when the quota price may be available lower in the next bidding exercise in a SUPPLY SIDE quota system ?<br><br>If they can afford it, I did not say that a Dealership need to buy only 50 cars, instead of buying 800 cars, when they can sell 700 cars Â– (if I get the drift of your confused position correctly) .<br><br>In my SUPPLY SIDE quota system, the OBJECTIVE is to control the growth of the car population, as the Government has indicated the objective to be for its "Normal" COE system.<br><br>So whether if it is in a DEMAND SIDE Â– (Normal COE quota system) - or SUPPLY SIDE (your Cheaper COE quota system) is being followed, <strong><span style="color: red;">any Dealership will just have to wait till the next month when all the cars (or COE) are sold out according to what are the number of cars allotted to be sold in either systems for a given period</span>.</strong><br><br>So what is your problem in accepting either one of the systems that serves the OBJECTIVE of controlling the GROWTH of the VEHICLE POPULATION ? Do you prefer the NORMAL COE and reject the CHEAPER COE version (SUPPLY SIDE quota system) ?<br>[quote]<strong><br>All your stupid crap just keep rotating about tis big [b]assumption</strong> tat u have. <span style="color: blue;">The demand will be lesser than the supply set by quota.</span> Can u <strong>100% </strong>say tat it will always happen ? Wat fiance sort of crap is just plain crap as wat I have explained earlier, they fixed the number of COE bought by their <strong>sale volume</strong>. <strong>If </strong>quota cannot fulfil the demand of bidders, which it highly likely will, then wat is your solution ? Please don't come up with answer such as "it won't happened lah because bla bla bla". Lets say it happened already, wat r u going to do ? Answer it to the point ! How does Gov do its selection ! [/b]If you can set aside trying to be smart while being stupid, and try to be objective then perhaps you will understand that all proposal will have to follow certain assumptions, until the reality of any situation prove such assumptions in a proposal to be right or wrong.<br><br>Nowhere did I write in my SUPPLY SIDE quota control system that DEMAND will be LESSER than SUPPLY.<br><br>How on earth did you read this into my post ?<br><br>Read again the purpose of the DEMAND SIDE quota control through the COE system, or the SUPPLY SIDE quota control system Â– they both are meant to CONTROL the GROWTH of the VEHICLE POPULATION.<br></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong><br>Another argument against your stupid fixed quota size. If a brand mitsubishi sell 700 cars a month, and he deicded to buy only 500 COE because they will be "overcharged" from your great idea previously, while BMW sell 300 a month and force to buy 500 COE as there aren't any other smaller denominators suggested by u again. Suppose I wanted to buy a mitsubish. But in the end I was turned down as it has ran out of COE, I will be forced to buy BMW tat month isn't it ? Does your fixed quota make any sense then ?? If I am importing Porche, importing a or 2 car per month, how much lots should I buy then ? </strong></blockquote>Surely now, if you can afford to buy a BMW, why even consider a Mitsubishi in the first place ? If you can only afford to buy a Mitsubishi, I am not sure if you have enough budget even to be forced to buy a BMW.<br><br>If one has to be stupid, it does not take too much smart effort to do so in trying to be a Car Dealer and wondering the quota lot size to bid for when importing any make of car.<br><br>Obviously, you are not an entrepreneur who can overcome the challenges of a new idea ?<br><blockquote><strong><br>Read point 5 carefully again,<br><br>Why will dealer ever choose balloting when he can go for aunctioning tat will give him more profit ? They r profit orientated isn't it ? Business is meant to make money, they r not here doing charity. Only can Gov to do such things direct to car owners,as wat I have suggested previously. </strong></blockquote>When a Dealer is successful in getting the quota lot size Â– in a SUPPLY SIDE quota system, he can dispose of the available cars to be sold in any manner the Dealership wish.<br><br>Nowhere did I suggest that the Dealership must only resort to balloting, as I had indicated that it is only GOOD PUBLIC RELATIONS that the Dealership does so to overcome the greater number of buyers against the limited quota of cars available to be sold<br><br>Again, you have allowed Â“stupidity to get in the way of being smartÂ” Â– since the Car Dealership is only interested in selling his stock of cars, and not exactly trying to squeeze every available dollar from the Car Buyer through a wild auction system. How will you react to such a Car Dealership, if you have the budget to be a Car Buyer ?<br><blockquote><strong><br>U really underestimate the potential of dealing with COE. Singapore definitely will have people buying cars right ? And the demand will be much greater than the quota given by Gov. The real price will definitely be higher than the "proposed" lower price u want the gov to set. The demand for COE will be the push factor for maintaining the price. Paying upright may be very difficult to u, but there r tons of rich guys around in Singapore using money to buy property, shares and etc. If your only deterent is just having a large capital, then I have to say it won't work. If the return is high, no matter how much the price is, people will invest in it. In the case u r really stupid, there r people investing hundreds of thousands to a mere business plan just to have the hope of getting back the money in a matter of many years, and the risk of losing it all is very great. I don't see why they will not buy the relatively safer COE for investment instead. If Gov quota is 5000, and each cost $1000, I think it is easy to monopolise the market using the many relatives' IC approach, needing only just $5 million dollars in capital. U again think tat is huge ? Then u really have to start work in a fiance company boy. </strong></blockquote>If there are Â“tons of rich guys around in Singapore using money to buy property, shares, and etc.Â” then the property market will not be so gloomy, the stock exchange index would have surged with high volume turnover, and the basic economic outlook will not be as gloomy as it is today in Singapore. So where are your rich guys ?<br><br>Are ownership of COE transferable ? Can one actually bid for a COE and resell it at a higher price ?<br><blockquote><strong><br>Why is the COE not open and transparent to u ? The price is really paid  by how much they bid, and the expected price is shown on the net everyday. Wat part is invinsible to u ? R u going to ask from Gov for something not practical again ? </strong></blockquote>If you think that the COE system is transparent then you truly live up to your credo and there is nothing more that need to be explained to try to help you to turn around.<br><br>For the benefit of the others, who have been following our series of exchanges, perhaps they will agree that it will be more transparent if the names of those putting up the bids are also displayed. If you believe in the auction system, which is a LIVE EVENT, then the COE system should be as LIVE as can be possible, so as to ensure that realistic bids are put by REAL PEOPLE, and not Â“ghostsÂ”.<br><blockquote><strong><br>The idea is not about how the Gov spend tax money, it is about if Gov should use tis method to gather tax money. Do u think tis is a bad way of taxing ?<br><br>U feel tat the money is not well spent by Gov when it collect COE as tax. U think u will do a better job ? From your stupid suggestion for COE, I can see how good your problem solving ability is. Your suggestion has no value added in it, creating more problems and u refuse to face tat point. Go back, read my 7 points again and reply instead of re-telling everyone wat your idea is all about again. Please answer my first point. This is third time I ask u to reply tat question.<br><br>Frankly I can not even see a single advantage nor any feasibility compared to the old COE method. Too much loop holes and not well thought, I think u better start from formula again. </strong></blockquote>Taxing is one thing, but Â“milkingÂ” the Citizens is another thing.<br><br>If you prefer the Government to Â“milkÂ” us in every possible way, as what the Government is doing to Singaporeans Â– by cornering every types of services that Singaporeans need daily, and through every single transaction performed via GST, ERP, HDB and URA car parks in every and any available space for every minute of the day and night.<br><br>The COE system was originally set out to CONTROL the GROWTH of the vehicle population in Singapore, and as stated, it has become so lucrative, that the original objective seems to have been lost; and the Government is now increasing the COE quota every month.<br><br>Perhaps in living up to your credo, you have lost sight of this event, and assume that the Government is looking after you Â– (with the issuing of Singapore Shares, HDB Upgrading Programs and other Â“bribesÂ” that you end up paying for ) , while taking more out of your pocket on a daily basis without you even feeling the pinch until it hurts.<br><br>Maybe there is some truth in your being Â“stupid-is-smartÂ” so as to be able to accept these Government Â“milkingÂ” actions in a justifiably positive manner, and forget the original declared objective made with the COE system. Sleep soundly in the arms of the Government and let it milk you while you go into deep slumber.<br></div>

NOW car owners do not require any help from DEALER at all in bidding for COE. They get to bid themselves. Who actually go through a car agent to buy a COE now ??? I wanted a car, I buy the COE direct from Gov, then after obtaining the cert I go over to the car dealers and select my car. TAT IS ALL ! Why go to a dealer and ask them to bid for me ? If u r lazy and stupid, asking dealer to bid for u, don't blame gov but blame yourself as the dealer not the one paying the COE in the end, the dealer just want u to get the COE in the end.<br><br>PRESENT: Gov -&gt; Buyer<br><br>STUPID IDEA : Gov -&gt; Dealer -&gt; Buyer<br><br>Isn't tat adding another rung of ladder to the red tape, the complication and the problems with your "smart" idea ?

If I bid for a car, and I bid at a high amount, why will I want other peoople to see I am the one bidding for it ? To me tis is my personal privacy. When the bid is over, there will be people claiming the COE isn't it ?? Using auction ? Why downgrade to a lower system when we have a more superior system on line now ? THERE R 5000 COE to fill up ! Do u expect people to sit there for 3 days 3 nights to finish auctioning for it all ?? There may be 50000 people trying to buy COE. U want it to held at national stadium ? WILL THE PRICE BE FAIR ?? The initially price may be very different than the price of the last COE sold.<br><br>As I say, I am asking if u think tis a bad way of taxing. I am not asking how Gov is spending the tax money. However your idea of the supply system has fail miserably. So u got any smart ideas to replace it ?<br><br>Your attack seems groundless as u keep feeling your idea is good. I have asked for four times now. If there is an overbidding from Gov quota, wat is gov going to do ? They raise the bidding price, go to ballot box or wat ?</div>

I will ignore other points till u come to senses and answer the question I wanted u to answer. Since u r so brain dead, I will use a more child like approach to explain the situation to u<br><br>Once upon a time, there was a small kingdom in the far east. The kingdom is small, as stated in the previous sentence, thus decided to employ SIngapore way of controlling cars, which is COE. The COE gradually rises to a very high level due to the high demand for cars in the kingdom.<br><br>Then came a stupid senseless consultant named Atobe and use the "supply" control method of controlling vehicles. The blur and good hearted king decide to use it, and "fine tune" its policy according to Atobe and inform all its citizen about the new changes.<br><br>The traffic advisor suggested to open up no more than 5000 COE tat month to establish normal growth, thus king decide to use 5000 as its quota for tat month.<br><br>The bidding day come after much anticipaton. To the king surprise, 50,000 bids came in for the 5000 slots available for tat month. The king now do not know <strong>how to choose who is getting how much COE </strong>available, and he approach back Atobe for the solution.<br><br>Imagine u r tat Atobe, how r u going to advise the king on how to select which 5000 bids will get the COE ?<br><br>I guess u r still sticking to your point and refusing to answer my question because u have no good answer for it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I never know u can be so vulnerable till tis stage, and all tat is holding your stand is creating confusion by answer a different question to the one posed, and trying to make the other party sounds silly, thus moltivated to stop asking tat question. Com'on, is tat all u can do ?<br><br>If u refuse to answer tis question, it proves U R JUST A TALK C,O,C,K person who being such a big coward, using verbal slippiness, to ignore a simple problem posed. Clearly one tat had  known tat is the biggest loop hole in his solution. If u refuse to answer tis one question, then talking more doesn't mean anything as tis is one of the fundamental element in your solution, and u have no solution to it. I will treat all those comments insulting my IQ level as a way of u trying to escape notice, and will treat u no greater than a naughty boy trying to avoid answering a question by creating distractions.<br><br>If u think I am speechless about all your other points, then think again.
