Germany almost took over the world (if not for the 'truth' that prevailed)<br>As Md Ghandi said (attribuited): "an eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind".<br><br>Perhaps the US could have used a more calculated and matured approach to the solve the Saddam crisis, why ennact so much horror to catch that poor old Iraqi looser?<br><br>Intelligent weapons, devastating explosions have we created, but regretfully placed both in the hands of immature and beligerent politicians.....<br><br>Why?... Have the masses forgotten the meaning humanity, humility and the spirit of good will?<br>Duty, honour, country begins with voting for the good of the community, good of humanity, and NOT primarily for upgrading or personal welfare; we MUST have higher ideals.<br><br>The people of this world have different interests and agendas which they selfishly persue.... to bad that they have forgotten that in cooperation CAN *ALL* their true agendas be achieved together (as God hath provided for) but regretfully, they have regressed to the state....

            <div class='col-md body'>World peace will only come when every last human is wiped off the face of the planet, and no sooner. I do not see why people find the idea of human extinction so repugnant, it's clear that we humans have completely fucked up every thing that we have done, and are completely fucked up ourselves. The illusion that we live by is that we are a positive manifestation, but we are not, human life is a negative, an illness, something we should strive to shake off, and the human race is no more important to the workings of the earth than ants are. But the humans will never face up to this fact, they will keep plodding on, living out their meaningless lives, labouring under the delusion that they matter more than maggots do, and, when on their breaks from fucking one another senseless, will continue to hack everyone to bits. The humans will never face up to the fact that life is a disease, rather, in the complete absence of sanity, will pass this disease on to child after child after child, dooming their begotten to the same wretched world they always wanted to escape, but never had the guts to do so.<br><br>When you have 6 billion of us, 6 billion beach apes, all with passions to control and wills to power, it aint gonna happen. Put two humans in the same room for any longer than 48 hours, and one of them will be left butchered, his head on a stick, his dick nailed to the wall.<br><br>PS:The above statement i replied is not originally written by me and it is taken from another website forum where i post a similar topic like you and i get this reply which i think can answer your question.<br></div>
