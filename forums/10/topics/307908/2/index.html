              <p>I did just that while doing student exchange... But after a while, it became rather sian... The interest will be there for a month or two, but after a while, you will start to feel that everything is very similar... Especially at Paris, when you do not know French, the French can get rather unfriendly towards Asians. Knowing just bonjour and merci is not sufficient. The same goes for certain parts of Berlin, of which it was fortunate that I know sufficient German.</p>

              <p>I would even move to US to work in Silicon Valley if I was really after all those Westernised dreams and ideals. Anyway I will be working in a US MNC for the next 3 years... with opportunities to go the US facility for training</p>
