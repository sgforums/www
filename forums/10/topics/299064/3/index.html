Wouldn't that be beneficial to your arguments?<br><br>You are asking for "Date of dismissal, Company's name, (Singaporean's Surname and initial, Age, Salary, Years of working experience, sex), if possible Foreign Talent's information such as Surname and initial, Age, Salary, Years of working experience, sex" as evidence of FTs robbing jobs as evidence<br><br>But how about us asking you, would you give us your Date of employment, Company's name, (Singaporean's Surname and initial, Age, Salary, Years of working experience, sex) to give us evidence that FTs are indeed not robbing locals of jobs?<br><br>My point is, this form of "collecting evidence" by asking private information here, and making conclusions when others do not want to give out private information, is wrong.<br><br>However, even if FTs managed to rob locals of jobs because of skill, my question to everyone who are against FT policy is, why is it wrong? So we are to say that Singapore companies should not employ FTs?<br><br>Imagine this, if a foreign company full of FTs (FT in the eyes of Singaporeans) replaced a whole company (only sgreans) in Singapore in the global business arena, wouldn't more locals too be 'robbed' of their jobs? For example the company Creative. Do you think it fared better than Apple? Do you think that if Creative employs mainly Singaporeans, would it have done better? And without doing better, they might have to retrench or close down, and thus, locals would be 'robbed' of jobs by the company Apple, in which the workers are in our eyes, FTs? Either way, it just mean that your jobs will be 'robbed' by foreigners if you don't have the necessary skills.<br><br>Just for information, Singapore public service itself has about 120k employees. Also, if you have walked many shopping centres in Singapore, many in the service industry are also Singaporeans. In addition, the many school children (above age 15) who worked part time to finance their own pocket money would also be considered employed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>my emphasis is for one to write more facts when he gets emotional of the FT/Local problem.  One could be drawn into self-panic if he just rely on the information found on public forums.

            <div class='col-md body'>To Mr Daddy,<br><br>I will not be divulging more info but I can tell you the info is accurate as I am part of the management and and would obviously be partly involved in the recruitment. Thus, I also have a good feel of the situation. It is also ridiculous of you to ask ppl to divulge salary. Even I would not know exactly my subordinates salary.<br><br>A number of my fellow FT colleagues have worked in this company for many years and most do want to become Singaporean citizens as in the case of one of fellow colleague. The usual trend seems to be either the wife or husband will convert to Singapore citizenship. Now if we also put this "converted" Singaporeans into the equation, I can tell you the porportion of actual FT taking away professional jobs is even more significant.<br><br>Just looking at the ratio I've given, it is obvious that the competition is fierce. If only I did a count of the job applicants and look at the profile, I can relate even more accurately the situation. But that's not my job.<br><br>The way I look at it is although the threat of FT is tremendous, it is necessary to keep Singapore very competitive otherwise which a number of companies would already fold up from global competition and otherwise which many MNC would not want to locate their HQ in Singapore. If the government tightens the control on FT, the FT would naturally go elsewhere and we probably would see a drop in competitiveness of Singapore companies.<br><br>Nonetheless, it is important that our government ensures every Singaporean is given at least a starting job where Singaporeans can have a foundation to compete with the FT. And I must say the job of retaining competitiveness vs giving Singaporeans their bread and butter is a tough one. Finding that optimal point is not only difficult but very subjective!<br><br></div>

If you upgrade, upgrade with the relevant skills and make sure to apply them relevantly. The latter is rather tough for most to accomplish.<br><br>I would say, more importantly, to retain a job you must be continuously valuable to the company. Again, it's a tough one especially when we start to age and slow down on both our physical and mental capabilities. To be valuable, one way is of course to upgrade ourselves relevantly.<br><br>However, I would debate against your example. 20% job loss could make a lot of difference and could mean a loss of customer and competitiveness of the company. 20% of the job loss could also have more repercussions because that 20% can affect other parties. Lastly, experience can indeed be gained but it takes a lot of time and the right working attitude and someone will be sacrificing and spending more of his time to explain to him. If a company keeps doing such thing, it will be difficult to grow.</div>
