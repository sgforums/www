Expats come and do not stay for long, i have a Jap colleague who was in charge of Japanese customers cannot accustomed to Singapore's lifestyle.<br><br>True they are cheaper in terms of without to pay them CPF, but do you know how much levy to pay for these ppl in order for them to work for you?<br>Many ppl are in the rat race, peer comparison at large. Workers tend to look more on what they can get from the company rather than what they can give to the company.<br><br>Globalisation has taken place and many are still frogs in the well, mergers are common to reduce similar trade competitions and to cut down cost. Only thing to do is to constantly upgrade yourself to be ahead of times and not to whine abt government is not taking care of you.<br><br>Sad to say, we are 'pampered'. i have heard of stories of living standards in Japan whereby the son has to carry on his father debts of housing loan. We are considered lucky to be able to have CPF to cover for this aspects.<br><br>The internet is a wonderful technology and do not use it just for the sake of meer entertainment, read wisely to expand your knowledge.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe it is industry related.<br><br>Fact is, the number of foreigners + PRs exceed the number of Singaporeans in the total labour force in Singapore (1.16 : 1), but a certain forumer continued not to accept this fact, and in fact, took it as a form of an attack, which I have no idea why.<br><br>Fact is, public service, the largest employer in Singapore, employ mostly Singaporeans, and thus, how would one expect a high ratio of Sgreans working in other companies? Yet a certain forumer failed to accept this point and decide to use his wonderful amount of working experience as a backing to his baseless claim.<br><br>Fact is, my calculations has shown at least a 96% employment rate of citizens, assuming 100% employment of foreigners + PRs, and as explained earlier, it is highly likely that a high proportion is in government agencies (SAF, GIC, DSO, MINDEF, etc, etc). Thus the normal observations of more foreigners in private companies. However, a certain forumer would continue to correct me that many foreigners are indeed snatching locals of their jobs because he has seen 3 companies, one of which has 20 employees, and in total &lt;0.1% of the labour force of Singapore.<br><br>Fact is, there are certainly loopholes here and there for employers to exploit such that it seems like they have a good citizen to foreigners ratio on paper, yet in actual fact more foreigners than normal. Thus the averages in the statistics can sometimes mislead, and these loopholes are the main thing that is worth discussing. Yet a certain forumer would continue to harp on the statistics, and not why the numbers could be screwed up due to these loopholes.<br><br>Fact is, there are indeed Singaporeans who were displaced by cheaper foreign talents from China and India. Yet imagine, Singapore was a country that relied on foreign workers since its founding. Have our ancestors not also displaced the original "inhabitants" of the land of Singapore too?<br><br>Fact is, even if you do go abroad to work, there are 2 things that can happened. Firstly, you could too get displaced by cheaper workers from India and China too; they migrate everywhere. Secondly, you will also be regarded as a foreigner that displaced a local of his/her work; you are doing exactly the same thing that you have despised.<br><br>Fact is, if you have the real ability, you would be able to rise up in this sea of foreign workers. With the real ability, you could lead them in work, instead of competing with them for work. Manage them. Get them to do the work for you. Why compete in an area they have an advantage of? Know your advantages, and make full use of them to have an edge. The never ending problem occurs when people only think linearly of competing in an area without any advantage.<br><br>Sigh.........</div>
