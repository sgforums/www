              It's the same issue with the import of foreign scientists, doctors,

              I think the main interest is the benefits it would get us.  and whether we need the medal in the first place. 
              
              <p> for the scientist, doctors, talents, etc , if done properly and with good enough discretion, it's to keep our economy up and improve our standards. Thus ensuring survival or standards of living. 
              
              </p><p> It's not the case for these medals. Getting these medals do not benefit singapore other than as a talking point or for the people to feel proud (or patriotism, etc) of. It's essentiallynot needed and thus comes the question of why do we need to spend so much and spend on foreign talents for it. Using local talents would also instil more pride.</p>

              That's the trouble with our system. We're only concerned with paper qualifications as that will ensure a good career which pays well. All other matters such as sports and culture are secondary.

              <p>I am a table tennis player myself.I heard alot of inside stories
                  about STTA.I dont want to get into any lawer letters, so i will not
                  say the stories.But the fact i still had to say is,STTA real motive is to get more medals to please the PAP MP so
                  that they will get more seed money,but where the money go to?Make a
                  guess!<span style="color: #ff0000;">STTA are not taking the time to groom local sport talents,
                  but prefer to use ready make players for battle.Fullstop!!!  </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If u refer to the interview i post here,i did not hear Li Jia Wei mentioned</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">HOME COUNTRY or Home Land</span>.what she mentioned was it is my TERRITORITY--</p>
              <p>i quote her:<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">åœ°ç›˜----</span></span></em></strong></p>
              <p>one of forumer alredai said this term.</p>
              <p>well.she was born and grew up in Beijing till aged 13 or 14 before</p>
              <p>she came to SG.So,it is her Beijing.Dunt blacken her.Ok?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SG and their efforts made them Top 10,not PRC's effort</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>When Li and Fang joined SG team 15 years and last year,</p>
              <p>they have no place in world table tennis .</p>
              <p>If they were Top 20 when they came to SG,then u can say</p>
              <p>SG bought them over to win medals.</p>
              <p>But they were very low ranking or not in ranking</p>
              <p>when they came.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>3 came to SG when not so succeful</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Li came direct from Beijing when she found not much hope</p>
              <p>got into Main team15 years ago.Did SG pay very well to her</p>
              <p>or spent much effort in table tennis then?I forgot lah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fang went to Japan to play in 2005 when she found no hope</p>
              <p>getting into PRC Main Team.Together with Wang,Fang were</p>
              <p>persuaded by SG coach Liu in Japan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If they already made to the Main Team of PRC,they needed not come</p>
              <p>to SG lah,stupid!!You know it is easy make into PRC Main Team Ah??</p>
              <p>U have Top in City,Province,selections ,Second team.Youth team</p>
              <p>etc before are in Main Team.u think just becos Li stayed in Beijing</p>
              <p>then she could make to Main Team easier then others?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Dunt insult them and yourself</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>i hope it is a honest mistake by alleging  Li said''i fight in Home Land'</p>

              <p>Sporting success can unify a nation...just look at the number of native Singaporeans who were rooting for our table-tennis players. With the influx of foreign-born citizens in recent years, success at the Olympics by new citizens can help reduce the enmity against them, whipped up by many in this forum. As long as the majority of Singaporeans feel proud that a foreign-born citizen raises the Singapore flag at sporting events, then this foreign sporting talent policy will be supported.</p>

              <p>Gao Ning incident---without a coach in the Game match.</p>
              <p>She first aired her angry right after Gao's lost match.</p>
              <p>Today ST reported she sacked Team Manager and</p>

              <p>OMG!! Does she want to build STTA from stretch,</p>
              <p>when we just wins a Silver Medal and she sitting on the seat for</p>
              <p>a month?</p>
              <p>Even the soft spoken SG IOC member Ng Ser Miang said:</p>
              <p>''I am shocked at the timing as well as the manner in which</p>
              <p>this decision has been made.''</p>
              <p>''I am quite puzzled as to how a decision like that can be made</p>
              <p>by The STTA president ,who has been in office for just over a month.''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Manager Antony Lee said he was not told about the firing nor asked</p>
              <p>to explain the incident.He said he deserved a little bit of respect.</p>
              <p>I agree with Mr Lee,even SG did not win any medal.</p>
              <p>He should had been asked to explain after</p>
              <p>tomorrow   Celebration Party.There was no human touch</p>
              <p>and lack of communications in the handling of this case.</p>
              <p>The timing and manner need to be investigated.</p>
              <p>We just wins a medal and she want to get new CEO and Technical</p>
              <p>Director for STTA!! What are the grounds?She better explain</p>
              <p>to all stake holders,including LHL!!</p>
              <p>I think Sports Council,SG Olymlics Committee,MCYS and</p>

              <p>What troubled me was not that he lost, but the outburst by Ms Lee
              Bee Wah, president of the Singapore Table Tennis Association (STTA)
              about her unhappiness over the absence of a coach on the sidelines
              while Gao Ning played. As the new president of the association, I
              suppose Ms Lee must have high expectations of her team and I can
              understand her frustration when things did not go as planned. But to
              speak to the Press in a post-game interview in an accusing manner was
              totally uncalled for, especially knowing that our player is still in
              contention for a medal. If I were on the coaching staff, I am sure my
              morale would be affected; how would I be able to carry on doing a good
              job with the remaining games? Ms Lee should have aired her displeasure
              behind closed doors with the board of the STTA after the Olympics and
              not on national television. If we want to continue to celebrate more
              successes, we urgently need to learn how to manage our failures.'</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>In a shock announcement, Singapore Table Tennis Association
              president Lee Bee Wah told The Sunday Times yesterday that the services
              of team manager Antony Lee are not needed anymore.</p>
              <p>Some view as not only too rash but also harsh, is sure to put a
              dampener on the team's scheduled celebrations when they arrive back in
              Singapore tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Ms Lee, who took over as STTA president, her first foray into
              sports, said: 'I have a new team and will have a new CEO and technical
              director. It is best that the manager is chosen by them. Antony is
              welcome to apply for the position when we ask for applications.' But a
              clearly upset Mr Lee, 39, did not take kindly to the news.</p>

              <p>Well well well, I still think China won both the Gold and Silver in the woman team event. All imported "Talent" my foot. Look at Susilo, drop out of study on the pretext of wanting to do well in badminton, I think he spend more time in BEDmintion. Always excuse for losing. 1 win against China number one is his only talk of topic and I guess that will be his only talk for a long long time.</p>
              <p>The Table Tennis is a joke, Feng just became citizen this year Jan and spend her training in China for 3 years or more. The other two, haha keep losing to ranking lower then them. Li JW ranked 6th in the world and lost to Korean rank 11th. Both time in major events...what a joke. Our man team, what a shame, cry because no coach and did not even try. Throw away the game and put the blame on no coach. Come on, he is better off saying is nanny is not there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bottom line, if we want ot win Gold, try giving enough money to Michael Phelps and we will have 8 or more in the next Olympic. No glory when everyone buying "talent" and very blind doing it or maybe money not enough.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>lionosey said  "hope it is a honest mistake by alleging  Li said''i fight in Home Land'".  I don't think it was a mistake.  Jiawei said in a CCTV talkshow earlier this year, that being a "Beijing resident and a Chinese national" she felt proud to play in Beijing. She did not identify herself as Singaporean. In the interview, she mentioned the mosquitoes in Singapore and the world's highest reward prize money Singapore will pay her if she gets the gold medal.</div>
