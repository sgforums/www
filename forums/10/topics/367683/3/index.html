              <p>Yes, every country gets a fair share of up and down in the economy - except that Singapore's share is not so fair when the root cause are not addressed even as the Economic Review Committees have identified the weaknesses in Singapore's economy.</p>
              <p>This has resulted in the recession in 1987, 1997, and also the economic disruptions caused by Osama Bin Laden in 2001, bird flu, SARS in 2003 and 2004, then the economic meltdown of 2008 - which began as early as 2006 which had to happen as part of the 10 year cycle that has been hitting Singapore like a rythm.</p>
              <p>Why should Singapore get MORE than the fair share of up and down in the economy -when Singaporeans are sold the idea by LKY to pay higher wages than any country on earth for the super talents  that are appointed as Ministers ?</p>

              <p>Did the 1987 crisis hit the USA and Europe ?</p>
              <p>The pussy brain must have swopped position to believe that the Asian Financial melt down in 1997 had affected the USA and Europe.</p>
              <p>If Switzerland is not a perfect country - why would GCT place it as a goal to achieve a Swiss Standard of Living ?</p>
              <p>Has the pussy been oversold by the PAP that no other country is better than Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Is this position an after thought taken by the noisy pussy - after he failed in his efforts to emmigrate to Oz, and has been venomously noisy in all his thread towards her ?</p>
              <p>Only a noisy pussy will be stupidly boorish and out of touch to believe that the reasons for Singaporean to migrate to a country is due to all conditions being better than Singapore.</p>
              <p>Only a noisy pussy will believe in utopia and have no sense of priortising the values to measure if a country will be acceptable - which explains for the bitterness of the noisy pussy towards Oz.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes SG improved only for "a lot" since PAP ruling, when "alot more" others in SG have been continously struggling since the PAP came into power in 1957.</p>
              <p>The single lot that has improved is found amongst the Elite PAP Executive Group, who shamelessly appoint each other as Ministers, and will pay themselves the Million Dollar Wages - even as Singaporeans are told to tighten our belts, accept wage and CPF cuts, accept short term employment  contracts, accept a higher CPF retention till the extended age of 85 years.</p>
              <p>Yes, SG has improved when in the 1960 - Singaporeans were retiring at age 55, and after 52 years of PAP rule, Singaporeans are expected to work till 65, and even then the CPF savings cannot be withdrawn as a lump sum.</p>

              <p>If the Malaysian Federal Government had succeeded with the ISA to arrest the entire SG State Government - would there be a need for National Service, when none was needed in Malaysia until only 2006 (and implemented for the sake of racial integration and not for military defense) ?</p>

              <p>Has Singapore improved alot in the 52 years since the PAP came into power ?</p>
              <p>The retirement age use to be 55 years up until the 1970s, then the retirement age began to creep upwards after the Howe Yoon Chong study about the CPF scheme.</p>
              <p>The CPF scheme is a time bomb waiting to explode like a ponzi scheme especially when the number of new participants is shrinking with a declining population.</p>
              <p>The PAP leadership is struggling to keep the CPF system afloat by designing new schemes to reduce the problems - by deducting funds for MediShield, Medicare, Approved Investment through Insurance Pension scheme, and finally the Old Age Maintenance plan to a provisional age of 85 years.</p>
              <p>Are Singaporeans better off today compared to those in 1950's ?</p>
              <p>Suicide rates are higher today than in the 1950s for sure.</p>
              <p>It cost more to raise children today then in the 1960s or the 1970s - even as wages are supposed to be more then that paid in the 1950s through to the 1970s.</p>
              <p>Are Singaporeans better off today when inflation is so much more then in the 1960s ?</p>

              <p>900,000 foreign working here, when the unemployment rate is 2.5% of the working population - based on the 2008 statistics that have yet to be updated for mid-2009 ?</p>
              <p>From the batch graduating this year, many of the fresh graduates are already working in China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Indonesia - as the employment scene in SG is totally hopeless except to those with honors degree.</p>
              <p>Even if the figure of 900,000 foreign workers here is taken at its face value - it does not reveal the fact that this are only blue collar workers in the manufacturing sectors, construction sites, cleaning services.</p>
              <p>The foreigners working in the white collar sectors have competed directly with the SG executives in the middle and senior ranks of management, and with most of these foreigners given easy confirmation for permanent residentship.</p>

              MM stays in the government for so long maybe due to the following reasons:
              
              1  He does not trust anyone, not even his son as PM
              2  He does not want to see his major polices being changed.
              3  He wants to have a hand in shaping new polices.
              4  He wants to get respect and diplomatic reception when he  is on official overseas trips.
              5  He wants to get host country security protection.
              6  He wants media attention (local and foreign).
              7  He wants to tackle his critics officially.
              8  He wants to continue getting security protection in Sg.
              9  He wants to continue getting free medical treatment as cabinet minister for himself and his wife.
