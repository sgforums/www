              <p><strong>Despite his advancing age, the world’s longest surviving national leader has become more assertive at home and abroad in the last two years, averaging one overseas trip every two months.</strong></p>
              <p>WITHOUT any official fanfare, Singapore has just crossed a historic mark that few Singaporeans are even aware of.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/7/11/focus/4292744&amp;sec=focus">The Lee Kuan Yew “era” reached its 50-year mark on June 5, </a>making Lee the longest surviving national leader in the world.</p>
              <p>It was on this day in 1959 that the Cambridge-trained lawyer was sworn in as the first Prime Minister of a self-governing Singapore.</p>
              <p>Lee is, of course, no longer the head of government after having given up the post in 1990. He now serves as an “advisor” in the Cabinet, with the title “Minister Mentor”.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb111/atobe-album/LEEKuanYew50Yrs.jpg" alt=""> </p>
              <p><span class="caption">Having his say: Lee speaking during </span><span class="caption">a dialogue session at the 65th annual general meeting of the IATA on June 8 in Kuala Lumpur. — AFP</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the last half-century, Lee has been Singapore’s undisputed force, shaping events, irrespective of who the designated leader is.</p>
              <p>Whoever the Prime Minister – be it Goh Chok Tong (1990 - 2004) or the present Lee Hsien Loong – no one in Singapore doubts that it’s Lee Kuan Yew who still calls the shot.</p>
              <p>At 85, this national leader has outlasted all others by a wide margin.</p>
              <p>He shared the record with President Fidel Castro who led Cuba for 49 years until Castro retired last year.</p>
              <p>The next nearest, President Omar Bongo Ondimba, had ruled Gabon for 42 years until his death recently in Paris.</p>
              <p>Lee’s historic half-century, however, has not come at the best of times. Singapore is in the middle of one of its worst recessions – and Lee is getting more public brickbats by the day.</p>
              <p>Economic hardship to the middle class, the bedrock of his support base, and huge losses of public money in several ill-timed global investments are causing discontent – and are being partly blamed on him.</p>
              <p>“I think public confidence in the government has sapped somewhat in the past few years,” one commentator said.</p>
              <p>It is evident that Lee is very worried. Since the crisis, he has become more assertive at home and abroad, often displaying energy of someone half his age.</p>
              <p>Locally, he has adopted an active public role, commenting on almost every facet of life in the country.</p>
              <p>Despite his advancing age, Lee has been making an average of one overseas trip every two months, the last being a hectic eight-day official visit to Malaysia in June.</p>
              <p>A month earlier, he spent three days in Japan before flying off to China for four days.</p>
              <p>For the whole of 2008, he travelled to seven countries, including China, Britain, France, and some Arab nations.</p>
              <p>The globe-trotting habits of leaders here are based on Lee’s perception of Singapore’s survival needs.</p>
              <p>Minister Mentor Lee explained it this way: Singapore has got to where it is today by riding every tide that comes its way, and using the world as its hinterland.</p>
              <p>With Internet, satellite, and air travel, growing interaction between countries and people was not a world that he could have imagined – but one that his country had to be part of, he said.</p>
              <p>So why is the image-conscious government so reticent about Lee’s political longevity?</p>
              <p>Party insiders say it is because he is bent on avoiding doing anything that will promote a personality cult.</p>
              <p>“There’s been no road, statue or street named after Lee Kuan Yew,” a community leader noted.</p>
              <p>Critics, however, give a different reason. One said the government would rather not mention the subject for fear it would renew calls for him to leave.</p>
              <p>In a Yahoo online poll, 53% of Singaporeans said they wanted their founding father to quit politics either immediately or very soon – and that was five years ago.</p>
              <p>In 2004 when he celebrated his 80th birthday, he told an interviewer that he would remain a senior minister for as long as he could contribute to the nation.</p>
              <p>“You don’t have to tell me. I can feel it when I am no longer making a contribution,” Lee said then.</p>
              <p>In recent years, the political icon has become noticeably slower both in speech and movement – but his global perceptions remain sharp.</p>
              <p>It is the younger Singaporeans who want him to go. Unlike the previous generation, they are not beholden to him for his contributions to the republic.</p>
              <p>Still, some admirers believe the nation should listen to his advice, but only after he has left the Cabinet or Parliament.</p>
              <p>One such admirer, Tracy Tan, said: “Lee Kuan Yew is an exceedingly strong leader and a very intelligent man. These qualities have made him a strong asset – as well as a liability – to Singapore.”</p>

              <p>Should Singaporeans not be surprised that this historic moment in half-a-century rule was passed without any fanfare ?</p>
              <p>Is there an awareness of the growing negative sentiments that borders resentment amongst Singaporeans towards all the boastful claims of superior talents that have not make any marked difference in Singapore with the rest of the World ?</p>
              <p>Still we spend the biggest amount of money on Government wages - on Ministers and the Civil Servants - than any country on this Globe.</p>
              <p>Certainly the population is aware of the globe-trotting habit of the Government Ministers since the last election was over in Year 2006.</p>
              <p>One trip every 2 months for MM ?</p>
              <p>The cost of which will have to include for the entourage of newly minted Ministers, Ministers of State, Permanent Secretaries, and Members of Parliament.</p>
              <p>This does not include the count for the President, Senior Minister, Prime Minister, and the occassional trips by the Deputy PMs.</p>

              Is it LKY or is it the efforts and hardwork of the people who build up Singapore's economy?
              
              <p>Singapore's GDP growth since 2000 is the result of PAP's open door policy of opening the floorgates to foreigners. These foreigners served as cheap labour to MNCs and businesses in Singapore. 
              
              </p><p>From 1999 to 2008, Singapore went through 3 recessions including the current one, is that a track record to be proud of? With such track record, would you still want PAP to rule for another 100 years bearing in mind that there may be at least 3 recessions for every 10 years period?</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, despite LKY having "<em>taught SG people English and built up economy so far</em>" - we still get noisy pussies making simple grammatical errors that even little kids know that "<em>LKY should not TEACH SG people English</em>" in the manner so poorly learnt by the noisy pussy.</p>
              <p>If LKY had built up the economy - why will the noisy pussy remain so bitter about OZ not accepting his application to emmigrate ?</p>
              <p>Could it be the unique Singlish that the noisy pussy hope to pass for Oz English ?</p>
              <p>As matters stand, despite the LKY supposed success with "SG...built up economy so far" - it is surprising that LKY will want Singaporeans to spread our wings and venture abroad to take on jobs in China, Middle-east, India, supposedly to spread our Singapore values.</p>
              <p>If the SG economy is so built-up - as claimed by the resident noisy pussy - is there no need for the trained manpower that LKY want them to go overseas ?</p>
              <p>With the brain drain - is it not happening now that Singapore require the graduates from Brunei, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines,  and even Vietnam ?</p>
              <p>In the statistics produced by the Government Department of Statistics - Singaporeans are lumped with the Permanent Residents for the purpose of all kinds of statistical studies.</p>
              <p>Is it not ironical that this is for the purpose of hiding the increase in the real numbers of foreigners taking up Permanent Residentship and confuse Singaporeans about the real numbers that are Citizens ?</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, despite LKY having "<em>taught SG people English
                  and built up economy so far</em>" - we still get noisy pussies
                  making simple grammatical errors that even little kids know
                  that "<em>LKY should not TEACH SG people English</em>" in the
                  manner so poorly learnt by the noisy pussy.</p>
              <p>If LKY had built up the economy - why will the noisy pussy
                  remain so bitter about OZ not accepting his application to
                  emmigrate ?</p>
              <p>Could it be the unique Singlish that the noisy pussy hope to
                  pass for Oz English ?</p>
              <p>As matters stand, despite the LKY supposed success
                  with "SG...built up economy so far" - it is surprising that
                  LKY will want Singaporeans to spread our wings and venture abroad
                  to take on jobs in China, Middle-east, India, supposedly to spread
                  our Singapore values.</p>
              <p>If the SG economy is so built-up - as claimed by the resident
                  noisy pussy - is there no need for the trained manpower that LKY
                  want them to go overseas ?</p>
              <p>With the brain drain - is it not happening now
                  that Singapore require the graduates from Brunei, China,
                  India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines,  and
                  even Vietnam ?</p>
              <p>In the statistics produced by the Government Department of
                  Statistics - Singaporeans are lumped with the Permanent Residents
                  for the purpose of all kinds of statistical studies.</p>
              <p>Is it not ironical that this is for the purpose of hiding the
                  increase in the real numbers of foreigners taking up Permanent
                  Residentship and confuse Singaporeans about the real

                  can hardly even qualify to lick his boots.</p>
              <p>With regards to the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the
                  fxxking billions dollars in the Wat Port,wat Funds, series of
                  corruptions</span></em>" - these have been well published in the
                  Malaysian Press, with the ACA investigating the matters, as much as
                  the different political parties digging deeper into the
                  scandals.</p>
              <p>If this was to happen in Singapore, will there ever be any
                  independent investigation, or will the culprits be allowed to
                  abscond as in the case of PAP MP Phey Yew Kok ?</p>
              <p>Will any alternative Singapore Political Parties be as
                  aggressive to demand the investigation to the loss of the US$100
                  Billion by the super talents at the helm of the GIC and Temasek
                  Holdings ?</p>
              <p>In any case, the loss of the Malaysian funds are in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hundreds of millions in
                  RINGGIT</span>, compared to the US$100 Billion lost by MM LKY -
                  Chairman of GIC and daughter-in-law as the CEO of Temasek
                  Holdings.</p>
