The Singapore Government had then explained that the investment by the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) in the Myanmar Fund was completely open and above board. The Fund held stakes in hotels and companies that were straightforward investments in bona fide commercial projects. Other investors in the Fund included Coutts &amp; Co, an old British bank, and the Swiss Bank Corporation. GIC was a passive investor in the Fund. Subsequently, it divested its stake in 2003.<br>At the time, the Government also offered to set up a Commission of Inquiry, so that Dr Chee could produce his evidence, and there could be a full and open investigation. Unfortunately, Dr Chee never took up the offer.<br><br>If any Singaporean disagrees with our tough laws on drugs and the death penalty for drug traffickers, the proper and democratic way to proceed is to contest and win an election, and press to change the law in Parliament. Dr Chee has stood for elections three times, but lost each time, most recently in 2001 garnering barely 20% of the popular vote.<br><br>Dr Chee has compared his struggle to<strong> Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent fight </strong>against the British in India, but Singaporeans know Dr Chee for what he is. In 1993, he was dismissed by the National University of Singapore for misusing university research funds to pay for postage on his wife's PhD thesis and falsifying transport claims. In 1996, when appearing before a hearing at a Parliamentary Select Committee, he wilfully gave false information and was censured by Parliament for perjury. Dr Chee's rehashed allegations about Singapore's links with Myanmar, and his criticisms of Singapore democracy, must be seen in this light.<br><br>Joseph K H Koh<br>High Commissioner<br>Singapore High Commission<br>17 Forster Crescent<br>Yarralumla, ACT 2600, Australia<br>Tel 61 (2) 6273 3944<br>Fax 61 (2) 6273 9823<br></blockquote></div>
