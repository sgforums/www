            <div class='col-md body'>Janadas Devan in his ST column on 26 Nov wrote an insightful article about the wage gap challenge facing Singapore; although Hong Kong and China also face the same problem. All are vibrant economies that have seen rising prosperity in a very short space of time. As he pointed out, the market is great at generating wealth but poor at distributing it.<br><br>Communist China used to be among the most egalitarian of all economies. Everyone was equally poor and everyone had access to the same low quality of healthcare. Now it is the world's fourth largest economy and has more millionnaires than Singapore. However, the price is the marked wealth inequality that pervades society. There are farmers who have to sell their children and they have lost even the low quality healthcare provided by barefoot doctors they used to have. The Gini coefficient ( a marker of wealth equality, 0=completely equal, 1= completely unequal) for China is around 0.4 and unofficial estimates suggest it is closer to 0.6 now. The same index for Hong Kong was 0.52 and 0.46 for Singapore in 2001. The latest figure for Singapore has risen to 0.517 (http://www.singstat.gov.sg/keystats/annual/ghs/r2/chap3.pdf) and probably higher for Hong Kong (http://www.hkcss.org.hk/cb4/ecp/pov_rate_91-05.pdf) .<br><br>Yes, there is rising wealth inequality in all the Asian economic powerhouses, from China to Singapore. The ability of national governments to control social unrest and maintain cohesion will determine future success of these nations. Communist China is probably able to suppress the rising rural unrest for some time, but not forever. The Chinese government is only too aware that it was hungry farmers who supported them to power against the KMT.<br><br>Singapore has to suppress the rising Gini index and keep it around 0.4. Studies have suggested that a figure between 0.3 and 0.4 is probably about right. A low Gini index in the 0.2s as in Scandinavian countries promote laziness, destroys the work ethic and erodes competitiveness.  On the other hand, a high coefficient may lead to unrest and degrades social cohesion.<br><br>At risk of simplifying matters, you can lower the Gini coefficient by reducing the income of the rich or raising the income of the poor. The former will not work in a globalised world where funds and talent are highly mobile. Taxing the rich to create a more equitable society will only drive away the ones who pay the most taxes and provide the most jobs. As the PM said, Hong Kong has lower income tax than Singapore. Any move to raise taxes will make Hong Kong even more attractive.<br><br>The only way is to raise the income of our poor by increasing their skill sets and re-engineering low-skilled work to increase productivity. But low-income Singaporeans must get off their butts and accept training, work unsociable hours and in uncomfortable environments such as clean rooms. They cannot have it both ways.<br><br></div>

But that will take longer time to train , more money , and sometimes they themselves cant provide the funds to further enhance thier skills. But it all comes down to cost. 5 KM's for 5 bucks or 15km with machine that costs 500. But it all depends on cost effecient and whether those that employ would want to spend that kind of money to have that kind of quality work done or not. Unless there is stringent measures for quality,  then maybe it will work. Comes down to standard of work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No matter how the poor tries to upgrade their skills, opening a floodgate of foreigners would always depress their wages. There arent much skills  that would not be depressed by floodgates of foreigner, other than those that are protected by professional bodies.<br><br>For upgrading of skills to translate to better income, there must be some protection from new entrants. A Japanese who upgrade his skills could be more certain of better wages, but a Singaporean who has upgraded his skill finds the floodgate of foreigners has depressed the value of his new skills.<br><br>There are many ways to close the income gap,like allowing people to peddle in the streets. If one is poor in taiwan, its easier to start a small business. The old man/old lady does not have to clean the tables or sell tissues to make a living like Singapore. Instead they sell wares like umbrellas on a rainy day or leather wallets in the streets. They can make decent living without having a need to pay rent.</div>

Being uneducated in the first place, and usually not young anymore, going back to school to study is like telling a old dying tree to start bearing fruit all over again.<br><br>The retraining, Its unrealistic. Studies showed that a person need to be trained at least 7 times at the same thing to remember it and perhaps change behaviour.<br><br>Anyways, these kinds of numbers don't show everything. Gini is derived by associating some number to certain factor. There are a ton of factors not considered. There are a ton of factors considered but does it fit this society?<br></div>

I bet this is not gonna be the last hike in GST... Can the government ensure that there will be a smaller grp of the poor after the hike? If not, if the poor grp stays the same or grows larger, becoz of inflation, they will certainly need more in the future... so are we going to hike GST again to solve the prob? There is certainly a cap to how much GST can rise...<br><br>If this is so, are we pushing the present problems into the future...? Should we hv times in the future that we may oso face trade deficit like the US?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GST or Credit Card... GST, has it caused anyone bankrupt? But the 'free' credit card has and have people &gt;$2 billion in debt and increasing, no?, so the Gahman surely must be eyeing this pie, no, expenditure wat?! The problem is we now have the double edged sword in the GST Hike which causes more hardship (Ok lah after one year's credit from the Gahman), and Credit Card limits  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  lowering or not? and more people in debts' company? OK lah, blame the people for not upgrading themselves, for not working hard enough and for having or no poor financial management skills... so wherein lies the real harsh truth, increasing the commercial prowess of those in charge so that they can better manage in no other better ways except to raise tax and provide credit (living in borrowed times)?<br><br>No, no, not condeming the Gahman's efforts in its endeavour to help the people (Progovt and/or Oxford Mushroom should be happy about this bit) ... there are no easy solutions but are these the best options?<br><br>Money, money money, must be funny in a rich man's world. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not directly related to the topic but i cant help but add my two cents worth after seeing how footballer's pay are compared with ministers.<br><br>i dont watch football but from what i hear, a footballer's worth is decided by his performance as well as how much 'wow' he can generate for his club/sports/entertainment etc industry. in other words, there's market forces at work.<br><br>our minister's pay is derived from:<br><br>1. self-declaration of economic worth. not market forces. (did the people, who are their employers or the market agree with their self-evaluation of value-addedness?)<br><br>but maybe they intepreted the 66.6% as a positive evaluation of their performance. so as long as they remain in power, they deserve to be paid more and more.<br><br>2. martyr's attitude (i have to take a pay cut to BE ELECTED AND TO PROMISE TO SERVE u, so u better pay me. and all these while, they run on a platform of integrity, selflessness and loyalty to country)<br><br>we are not talking about a free-service. but to be paid millions for their selfless service? with a million dollars, who wouldn't want to 'serve selflessly'?<br><br>3. perverse logic of thinking that to fight corruption, one has to stuff oneself with money.
