I think to migrate to Canada is easier than Australia. Any comments?<br><br>So, with skilled migration plan, there is no need much money except you may need to rent a place or your employer can pay for you depending on how you nego with them during contract time , and maybe the application fee or if you hire an agent to do that for you a couple of thousand sgd that all.<br><br>Best if you have a Canadian or Australian degree.

I think this makes things very easy.<br><br>But then, in SG, its either the easiest or one of the top most easy country to get citizenship for skilled workers and even not so skilled ones. Just come here, apply for study and then viola, skilled FT. Accept low pay for a start and once get a sg job, stick around until you get citizenship.

The balance AUD250K is to buffer the uncertainty in migration.<br><br>So even with S$1mio, one has to continue working and hardly afford to live a carefree life traveling around the world.  Besides, not working isn't a good life style for a young couple too.</div>

Consider this for someone who has a family to support.<br><br>So one needs money to pay in cash a safe apartment (with porter security and private car-park) to eliminate the problems of LIVING UNDER THE BURDEN OF HIGH INTEREST RATES and a buffer to safeguard one from falling down under this burden.
