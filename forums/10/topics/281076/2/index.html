            <div class='col-md body'>It costs about AUD $2000 to apply for the Australian skilled migration visa. Add another SGD SGD $300 for English test and maybe another SGD $500 to get your skills assessed by an Australian institution. Other costs include getting police checks, medical check up, certifying true copies of your documents... probably around SGD $200.<br><br>Total = SGD $1000 + AUD $2000 (SGD $2531.35)<br>= SGD $3531.35<br><br>This is just to apply.

Consider this for someone who has a family to support.<br><br>So one needs money to pay in cash a safe apartment (with porter security and private car-park) to eliminate the problems of LIVING UNDER THE BURDEN OF HIGH INTEREST RATES and a buffer to safeguard one from falling down under this burden.  I guess S$1mio is JUST enough.  Am i correct?<br><br></div></blockquote>The facts<br><br>There are actually 4 ways to migrate over to AUD.<br><br>1. Study a relevant degree there, get relevant work for 1 year(hard part) and get PR.<br><br>2. Marriage.... fer the wrong reasons imo<br><br>3. 1 Mil AUD to leave in bank for 5 years i think cant remember.... you can touch the $ after and will accrue interest whilst doing so. You will be getting $6_k interest pre tax per annum ( good ar? ) which you can touch. The principal you cant touch.<br><br>4. Business investment scheme ( not sure actual name). Basically you set up a business here and i think must employ X no.s of Australians and have annual turnover of $X... dunno much about this scheme. Fren is in it.<br><br>Living conditions<br><br>In Victoria/Melbourne, prices of house is actually quite affordable. $250k for a house? $300-400k for an apartment in the "Orchard Road" of Melbourne ie. South Yarra, South Bank, Port Melbourne, Brighton.<br><br>Mortgage rates i think i'm at 9% est can't remember. But to offset that capital appreciation is on the move  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> and should more than offset "high interest rates" if you get a good location.<br><br>Jobs are pretty easy to find. $40k per annum pretax is easily accessible if you are not choosy and you dont need a degree to survive here lol.<br><br>Tax rates are high but it scales. Think the 1st 7k of yer annual income is tax free.... then 7% then 14% then 3X% till u hit 40k..... i know for a fact if you are around the 50k +- bracket take home is about 3k AUD/mth.<br><br>Those are facts that i remember offhand<br><br>EDIT:- O yea skilled migrant that is 5th way.... fergot about that.... but then again i'm not skilled  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>
