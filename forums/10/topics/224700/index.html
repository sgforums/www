            <div class='col-md body'>Big risks, says World Bank<br><br>Billions spent with results far away, WB economists say. Reuters.<br>Dec 9, 2006<br><br>Singapore's multi billion-dollar campaign to develop a biomedical sector and create new sources of revenue is failing to yield any significant payoffs so far, two prominent World Bank economists said.<br><br>The economists, authors of a new book about industrial policy in East Asian cities, said Singapore has only a 50/50 chance of succeeding, but the move is a gamble it must take to maintain economic prosperity in the face of growing competition from low-cost neighbours such as China.<br><br>Â“We don't see the pay-off yet. The real pay-off is when Singapore companies are turning profits and going for IPOs,Â” Shahid Yusuf said on a call from his office in Washington DC.<br><br>Â“The pressure is building for Singapore to have some success stories,Â” he said, noting that Singapore did not have any internationally known drug companies.<br><br>Over the last five years, Singapore has plowed more than S$3 billion (US$2 billion) into its biomedical sector, official data showed.<br><br>Some estimate as much as S$5 billion has been committed. It has spent generously on start-ups, new facilities and labs and on luring top scientists from the US, the UK and Europe.<br><br>The problem Singapore faces is one, which is faced around the globe by countries trying to tap into the potential of biomedical development.<br><br>So far, despite all the investment, few are earning the kind of money that hubs in Boston and San Diego are making.<br><br>Â“Around the world, biotech is still more promise than profit as of yet,Â” said Mr Yusuf.<br><br>Despite the lack of success so far, the authors highlighted the potential for huge dividends later.<br><br>Kaoru Nabeshima said the pharmaceutical industry held great potential for economies such as Singapore, India, China, South Korea and Taiwan.<br><br>In the US health care spending was about 16 per cent of GDP compared to 3-6 per cent in many other countries. - Reuters<br><br><a href="http://www.littlespeck.com/content/Technology/CTrendsTechno-061209.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlespeck.com/content/Technology/CTrendsTechno-061209.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It should be noted that manufacturing will not help people move up the social ladder. Moreover, as we go up the manufacturing ladder, the no. of jobs available becomes fewer and fewer. Yes, they will feed families, but fewer and fewer as time goes by. The truth of the matter is that manufacturing in Singapore is becoming more and more expensive as the years go by.<br><br>Using GSK as an example is a little flawed as the company on its own regards manufacturing something of a secondary operation since their primary goal is to develop new drugs. I might furthermore add that developing a drug take 10 years or more with a high potential for failure. A drug which Pfizer was banking heavily on for the past decade has turned out to be a failure and billions spent has been wasted. The nature of research is that one should not expect short term gain and expect only long term in the order of a few decades. Singapore, as it is, has small chance of competing against giants such as the Untied States by sheer quantity and quality. It is as LKY's daughter said; focus on some research areas and not spread themselves too thin. If one were to visit a public university like University of Michigan, depts make do with limited resources and focus on certain fields and hire people related to those fields to enhance the output of the dept. Singapore, especially when it is just starting should focus and attempt to produce success then bank on its reputation and expand from that standpoint. As it is, our current pool of talent is largely foreign and it wouldn't take much effort for them to pack their bags and head back to the US especially when the current US Govt wakes up its idea and starts ramping funding up.<br><br>It should be noted that the Govt's push for R&amp;D prior to the biopolis has not worked and hasn't worked for a decade over. What makes anyone think that this crack pot policy would work? If the Govt does intend to focus on research, it should spread beyond Biotech as the only way to tap and foster huge interdisciplinary work is to have depts in most related fields who may or may not cooperate but instead be centers of creativity etc. Each dept of course should focus on fields that they think they can excel in.<br><br>The Govt's inflexibility is a problem. They cherry pick sciences like nothing. This does not work. To foster an environment of creativity you must give people some breathing space to work their own creativity. Alas the Govt fails to see this.<br><br>By the way, the economists weren't the first to say this. Some years back, a noted Harvard economist who correctly predicted how SIngapore should develop said the same thing with due reflection on how the Singapore Govt thinks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IF anyone thought the Goverment might be rethinking its strategy to develop the biomedical sector here, several big guns from A*Star were quick to dismiss it on Tuesday.<br>They said the Government is fully committed to the current approach of hiring world-class researchers and letting them work on major diseases such as cancer - a policy which had come under fire recently from National Neuroscience Institute head Dr Lee Wei Ling.<br><br>They also defended the achievements of Singapore's multibillion-dollar biomedical sciences (BMS) drive.<br><br>'The BMS initiative has been successful and there is no rethink or change in the Government's BMS policy,' said Dr Beh Swan Gin, executive director of the Biomedical Research Council at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star).<br><br>The statement comes in the wake of remarks made by Dr Lee last November in an article in The Straits Times and which she repeated in a Reuters interview last Friday.<br><br>Dr Lee had said that the Government should reassess its strategy for creating a biomedical industry after spending billions of dollars without achieving significant results.<br><br>'All I can say is that maybe they are having a rethink,' she added.<br><br>In the interview, Dr Lee had also suggested that Singapore should invest in niche areas of research such as Asian diseases.<br><br>Quashing suggestions of a change in policy, Dr Beh read out the Government's position on the issue at a media conference to review the performance of the BMS industry last year.<br><br>But he added that Singapore will always continue to adjust its strategies, depending on how they perform.<br><br>'The aim at the end of the day is to ensure we are on the right track,' he said.<br><br>Outgoing A*Star chairman Philip Yeo and his successor Lim Chuan Poh, as well as Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology chief David Lane, also weighed in on the debate.<br><br>On the alleged lack of results, they emphasised that the biomedical initiative is a long-haul effort that typically takes 10 to 15 years to blossom.<br><br>'You have to give it time to show success. Some of these things cannot be done in a matter of three years or five years,' said Lieutenant-General (NS) Lim. 'We are going to stay the course.'<br><br>But what Singapore has achieved was already attracting international attention, with many countries trying to emulate Singapore's success, said Mr Yeo.<br><br>Lt-Gen (NS) Lim also defended the policy of attracting big names from the research world while nurturing local talent.<br><br>'Why must it be that Singaporeans cannot be world-beaters?' he asked.<br><br>'We have bright young Singaporeans who compete in the top league. If we don't create the kind of place for them to realise these ambitions, they will be overseas competing for other people.'<br><br>Star researchers such as Sir David are the 'whales' needed here as role models for the pool of young 'guppies' that A*Star is grooming, explained Mr Yeo.<br><br>On why an upstart such as Singapore should work on major diseases, Sir David noted that the major causes of death here - illnesses such as heart diseases and cancer - are the same as top killers worldwide.<br><br>At the briefing, Mr Yeo also distributed to reporters an e-mail written by Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in the United States.<br><br>In it, Dr Brenner reaffirmed Singapore's focus on diseases that are rising in incidence here and that have public health value, such as cancer. 'We should not accept that Singapore is a second class country only fit for cast-offs of the major countries,' he wrote.<br><br>Characterising Dr Lee's criticism as 'a voice in the wilderness', Mr Yeo said: 'For a person who has not been here (to Biopolis) to make comments, I leave it to that person. The Singapore Government is fully committed to what we have done.'<br><br>(Straits Times, 6 Feb)<br></div>

Otherwise Singapore as a country has NOTHING to offer to the foreign researchers who otherwise have far better access to funding and equipment and not to mention weather in the US. We are simply buying time hoping to make a breakthrough or two before they pack up their bags again. John Hopkins packed their bags precisely because Singapore is a pile of poodoo when it comes to attitudes towards research. They could do without our bloody money. The attitude towards research is so damn bureaucratic that it boggles the mind about the real quality of the research in Singapore which from what I hear from people who have knowledge of these matters is that the quality is darn near zero and even professors here have admitted that. Has no one forgotten that some professors at NUS themselves regarded the university rankings are ridiculously IRRELEVANT because they failed to take into account quality of research. We may have some bright sparks but they aren't enough to drive Singapore forward.<br><br></div>

For all the flair, our biomed industry is a near mirror image for the electronics industry! </div></blockquote>So what's your objection? That instead of waiting the decade it takes on average to get a marketable drug, we are already making money right from the go by manufacturing licensed drugs? As I said, we still have a small window of opportunity in drug manufacture in Singapore, based on the quality of our manufacturing processes and confidence in our quality assurance schemes. China and India can certainly make drugs, and have made thousands of copy drugs or varying quality. Big pharmaceutical companies would rather manufacture a blockbuster drug in Singapore where the standards are high and their intellectual property will be protected. The government is right to leverage on this advantage to grow our economy.<br><br>R&amp;D in the biomed industry is essential for us to maintain the lead over China and India as they tidy up their factories and confidence in their drug-making capability builds with time. Eventually, we will have to move into a drug design and trial centre rather than just a manufacturing base, but that will take time. In the meantime, we are earning revenue making licensed drugs. That is to be encouraged.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Fingolfin_Noldor:</div><div class="quote_body">And many US researchers came to Singapore because of the restrictions on stem cell research in the US. Otherwise Singapore as a country has NOTHING to offer to the foreign researchers who otherwise have far better access to funding and equipment and not to mention weather in the US. We are simply buying time hoping to make a breakthrough or two before they pack up their bags again. John Hopkins packed their bags precisely because Singapore is a pile of poodoo when it comes to attitudes towards research. They could do without our bloody money. The attitude towards research is so damn bureaucratic that it boggles the mind about the real quality of the research in Singapore which from what I hear from people who have knowledge of these matters is that the quality is darn near zero and even professors here have admitted that. Has no one forgotten that some professors at NUS themselves regarded the university rankings are ridiculously IRRELEVANT because they failed to take into account quality of research. We may have some bright sparks but they aren't enough to drive Singapore forward.</div></blockquote>You don't know what you are talking about. University ranking doesn't take into account quality of research? It's just the opposite and I know it because my pay depends on my research output.<br><br>There are disagreements in the research community over the way funding is distributed and the sort of research that is being supported in Singapore.

You obviously don't know what you are talking about either, nor do you even have a pretense of know what the situation is. Now you tell me that biotech is to be the fourth pillar of the economy, do you even know what that means? I said the biotech right now in Singapore is mere mirror image of the electronics industry. For all that rebranding, biotech is just picking up the slack from the weakening electronics sector which has seen steady outflows of investment over the years. So the biotech is technically not a fourth pillar but merely a replacement pillar in the manufacturing industry. It's all bloody propaganda. Old wine in new bottles, hmm? Same o' strategy of manufacturing as usual.<br><br>Research? Forget it.

Please, the local pool of people leading the way are all foreigners, who'd sooner pack up their bags and go. Hardly sustainable in the long term. Moreover, the figures themselves show how bad we are at R&amp;D for years. Have you forgotten the Govt's trumpeting of the electronics R&amp;D long ago with a heavy emphasis on engineering and Computer science? This biotech nonsense is merely the latest nonsensical trumpeting, albeit with a gloriously large sum.

Many of these so called hinderance won't be left behind. Rather, they pack their bags and leave, and see who's left behind. Life abroad is infinitely better. It is your arrogance that you fail to see that. It is your own arrogance to think that the Govt is perfect, and it is your own arrogance to refuse to have an open mind but simply regard your opposition as something beneath your dignity to even lower yourself and think as they do. Rather you wave them off as insignficant flies. Just as the kings of Europe who waved off those against the monarchy as anarchists who seek to destroy world order, you wave off the opposition as anarchists. By the end of the 19th century, most of the kings of Europe were swept away by the tides of history, so will Singapore. You fear chaos because you do not comprehend what the chaos is and how to function. Like many Singaporeans, you are afraid to think.
