As it is, OM has successfully pissed off many by not addressing points raised by others and instead go on and attack the person's credibility. You could even smell LKY's style in his style of debate, recalling that time where he called some Opposition bugger "sneaky" with a look that looks like "I will crush this idiot like an insect he is". All published in the papers too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I will put down my objections and irritations simply:<br><br>Fact 1: The Govt trumpets the biotech industry as a great booming industry.<br><br>Reality: Really, it is simply another attempt to start up a whole new manufacturing sub-sector after the debacle involving electronics industry. Simply put: Same o' strategy in wine bottles. Reality is that manufacturing has its limits and the higher the ladder we go, the less people gets employed and eventually the factories will move elsewhere as costs go high. Long run? Same o' problem, AGAIN.<br><br>Fact 2: The Govt regards biotech research will produce gains in the future.<br><br>Reality: The Govt's approach to research is incredibly bureacratic and has successfully driven off some of our best talents years ago. The Govt never accorded enough funding into the Sciences for decades since they felt it won't generate monetary returns. Since there was no interest, our brightest felt they had better opportunities else where and left. No big surprise that even today, A*Star scholars still break bonds for the same reason. Even then, the Govt allocated funds to engineering and applied research, which of course yielded nothing if anything. Now the Govt comes around and plows tonnes of cash into Biotech ONLY in hopes to catch up. Yet, the culture of research isn't here and the Govt imposes a requirement on profs and researchers to produce a finite amount of papers in a year. It has long been known that the quality of our research is quite pathetic since most of these papers are quite worthless. Seems the Govt doesn't know that some research takes a while to bear fruit and producing a paper about some uncompleted project is a waste of time. But hey, NUS/NTU have been doing this for a long time.<br><br>Fostering a research environment requires a wide range of sciences and they must be flourishing. Only where there is a wide range of sciences will there be interdisciplinary research and then allow people to share ideas. There was one Physics Nobel laureate if I recall made a dramatic switch to biophysics. You won't get that in Singapore at this rate. Forget about Nobels too. The environment is stifling and too pressurizing. Fudging of results will occur as a result and then you get lousy papers which are not well cited.</div>
