              <span>SINGAPORE : Singapore lawyer M Ravi was charged in court on Monday for disturbing a religious assembly.
                  <br> <br> The lawyer, who has represented the Singapore Democratic Party in
                  previous civil cases, was allegedly disrupting evening prayers at the
                  Jamae Chulia mosque on August 3 at about 7.30pm.
                  <br> <br>He is said to have been shouting and interrupting the religious
                  proceeding and when approached by devotees, is alleged to have verbally
                  abused them.
                  <br> <br> According to the police, this is not the first time the lawyer has behaved this way.
                  <br> <br>They said he is known to have behaved violently and abusively at
                  places of worship, shops, the Subordinate Courts, and other public
                  areas.
                  <br> <br> Bail has been set at S$8,000.
                  <br> <br>Police say behaviour that undermines racial and religious harmony
                  will not be tolerated, especially when the provocative act takes place
                  in a place of worship while prayers are being conducted. - CNA/ms</span></blockquote>

                  morning between 10am to 11am, human rights lawyer Mr M Ravi was
                  arrested in his own office and charged in Court 26 at about 4pm. I was
                  informed and attended his mentioning in Court 26 at about 5pm.<br><br>Mr.
                  Ravi face 2 charges, including disorderly behavior and disrupting
                  religious ceremony at Hindu Temple of Sir Marianman (Temple Street
                  China Town). This was for an incident happened on 3.Aug.2008 (Sunday)
                  at the Hindu Temple. However, the famiLEE LEEgime's mata did not arrest
                  nor summoned Mr. Ravi for any such investigation during the many days
                  lapsed including National Day. I recalled Mr. Ravi telling me last week
                  that he was assaulted at the temple before many witnesses, as I was on
                  trial then with Dr. CSJ daily for the last 4 weeks, I had not much idea
                  what happened at that temple.</blockquote>

              <p>Ravi was involved in both incidents.</p>
              <p>Anyway, as for whether it is politically motivated or not, let's remember Ravi was caught in the act in both instances. How to dispute that? Because of who he is, it suddenly becomespolitically motivated? An offence is an offence, no matter who the person doing it is. It does not suddenly becomes politically motivated when the person committing it is an opposition member. He can be another tom dick or harry and it is still an offence.</p>
