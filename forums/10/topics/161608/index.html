The violence has spread west to the rolling fields of Normandy and south to resort cities on the Mediterranean.<br><br>Those working in some of the affected areas said many rioters were school dropouts or unemployed, with some from fatherless homes.<br><br>Ms Sonia Imloul, who works with troubled teens in Seine-Saint-Denis, said youths often felt trapped.<br><br>'It is very, very difficult to leave this place,' she said.<br><br>'There is a stigma attached to being a resident of this place.'<br><br>Families break down in the pressure cooker of suburban crime, poverty and unemployment. Many single mothers are left to fend for themselves, said Ms Imloul, a single mother herself.<br><br>'Fathers do not play any role in their children's lives.'<br><br>She said 40 per cent of families in the suburbs where she works are dysfunctional, which explains the high rate of school dropouts, drug use and trafficking, petty crimes and aggressive behaviour.<br><br>'Those who set fire to cars and buildings are not criminals. They are young kids. What are 12-year-olds doing in the streets at midnight? Parents have no control over them.'<br><br>But others blame racism from the larger society for driving the youths of immigrant parents to burn cars and cause mayhem in the place where they were born.<br><br>Hardline law-and-order policies from Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy have also been accused of fuelling anger in the mainly immigrant estates where the trouble has spread. But the minister has insisted the violence was being orchestrated by unknown ringleaders.<br><br>Police union leader Bruno Beschizza also said the riots were 'a form of urban terrorism led by a minority of kingpins who have a financial interest, such as drug trafficking, or an ideological one such as Islamic radicals'.<br><br>Many residents seemed to agree with Mr Sarkozy that the rioters were 'scum'.<br><br>'You should see these hooligans in the morning,' said Ms Genevieve Bourgognat, who watched from her eighth-floor flat as a social club burned below.<br><br>'They come back to survey what they did and they are proud of it. They show their friends. They boast they got on television.'<br><br>Consultant Henri Huynh searched for the best way to describe them.<br><br>'They are like dogs - they bite anything in their way,' he finally said. -- ASSOCIATED PRESS,AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE<br></div>

All, however, have accepted the original term as being racist and dehumanizing. Generally, nigger is considered a highly offensive racial epithet, especially when used by non-blacks."<br><br>Please don't use such term.</div>
