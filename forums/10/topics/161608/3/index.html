Following a chase, police officers caught up with him -- at which point the alleged assault took place, the official said. - AFP /dt</blockquote>I think those eight police officers deserve to be shot. It is very unbecoming of them to beat up a coloured person for the sake of it. They might as well be sent back to the Third Reich if a time machine becomes available. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Paris has so many origins from many refugees country all the way to korean and vietnam war and combodia.  and so many beliefs and religions and race.<br>It is up to them themselves to dig out of the hell hole they believe they are in.   they think by rioting, others will accept them.  Wrong, many frech citizens of all races and religion will become more fearful and resentful to them.<br><br>same as everyone else living in this world except the really unfortunate that need help and refugee status for a better life.<br><br>Its a shame that the two did not know high voltages kill.  Maybe they could not read the french word "Danger high Voltage sign".<br><br>never go inside/near a high voltage transformer or sub station.<br><br></div>
