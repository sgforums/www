              should not be quick to conclude it's MP's fault. some MPs i've spoken to are genuinely sincere about helping people, and if the queue lasts till 1am, so be it.
              
              the grassroots leaders (presumably whoever scolded you is one) are a different story. they think they work for MP damn big, will talk in a condescending manner to people. at some PAP rallies, i was also disgusted by their behaviour. eyes shooting daggers at whoever not cheering loudly enough.
              
              if anything, MPs should discipline their grassroots.

              <p>That is where the problems arises from those grc dogs that serve the residents in this manner. They are bringing down their own mps.</p>
              <p>Dont blame the residents, mps should really investigate and take this feedback seriously, if grassroots have this kind of attitude, your place in the grc will not last more than 2nd term.</p>
              <p>I heard alot of this too. How they treat the residents during the meet the resident session.</p>
              <p>If those pple dont like to serve the people, plse, dont come and serve, let other people who willing to listen serve the community. They are the bad eggs in the grc grassroots. And you are the 1st line to meet and feel the ground. Very important, and attitude will tarnish the party.</p>
              <p>Hopefully, any ministers read this will take note of this issue seriously. Not a laughing joke.</p>

              <p>the grassroot in my opinion are one of the reason the PAP fail to hear the ground. Most grassroot are there to serve their own interest only. thus if the PAP MP ask grassroot about the how the ground feel, they would have paint a beautiful pictures to them to show they are canvassing the ground well. </p>
              <p>to all MP, take a good look at the grounds. please dont ask just the grassroot as they are only interested in getting some benefits from the PAP such as free carpark, goodies here and there.</p>

              <p>If you were summoned because you tried to "avoid a whole lane of trucks" from the opposite direction, you should, can fight all the way. But if you went dangerously into the opposite lane, or speeded all the way, causing the trucks to take evasive action,...then your summon is rightly served.</p>
              <p>you must have done something else, even the hokkien speaking apeh can laugh. Tell us leh, lets share the fun. <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>if even a hokkian apeh can laugh, why don't you just laugh. In 5 years, he probably lost his licence if he doesn't know why he was summoned and make changes. </p>
              <p>I am not worried about him voting for the PAP, I am more worried about him on the road. </p>

              <p>Some of the electorate can be very simple, don't reduce my fine ah? ok vote you out. Make me pay for Lift Upgrade ah? Vote you out. I think it's only human and natural.</p>
              <p>Obviously, they also feel that PAP hasn't done enough good for them for the pros to outweight the cons. To me, beautifying the town or repainting every 3 years means nothing to me. They could start by being kinder and more benevolent.</p>
              <p>Legend has it that when someone in Potong Pasir lost his job, Chiam ST gave him a space at the void deck to cut hair for people. Would this thing happen in a PAP ward? No way man. You die your pasar.</p>
