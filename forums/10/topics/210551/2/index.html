            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore politician-police standoff continues<br>Sebastian Tong<br>Reuters<br>17 Sep 06<br>http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=1375212006<br><br>A downtown stand-off between Singapore police and an opposition politician over the right to hold a protest march entered its second day on Sunday, after the overnight encirclement of Chee Soon Juan and several supporters.<br><br>Chee, who heads the tiny Singapore Democratic Party, had planned to hold a rally in a city park on Saturday, followed by a protest march to parliament past the convention centre where thousands of financial big shots, bankers and journalists are attending the IMF-World Bank meetings.<br><br>But Chee, his sister Chee Siok Chin, and five supporters, were never allowed to leave the park. About 30 police formed human barricades around the Chees, at times linking arms and pressing in close to them to prevent their movement.<br><br>"They are physically preventing us from walking to the parliament. But they won't arrest me," Chee said. "We need to send a message to be firm, to continue to insist on freedom of speech."<br><br>Chee had wanted to protest about the city-state's restrictions on freedom of speech and its widening income gap. Under Singapore law, public gatherings of more than four people require a police permit.<br><br>Throughout the night, changing shifts of police kept guard over Chee and his sister on a corner of Hong Lim park, close to Singapore's Speakers' Corner.<br><br>Supporters brought the Chees and the other activists food and water, and the pair slept briefly on the pavement. Puzzled passers-by, among them party-goers on their way home, the odd cyclist and early-morning joggers, stopped to stare or chat.<br><br>Area Cordoned Off<br><br>British tourist Christopher Osborn, 27, who saw the stand-off as he walked by on Saturday, decided to stay the entire night.<br><br>"I'm astounded by the police preventing the legitimate movement of people. The manner in which they are implementing it would be classified as intimidation. There's a disproportionate reaction and it shows another side to Singapore," he said.<br><br>While U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and other Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers discussed the Chinese yuan at the convention centre on Saturday, the Singapore police were busy interviewing those people who had gathered at the park to find out who they were and why they were there.<br><br>About 200 people, including media, had gathered for the rally.<br><br>Police with video cameras filmed Chee, his supporters and journalists present for several hours. Several plainclothes policemen and women mingled among the reporters and supporters.<br><br>"Police are at the scene and are engaging Chee Soon Juan and his associates. We advise them not to commit any offence or pose a threat to public order," a police spokeswoman said on Saturday.<br><br>Soon after Chee arrived at the park with his supporters on Saturday morning, police cordoned off the area. Speaking through loudhailers, they told the crowd of supporters and journalists not to participate in the protest march as this would be breaking the law.<br><br>As Chee Siok Chin tried to walk to a nearby public toilet, police stopped her. Only after much argument was she allowed to use a bathroom -- in the nearby police station.<br><br>Chee, an acerbic critic of the government, has had several run-ins with Singapore's leaders. On Tuesday, the High Court ruled that Chee and his sister had defamed Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his father, Lee Kuan Yew. No damages have been announced yet.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>False information of rally and march<br>Empower Singaporeans @ Speakers' Corner<br>17 Sep 06<br><br>The PAP controlled media is engaged in a campaign of false information on the ongoing Empower Singaporeans March &amp; Rally.<br><br>The government-owned Straits Times falsely claimed in its report today that the standoff between the police and Dr Chee Soon Juan &amp; the activists ended 'last nightÂ’. This is a blatant lie to mislead the readers while the standoff is still continued on at the SpeakersÂ’ Corner at Hong Lim park.<br><br>Similarly, the afternoon tabloid, The New Paper, for its part said, Dr Chee was flanked by fewer than 10 supporters. What the newspaper didnÂ’t report was that despite police harassment, more than one hundred people showed up to support the event.<br><br>The police had turned people away at the entrance to the Speakers Corner, warned supporters to leave the Speakers Corner, took down their NRIC numbers, and even confiscated the fliers that the organiser was distributing.<br><br>The standoff was deliberately created when the police refused to allow Dr Chee and the activists to march towards the Parliament House, then to Suntec City, and ending up at the Istana, as previously planned.<br><br>Dr Chee and activists are still held up at Speakers' Corner and the standoff with the police will only come to an end on Tuesday, 19 Sept 2006, when PM Lee Hsien Loong makes his opening address to the WB-IMF meetings.<br><br>For further information on the standoff, please continue to visit this website.<br><br></div>
