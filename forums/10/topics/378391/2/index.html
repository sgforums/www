              <p>This long post is meant solely for Gensis and others are free not to read it. To do so is one's wish and right.</p>
              <p>1. Make no mistakes, I am not the one complaining about policies, if you are blind. It is not up to me to offer any solutions, for I support our society's policies, and we will ultimately evolve and change in time, a pace all can accept so that none gets left behind.</p>
              <p>USA had 200+ years of history and yet to achieve the lofty idealisms of a perfect democratic sociey. How much must we, thru better education of our young to see progress in political achievements, through a conducive and peaceful environment for growth.</p>
              <p>I am a nobody and insignificant, just a reader here, and who came across so many posts, criticisms after criticisms and yet for all the hate fill messages, they offer no solutions, or only impractical ideas of lofty idealism best suited for novels and not the real world.</p>
              <p>Yet I had not attempted to shut their mouths, but only to reveal and show up who they really are and stand for. I had seen with my own eyes in states within US, France, England and Australia on how the naive are manipulated to serve selfish ends, with the innocent ending up in body bags. Angry young men manipulated by corporations lobby or self interest groups in NGOs, chinese restaurants wrecked, indians brutalised, etc.</p>
              <p>I have no wish to see my fellow citizens thus. There is no denying that life is harsh nowadays, but there are not alone for everyone is suffering in some measure, in the world, not just a few. It is not a fault of ours or our society, but an external creation many are now familiar with.</p>
              <p>Many who come here, see the demoralizing postings will themselves be demoralized, for none offer solutions. Worse still are they being manipulated to serve selfish ends with lies and half truths.</p>
              <p>Some walk away and would let this site rot. I stayed to do what I can for my fellow citizens, but only for those whom seek to understand. Those who respond to me negitively are not my target audience, for their mindsets are too far gone to accept any logic or reasoning. I impose nor deny any freedom to anyone.</p>
              <p>I can only help those who want to be helped, in my time when avaliable, to get a different insight thru my logic and reasoning, by way of greater understanding of necessary measures required in extraordinary circumstances, as consolation,  for consideration and never an agreement. I am but only a voice, and no superior or inferior to anyone else in my society's republic.</p>
              <p>2. You have my deepest respect if indeed you are from HFH, even if you only one of those 'contribution on Tour' volunteers, but only if you are indeed from there and not just a reference threw here to impress others.</p>
              <p>I thank you for your offer to volunteer in HFM. There are many ways for a person to contribute to humanity annonymously, espacially for my own society and need not impress anyone. <br>How I organise my time, What I do and had contributed, I need no approbation from anyone. I sleep with a sound conscience at night, with no expectations of appreciation from anyone as well.</p>
              <p>3. Out of admiration to your contribution to HFM, if indeed you are from there, I give you the fullest right to dismiss what I had written as thrash or hogwash, for it is only your perception, and not mine. It is a long reply because it would be churlish of me not to reply to you. I owe you that much for belonging to HFM, for its ideals, but not our differences which compromises on both can bridge in time, if indeed necessary.</p>
              <p>Best regards.</p>

              <p>The company has not committed a breach of statutory law as far as I know.</p>
              <p>Singapore does not have any legislation that explicitly forbids discriminatory employment practices; so long as an advertisement is not so blatantly racist e.g. "Chinese/Malays/Indians do not bother applying because we do not like to hire Asians", the company is theoratically not under any other legal obligation besides making sure they're not violating other acts such as the Sedition Act and so on.</p>
              <p>The closest we have to so-called "enforcement" of fair employment practices is the Tripartite Guidelines for Employment Practices (TAFEP). Check out their website for mroe info. Whether a company chooses to follow the guidelines stipulated is entirely up to their discretion. Many companies are paper signatories to TAFEP but in reality, violate the regulations they pledged to adopt i.e. wayang. The only thing that truly discourages a company from going overboard with discrimination is the negative publicity they will get from the public and the media (but as you should know, the Singapore media is err...)</p>
              <p>This is not America. The offending advertisement is perfectly within the bounds of the laws set by a government that will not pass an anti-discriminatory bill into legislation for fear of affecting business competitiveness.</p>

              <p>Only a X-rat will have the vanity to make immodest statement of being able to rescue anyone, when it is unable to defend its own position as it sinks into its own mud hole of "lies and half-truths" that is creates from its own X-rated version of the Truth.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>I can only help those who want to be helped, in my time when avaliable, to get a different insight thru my logic and reasoning, by way of greater understanding of necessary measures required in extraordinary circumstances, as consolation,  for consideration and never an agreement. I am but only a voice, and no superior or inferior to anyone else in my society's republic.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another false claim to help others, when it is nothing more then vulgar vanity of a female hoping to attract some attention while strutting on the catwalk, as it spreads it ignorant coyness to draw the desired publicity to its X-rated values.</p>
              <p>Between not being superior nor being inferior - what can you possibly hope to be when at the same time you intend to be of any consequence to influence anyone to change their mind ?</p>
              <p>It clearly show that you are not being serious with your views, but simply wasting space to display your childish and petty reprisal on those who have repeatedly trounced and bankrupted your idiot-logy.</p>

              <p>2. You have my deepest respect if indeed you are from HFH, even if you only one of those 'contribution on Tour' volunteers, but only if you are indeed from there and not just a reference threw here to impress others.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why will the X-rated mind of a bankrupt X-rat get involve with any HFH, when FMH will be better suited for its X-rated values ?</p>
              <p>Is the X-rat desperate to impress all and sundry - in its typical indiscriminate ways ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I thank you for your offer to volunteer in HFM. There are many ways for a person to contribute to humanity annonymously, espacially for my own society and need not impress anyone.<br>How I organise my time, What I do and had contributed, I need no approbation from anyone. I sleep with a sound conscience at night, with no expectations of appreciation from anyone as well.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should contribute a X-rated pose for the center-fold of FMH and allow the gay community to have you as their pin-up X-rat, and you will be of true service and use for their gay humanity.</p>
              <p>From one who do not seek appreciation from anyone, you seem to be repeating this over quite a few postings and across several threads, in the same manner as you have repeated that you are a nobody, and an insignificant X-rat.</p>
              <p>The false modesty is a convenient cover for a psychopath - as History has recorded the same false modesty of your OLD PAPa, who introduced someone as the future Prime Minister of Singapore, but will scheme to have that unfortunate soul to be incarcerated.</p>

              <p>3. Out of admiration to your contribution to HFM, if indeed you are from there, I give you the fullest right to dismiss what I had written as thrash or hogwash, for it is only your perception, and not mine. It is a long reply because it would be churlish of me not to reply to you. I owe you that much for belonging to HFM, for its ideals, but not our differences which compromises on both can bridge in time, if indeed necessary.</p>
              <p>Best regards.  </p>

              <p>* Did the X-rat reached this point so quickly and missed out the best for the X-rat to dig the grave for me to bury the rat ? *</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For one who will suggest for others to treat its own writing as thrash or hogwash, and then claim that it is the perception of others and not its own - it is simply dishonest and disingenious.</p>
              <p>It is obvious that only a nobody and an insignificant will indulge itself with writing thrash and hogwash - does anyone need a nobody to give anyone the right to dismiss it ?</p>
              <p>Obviously again, only a X-rat will know what "churlish" mean - as the entire length of this response to Gensis is filled with its boorish and vulgar display of false modesty, loud boasts, and inconsequential reasons for doing what a X-rat does best.</p>
              <p>A grand performance of a court jester doing its level best to hit X-rating.</p>

              <p>What possibly can be in the simple and bankrupt mind of a X-rated petty rat - to deny the honorary of being a "armchair critic" ?</p>
              <p>Is it not a fact that the bitterness of the X-rat is due to its own lack of creativity to offer advice ?</p>
              <p>Or perhaps the truth is that it simply cannot do any better than others even as the X-rat will huff and puff and fret over the present difficult status-quo ?</p>

              <p>You had failed in a simple test i had set up for you.</p>
              <p>I had friends and contributors in organisations such as HFM. HFM volunteers would spend and slog long hours to help build homes for the disadvantage, and are impartial people, driven only in their selfless attitudes to help others.</p>
              <p>You couldnt even spare 2 minutes to read a post before you. You did not claim to belong to that organisation, for which i am thankful as your kind wouldnt have lasted, nor did you claim to belong there, of which you wouldhave been a disgrace to the organisation.</p>
              <p>You are no more than a rabble rouser, with your clearly bias personal attacks, just as the pitiful Turd here, a pathetic creature reduced to insane ramblings, when confronted with realities against her twists, lies and half truths. If the real PAP is here, she would be torn apart much earlier and would need to recuperate in IMH, instead of being shown up now by me, a mere nobody and insignificant.</p>
              <p>What you do with your time, as you haughtily claim is precious, and yet free to drop in here as you like, cowardly using different nicks to hide your devious agendas, that is, if you truly are, is none of my concern, for I owe you nothing.</p>
              <p>Revealing what you really are and to be beware of is a contribution i would gladly offer anytime to my fellow citizens.</p>
