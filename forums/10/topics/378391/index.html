              <p>Don't know the rationale behind asking for PRCs for the job.  Could the boss of the company be a PRC or the wife is a PRC?</p>
              <p>Whatever, it is rather discriminating to the locals.   MOM should step in to deal with this.   But I doubt MOM will as we are know the ruling party is all for the PRCs.   hahahah</p>

              <p>Why do you persist in giving bad advice?</p>
              <p>Do I need to stand up or even, a republican, beg when i have an MP to speak up on my behalf, whom I have the fullest trust in his capability to do what is right, not just for my interest but for the interest of the majority whom had elected him?</p>
              <p>No. This is my country and home. I am not involve in politics nor seek political office. There are more capable people than me to represent my constituency.</p>
              <p>I am educated and matured enough to know that change takes time and patience, people are not perfect and mistakes do happen. I am not the one complaining here, but you and your kind are.</p>
              <p>Thus, there is no need for me to stand up. Only people like you and your kind who are not satisfied, needs to stand up, and be democratically voted into office if what you complain about is right, in peace and constitutionally,  and not by bullshit 'civil disobedience' or nonsensical oxymoronic ' non-violent' demostrations.</p>
              <p>Failure which, you are in reality, selfishly sitting here instigating, inciting, and hoping someone else will do the job for you, on your behalf, and take the rap for it if something goes wrong.  </p>
