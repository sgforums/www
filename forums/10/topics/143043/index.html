Barrack, chief executive officer of Raffles' purchasers Colony Capital, also said the American group deeply 'respects the historical significance of the Raffles Hotel, Singapore' and considers it their 'responsibility to protect that legacy'.<br><br>Raffles Holdings' parent CapitaLand's president and chief executive officer Liew Mun Leong added his own reassurance.<br><br>'When the Americans sold Rockefeller Centre to the Japanese, Mitsubishi... there were also sentiments about it. And when the British sold Harrods to an Egyptian buyer, did anything happen to it? In fact, it's still very much a British institution.<br><br>'Those two institutions did not change. Ownership does not change the legacy of the buildings.'<br><br>Raffles Hotel, in Beach Road, is one of the 41 luxury hotels owned or managed by Raffles Holdings that Colony, a United States real-estate investment company, has bought for about US$1 billion (S$1.7 billion).<br><br>The purchase, which includes 15 Raffles and 26 Swissotel hotels and resorts, is expected to be completed by the end of the year.<br><br>Since 1887, Raffles Hotel has played host to numerous celebrities, including Elizabeth Taylor, Grace Kelly and Orson Welles.<br><br>The hotel has also served as a source of inspiration for writers like Somerset Maugham, author of The Casuarina Tree, who would sit under the frangipani trees in the morning, turning the society gossip he overheard into fiction.<br><br>Since 1995, it has been one of 54 buildings in Singapore gazetted as a monument, which means little can be done to change the architectural properties or even colour of the buildings without the approval of the Preservation of Monuments Board. Its name - Raffles Hotel - must also be retained.<br><br>The board, however, has no jurisdiction over any change in the usage of the building.<br><br>And that concerns heritage-watchers like Dr Kevin Tan, president of the Singapore Heritage Society. 'The concern isn't if it will be kept intact architecturally, but more if it will be used for other purposes, for example, as a shopping centre or a casino,' he said.<br><br>In a statement yesterday, the board pointed out that Raffles Hotel is not the first national monument to be owned by foreign companies or individuals.<br><br>The old Thong Chai Medical Hall in Eu Tong Sen Street and MacDonald House in Orchard Road are also owned by foreigners and 'these continue to be preserved and maintained according to the guidelines'.<br><br>While the board has no say on how the building is used, owners have to run it past other government 'gatekeepers' like the Urban Redevelopment Authority and the Ministry of National Development.<br><br>As for retaining the interior decor, Raffles Holdings will continue to own a range of assets, including antiques and memorabilia, and has agreed to loan them to Colony for display at the hotel.<br><br>Real estate experts also believe that there is no cause for concern, as the new owners are unlikely to change a 'winning formula'.<br><br>Said Assistant Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim from the National University of Singapore's department of real estate: 'A significant part of the value of the building comes from its role as a hotel and that is likely to be the reason the investors bought it. It's not a rational choice to change it.'<br><br>mariaa@sph.com.sg<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>WHY SELL AN ICON?<br><br>'My sentiments are very simple... I think the change of ownership of Raffles Hotel, doesn't change it at all. It still has its own history, own legacy, it'll still be in Beach Road. And the new owner, paying so much for it, will definitely bring it up...<br><br>Singapore is an open economy and if people want to buy something at a good price, why not?'<br>MR LIEW MUN LEONG, CapitaLand's president and chief executive<br><br>DOESN'T MATTER WHO OWNS IT<br><br>'When the Americans sold Rockefeller Centre to the Japanese... there were also sentiments about it. And when the British sold Harrods to an Egyptian buyer, did anything happen to it? In fact, it's still very much a British institution. Those two institutions did not change. Ownership does not change the legacy of the buildings.'<br>-- MR LIEW<br><br>NO DIFFERENCE TO GUESTS AND STAFF<br><br>'Some guests don't even care who the owners are. They care only about the staff, and the hotel that they come to Singapore to see, to visit, and to stay in... Whether it's Colony owning it, or somebody else, it's something that is very far removed from the guests.<br><br>And the staff, as long as they continue under the same management... and the same general manager and the same brand, they're also equally comfortable.'<br>-- MS JENNIE CHUA, chief executive of Raffles Holdings<br><br>RAFFLES LEGACY WILL BE PROTECTED<br><br>'We deeply respect the historical significance of the Raffles Hotel and we consider it our responsibility to protect that legacy. We are delighted Jennie Chua has agreed to remain as chairman of the Raffles Hotel Singapore to provide continuity and support our efforts.'<br>-- MR THOMAS J. BARRACK, chairman and CEO of Colony Capital</span><br><br>Isn't it odd that our GLCs have no qualms about selling our national assets, especially when they get tremendous value for it? We seemed to have <strong>forsaken national heritage in favour of monetary profit. </strong><br><br>As there wasn't any open bids, we can safely assume that raffles hotel wasn't saddled in debt. Given the lack of reasons, one can only wonder what raffles holdings or rather CapitalLand was thinking when they even considered this offer. Then again a 1 billion offer equates to good business and was probably too tempting to resist.<br><br>Appointing (or re-appointing) Ms Jeanie Chua seems only iconic rather than strategic as, despite what is reported on non-jurisdiction, her own powers are likely to be limited by the subsequent Colony Board, indicating that she serves only as 'interim' chairman to supervise the transition. I don't see how she plans to preserve the legacy that is Raffles and all that talk abt patrons who 'don't care who the hotel owners are' simply marginalise the issue at hand - that all our national assets are expendable so long as it comes at a good price.<br><br>CapitalLand probably needs the funding, possibly to seed other projects and aquisitions as part of their overall company direction. Sadly, it seems money has taken precedence over basic pride and heritage.<br><br>We have relinquished Westin Stamford to Swissotel. With the sale of Raffles hotel, one can only surmise...who's next?</div>
