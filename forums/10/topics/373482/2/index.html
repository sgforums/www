              <p><strong>I’m inclined to think that costs are rising mainly because of greed i.e. people living beyond their means by the way of credit</strong></p>

              <p>??? did u not made the presumption?</p>
              <p>what about price theory.....? Have you ever thought that how businesses expand their business if they do not have bank overdraft? and extend credit terms to their customers to expand their business activities?</p>

              <p>i think Its like this, Costs are rising and will continue to rise because govt is importing more foreigners from 4.8 million to 6 million people as more people are competing over the same resources.</p>
              <p>govt is doing so much importing of ft because more people here = more spending = higher gdp figures = keep their pay. So this can be a worrying sign as govt is resorting to sheer quantity of people to help boost gdp figures.. Just my 2 cents i could be wrong</p>

              It is easy just reduce the revenue collected by govt.   Please see iras webpage and see the total revenue collected for 2008/2009 was almost $30 billion.  See the appendices for details of each item of revenue collected.     GST still maintain at 7% inspite some appeals in parliament to reduce recently.
               I  visited the two new markets at Geylang and Little India and observed food and drinks have increased.  When enquired the stall holders said rental has increased so they have to increase the prices.

              <p>if i am you i would pt 2 major factors and subbreaking them into smaller smaller factors.</p>
              <p>1. macro factors.</p>
              <p>2. micro factors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. macro factors are what factors that will determine the prices of goods to go up beyond our control.</p>
              <p>a. greenhouse effect. droughts, heavy rains, push prices of crops to go up. demand for bio fuel.</p>
              <p>b. ecalating of oil prices due to economic growth of india, china. this drive up energy prices and business cost.</p>
              <p>3. escalating commodities prices.</p>
              <p>4, govt policies, such as protectionism.</p>
              <p>5. others u think yourself/</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Micro factors what factors that are within our control of our govt or various businesses.</p>
              <p>a. taxes or indirect tax such as GST., ERP, fuel tax, increase business cost.</p>
              <p>b. immigration. influx of foreigners push up demand for housing. causing prices to go up without substantial increase in salary. u need elaborate more.</p>
              <p>3. govt policy of lax regulation on speculation of property prices. 1person can have 8 private properties in some cases.</p>
              <p>4. others u think lor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>watch more CNBC, Bloomberg or independent business channel.  My advice is not depend on CNA, state control media will tell u what they want u to know. it stifle your adbility to think out of the box.</p>

              <p>sure, they are the creator of debts, they created credits cards, banks, loan financial institution and many other way of going into debts, one thing that they like to borrow so much is because their bankruptcy system is very lax compare to other countries, after 7 years of declaration of bankruptcy, they are no more bankrupt and goes loan free.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So they go into borrowing, spend other people money, especially from Asians investor,..then they make the bank bust, and they dun have to pay back.</p>

              <p>i think Its like this, Costs are rising and will continue to rise because govt is importing more foreigners from 4.8 million to 6 million people as more people are competing over the same resources.</p>
              <p>govt is doing so much importing of ft because more people here = more spending = higher gdp figures = keep their pay. So this can be a worrying sign as govt is resorting to sheer quantity of people to help boost gdp figures.. Just my 2 cents i could be wrong</p>

              <p>When we face a price upsurging condition, most likely is that the demanding is higher than the supply. So you import more than export, and when you import more, you loose more and have to jack up the prices of goods just to make profit. Therefore prices went up. And we will be poorer because if you import more than export the GDP will be in negative side. Therefore the govt now have to look at the prices and study more way for exporting</p>

              <p>Instead of finding more ways to export doesnt it make sense to find ways to not be reliant on exporting especially when the 2 superpowers are unreliable countries to export to? - America: going to fall soon - China: can produce more cheaply than SG. More people to spend on domestic produce reduces SG's vulnerability on export</p>

              <p><br>Bear in mind that we have no natural resources, thru all these years since our industrialisation, we are a export driven economy, very much still depend on FDI or so call MNCs. Our own domestic market is the smallest in the world, generating low products such as pencil, washing foams shoes, shirt etc or even foods is no more competitive as others can easily follow up, we needs to advance constantly for higher end product such as financial, services, computers, bio science, pharmacy, medical products or some high tech electronics parts etc etc. In another words, we need to be knowledgeable, the know how and why knowledge to shift ourselves from a knowledge economy to intelligent economy. China and America is needed because of it big market, selling one pencil in singapore among our 0.5 million students is nothing compare to selling 50 millions in china ya.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Economy of scale come in as more peoples start to buy a product, the business will first increase it price till it meet another competitor who is selling the same product, and more so with more competitor. Just like selling chicken rice, the more sellers in your hawker centres the more cheaper it is, and cheaper does not mean the lower of prices, more meat and rice can also mean lowering of price.There are two types of goods, one is the essential goods, the salt, meat, coffee, rice, washing powder etc etc that you need to use daily and is a must, the other is the higher end goods which if you got money you go for it.</p>
