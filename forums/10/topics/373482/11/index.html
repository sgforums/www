              <p><br>Where to rent a room for $250 only?</p>
              <p>Rent from HDB directly may be  possible,  and their staff may be can help you although it has so many rules regulations.</p>
              <p>If u don't believe you can read the following eg., not qualify but still can rent since the year of 2005, open market rent a room u have to pay $500/month, HDB rent very very cheap, $26/-- per month for 1 unit also have, some more no need to pay for the rent,Town council and SP bill for several months per year, where to find this kind of house at the open market?</p>
              <p>This case got complain but seems nothing will happen, worth to try! </p>

Mdm Seah said she can't get along with her currently flatmate so she is requiring HDB to let her change co-tenant at Blk 9, North Bridge Road #12-4166 S(190009).<br><br>Mdm Seah has been working in Swissotel The Stamford Singapore (morning shift since 21 years ago) and Swissotel Merchant Court Singapore(Night shift since 10 years ago) as a House Attendent, therefore her income is more than $2,000/- per month and both of the companies are contributing CPF for her.<br><br>She also said that she was actually not qualify to rent the above unit during Nov 2005, because her income exceeded the limit set by HDB(HDB only set the limited to $1,500/- per month at that time) , but the HDB HQ staff told her don't show CPF statement even she was working and her company was contributing CPF for her because she was above 55 years old, therefore she reported that she was unemployed when she was applying to rent the above unit.<br><br>When she was renewing the tenancy for the above unit at Nov 2007, her income was still more than $2,000/- per month, but the staff of the HDB Sims Branch suggested her to report that she and her currently flatmate total income only $800/- per month, so she did it and then continue to enjoy the heavily subsidised(the lowest rent $33/month, rebate from SP bill and Town Council) from government for more than 3 years.<br><br>May I know whether those above 55 years old citizens have to report their incomes when they are applying to rent flats or renewing tenancies? Especially those applicants who have high incomes at every month for many years until now and the company has contributed CPF for him/her!<br><br>If the answer is Yes then why your staff told Mdm Seah to do like that?<br><br>Is below 55 years old co-tenant has to report their income when renewing tenancy?<br><br>If yes then why your branch staff suggested Mdm Seah to report that household gross income only $800/- per month even Mdm Seah's flatmate was working (income was more than $1,000/month) with CPF contribution and below 55 years old when renewing tenancy at Nov 2007.<br><br>Can you let me know the answer as soon as posible because I am worrying that if I paring up with Mdm Seah to rent the above unit but finally the board take action to against her then I would be affected!<br><br>If your answer is NO then I would not understand why the government subsidised for this kind of high income tenant to enjoy but left those low income citizens waiting in the long queue for renting smallest flat?<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>regards<br>Chan Sxxx pxxx<br><br> </p>
