              <p><br>Uncle, why u always like to bring out the old time, but nevertheless, that was my purpose, make u angry and you do the GP for me..hehehe...cos, i hardly find flaws in LKY.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From 1964 to 2004, 40 years, if LKY is to stick to what he talked in 1964, we are history. Please lah, time changed, we must also change to suit the enviroment and condition of state, if you are to remain status quo of the oldies or retro night, by all mean, but that does not mean he dun walk his talks. Dun be a frog in a well ya.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever your heros of patriotic pass is over, I do respect them, but it over, learn the lesson and move on, the new breed of oppositions should not mingle on old old issue, they should take it as a lesson, keep it and speaks to the audience more on the present and the future. That is why opposition supporters like you alway lose out, because you all like to talk about ah ma stories whereas PAP talks about the future, the pre emptive measurement for jobs, careers, success, stablility and harmony.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As an enemy of the ruling state, dun try to do the differences, try to amulate their success into your advantages. UNDERSTAND.</p>
