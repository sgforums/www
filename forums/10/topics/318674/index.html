              <p>basically, mediacorp is holding this charity programme for publicity. if it is really concern about helping the countries affected, burma is the one that needs more help. china has a freaking $12billion aid fund, whereas for burma, there's none that i know of. (pls enlighten me otherwise)</p>
              <p>furthermore, the burmese victims suffered longer as compared to the sichuan quake victim, with the cyclone nargis striking earlier than the quake.</p>
              <p>Also, their country isn't bless by the fact that it has rich patriots who are willing to donate millions of dollars for aid relieve. (look at yao ming and liu xiang).</p>
              <p>they are just a bunch of needy people who deserve more aid.</p>

              <p>Btw, the Singapore Red Cross accepts donations for both sichuan and burma through walk in donations, mailed checques, bank transfers, internet banking, phone banking (through toll free 1800 numbers, no less) and AXS payments ....</p>
              <p>if you guys don't feel like enriching the "sole winner" any further, but would give a little something for either of these places .... please take a look</p>

              <p>At prime-time 6.00 pm - 11.00 pm a 30-sec commercial costs $3,000 - $6,000.00. How many seconds were each of the ministers and MPs and senior civil servants given to sell their one-sided news?</p>
              <p>Multiply this rate by the news devoted to the government and the time slot taken by all of them we will know why as a country we are no longer being governed for the good of all or the majority. Conversely multiply the rate and the time slot devoted to solving citizens' problems and discussing issues or exploring greater solutions and suggestions made by citizens or exploring oppositions' works in their wards or in raising issues in parliament and we will know what contributions are the TVs like Channel News Asia making to the citizens.</p>
              <p>Should citizens have a greater say in the allocation of time devoted to government as against people's news and problems?</p>
              <p>If the answer is no then should citizens pay less TV licence fees and let ministers or ruling party pay for their prime time slots which should be devoted to citizens and news.</p>

              <p>But I think it's very healthy to question where your donation dollars are going to ... how are they being spent ....</p>
              <p>remember the gold taps and the 600k peanuts of the NKF ? ... that was the result of our apathy ... we all need to share in the collective guilt of being unquestioning drones who didn't ask what was happening ... do you want a redux ? ...</p>
              <p>you may want to leave it to God or the almighty to punish people who feed off charity dollars, but I believe that the debts of this world must be reckoned in this one .... if you just dump your coins and notes into a tin can when it comes to you and hope for the best, and nothing comes out of it in the end, what difference does it make to those you were trying to help ? ... certainly not those in need ... maybe only you, who may have felt that 5 minutes glow of having done a good deed for the day ? .... </p>

              <p><br>Totally agree! If someone, an organisation or company wants to make a donation... why do they even wan to spend money on tv telling people watching "I donated money to the Si Chuan quake"</p>
