              <p>I personnally dun think so for China case. Yes, they have the $$, I never deny that. However, we must see it this way. The Chinese government is trying to solve 13 billion (I think it's about 14 billion now, I can't confirm the stats) peoples' small problem, so when you multiple a small problem by 13 billion, it will become a BIG problem. The Sichuan quake is part of the BIG problem. Besides, I think what we are donating is based on humanitarian ground. Of course, we donors, deserves to know how our donations were being spent by the organizations we donate to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for Myammar, I dun really feel like donating. Who knows? maybe the $1 you donated will be use to buy a cup of rice that will be used in the wedding of a certain general's daughter?</p>

              <p>what the cost of mediacorp for these funds raising program time?</p>
              <p>remember last time seen before should be around few hundred thousand dollars,</p>
              <p>so this time all wear round neck printed T shirt, but their makeup still using more expensive water-proofed type! what the different? saving from clothing! spent on cosmatic?</p>
              <p>35 call-in lines! where got enough? Hong Kong and Taiwan had more than 100 call-in lines, even their immediate president with first lady were present not only to grace the event, but also sit on the task, as telephone operater answer call-in, where our SGP president?</p>
              <p>and why must call-in be S$50 and above? taiwan TV fund raising even call-in with Taiwan dollar 100 = S$4.45, even these small amount their donor name also appear scrolling across TV screen.</p>
              <p>the whole taiwan TV fund raising, do not has singer performing except some occassion really do not has empty sits for them to be telephone operator they then sing with sad mode.</p>
              <p>worst part of last night fund raising program, TV screen shot of latest fashion up coming program.  what they expecting us to re-act? crying then happy mode with seconds to crying mode again!</p>

              <p>I dont have much comments regarding the comparison of Myanmar and China disasters, comparing which one is worse. I think let it be for each individual's decision. For some people, maybe they will make a comparison, and then they decide which one to help. For other people, they wont do this comparison. For instance, I am sure Myanmarese would be far more likely to donate to Myanmar cyclone than China earthquake. Similarly for Chinese, it is far more likely to donate to China earthquake. This is just natural. I dont have much comments on this, let each person decide.</p>
              <p>People who are non-Myanmarse and non-Chinese, maybe they are more predisposed to make a comparison. But for a Myanmarese, and for a Chinese, it is natural they tend to help their own 'family'.</p>
              <p>I dont know about that Singtel 30 cents charge. Dont know what to say. In a sense 'admin charges' seems wrong in donation drives. But to shun it because of these 'admin charges' seem like even bigger wrong. Singtel is just an actor in this drama, an intermediary. The bigger picture is the help towards victims.</p>

              <p>Majority of the people are mislead, misguided, misinterpret or whatever you want to call it about the word 'Donate'. Donation in its true sense doesn't just point to monetary. It can be in any form. However for example sake, most dictionary has noted down donation as giving in any form and then added this stupid word 'ESPECIALLY' money.</p>
              <p>Let's put it this way. When a victim of the earthquake now is suffering in hunger, would you say give him money or food? If you give him money, where do you think he is going to buy food when it's not instantly available? Ok, you can argue that money can be given to the government. Right, you gave it to the government but it takes a long time for the government to purchase the food and then transport it to the disaster zone. That takes time. Why go around the camel's balls to do things? Why not just send the food directly and immediately that we've donated to the affected area which cut short the route? Moreover how sure are we that our monies will really really be put into good use that is by buying the necessities for the victims?</p>
              <p>Singapore has sent a team of abled men to help. To me that is a form of donation - donating our effort. Bear in mind these abled men are our sons who are risking their lives in a highly dangerous area. Isn't that is a greater cause than money?</p>
              <p>As for Myannmar. The world has donated lots of necessities like foods and medical supplies but it doesn't even reach the victims until days later. And the joke of the year was the food supplies were labled with Thiem Sen's name! (Somebody correct me on that sh*thead name please) Why need to put his name when the food supplies were from the world. Can you imagine even food supplies and medicals also take days before it finally reach its vicitms, I couldn't imagine if the monies will really be put into good use should it reaches his hands!</p>
              <p>Anyway just my 2 knuts.</p>

              <p>Allow me...</p>
              <p>1. I do agree that there has been a resurgence of calls and 'live' tv programs to encourage, persuade, influence people to donate. Influence need not be a bad word.</p>
              <p>2. Are charity shows and donations programs really non-profitable to everyone?</p>
              <p>Out of the 9 million collected, how much actually went to the needy?</p>
              <p>Who are those earning revenue from this, if any? I no no. I dam stewpig wan. Tell me.</p>
              <p>3. IF there is 1 company or organisation that will increase its revenue with charity shows, would they not be eager to have more? I mean, why do they not give all this revenue derived from those kind hearted and innocents who wants their money to go directly to the needy ? Are they doing that?  If not , can I say they are profiting?</p>
              <p>4. Many people call for donation. I wonder among these, the well off ones, how much have they donated exactly clearly absolutely? I expect them to walk the talk.</p>
              <p>For example, if average people salary is 3000, and say this person donates 30 dolloars, by proportion, a person earning say 3 0 0  0 0 0 a month! should be donating at least 100 times that amount which is 3000  dollars.</p>
              <p>Are they doing that?</p>
              <p>5. Since the NNKKFF fiasco, many have not donated.  I get the feeling that with this kinds of encouragement, more would return to donating. Good or bad is debatable , like everything under the sun.</p>
              <p>6. I also notice more calling for funds to be donated by the people to get some things done. Why the rich don't do these good deeds instead? or at least are they doing it together with the poorer ones who are helping? </p>
              <p>7. I call for implementation of publishing every cent of public donation received on the internet for all to view. There should be nothing that could not be disclosed.</p>
