            <div class='col-md body'>This memory is etched in my mind forever.<br><br>when i was a kid, i went to disneyland with my family (this was in the 1980s). we were inside this omni-theatre style of auditorium and it showed scenes of the USA. suddenly, the entire audience stood up spontaneously and burst out in song singing "America, the beautiful". there was no announcement to sing or any prompting. they sang with passion and geniune love for their country.<br><br>i was touched. and even though i didnt what the song was about, i was moved to tears.<br><br>many yrs later, i know that the USA is often divided along political lines and social issues but one thing they do agree is that America is their home and they are proud to be americans. apparently, their disagreement did not destroy or weaken their country, or dilute their loyalty to their land.<br><br>we are often told that having  a differing politics would destroy our country, but it seems that not having a chance to disagree would destroy the soul of our country.<br><br>nowadays, who sings the national anthem? go to any school and you will realise that the quietest period of the day is the morning assembly period.<br><br></div>
