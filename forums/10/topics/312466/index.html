              <p>remember that incident and there was a talk about how "brain
                                      dead" is dead for patients? well, this "brain dead" patient
                                      recovered..</p>
              <p>http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/zachs-back-from-the-dead/2008/03/25/1206207051448.html</p>
              <p>Four months after he was declared brain dead and doctors were
                                      about to remove his organs for transplant, Zach Dunlap says he
                                      feels "pretty good".</p>
              <p>Mr Dunlap was pronounced dead on November 19 last year at United
                                      Regional Healthcare System in Wichita Falls, Texas, in the United
                                      States, after he was injured in an all-terrain vehicle accident.
                                      His family agreed to having his organs harvested.</p>
              <p>As family members were paying their last respects, he moved his
                                      foot and hand. He reacted to a pocketknife scraped across his foot
                                      and to pressure applied under a fingernail.</p>
              <p>After 48 days in hospital, he was allowed to return home, where
                                      he continues to work on his recovery.</p>
              <p>On Monday, he and his family were in New York, appearing on
                                      NBC's <em>Today Show</em>.</p>
              <p>"I feel pretty good. but it's just hard ... just ain't got the
                                      patience," he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Dunlap, 21, of Frederick, said he had no recollection of the
                                      crash.</p>
              <p>"I remember a little bit that was about an hour before the
                                      accident happened. But then about six hours before that, I
                                      remember," he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Dunlap said one thing he did remember was hearing the
                                      doctors pronounce him dead.</p>
              <p>"I'm glad I couldn't get up and do what I wanted to do," he
                                      said.</p>
              <p>Asked if he would have wanted to get up and shake them and say
                                      he was alive, he responded: "Probably would have been a broken
                                      window that went out."</p>
              <p>His father, Doug, said he saw the results of the brain scan.</p>
              <p>"There was no activity at all, no blood flow at all," he
                                      said.</p>
              <p>His mother, Pam, said that when she discovered he was still
                                      alive, "That was the most miraculous feeling.</p>
              <p>"We had gone, like I said, from the lowest possible emotion that
                                      a parent could feel to the top of the mountains again," she
                                      said.</p>
              <p>She said her son was doing "amazingly well", but still had
                                      problems with his memory as his brain heals from the traumatic
                                      injury.</p>
              <p>"It may take a year or more ... before he completely recovers,"
                                      she said. "But that's OK. It doesn't matter how long it takes.
                                      We're just all so thankful and blessed that we have him here."</p>
              <p>Mr Dunlap now has the pocketknife that was scraped across his
                                      foot, causing the first reaction.</p>
              <p>"Just makes me thankful, makes me thankful that they didn't give
                                      up," he said. "Only the good die young, so I didn't go."</p>

              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">From NBC News</span></p>
              <p>An Oklahoma man declared brain dead shocks everyone when he suddenly reached for the nurse who was prepping him for organ donation.</p>
              <p>The Frederick, Oklahoma man was critically injured while riding an all terrain vehicle near the town of Davidson.</p>
              <p>The family of Zack Dunlap is calling his story a miracle. One moment, they're saying goodbye to him. The next, they're being told he has come back to life.</p>
              <p>As church signs urged the town of Frederick to pray for 21-year-old Zack Dunlap, his family said they received a sign from God.</p>
              <p>Dunlap's uncle James Blackford said, "God come down and give him a miracle. I believe that with all my heart."</p>
              <p>Zack suffered severe head injuries in the accident. Monday morning, at a Wichita Falls hospital, the highway patrol said Zack was pronounced brain dead.</p>
              <p>Shortly after, a nurse was preparing him for organ donation when the unthinkable happened.</p>
              <p>Oklahoma state trooper Betsy Randolph said, "During this time, while the nurse was prepping his body for organ transplant, he grabbed her arm."</p>
              <p>Zack had come back to life. But how?</p>
              <p>"Doctor came back down and said 'Well, I don't know what happened. But I guess it was faulty equipment on the first test. Which, it wasn't faulty equipment. God touched him," said Blackford.</p>
              <p>Zack's next-door neighbor Roberta Klein agrees.</p>
              <p>"I think it's the result of people praying in this town, and committing him to the Lord. And God has a purpose for him."</p>
              <p>"He's got a long ways to go, but he's alive," Blackford said.</p>

              <p>How long should a person be in brain-dead state before he's being declared dead?</p>
              <p>4 months isn't too long, neither is 10 years if the person survives.</p>

              <p>   Remember the case of the HK lady news reporter ? I forgot her name but she was involved in an accident an her boss invited both dunno london or british best doctors and also beijing best doctors . The ang mo doctors being the first to examine her told the boss that she was declared brain dead . Then her boss let the doctors from beijing examine her . After a while of examining , the beijing doctors make ehr swallow a pill called An Gong Niu Huang Wan . Then after dunno how long proceed to give her acupunctor among other chinese traditional medicines . Before long the lady news reporter woke up . And after continuing the chinese medical treatment for sometime , she was able to leave the hospital only have to go for some physiotheray treatment . Now she is already back to her old job and many pple bombard the ang mo doctor say how come you declare her brain dead but the beijing doctor can bring her not only to life but even a complete recovery till she was even able to go back to work and still dare to call yourself specialist ? The ang mo doctor were stunned for an answer . This case was very famouse at that time and it hogged the limelight for sometime .</p>
              <p>   Last week when i went for my back pain treatment at a chinese medical center , when the doctor heard me sniffing my nose she immediately pierced a needle at both my hand and near both my elbow and my running nose was cured within minutes . Instead of hours or even days by western medicine .</p>

              <p>yeah, TCM's pretty cool that way. but there are some stuff western doctors can do that TCM can't. so i think they're like 2 sides to the same coin.</p>
