            <div class='col-md body'>I refer you to the american talkshow 20/20 that was aired on 8th of July 8pm on channel news asia.<br><br>i happened on this show while i was sitting in front of the television enjoying the $2 mac offer from macdonald(&lt;--not i'm not working for them).<br><br>Now the show was talking about how despite the 9/11 and anthrax incidents America's firstline of defence - the police, the firemen and paramedics were actually NOT equipped for terrorist attacks, biological, chemical, nuclear or otherwise.<br><br>They are only given small little hand kits of latex gloves, rubber packaging for the boots and thin little gowns in an event of a terrorist attack. Even the firemen's equipments can only deal with smoke.<br><br>Even special police forces did not have the equipment to deal with non standard weapons.<br><br>It was said, first for 6mths, then a year then a year and a half that 4 billion dollars would be diverted to properly equip the first line of defence against terrorism. But not a cent was seen.<br><br>Instead, the money was diverted towards the gathering of intelligence because it is cheaper and more cost effective (Ironic isn't it? Even though the CIA had information before the 9-11 they took no decisive actions)<br><br>It was interesting to hear that Congress had already provided adequate protection for its 25,000 of governmental workers. It looks like they were more concerned for themselves.<br><br>How hilarious especially, that more money is spent on waging wars and given to Iraq to rebuild than given to its own citizens to protect themselves. Why? probably because they could regain the loss through Iraq's oils.<br><br>Personally i dislike the Singapore system and wished we had more freedom. But i do not believe that simply "more freedom" would make us a better country. America is hailed as a land of freedom, but are their system free of the corruption that is in the world? How about Enron?<br><br>I'm not a PAP lover and i'm disgusted with the education system. However, i will not look upon the faults of our systems and regard them as unique.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While I can empathize with your position concerning the non-uniqueness of the problems that every country will face with Governmental or Private faults, I can hardly agree that SingaporeÂ’s method in dealing with our problems is preferred or any better.<br><br>Freedom in the USA will at least allow the Citizen to decide in the manner that Politics is conducted that no single political party can change the ground rules of election that will be to any one partyÂ’s advantage.<br><br>At least in the USA, the Election Commission is a truly independent, non-partisan body that will not be accommodating or defer to any political personality; and will at least truly - and not simply - show to be upholding the Law, but will actually execute its role according to the expectation of the Law to such an Office.<br><br>At least in the USA, the Judiciary System is certainly a non-Partisan body that is truly separate from the Executive branch of Government, and do NOT favor or defer to any personality or political party.<br><br>In the USA, despite its faults Â– either in the Public Domain of Enterprise or Government, or in the Private Acts of Sick Individuals Â– the truth will surface that allow the Citizens the FREEDOM to express its true feelings to demonstrate against any inequities or injustice in the System.<br><br>What have we in Singapore that allow the Citizen to make any form of Â“demonstrationÂ” against inequities and injustice - Private or Public ?<br><br>The Labor Movement do NOT represent the Singaporean Workers, and has degenerated itself into a commercial body in the guise of a Workers Co-operative that work more to generate Profit for itself - more than to lower the Cost of Living for the average worker.<br><br>During this period of mass unemployment, has the National Trade Union truly represented the unemployed workers to regain access to any form of financial assistance during this period of mass unemployment ?<br><br>Instead it has remained "loudly dumb" and unable to represent the unemployed in gaining a return of their CPF monies to tide over this difficult period.<br><br>For any unemployed worker, he or she has to suffer the indignity to show proof that he or she has made an effort to regain employment before any form of financial assistance will be given.<br><br>Does the displaced worker have to beg for financial assistance, when the worker has so much funds locked away in his CPF that will probably allow him to start a small business ?<br><br>Where is the CitizenÂ’s Right to protest against such inequities ?<br><br>This will not happen in the USA despite the glaring faults of her systems.<br><br></div>
