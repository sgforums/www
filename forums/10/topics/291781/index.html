After they have won several more seats, then only can they start to think about  competing against one another.<br><br><strong>Opposition must learn to be humble and not be too ambitious now</strong> that they form many parties and make opposition as a whole, full of holes. weakening themselves. like this, their opponent will gain and laugh all the way to the bank. Thus, that is why, given this is so obvious, I always question , why they behave with so little humbility. Then, you will suspect....ar....you get what i mean.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   more than meets the eyes.

Surely. Many Ruling parties started as Opposition and then their voters were impressed and swung votes to them to prove themselves. But they must put in more effort than the last 50 years added together.<br><br>Their pace must at least speed up by 50x if they are gonna win.<br></div>
