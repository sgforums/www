            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks.  There are an abundance of supporting reports that we were asked to leave Malaysia.

To say LKY 'orchestrated' the seperation may perhaps be too strong a word. An opportunist, probably?<br><br>Even if a foreign historian were to do a write up that "LKY orchestrated the seperation", how far would that go towards debunking official history that has been in place all these years?<br><br>Remember Gavin Menzies who wrote 1421 and claimed it was Cheng Ho who discovered America first?<br><br>Think of the Arabs who claimed they were the first to sail round the world when it was historically known to be Magellan?<br><br>Anyway, if you were to ask any Malaysian, particularly the Malays, they will tell you that LKY made use of Tunku Abdul Rahman to secure independence. Almost everyone that I ask sing the same tune. Product of brainwash? Maybe.....and one can say the same about Singaporeans.<br><br>Even LKY's memoirs......they were meant to be a descriptive and pictorial history. However, what's the feel that one gets after reading it? Self glorification? Most likely.<br><br>Historians have always penned history books the <span style="font-style: italic;">way it was meant to be written</span>. That will never change for perpetuity.<br><br>If you were in LKY's shoes, what would you have done?<br><br>A 44 by 32 km land with only less than 2 million people, no natural resources, no armed forces, no organised police force, gansterism rife etc etc.<br><br>Compare that with living under the Malays and having the ruling party jealous of your own PAP. Suffering under the Bumiputera policy where race matters more than merit. A dictator mentality at heart LKY would never have tolerated it.<br><br>Of the two evils, which one?<br><br>After all, Singapore could still count on its port. Foreign Direct Investment to quickly build the country wouldn't be too difficult an idea to moot, right?</div>

No job? go government agency la.<br><br>Look at Proton. A good example how much it has declined as a company when it has to employ 80% of its workforce Malays. Are we sure all of them get the job due to merit or race?</div></blockquote>i am msia chinese, i know how it feel, most probably far better than ur so called undergrad frens. with or w/o the policy, you still need to fight for what you want to achieve. the policy has been ard for decades. yes, it benefited the malays, it made wealth for the malays, it also brought peace to the whole country. look at Indonesia, the anti-chinese in 1997, what was the root of the problem?<br><br>for an educated person (esp for those got into uni with poor grade), would you pick up the parang and go chop the chinese while u can actually do ur shopping with your decent salary or even underpaid salary?<br><br>take sg for example, if the malays was poor like those in indo, can you guarantee they wont pick up the parang and chop you?<br><br>I am happy to see the malays have made their life better, meaning it will be more peaceful. i dont support the policy as well, but i did not deny the "some benefit" it brought to the country.<br><br>the problem now is the ppl that making tons of $$ from the policy, they do not want changes. Changes mean loses to them, who dont want to take the millions that put right infront of you. that's y malays are against their onw ppl.<br><br>ask ur undergrad frens what differences they can make w/o the policy? would they still come to nus to study w/o the policy.<br><br>chinese has strong will of survival, that's y we are still far better than the malays even w/o the help of the government. because of that, your frens can come to nus to study, don't they?</div>

Almost everyone that I ask sing the same tune. Product of brainwash? Maybe.....and one can say the same about Singaporeans.<br><br>Even LKY's memoirs......they were meant to be a descriptive and pictorial history. However, what's the feel that one gets after reading it? Self glorification? Most likely.<br><br>Historians have always penned history books the <span style="font-style: italic;">way it was meant to be written</span>. That will never change for perpetuity.<br><br>If you were in LKY's shoes, what would you have done?<br><br>A 44 by 32 km land with only less than 2 million people, no natural resources, no armed forces, no organised police force, gansterism rife etc etc.<br><br>Compare that with living under the Malays and having the ruling party jealous of your own PAP. Suffering under the Bumiputera policy where race matters more than merit.
