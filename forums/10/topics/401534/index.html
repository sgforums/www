              <h1>Bilderberg 2010: Plutocracy with palm trees</h1>
              <p id="stand-first" class="stand-first-alone">The shadowy global 
              elite is meeting in Sitges – and Charlie Skelton is there, hoping for a 
              new spirit of CamCleggian openness</p>
              <p class="stand-first-alone"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2010/jun/02/charlie-skelton-bilderberg-spain">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2010/jun/02/charlie-skelton-bilderberg-spain</a></p>
              <p><em>This is the first dispatch from Charlie Skelton's Bilderblog. 
              Read part two <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2010/jun/03/bilderberg-spain-charlie-skelton">here</a>.</em></p>
              <p>Another
               year, another <a title="Wikipedia: Bilderberg Group" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderberg_Group">Bilderberg</a>. The first 
              "participants" (as the delegates are known) won't be arriving until 
              Thursday, but already the <a href="http://www.dolce-sitges-hotel.com/">Hotel Dolce in Sitges</a> is buzzing with anticipation. This 
              Catalan seaside town hasn't hosted an event as large and politically 
              sensitive as <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Bilderberg" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bilderberg">Bilderberg</a> since the 
              legendary 2008 Foam Party at the Mr Gay Sitges awards night.</p>
              <p>Last 
              year, Bilderberg was held in <a title="Charlie Skelton's Bilderberg Files 2009" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/series/charlie-skeltons-bilderberg-files">Vouliagmeni</a>, on the
               coast just south of Athens. The Greek minister of finance attended, the
               minister of foreign affairs, and the governor of the National Bank of 
              Greece. A few months later, Greece was bankrupt and Athens was in 
              flames. So … good luck, Madrid!</p>
              <p>Police are already stretching 
              their red stripy tape around the hotel, and zipping up and around the 
              local roads in their squad cars, sniffing for trouble. I'm really hoping
               there's none to find. The Spanish are promising a beach party and an 
              "awareness camp", with political discussion forums and meditation zones.</p>
              <p>I
               plan to spend at least part of Friday sitting cross-legged in a 
              campsite, sending beams of white light up the hill and into the hotel. 
              Feel my love, Marcus Agius – Chairman of Barclays and senior 
              non-executive director on the BBC's new executive board. Let it surround
               you, Queen Sofia of <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Spain" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/spain">Spain</a>. Don't fight it, 
              president of the World Bank. You can't beat the love.</p>
              <p>It would be 
              nicer if the interface between Bilderberg and the world could be softer –
               if it could turn an open face towards us, rather than the barrel of a 
              machine gun. What I'm hoping is that this year, in the all-new 
              CamCleggian spirit of openness and political transparency, any British 
              elected official who attends the meeting – and I'm talking to you, 
              Kenneth Clarke and George Osborne – will tell us they attended, tell us 
              what they spoke about, and tell us what the next 12 months has in store.
               I don't think that's too much to ask.</p>
              <p>Not that anyone is really 
              asking. I've come along again this year because I had the horrible, 
              nagging thought that no other journalists would.</p>
              <p>Not that I'm a 
              proper journalist. Hardly: consider me an interested citizen of the 
              world come to bear witness to a peculiar, important, and unsettling 
              event.</p>
              <p>For a long and luxurious weekend at the Dolce Sitges, 
              relishing its "new and creative buffet concepts" (a table with food on 
              it), prime ministers will mingle with European royalty, with various EU 
              commissioners, with representatives from Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, AIB, 
              Deutsche Bank, Chase Manhattan and Royal Dutch Shell.</p>
              <p>They'll 
              clink glasses with President Obama's special envoy to Afghanistan and 
              Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke (he is confirmed for this year). And join 
              the Friday night conga line behind the US treasury secretary (Tim 
              Geithner went last year; he goes a lot). We can reasonably expect the 
              head of the Federal Reserve, the president of the World Bank, the 
              secretary general of Nato … they've all attended in the past and many 
              will attend again. So yes, important it is; to think otherwise is 
              painfully naive (see below for the usual "just a big boys' club" 
              comments …)</p>
              <p>The conference hotel may be perched above a golf 
              course, and boast two ping pong tables, but this four-day event isn't 
              about who is better at table tennis, Ken Clarke or David Rockefeller 
              (it's Rockefeller). This is about big business, global financial 
              strategy and the economic future of Europe … if indeed it has one.</p>
              <p>And
               most importantly, this four-day event doesn't start until tomorrow – 
              and continues all the way through the weekend – so if you're a PROPER 
              journalist reading this, or a blogger, or simply a curious citizen of a 
              Europe teetering on the edge, then come along. Please come. I'll buy you
               a Catalan beer. I recommend the Rosita. It's fruity but ballsy – not 
              unlike the winner of Mr Gay Sitges 2008.</p>

              <p>so after so many decades, this group is finally out in the open, eh ?</p>

              <p>also, i wonder when they'll meet here in S'pore so their lackeys ( LKY and son ) can display their work like the influx of foreign talent to diminish national identity !</p>

              <p>People are waking up the presence of the corporatocracy.</p>
              <p>As Zbigniew Brezesinki noted in a CFR speech, "For the first time in all of human history mankind is  politically 
              awakened – that’s a total new reality – it has not been so for most  of 
              human history.”</p>
              <p>He adds all over the world people were aware of what  was happening politically 
              and were “consciously aware of global inequities,  inequalities, lack of
               respect, exploitation.”</p>
              <p>That's probably why this year's Bilderberg is being covered by The Times, The Independent, The Guardian among other mainstream news agencies.</p>
              <p>According to Daniel Estulin, author of <em>The True Story of the BIlderberg Group</em>, the Bilderberg agenda includes:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/articles/20100528_bilderberg_agenda.htm"><strong>1. Will the Euro Survive?<br>   2. Development in Europe: Europe's 
              Exit Strategy...On Hold? <br>   3. Do We Have Institutions to Deal With

              <p>I don't think Singapore will ever hold one. Though I think its a pretty good idea for the global elites considering our police state apparatus.</p>

              <p>you can bet LKY's son will try to host one summit or he already tried but these elites don't want to come to a lowly Asian country to meet up with their Chinese lackeys, LKY and son !</p>
              <p>that jewish guy was supposedly Anwar's ''close'' friend ! he was Anwar's supervisor actually of course and Anwar disappointed these elites after he failed to topple Mahathir during the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 90's.</p>
              <p>if Anwar had succeeded, Petronas would have been bought by BP or Shell long ago !!!</p>
