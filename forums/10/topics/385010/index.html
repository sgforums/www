              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>The YPAP member who posted Alex Tan’s past detention during his National Service on Facebook to taunt and discredit him is a grassroots leader in Eunos under Aljunied GRC.</p>
              <p>The comment was posted in the midst of a heated exchange between Alex and the YPAP members on a YP Community Project – “Skating with students from Pathlight” held on 7 November when volunteers of YP Community brought a group of students from Pathlight School to have a skating experience in East Coast Park.</p>
              <p>Pathlight is a special school offering mainstream academics to students with autism. It is also the first autism-focused school in Singapore that offers a unique blend of mainstream academics and life readiness skills.</p>
              <p><em>(Two years ago, the Workers’ Party’s application for a permit to hold a cycling event at East Coast Park was rejected. Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs Ho Peng Kee told WP’s Sylvia Lim in parliament that such activities “have the potential for public disorder and mischief, and may disrupt community life.”)</em></p>
              <p>Alex charged that the YPAP is using taxpayers’ monies to score political points and claimed that he is doing “National Service” by stopping its “propaganda” on Facebook:</p>
              <p><em>“PAP-organized community work, be it voluntary or remunerated, fronts PAP’s name and therefore is a political tool, yes or no?<span>…<span> </span></span><span>Is the PAP community work funded through taxpayers money”</span></em></p>
              <p><span>He also berated YPAP Chairman Teo Ser Luck for not standing up to scrutiny:<br></span></p>
              <p><em><span>“Teo Ser Luck: do you think your $15000/mth salary puts you in a moral high ground such that you can treat ordinary Singaporeans like your servants? Be a politician and stand up to scrutiny. this is a chance for you to score political points. let’s see if you indeed deserve such obscene salary.”</span></em></p>
              <p><span>Alex was lambasted immediately by YPAP members for being “childish” and “hot-headed”. </span></p>
              <p><span>That’s when a YPAP member by the name of Sear Hock  Rong stepped in and attacked Alex by addressing him as “alex zhixiang tan who was charged with ‘general disobedience”:</span></p>
              <p><span><br></span></p>

              <p><strong>[Source: </strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/youngpap?ref=search&amp;sid=100000165242017.3624453457..1&amp;v=wall#/posted.php?id=19068409773&amp;share_id=205782152008&amp;comments=1#s205782152008"><span style="color: #a91b33;">YPAP Facebook</span></a><strong>]</strong></p>
              <p>According to information posted on his blog, Hock Rong mentioned that he just completed his National Service not too long ago.</p>
              <p>It is not known if he belonged to the same camp as Alex. He joined the Ministry of Finance after his NS before setting up a start-up of his own.</p>
              <p>Though Alex has been relentless in his hard-hitting criticisms of the PAP, he did not attack the character of any YPAP member.</p>
              <p>YPAP Chairman Teo Ser Luck was in the discussion as well, but did not condemn Hock Rong for revealing confidential information about Alex.</p>
              <p>It is unbecoming for a YPAP member and grassroots leader to resort to such petty name-calling in order to destroy the credibility of a critic.</p>
              <p>What is more glaring is Mr Teo’s nonchalant attitude which suggests that he condones such behavior.</p>
              <p>Now that Alex’s past DB record had been picked up by the press from the YPAP Facebook and released to public, Mr Sear Hock Rong should issue an open apology to Alex.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo should explain why he did not put a stop to the taunts and vibes YPAP members have directed at Alex when he was aware of the content of the conversation all along.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the relevant authorities should investigate if the revelation of Alex’s DB record contravenes Section 5 of the Official Secrets Act (CAP 213).</p>
              <p>A soldier’s detention record during National Service is classified information and should not be released to the public unless specifically asked for by the Home Affairs Ministry or Attorney-General Chambers.</p>
              <p>For a political party which prides itself on the rule of law, it is a shame that its Youth Wing has degenerated into such a sorry state.</p>

              <p>One can suppose that the Taiwanese 'hum' is not a 'worker' as it is too Professional as a Manager in the Flesh Trade, and will engineer all the arrangements that are too technical for the foreign workers - that it employ to put on a grand show with itself cast in the central role as the "Attention Seeking Whore" ?</p>
              <p>A street walker is a Pro - maybe they should also change the name to Prostitute Action Party as it has attracted Flesh Traders to be loyal to the Party, and is so useful with its support to the PMET actions for fun, fun, fun and parties at the expense of oridnary citizens.</p>

              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>A netizen using the moniker of “MrBell” posted a question on the Facebook of YPAP member Mr Sear Hock Rong asking him if there is a conflict of interest between his job and his grassroots work at Eunos:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/searface.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="431"></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=77865194499&amp;topic=13034"><span style="color: #a91b33;">http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=77865194499&amp;topic=13034</span></a></p>
              <p>Mr Sear caused an outcry in cyberspace when it was revealed that he taunted an online critic of the PAP Mr Alex Tan with his past detention during National Service.</p>
              <p>Mr Sear posted comments on the YPAP Facebook to Mr Tan beginning with the following address:</p>
              <p><em>“Alex Zhixiang Tan who was charged with ‘general disobedience’”</em></p>
              <p>Mr Sear had defended himself on the ground that it was Mr Tan who started using vulgarities on the YPAP Facebook. Mr Tan has since been banned from posting on it.</p>
              <p>According to “MrBell” who obtained the information from website of Mr Sear’s company, who holds many positions in Eunos grassroots organizations:</p>
              <p>He is the Chairman of Eunos Community Club Youth Executive Committee and Secretary of Eunos Zone ‘2’ Residents’ Committee and Eunos Civil Defence Executive Committee. He is also a member of the Eunos Community Club Management Committee and Eunos PAP Community Foundation Management Committee.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.r2e.com.sg/about/mds.php"><span style="color: #a91b33;"><span>http://www.r2e.com.sg/abou</span>t/mds.php</span></a></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sear is an MD of R2E Concepts:</strong></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.r2e.com.sg/about/mds.php"><span style="color: #a91b33;"><span>http://www.r2e.com.sg/abou</span>t/mds.php</span></a></p>
              <p><strong>R2E Concepts clientele includes: Eunos Citizens’ Consultative Committee, Eunos Zone ‘1′ Residents’ Committee, Eunos Zone ‘3′ Residents’ Committee, Eunos Zone ‘5′ Residents’ Committee</strong></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.r2e.com.sg/clientele.php"><span style="color: #a91b33;"><span>http://www.r2e.com.sg/clie</span>ntele.php</span></a></p>
              <p>“MrBell” asked if there is a “conflict of interests” in this case:</p>
              <p><em>“In what way has Mr Sear, being the grassroot leader of Eunos, sitting in multiple committees in Eunos community, has influence the decisions in the various Eunos RCs and committees to use R2E Concepts’ services whose MD is also Mr Sear?”</em></p>
              <p>Mr Seah had not replied to the question posed on his Facebook yet, however his fellow YPAP member Mr Edgar Khieu had jumped to his defence.</p>
              <p>Mr Khieu said it is not a concern that Mr Sear’s company counts some Eunos grassroots organizations as its clients:</p>
              <p><em>“There are proper protocols involving conflict of interests. In the event of a committee member’s personal interests are involved, the member in question must sit out a vote on the decision. PA also requires a declaration of conflict of interests and also there are audit procedures to ensure there are no irregularities in the process.”</em></p>
              <p>He also appears to insinuate that the question itself may be “defamatory” in nature:</p>
              <p><em>“I believe that the books are open for inspection and they are audited according to PA guidelines. If you feel there is a conflict of interest or are accusing the various committees of wrong doing, kindly make the relevant reports. However if you are hinting without any basis that there is wrongdoing, you might be defaming the people involved in making the decisions.”</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><em>ps.  </em>What do you think ??   </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Is there a conflict of interest here ??    No ??   Definitely not ??   Never ??</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Guess not... b'cos a YPAP / Grassroots leader would never do that...</strong>    </p>

              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>The on-going YPAP v Alex Tan saga took another twist when the latter “apologized” to Mr Sear Hock Rong in his latest blog entry.</p>
              <p>Hock Rong had earlier demanded that Alex and Temasek Review apologized for causing “distress” to him and his family as well as for “putting the PAP in a bad light.”</p>
              <p>In his article, Alex claimed that he had posted an apology on Hock Rong’s blog which was not approved by him.</p>
              <p>He subsequently posted another comment anonymously which was approved:</p>
              <p><em>“Thanks a lot for clarifying. The general public needs to know what truly transpired lest they get fed a one-sided story by temasek review. With this clarification, i believe viewers can safely evaluate and judge the situation.”</em></p>
              <p>For some strange reasons, there were only 6 comments posted on Hock Rong’s article and all of them in support of him including the above “fake” comment by Alex.</p>
              <p>Alex poured scorn on Hock Rong for deleting comments bearing “anti-PAP content”:</p>
              <p><em>“yes the above comment were by me Alex Tan and its meant to carry hock rong’s balls…oops vulgarities again (i better start exocising the NS demon in me) erm i meant “rational” and “polite” as the way YPAP want it. besides, any message bearing anti-PAP content will be deleted, thus I experimented with a comment, and alas! it got hock rong’s approval and managed to see light!”</em></p>
              <p>In Alex’s original comment which was censored by Hock Rong, he explained that he clarified his DB sentence only after Hock Rong revealed it in YPAP Facebook and he did not how he got the confidential information about him:</p>
              <p><em>“Hi Hock Rong,</em></p>
              <p><em>please note that i have clarified my DB sentence only after you mentioned it in YPAP Facebook forum (and how did you get such info i dont want to know), and not before, as your post suggests.<br></em></p>
              <p><em>I am sorry I hurt your feelings with my vulgarities and disrespect…do you want my love plaster to your wounded heart?”</em></p>
              <p>Hock Rong had received much flak for his taunting of Alex using his DB record which is reminiscent of the tactics used by the PAP on its political opponents.</p>
              <p>Alex also asked Hock Rong to clarify if there is a conflict of interest between his job and grassroots work:</p>
              <p><em>“I need some advice from you: you, being Chairman of Eunos Community Club Youth Executive Committee and a Eunos Grassroot “leader”, is also the Managing Director (wah seh! dilector wor!) of a training workshop company, R2E Concepts, had clients from Eunos Citizens’ Consultative Committee, Eunos Zone ‘1′ Residents’ Committee, Eunos Zone ‘3′ Residents’ Committee, Eunos Zone ‘5′ Residents’ Committee PCF Eunos. May I ask if there is a conflict of interest ?”</em></p>
              <p>Hock Rong’s community work at Eunos had come under intense public scrutiny from netizens after it was revealed that some of his company’s clients are grassroots organizations from Eunos. (the information is actually posted on Hock Rong’s company website)</p>
              <p>Forumers have been seeking a clarification from Hock Rong on the YPAP Facebook Network, but have yet to receive a reply from him.</p>
              <p>Alex ended his blog post with a veiled threat that he is “thinking of lodging a complaint of suspicion on “Conflict of Interests” up to CPIB and the Attorney General Chambers.”</p>
              <p>Since the saga first erupted last week when the Sunday Times reported on the spate between YPAP and Alex, the former has maintained a strange silence on the matter so far.</p>
              <p>YPAP Chairman Teo Ser Luck, who was involved in the discussion thread containing Hock Rong’s derogatory remarks about Alex, did not condem his party members from their abusive and rude behavior.</p>
              <p>There were no replies from YPAP to Alex’s challenge of a public debate at Hong Lim Park too.</p>

              <p>What I see:</p>
              <p>The dominant group tries to maintain the illusion of unanimity.... even when some of their members fuck up...</p>
              <p>In singapore where people strives to maintain the 'cohesion' even when the the cost outweighs the benefits...</p>
              <p>Outspokeness is not a valued quality, people are expected to speak loudly in private, not public...</p>
              <p>Blogging is going to change the power of opinion trafficking to those outside dominant group, but not the ones inside, they already had interests in some areas that are conflict with those people outside their group...</p>
              <p>Hope to see the dominant group clean their acts before a major event...this could potentially benefit all parties involved.</p>
