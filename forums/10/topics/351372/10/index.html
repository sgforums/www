              <p>Virgin lion boy, before you comment on other people's relationship, especially a dead person's past relationship.</p>
              <p>I suggest you experience A relationship first.</p>
              <p>Since a dead person cannot clear his name.. I suggest you stop smearing it. Because no body is gonna accept your criticism since the person in question cannot come back and clarify it.</p>

              <p>Dear lionnoisy,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) I didn't blame MINDEF. Don't put words into my mouth.</p>
              <p>2) <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How can Dr Ooi misunderstand that he
              had to serve EXTRa 3 YEARS BOND? MINDEF now say the 3 year run
              concurrently. Do Dr Ooi and his lawyer sis both misunderstand the
              bond contract?Or the contract is not written very
              clearly?</span><span style="color: #003366;"> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>You questioning a lawyer and a doctor ability to read a
              contract?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">H</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">e said his job of long hours,no job
              and no satisfaction</span></strong>, ''extended at will by an
              administration'' <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I dunt think he needed to work for so
              long hours.</span></strong></em> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Can u believe long  hours ,no
              joy and no satisfaction will drive him so
              sad?</span></strong></span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">If he did
              not sign up for another course,then there is no extension, as he
              think.In fact,THERE IS NO EXTENSION,JUST RUNS
              CONCURRENTLY!!</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Seems to me that you've never served NS before.
              You just don't know how the SAF work do you? Go serve it and you'll
              know. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; accusation &amp; assumption
              here.</span></span></p>
              <p>Look this guy is dead. The family is sad. IF THEY SEE YOUR POST,
              THEY'LL BE EVEN MORE SAD AND PISS OFF. THINK OF YOURSELF IN THEIR
              SHOES BEFORE YOU DO YOUR POST!!!!</p>

              <p>1.If i misunderstand u,then i am sorry.</p>
              <p>2.will MINDEF or Ooi family just show the bond contract to the public?</p>
              <p>This is a very simple issue.Is the 3 year runs concurrently or not?</p>
              <p>3.if the 3 years runs concurrently,then it is wrong to accuse</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">''extended at will by an

              <p>4.It is not very nice for Ooi family to exchange messgae with MINDEF thro</p>

              <p>I still not understand why a guy with everythings under the sun,</p>

              <p><br>So lets not take petty umbrage at Lionnoisy, but rather, focus on his message he is attempting to put across.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>---------------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am horrified when others blame or attribute Mindef for the death of Dr. Ooi. Mindef is a public institution, and stands only by our authorisation through the vote.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To challenge a public institution is to challenge our society itself - you, me, our families and friends!</p>
              <p><br>We are responsible for Mindef, as well as the scholarships endowed upon the brightest mind.  Those were our money, a portion of the money from our salaries - from the PM to the roadsweeper who worries if he might get to keep his job tomorrow to feed his children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We all sacrificed such sums in the hope that such sons and daughters of Singapore would help build and lead our society to greater heights. We had ensured that it is done fairly and given out fairly through our administrators.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But there are some who attempts to use it to be stepping stones for their own selfish interests and break bonds, thus wasting those precious dollars which might had help some other more upright citizen.</p>
              <p><br>Only those who genuinely need such funding would be given, with the understanding that they would serve and not bite the hand that feed them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those who regretted taking such loans or feel misused or underused while putting through the test of civil service, most unfortunate for our society, are still allowed to break their bonds, but only with a valid reason so as to ensure our awards be better given out the next time to avoid mistake.</p>
              <p><br>Thus, the question is, had our society done wrong in giving out the money when it was needed by a talent whom we hope can lead us when he matures?</p>
              <p><br>Worse still, are we as a society, to be blamed for his death?</p>
              <p><br><strong>I would remind you all that the late Dr. Ooi chosed to live when he fled to Australia, otherwise his death would had been much earlier.</strong> Thus, are we responsible for that as well?</p>
              <p><br>Should we as a society stop helping talents with funding and in return for a few years of highly paid service to the country, just because of one blacksheep and harm our other more promising and honest citizens, or should we just give blindly with no thoughts of any return, such money whom could have fed our poor or weak?</p>
              <p><br>I am a nobody and don't have an iota of power to make rules. But you as a society can determine the direction to take. I will not weep for the late Dr Ooi but condemn him for he brought shame to the officer corps of the army as well as every soldier who served our country with pride through blood, sweat, toil and sacrifice, as well as his shaming every male in our nation through his defeatist attitude of suicide.</p>
              <p><br>But I will grieve his death, for he is a fellow human being and would had made a positive impact to another human in his life-time if he had rehabilitated. What a waste....</p>
              <p><br>My sincere condolences to his family for losing a son and my fellow citizen. May the truth of his suicide in Australia be made known, no matter how ugly it may be to the family so that another life may not needlessly lost and he can finally rest in peace.</p>

              <p>Sorry, we weren't asking for PERFECT english.</p>
              <p>We were just asking for Functional English.</p>
              <p>To date, lionnoisy's english is atrocious and a lot of parts are not understandable, unless you put in effort to try to dissect his rubbish and find the nutrients.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, like you said, I have no interest to spend time sifting through layers of incomprehensible stuff just to find the comprehensible ones.</p>
              <p>If he cannot even express himself adequately, then he deserves all the spanking and slapping, because writing on a forum is for OTHERS to read, not for HIMSELF to read. If you do not even put in some effort to make yourself understandable, then you don't deserve to be here at all.</p>
              <p>No sympathy from me. All his postings are likened to walls of dirt</p>

              <p>1. Language - this is a forum, and i fully agree with you on 'functional' english. But what is 'functional' english and to what degree is its yardstick?</p>
              <p>No. The common man must be allowed to have a voice, the most basic of freedom whom everyone seem to preach here. The onus for 'functional' english thus lies on the person whom post, as best as he can, and up to any reader to attempt to comprehend or seek clarification.</p>
              <p>Failure or demand for better 'english' would only create fear and stifle more voices that may necessary to be heard. I would encourage better english spoken and written, even for myself, but at the same time, it must not and never be a hindrance for anyone to have his/her voice heard.</p>
              <p>2. Suicide is not an illness. There is no scientific basis for it as you would have led others to believe. Many do suffer from depression but it does not entail a final solution of suicide. To commit suicide is pyschological disorder that can remedy by medicine and counselling. This is VITAL AND CRITICAL, and must be opposed by those such as you that uphold suicide as a medical condition.</p>
              <p>3. I had never claimed intelligence. Any such claims are bestowed upon me by your kindself, but i must refuse such merit, for i am only a simple person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Again, i apologise for posting here which may seem as disrepect to our fellow citizen, the late Dr. Ooi. I only do so in the hope that with my clarifications or anyone who share their personal thoughts, it may somehow avert another tragic incident and thereby his death would not be in vain in the least, for it would have serve a noble and higher purpose if it had open another's mind, even just one.</p>
              <p>Regards.</p>

This is extremely difficult to do, as your arguments lack clarity, cogency and at times are downright contradictory. Nevertheless, I shall persist as this is such a very sensitive subject.</span></span>
              <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 18.0px; font: 15.0px Arial; color: #333333;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Disclaimer: Although my work involves dealing with trauma affected clients in therapeutic settings (therefore the subjects of depression and suicide are ones I am often exposed to). I do concede that most of my formal research work has been centered on PTSD. I do not claim to be an authority on the subject of depression, but I do know more than the average Joe.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 18.0px; font: 15.0px Arial; color: #333333;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">First things first. I am not a moderator, nor am I an arbiter of all things English. If you read my post clearly, nowhere have I suggested any standard by which posts in the forum should abide by.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 18.0px; font: 15.0px Arial; color: #333333;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">I did, however, point out that you made a straw man argument. I'm starting to wonder if you understand the concept, because you have committed the exact same fallacy again. If you are going to construct a rebuttal, it would be helpful if you address the original argument faithfully and not one which you have fabricated.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 18.0px; font: 15.0px Arial; color: #333333;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Secondly, suicide is not an illness. Yet in this case, it is arguably the unfortunate and final symptom of depression. Depression was the illness I referred to; if you have any doubt at all that depression is an illness, consult the DSM IV.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 18.0px; font: 15.0px Arial; color: #333333;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Yes, not all who suffer from depression complete suicide. Not everyone who gets the flu is bed ridden. What is your point?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 18.0px; font: 15.0px Arial; color: #333333;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">It appears that your argument is as follows, "Not every who is depressed completes suicide, therefore anyone who completes suicide is not depressed." This is akin to saying, "Not everyone who has HIV develops AIDS, therefore anyone who developed AIDS did not have HIV." In taking this approach, you have committed the fallacy of accident- you have taken a generalization and made it the rule.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 18.0px; font: 15.0px Arial; color: #333333;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">As to why I would oppose the treatment of depression with "medication and counseling" is beyond me. Have you taken leave of your senses? Why would I be against medication and counseling if I see depression as a medical condition? </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 18.0px; font: 15.0px Arial; color: #333333;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Furthermore, there is no treatment for a completed suicide, medicinal or otherwise. Once suicide is completed (or committed as you prefer), the patient is by definition without life. This is obviously irreversible.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 18.0px; font: 15.0px Arial; color: #333333;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">As a side-note, your duplicity is fascinating, as in one paragraph you can state suicide is not an illness (which is correct, though it's antecedents almost always are), as well as,  a "</span><span style="font: 14.0px Arial; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">disorder that can remedy<em>[sic]</em> by medicine and counselling.<em>[sic]" </em>Sheer lunacy.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 18.0px; font: 15.0px Arial; color: #333333;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">On the third and final point, I might have to concede an error of judgement. I am unsure if you deliberately chose not to understand and formulate a cogent argument or if you lack the intelligence to do so. Six to one half dozen to another; the end result is the same.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 18.0px; font: 15.0px Arial; color: #333333;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">**Depression is a serious and complex issue and carries a high risk of suicide.

              <p><br>Ya, commit suicide is a mental disorder, when i was doing my voluntary work for the Red Cross Society of Singapore, i studied a bit of counselling. Once, there was an Uncle who got so much depression from his ailing health and falling business, that he become a regular in my pub just to drink. Some of my gals who entertained him told me about his problems, so i decided to put my counselling skill into good use. But damn!!! the day i talk and counselled him, the very next day, i heard he committed suicide, Wha lau, is it because of my counselling or cannot withstand my comment and $&amp;^%&amp;^*(&amp;**(..now i dun dare to counsel people anymore.</p>

              <p>Sergeant: ALL Rise!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Judge Angel: Be seated, with all due respect, i shall deliver my verdict in regard to scholarship in Singapore and hope that all can have a better understand on this issue and let us all pray in whatever god or things you believed in for a better tomorrow. Awomen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a perfect world, it's a win-win situation. Scholars are set for stardom, and companies/SAF get the best talent - the belles of the ball.</p>
              <p>At the wooing stage, the organisations present themselves as Prince Charming, willing and able to offer the belles everything they are looking for.</p>
              <p>But once the contract is signed, some organistions treat their scholars like babes, some like aliens.</p>
              <p>They feel they 'own' the scholar. Because they paid for his/her education and living expenses, they feel entitled to ask them to do whatever they want, without considering what he/she wants.</p>
              <p>This may sound extreme, but how different is it from Capt (Dr) Allan Ooi's case?</p>
              <p>Here was a fully-trained medical doctor asked to write newsletters and organise ad hoc events.</p>
              <p>Herein lies the flaw of the contractual analogy. Why are some giving a scholarship contract the same level of sanctity as a marriage agreement?</p>
              <p>There are no children involved. No ugly dividing of friends and assets. So why was Dr Ooi not permitted a 'divorce' except under 'exceptional' circumstances?</p>
              <p>Then again, it would not be fair to 'blame' Mindef for Dr Ooi's death. With all respect to his family, the decision to end his life was his own.</p>
              <p>But his intense unhappiness over how the 'contract' had turned out ought to be given greater consideration - by Mindef and other scholarship managers.</p>
              <p>Of course, 'brides' should take responsibility too.</p>
              <p>For the diva brides: Are your expectations too high, too unrealistic? Are you unwilling to compromise? Are you so fixated on your groom's flaws that you fail to see the good? Are you so upset about letting other Prince Charmings go by that you spend all your time wallowing?</p>
              <p>In short, are you the one who is a bad wife?</p>
              <p>Like a true marriage, scholars and their organisations/Mindef should meet as equals, each bringing something to the table, going in with their eyes open, willing to make compromises, and communicate.</p>
              <p>It's hard work. But the reward is happy, fruitful unions, fulfilling the essence of what scholarship contract is all about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Case Close</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All Rise!</p>
