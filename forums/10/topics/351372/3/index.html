              <p><br>no fact, dunno, no reason, no way to know, nothing...so what are we talking about...in every facts of life u look into it, committing suicide is a crime, a murder of oneself is a crime, ending one life is not the end of the story, what about the poor parents, siblings, relatives and people involved, and especially the parents who brought him to this world just to die before them??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In every religions, every rules and philosophies of life preached, committing suicide is alway a crime, that is why people who committed suicide are sometime handcruffed by their authorities charging him/her as a disruption to the public and killing/murder of oneself.</p>

              <p>fyi, i have seen thosse Mos really cannot make it as they have no experience in doctor. They come out from Uni and come straight to serve bond . some of them, they go fool around with their medics having dinner parties in medical centre. One time i was a DO and had to send one of my men for the medical centre at night. And the MO, ( i dont talk to him much)  there obviously 8-5 stayed on and they were having KFC and MAcdonald party with medics. and the bloody ambulance driver too who is attached to the night medic. This Mos and medics, their vocations are quite liberal , they gang up and try to always chao keng this that, everythime there is a standby or arms cleaning, they always hide inside their precious medical centre give some excuse doing store supply check up or say there is patient in sick bay.</p>
              <p>This particular MO is not really a young guy because of his disruption, he is much older than me, but yet acting like those uni student. these Mos usually come from well to do families who can afford the high cost of medical degree. I believe the medics are poly and A level students who are those high class type of people. they dont want to associate themselves with the rest of the unit men. They normally group among themselves and keep to them and their leader , the MO is normally treat them nicer than the rest of us. And the worst thing is The CSm and RSm watever who is lower educated than them somewhat , usually think their words are god send since they are A level and poly students before. They always take  them for a ride. And one of the shocking things i heard in my NS is from the CO: <strong>"medic and Mo are life savers, they are the only elite force in our unit,...". Even Co never disturb them!!!</strong></p>
              <p>Medics and Mos never had a good name anywhere in SAF. They like to hide under their red cross thing fooling everyone that their vocation is damn shiong need to do IV and they the only ones to shed blood than the rest of us who shed only sweat,</p>
