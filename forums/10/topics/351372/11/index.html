              <p><br>Ya, commit suicide is a mental disorder, when i was doing my voluntary work for the Red Cross Society of Singapore, i studied a bit of counselling. Once, there was an Uncle who got so much depression from his ailing health and falling business, that he become a regular in my pub just to drink. Some of my gals who entertained him told me about his problems, so i decided to put my counselling skill into good use. But damn!!! the day i talk and counselled him, the very next day, i heard he committed suicide, Wha lau, is it because of my counselling or cannot withstand my comment and $&amp;^%&amp;^*(&amp;**(..now i dun dare to counsel people anymore.</p>

              <p>Sergeant: ALL Rise!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Judge Angel: Be seated, with all due respect, i shall deliver my
              verdict in regard to scholarship in Singapore and hope that all can
              have a better understand on this issue and let us all pray in
              whatever god or things you believed in for a better tomorrow.
              Awomen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a perfect world, it's a win-win situation. Scholars are set
              for stardom, and companies/SAF get the best talent - the belles of
              the ball.</p>
              <p>At the wooing stage, the organisations present themselves as
              Prince Charming, willing and able to offer the belles everything
              they are looking for.</p>
              <p>But once the contract is signed, some organistions treat
              their scholars like babes, some like aliens.</p>
              <p>They feel they 'own' the scholar. Because they paid for his/her
              education and living expenses, they feel entitled to ask them
              to do whatever they want, without considering what he/she
              wants.</p>
              <p>This may sound extreme, but how different is it from Capt (Dr)
              Allan Ooi's case?</p>
              <p>Here was a fully-trained medical doctor asked to write
              newsletters and organise ad hoc events.</p>
              <p>Herein lies the flaw of the contractual analogy. Why are
              some giving a scholarship contract the same level of sanctity as a
              marriage agreement?</p>
              <p>There are no children involved. No ugly dividing of friends and
              assets. So why was Dr Ooi not permitted a 'divorce' except under
              'exceptional' circumstances?</p>
              <p>Then again, it would not be fair to 'blame' Mindef for Dr Ooi's
              death. With all respect to his family, the decision to end his life
              was his own.</p>
              <p>But his intense unhappiness over how the 'contract' had turned
              out ought to be given greater consideration - by Mindef and other
              scholarship managers.</p>
              <p>Of course, 'brides' should take responsibility too.</p>
              <p>For the diva brides: Are your expectations too high, too
              unrealistic? Are you unwilling to compromise? Are you so fixated on
              your groom's flaws that you fail to see the good? Are you so upset
              about letting other Prince Charmings go by that you spend all your
              time wallowing?</p>
              <p>In short, are you the one who is a bad wife?</p>
              <p>Like a true marriage, scholars and their organisations/Mindef
              should meet as equals, each bringing something to the table, going
              in with their eyes open, willing to make compromises, and
              communicate.</p>
              <p>It's hard work. But the reward is happy, fruitful unions,
              fulfilling the essence of what scholarship contract is all
              about.</p>
              <p>Case Close</p>
              <p>All Rise!</p>

              <p><br>copy and paste also got skill mah, many uncles here also copy and paste, at least i drink kopi and paste slowly. Hmmm..now i learnt more liao. Last time in school, my all my projects also copy and paste mah, anyway, i can get the right source, not bad liao, so the lecturer give me C for most project, i nearly stabbed him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh, my verdict ar!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Frankly, i think everyone of us should wake up from this issue, in life, there are many contracts and obligations we need to sign and fulfil. We should therefore go in with our bloody eyes open and not close or blind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taking one own life is not pardonable in all aspects, be it religions or state laws, in Singapore if you commit suicide and provern to be, they will still cane the death body and handcuff it just to prove that no one escape justice as deem that u r disrupting the public and murdering yrself and most likely you will go to hell for ending your life, for that, like me and God decide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not in flavor of committing suicide, I dun give a damn about the SAF defence, i dun give damn about the issue of why he committed suicide, that is over, he is in hell, pardon me. What I feel pity and sad is the parents who had brought him and nurture him till this day. Did he therefore took into consideration about his parents before ending his life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, one has the freedom to execute himself, there is no doubt about that, if I choose to die, i can just jump MRT, the usual practice here. When billions are struggling to survive including the virus, ants, germs, bacterias, animals, etc etc whereby some need a host and some a space, but no matter what, it is a nature process that living things have a instinct of survivor and reproducing. And because of these process, we are at wars with each other, with the virus, bacterias, trees, and even the animals for space and a breathe of lifeline.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a mental the doctor mind that no one truly understand, for he dun believe that everything is negotiable, just a matter of money and time, to take his life in a foreign country instead of just ECP or sentosa, I have my doubt that something is very very wrong and weird with his life and lifestyle rather than just SAF scholarship contract issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no guilty parties here to be consider, given an honor as a soldier of the SAF, he choose to end his life rather than dying in the hand of enemy of war, i see no hero but coward, i beg your full pardon on this. That is my stand as a Judge.</p>

                      realise that mental torture can be a terrible thing - even worse

                      people.   <br> <br> When I read his suicide letter, I can't help feeling for him. Word
                      by word, sentence by sentence, the letter smacks of a trapped

              <p>I feel the same as you, 4sg. Many thoughts ran through my mind as I follow on this case.</p>
              <p>If an academically excellent, physically and mentally strong (he went through BMT) army doctor can sucuumb to work dissatisfaction to the extent of committing suicide, I wonder what it will be like for full-time National Service men of the past and present.</p>
              <p>I had experienced bullying when I was in the army. I can fully understand the meaning of being a 'trapped animal' in the army.</p>

              <p>Hi all,so many 'bo liaos' can sign up just 'to say this specially', when they know nothing, so let me do the same when I have the full story.</p>
              <p>He was an underperformer and could not cut it. He had allowed his emotional problems with a girl get in the way. He was <strong>not</strong> considered a scholar in the SAF. Anyone who has served a day with the SAF knows.</p>

So he became one of them underperforming doctors, BUT IN THE SAF. He was not an SAF scholar. Go ask around who the SAF scholars are, they hold the scholarship that is awarded concurrently with the President's Scholarship, they are under the PSC as much as under SAF, they are all in combat arms and after JC, are in what is known as the 'Scholars' Company', the D Coy, and they went to top US and British universities after they disrupt from OCS at 19 and get their commission. They do not commission with the rest of the OCS cohort. They spend some of their school vacations back in the SAF serving. They get FULL SALARY during their studies, plus monthly maintenance allowance- roughly the same amount as the salary. They come back to service at 23, after finishing two degrees, and go to the US Army for about 6 months on course, this is meant to replace the bit of OCS they missed and ONLY SAFOS scholars get to go to US Army by default, SMS can only queue and see if there is a place. They are placed on the MAP programme automatically and get AO salary immediately in service. They are your CDF, COA and JOINT CHIEFS, ACGS, DIVISION COMMANDERS, your ministers, perm secs, GLC chiefs, I am dead sure you don't even know any SAF scholar in person.

              <p>So what if he is a farmer and so what if he is not ? Does it really matter ? Does it make a life more dispensable just because he is not an elite ?</p>
              <p>You think you want to act smart with your SAF ranking knowledge ? Lemme tell you this.. we don't give a fark what his rank was.</p>
              <p>Under-performing is a career suicide.... why keep this kind of people liao bee ? You keep one who is unwilling to serve .. what good can come out of it ?</p>
              <p>Then cham lah.. anyone who sign bond gets paid no matter his performance leh.. sibeh uh hua lah... ( worth it ). What kind of farked up system is that ? Just because a person sign a piece of paper.. is it worth it to havta lost a life over the terms ?</p>
              <p>Since you so knowledgeable.. why not tell us why SAF don't let him go ?????</p>
              <p>He coulda have been better off elsewhere outside SAF. Not that his parents are so poor . They coulda pay off the
                                                                      penalties easy.</p>
              <p>A dead person is dead.. you dig up his past also useless.. you dare go say wat you posted in here to his parent's face ? If you don't you are just a coward, no ? After all.. what you claim to be truth .. his parents should thank you for it what ?</p>
              <p>If he committed suicide AFTER he was discharged from SAF.. then we understand SAF has nothing to do with it.</p>
              <p>When a person sign bonds.. we expect him to sign with good faith. If he cannot serve the nation with a willing heart.. then it is to everyone's best interests to let him go and make him pay penalties.</p>
              <p>But is it the right thing to do.. to hold the piece of paper to his throat and force a person to make it good even if it means having to pay for it with his life?</p>
              <p>If our nation needs to FORCE our men into serving our nation with a piece of bond.. then something is SERIOUSLY wrong with our society.</p>
              <p>You think you are terminator issit ? Where's the human side of you ?</p>

              <p>Short Ninja, let's see, this crimson soldier freak said that he feels suicide solves problems and also, is not irresponsible. Of course suicide "solves problems".. for losers. That is because the loser is dead. You see, dead people cannot have problems. They also cannot have happiness, orgasm, cannot watch movie, drink tea or eat ice cream. Basically cos they are dead. So in this respect and in this 'way', they do have their problems 'solved'. Just that they also can't do anything else.</p>
              <p>Second, we can see with crystallised clarity that crimson soldier has nobody to live for, since if he dropped dead tomorrow, (due to life's lemons and curveballs he can't overcome which other people who do not drop dead can), he would not be irresponsible to anyone. Not irresponsible to mother, father, wife, pet goldfish. In other words, it's not shocking that for some ppl out there, it's 'not irresponsible' to kill oneself, simply because no one cares abt them and they have no one to live for? Its like those sad fucks like Uncle Yap or the retard Chee who have nothing to lose in life. Their lives are cheap.</p>
              <p>As for that dumb broad JoJobeach, I did not bother to read your reply, you can yak yak yak all you want, i knew that reading an ounce of your useless words of no merit and with no value since you have no intelligence of thought, neither did you know Allan Ooi to command any realistic and reliable insight to his loserly former life for your 'opinion' to be of any salt would be a waste of even 0.00001% of my lifeforce, I saved myself the eye sore and my eye balls completely skipped your reply and went down to Short Ninja's post.</p>
              <p>I mean by what how you stupidly believed that SAF regular MOs 'do administrative work' just because they're doctors, you clearly are a (stupid) broad (this means woman btw) who didn't serve a day of NS and no wonder you don't know what is the meaning of SAF scholar. So there's no point in arguing with you, since you know... errm NOTHING?</p>
              <p>You can yak all you want, but the fact is anyone who worked with him in the SAF knew he was a CMI. He wasn't famous and was largely unknown, since he's nothing but an MO. Not some high flier (combat or combat support, SAFOS that sorta profile). More people knew about him only did after he dropped dead. And all I know say he's a loser who simply got weeded out by Darwin's Natural Selection. It was nothing but Natural Selection at work, they all said wryly. Oh well. zzzz boring, <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

              <p>Short Ninja, let's see, this crimson soldier freak said that he feels suicide solves problems and also, is not irresponsible. Of course suicide "solves problems".. for losers. That is because the loser is dead. You see, dead people cannot have problems. They also cannot have happiness, orgasm, cannot watch movie, drink tea or eat ice cream. Basically cos they are dead. So in this respect and in this 'way', they do have their problems 'solved'. Just that they also can't do anything else.</p>
              <p>Second, we can see with crystallised clarity that crimson soldier has nobody to live for, since if he dropped dead tomorrow, (due to life's lemons and curveballs he can't overcome which other people who do not drop dead can), he would not be irresponsible to anyone. Not irresponsible to mother, father, wife, pet goldfish. In other words, it's not shocking that for some ppl out there, it's 'not irresponsible' to kill oneself, simply because no one cares abt them and they have no one to live for? Its like those sad fucks like Uncle Yap or the retard Chee who have nothing to lose in life. Their lives are cheap.</p>
              <p>As for that dumb broad JoJobeach, I did not bother to read your reply, you can yak yak yak all you want, i knew that reading an ounce of your useless words of no merit and with no value since you have no intelligence of thought, neither did you know Allan Ooi to command any realistic and reliable insight to his loserly former life for your 'opinion' to be of any salt would be a waste of even 0.00001% of my lifeforce, I saved myself the eye sore and my eye balls completely skipped your reply and went down to Short Ninja's post.</p>
              <p>I mean by what how you stupidly believed that SAF regular MOs 'do administrative work' just because they're doctors, you clearly are a (stupid) broad (this means woman btw) who didn't serve a day of NS and no wonder you don't know what is the meaning of SAF scholar. So there's no point in arguing with you, since you know... errm NOTHING?</p>
              <p>You can yak all you want, but the fact is anyone who worked with him in the SAF knew he was a CMI. He wasn't famous and was largely unknown, since he's nothing but an MO. Not some high flier (combat or combat support, SAFOS that sorta profile). More people knew about him only did after he dropped dead. And all I know say he's a loser who simply got weeded out by Darwin's Natural Selection. It was nothing but Natural Selection at work, they all said wryly. Oh well. zzzz boring, <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

              <p><br>Maybe he got that spirit and motivation from the begining, but slowly, he got tire of it and perhaps blaming himself from entering the wrong careers, he may be better off as a model or others. All these demoralised him and when you are in such state, usually you dun perform. I would said that his performance must have gone from Very good to moderate, and as far as i know, Doctors classify under moderation is consider poor. You might be right, naturally, he shouldn't be in this line.</p>
