              <p>If anyone wishes to make a judgement, one will need the facts. The facts are:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. He came from a rich family.</p>
              <p>2. He is an intelligent young man and well-liked.</p>
              <p>3. He used public funds for his education, which actually his parents could well afford.</p>
              <p>4. He plays video games, so do many others.</p>
              <p>5. More importantly, he is a doctor, people whom treasures and heals life.</p>
              <p>6. He ran away to Australia, to live and not die.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, what would make a well liked intelligent man commit suicide?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a. Job pressure - impossible, as what can be more pressurized in the SAF as compared to cilivilian doctors?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b. Boredom - It was said he found being a Medical doctor is boring, and could not see himself working there for the next 10 years. Thing is - SAF would long had worked out a career plan for him, he is not a 'famer' but a high flyer - Colonel rank is already planned for him. No one commits suicide out of boredom.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>c.Bond pressure - Bonds can be broken, if not today, then tomorrow. Just return the public funds. He could have easily paid back and with patience and clearing the red tape, he would be out in the streets in no time, under 1 year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>d. Relationship problems - a handsome young and rich boy like him committing suicide over a failed relationship? laughable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>e. Holding damaging info -  A doctor? C'mon, he is not working in sensitive units. Even if he overheard something he should not have, he has no evidences or would be belived anyway. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The answer to his death lays in Australia and could not be because of WoW, bond, boredom or espionage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What had led to his fatal attraction with and in Australia, and the events leading up his death there is the answer his parents must find out, and not bark up the wrong tree with SAF.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i really wonder what could have happened in aussie that led him to take his own life. he had so many things that others dun, he's a doctor (i didnt manage to get into medicine), he's a SAF scholar (i dun think i'm smart enough to be able to get a scholarship of that prestige), he came from a rich family (i don't). but yet, i'm leading a happy life, whereas he had chosen to take his own life. moreover, he's said to be sociable and well-liked. most of such similar bizarre cases normally stems from loners, isnt it?</p></div>

              <p><br>agree..... i think govt should start passing laws to make newspaper liable for their reports...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>on the ground, if citizens want to make a change... its no use. talking in forum only... they have to group together and voice their concern.... then the govt will hear you... citizens has to be systematic and organized in their request in what they want their society to be and to be not and to argue with reason.. only then will the govt listen to you..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>currently... my vote is still with the people acting party... but trust me.. there is always room for improvement in our singapore and this evening newspaper biasness is one of them.. and the inaccuracy of report is very detrimental to the well being of citizens.. especially those who unluckily got themselves onto the newspaper report.</p>

              <p>My condolences to the bereaved family.  It is sad and tragic event.  Mindef need to relook at its training programmes and methods as the deceased person seems to be  unable to tackle his own personal problem and took the easy way out.   Mindef need to have a good human factor system in  its management of limited manpower instead of just buying expensive weapons, aircrafts, submarines, etc.   The human factor is important in dealing in such cases as the late Cpt Alan Ooi. I would like to see Mindef set up an independent body (not military personnel) to manage servicemen's grievances.</p>
