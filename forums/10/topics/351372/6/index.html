              <p>Batistuta 010, no need to regret. At least, you have a job which provides you with steady income.</p>
              <p>Talking about aspirations, it depends what you aspire to be.</p>
              <p>You don't need to fulfill your aspirations through the Force.</p>
              <p>You can work out your way outside work.</p>
              <p>Just treat your current job as a source of income for you to pursue whatever aspirations you might have.</p>
              <p>Keep low profile and don't mix with people with negative thoughts.</p>
              <p>-ve People who keep saying "sian" or talk bad things about other ppl. This are the people who finds solace in pessimism and will be stuck in their state of pessimism.</p>
              <p>You DO NOT want to be in a state of pessismism, right?</p>

              <p>This is not the first time the Ooi family has been hit by scandals. His father is a gynae and was affected by a molest case many years back. He had to shut down his clinic for a few months as a result.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My source is from someone 30 years in the health industry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe what i comment here is a little unrelated depending on how u look at it. SAF should stop these crap, glamour ads on how cool it is to be a soldier. The worst ad depicted how SAF evolved from an elite phalanx chinese unit into a modern revolutionary armed forces.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The feedback i gather and from my own personal experience, dun sign up with the force at all unless u r a military die hard. The long term exposure to weapons, tanks and artillery will only make u feel useless compared to ur peers who are already in the "real world" working as engineers, doctors, lawyers etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If u r an aviation enthusiast, by all means sign up to be a pilot. But other than that, no pls.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dr Allan Ooi seems to be a man of ideals. He signed on probably becos he saw a bright future with SAF. But look what happened? Long hours of admin work and those of us NS men, we know how they work right? A monkey also can dispense the medicine the way they do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fever? Rapidol</p>
              <p>Cold? Rapidol</p>
              <p>Pain in the body? Rapidol</p>
              <p>Cough? Cough mixture</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SAF docs work within very rigid guidelines. Creaitvity is stifled to the max.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SAF should stop those glamour ads cos they mislead.</p>

              <p>He clearly stated in his suicide letter that he was not under the influence of drug or mental depression.<br><br>But he did stressed that he hated his work because the bulk of his duties were administrative in nature, like writing non medical publication report, and he had to spent long hours on them.<br><br>Yes, a demise of a doctor is a lost to the tax paying public but using a well trained doctor for administrative duties is a greater lost or a greater waste in the deployment of talent.</p>

              <p>As far as you and me are concern, we are just assuming things here, there were so many issues happening before he ended his life that we dunno.

              <p>Yup, the family can say what they want. Heck, they can even smuggle the guy to australia, and could theoretically hide him there forever.</p>
              <p>Is it a big surprise that there is no exit clause? Do people sign bond with the intention of breaking it? If really that is the intention, than ask about it loh.</p>
              <p>If the scholar is a poor kid, not a rich kid, the story will be very different.</p>
              <p>Performance not good, the poor kid has to improve himself and solve the problem. He won't even think about breaking the bond because he can't afford to pay back the money AND he is grateful for the chance to pursue his studies with the aid of the scholarship. And run away to Australia is not an option, as he have to live up to the expectations of his parents and give them a good life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think should stop giving scholarship to rich kids. they won't appreciate the scholarship, and will deprive of someone who does.</p>
