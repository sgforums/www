              I have very mixed feelings about this issue.  PSC seems to focus all its resources 100% on attracting talent, but a big zero 0% on retaining talent.  End of the day the company still winds up with mediocre people inside who gets 'A*' at playing petty company politics but have zero talent whatsoever.  
              
              I would suggest having an 'internal audit' department to weed out these kinds of behavior which cost the company hundreds of thousands of dollars every year.  Imagine the cost to train and groom a scholar only to have some rogue middle manager try to kick the fella out of the company.
              
              Some basic things to have might be:
              
              1.  Educate staff on their rights.
              2.  A proper route to feedback complaints.
              3.  Ensure complaints are investigated promptly.
              4.  Even if staff do not complain, take initiative to assess the efficiency of managers, do polls often etc.
              5.  Provide proper counselling service, which is pretty much necessary to help newcomers ease into their job.
              
              One very common example is if the staff turnover rate under a certain manager is very much higher than other managers, then the problem might lie with the manager instead of the workers.

Chinese-language daily Lianhe Zaobao had referenced the alleged letter and its contents, which touched on his dissatisfaction with his job and his bond with the SAF. <br><br>Mindef confirmed in its letter that Capt (Dr) Ooi, who studied medicine at the National University of Singapore under the SAF Local Study Award (Medicine), had last year informed his superior at the Aeromedical Centre that he was “unhappy at work and was considering leaving the SAF”. <br><br>Recipients of the scholarship are required to serve a 12-year bond after their housemanship, which Capt (Dr) Ooi completed in 2006. <br><br>“On 3 Oct 2008, his superior offered him the option of posting to an appointment which he would be interested in,” wrote Mindef spokesman Darius Lim in the letter. <br><br>“Capt (Dr) Ooi agreed to consider this option and to get back to his superior in two weeks’ time. However, he did not do so. He also did not submit any application to leave the SAF.” <br><br>Less than two weeks later, Capt (Dr) Ooi went Awol (absent without official leave). He would have been scheduled to go for his hospital posting at the end of this year. <br><br>In the letter, Mindef stated that SAF officers who take up sponsorship have a responsibility to serve the full period of their bonds as “substantial resources and time have been devoted to training them”. <br><br>“Otherwise, they will leave gaps in key positions in the SAF. Nevertheless, if an officer wishes to leave the service early, he can submit an application through a proper process. Approval to leave the service will be granted only under strong and extenuating circumstances,” wrote Colonel Lim. <br><br>Capt (Dr) Ooi was commissioned in 2006, and served for one and a half years in the Air Force Medical Service. He was sponsored by the SAF in January last year for further specialist training in Aviation Medicine in the United Kingdom. He was posted to the Aeromedical Centre after completing the course last July. <br><br>While it was not said if this would extend his stay in the SAF, a 12-year bond from a Local Study Award comprises six years spent in hospitals to acquire clinical competency in fields needed by the SAF. <br><br>The other six years are spent in command and staff positions with the SAF Medical Corps, performing duties such as the clinical care of SAF servicemen and professional development of military medicine. <br><br>Melbourne police are still investigating the circumstances of Capt (Dr) Ooi’s death. <br>- </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">TODAY</span></span></a><span>/yb</span></p></div>

              Usually, it is survival of the fittest regardless of where you are working in ( SAF, govt companies, MNCs, etc).  Those with power and authority will attempt to prevent talented and promising subordinates from outshining them.
                                
              Sometimes, management are blind to such things as long as the rogue middle manager in question produces results at the expense of his staff.

              Centre that he was “unhappy at work and was considering leaving the
              SAF”. <br> <br> Recipients of the scholarship are required to serve a 12-year bond
              after their housemanship, which Capt (Dr) Ooi completed in 2006. <br> <br> “On 3 Oct 2008, his superior offered him the option of posting to an
              appointment which he would be interested in,” wrote Mindef spokesman
              Darius Lim in the letter. <br> <br> “Capt (Dr) Ooi agreed to consider this option and to get back to his
              superior in two weeks’ time. However, he did not do so. He also did not
              submit any application to leave the SAF.” <br> <br> Less than two weeks later, Capt (Dr) Ooi went Awol (absent without
              official leave). He would have been scheduled to go for his hospital
              posting at the end of this year. <br> <br> In the letter, Mindef stated that SAF officers who take up sponsorship
              have a responsibility to serve the full period of their bonds as
              “substantial resources and time have been devoted to training them”. <br> <br> “Otherwise, they will leave gaps in key positions in the SAF.
              Nevertheless, if an officer wishes to leave the service early, he can
              submit an application through a proper process. Approval to leave the
              service will be granted only under strong and extenuating
              circumstances,” wrote Colonel Lim. <br> <br> Capt (Dr) Ooi was commissioned in 2006, and served for one and a half
              years in the Air Force Medical Service. He was sponsored by the SAF in
              January last year for further specialist training in Aviation Medicine
              in the United Kingdom. He was posted to the Aeromedical Centre after
              completing the course last July. <br> <br> While it was not said if this would extend his stay in the SAF, a
              12-year bond from a Local Study Award comprises six years spent in
              hospitals to acquire clinical competency in fields needed by the SAF. <br> <br> The other six years are spent in command and staff positions with the
              SAF Medical Corps, performing duties such as the clinical care of SAF
              servicemen and professional development of military medicine. <br> <br> Melbourne police are still investigating the circumstances of Capt (Dr) Ooi’s death.

              <p>I just signed up because i wanted to comment on this topic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have a friend who was a regular in the force, also commited suicide few months back. Though his case was an identified depression case and the force did allow him to be released, but that did not prevent him to end his life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who have served the force before will understand how the jail term is like. It is the main cause of all the factors that leads to a person like Mr MO to end his life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just like Mr MO, my fren had other problems too that caused him to com, but all i know is before he signed on, he was never a person to do it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think i have to conclude this by saying what my fren had told me, if you are someone who have aspiration, dont sign on, you will regret like me.</p>
