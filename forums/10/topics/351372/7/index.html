              <p><br>I follow his case, he did mentioned to his superior about his unhappiness. What and how it was handled and the outcomes were puzzles.<br><br>I am very passionate about this case because guys like me who have gone thru' the army knows that such organisation can be a breeding ground for intensive bullying.  <br><br>In my previous work with psychologist and psychiatrist, I come to realise that mental torture can be a terrible thing - even worse than physical torture to some groups of people.   <br><br>When I read his suicide letter, I can't help feeling for him. Word by word, sentence by sentence, the letter smacks of a trapped animal - an animal in the snare of a hunter's trap, no way out. </p>

              <p>Seriously, I question the issue about rich enough to pay off his bond.</p>
              <p>2.5x the original bond amount would make his family pay off a value of up to $400+k. From what I know, you can only pro-rate your bond on the last year, anything before that, you must pay the bond penalty. Half a million is quite a crazy amount, unless you are a super-duper rich family.</p>
              <p>Even if his family wishes to pay for him, as an adult, I doubt he would want to accept that.</p>

              <p>Enough already OK ? That person is already DEAD. You still want to pick his bones.</p>
              <p>Your parents never teach you not to lecture the dead har ?</p>
              <p>What is wrong with you Lionnoisy, you know how to be sensitive to the dead and the living or not ?</p>
              <p>One day your parents will die.. do you want some stranger to come do the same shit to your family ?</p>
