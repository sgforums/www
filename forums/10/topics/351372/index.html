              <p>This site (<a href="http://wayangparty.com/?p=6191">http://wayangparty.com/?p=6191</a>) just published the entry below:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>By Eugene Yeo</strong></p>
              <p>Attached below is an extract of Dr Allan Ooi’s email sent to his
                  family and friends before his death. It was sent to us by his friend:</p>
              <p><strong>To: Wayang Party Editors</strong></p>
              <p><strong>His suicide letter attached. Blackout from media on this. An
                  inquiry into his supervisors and the whole scholarship process in the
                  SAF should be demanded, someone lost a precious son/friend/brother.</strong></p>
              <p>We have elected to reproduce only relevant parts of Dr Allan Ooi’s
                  email. In the last few days, the mainstream media, especially the
                  Chinese dailies have been speculating about the cause of his death.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times suggested it was due to over-indulgence in online
                  war games. Lianhe Wanbao claimed that he committed suicide because he
                  lost heavily in gambling. Shin Ming wrote that it may due to some
                  relationship issues. None of these were true.</p>
              <p>Like the smear campaign directed against David Widjaja, the
                  mainstream media had been concocting all kinds of unsubstantiated tales
                  to distract attention from the authorities which have yet to provide us
                  with a satisfactory explanation.</p>
              <p>The SPH journalists are aware of the content of Dr Allan Ooi’s
                  email. Why didn’t they report the real reason behind his suicide and
                  instead throw all kinds of smoke-bombs to mislead Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>In his email below, Dr Allan Ooi stated explicitly that the main
                  reason why he decided to end his life is due to work-related issues:</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="reflect aligncenter" src="http://www.wayangparty.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/allan01.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="237"></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="reflect aligncenter" src="http://www.wayangparty.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/allan02.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="500"></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="reflect aligncenter" src="http://www.wayangparty.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/allan03.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="500"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SAF needs to answer the following questions arising from Dr Allan Ooi’s email:</p>
              <p>1. What does Dr Allan Ooi mean by his statement <strong>“<span style="color: #ff0000;">How can a bond be unbreakable</span>?”</strong> Did he inform SAF of his intention to break his bond and was told that he was not allowed to do so?</p>
              <p>2. In the next sentence, Dr Allan Ooi wrote “<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">How can it be extended at will by an administration simply by passing a paper?</span>” </strong>SAF
                  needs to explain why Dr Allan Ooi’s bond was extended. Did they consult
                  Dr Allan Ooi and seek his acquiesence before the decision was made?</p>
              <p>3. Dr Allan Ooi was very angry at the unfortunate turn of
                  events - the extending of his bond and not allowing to break it, which
                  drove him into utter despair and hopelessness culminating in his
                  eventual decision to end his own life to get away from it all. What was
                  the nature of his work at SAF? <strong>Who was his immediate superior
                  or supervisor? How could he not detect the problems his subordinate was
                  having at work? Is there any system in place to attend to scholars who
                  have encountered problems in the course of their work?</strong></p>
              <p>4. Dr Allan Ooi made the fateful decision to end his life 5 months
                  after leaving Singapore. SAF claimed it was unable to contact him, but
                  surely the authorities must have emailed him and what were the contents
                  of the email? Dr Allan Ooi left Singapore initially to escape from the
                  pressure-cooker environment he was in. Were there any other factors
                  which cause him to come to this decision in the end?</p>
              <p>How can a promising young doctor who went through 6 rigorous years
                  of medical studies and housemanship be so traumatized by his work that
                  he had to AWOL and leave his family and friends to be alone by himself
                  in a foreign land? How did SAF allow such a preventable tragedy to
                  happen to its soldier?</p>
              <p>We have not heard a single official statement from SAF, not even a
                  word of sympathy or condolence so far. Dr Allan Ooi was a SAF scholar.
                  He worked in SAF as a medical officer upon obtaining his medical degree
                  and most importantly he was driven to suicide due to anguish,
                  despair and stress arising from his work. How can SAF exonerate itself
                  from its pastoral responsibility as if it has nothing to do with him?</p>
              <p>As one of our readers, Agape Xue wrote on our blog:</p>
              <p>“There seems to be a recent trend that many young scholars are
                  taking their lives for granted, and commit suicides at the instance of
                  meeting obstacles in their studies or career pursuit.</p>
              <p>This is a very worrying phenomenon seemingly having its undesirable
                  influence on today’s bright youngsters. This trend must be checked.
                  Young people need to treasure their lives more,, need to know that they
                  not only have a responsibility to themselves, they also need to know
                  that they have a responsibility ensure that their parents live no guilt
                  in raising them.</p>
              <p>What pain is there more destructive to all parents to have to see to the funeral of their children.”</p>
              <p>There is nobody to blame for Dr Allan Ooi’s untimely death and now
                  is certainly not the time for pointing fingers. We need to know what
                  exactly happen so that we will not see a repeat of such tragedies again.</p>
              <p>To recall the cryptic last words of Dr Allan Ooi:</p>
              <p><strong>“To the people within this system, please change it to
                  better benefit yourselves and future generations, instead of creating a
                  self-perpetuating cycle of at best, painful obligation, and at worst,
                  utter despair.”</strong></p>

              <p>The "state controlled" media hasn't exactly been shy about reporting about the dirt in the SAF why would they suddenly do so ? Is it because they got no confirmation on whether the letter is real?</p>

              <p>The sucide email sounds so fake.</p>
              <p>Even if it's true, there is insufficient evidence in the email to determine what "drove" him to his sucide.</p>
              <p>And, whatever written may not be true also. Criminals are known to come out with excuses to try n reduce their charges externally, and internally justifing to themselves what they did or going to do is correct.</p>
