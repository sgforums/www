              <p>Question to all the wise wo/men here---</p>
              <p>1.When did Dr Ooi first feeling  not happy in the job?</p>
              <p>He would be posted to hostital in late 2009.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.Had he felt not happy BEFORE or AFTER he signed another</p>
              <p>bond for UK Aviation Medical course?If before he signed,</p>
              <p>then why did he sign?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3.Why did Cpt Ooi resign right after Aviation Medicine
              course?</p>
              <p>HaS Anything happen during this period?</p>
              <p>If he found the job was not happy,why did he go for the course
              and knew that</p>
              <p>should he break the bond,he had to pay for the course fee and
              penalty?</p>
              <p>Did he tel his parents (i assume they are the 2 sureties )</p>
              <p>that he was not happy in his job?</p>
              <p>If he did,then I dunt think his parents would agree he went for
              the course?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4.How can Dr Ooi misunderstand that he had to serve EXTRa 3
              YEARS BOND?</p>
              <p>MINDEF now say the 3 year run concurrently.</p>
              <p>Do Dr Ooi and his lawyer sis both misunderstand the bond
              contract?</p>
              <p>Or the contract is not written very clearly?</p>

              <p>lets state some few agreed facts before we go on--</p>
              <p>Jan 2000----Allan Ooi joined SAF and went to NUS medical school under Schloarship</p>
              <p>Apr 2006---completed housemanship</p>
              <p>Aug 2006--commissioned as RSAF Medical officer.Spent one and half year in RSAF medical center.</p>
              <p>Jan 2008---started 6 months Aviation medicine course in UK.</p>
              <p>He and his family think it need another 3 years bond period.In fact,the 3 year bond runs concurrently with the first bond.</p>
              <p><span> Jul
              2008, ---completed UK course.<em>''he was posted to the Aeromedical Centre to perform clinical and
              staff work. CPT (Dr) Ooi was scheduled to go for his hospital posting

              <p><em><span>''on 23 Jul 2008, while serving at the
              Aeromedical Centre, he informed his superior that he was unhappy at

              superior in two weeks' time. However, he did not do so. He also did not

              <p>except the offer of alternative job which some of u may not buy the story from MINDEF,i think u guys generally agree the above are facts.</p>
              <p>@@@@@@@@@@</p>
              <p>Questions--</p>
              <p>1.Why did he extend the unhappy job by another 3 year,to 7 years?</p>
              <p>When he left for UK course in  Jan 2008,he had alreday served for good</p>
              <p>8 years.If he was unhappy with the job,why did he sign up another</p>
              <p>bond to <strong><em>''EXTEND''</em></strong>(this is as his family and he thought  )ANOTHER</p>
              <p>3 years bond?This is an increase of 75% remaining period!!</p>
              <p>Now we know the 3 year bond for UK course runs concurrently with</p>
              <p>the original bond.</p>
              <p>2.Did his family know he was unhappy with the job when they signed for</p>
              <p>surety for UK course?</p>
              <p>3.Have any family members found him unhappy?There are other</p>
              <p>3 docs in his family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">4.<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong>''retailated</strong></em></span> by in

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Did he mean hurt others by tangible or intangible means?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5.He said his job of long hours,no job and no satisfaction,</p>
              <p>''extended at will by an administration''</p>
              <p>I dunt think he needed to work for so long hours.</p>
              <p>Can u believe long  hours ,no joy and no satisfaction will drive him</p>
              <p>so sad?</p>
              <p>If he did not sign up for another course,then there is no extension,</p>
              <p>as he think.In fact,THERE IS NO EXTENSION,JUST RUNS CONCURRENTLY!!</p>

              <p>@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
              <p>except the offer of alternative job which some of u may not buy
              the story from MINDEF,i think u guys generally agree the above are
              facts.</p>
              <p>@@@@@@@@@@</p>
              <p>Questions--</p>
              <p>1.Why did he extend the unhappy job by another 3 year,to 7
              years?</p>
              <p>When he left for UK course in  Jan 2008,he had alreday
              served for good</p>
              <p>8 years.If he was unhappy with the job,why did he sign up
              another</p>
              <p>bond to <strong><em>''EXTEND''</em></strong>(this is as his
              family and he thought  )ANOTHER</p>
              <p>3 years bond?This is an increase of 75% remaining period!!</p>
              <p>Now we know the 3 year bond for UK course runs concurrently
              with</p>
              <p>the original bond.</p>
              <p>2.Did his family know he was unhappy with the job when they
              signed for</p>
              <p>surety for UK course?</p>
              <p>3.Have any family members found him unhappy?There are other</p>
              <p>3 docs in his family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">4.<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong>''retailated</strong></em></span> by
              in turn hurting many people</em></strong> after''</span></em></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Did he mean hurt others by
              tangible or intangible means?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5.He said his job of long hours,no job and no satisfaction,</p>
              <p>''extended at will by an administration''</p>
              <p>I dunt think he needed to work for so long hours.</p>
              <p>Can u believe long  hours ,no joy and no satisfaction will
              drive him</p>
              <p>so sad?</p>
              <p>If he did not sign up for another course,then there is no
              extension,</p>
              <p>as he think.In fact,THERE IS NO EXTENSION,JUST RUNS
              CONCURRENTLY!!</p>

                      2007, a Singapore Tatler writer approached CaptOoi. Said the friend:
                      ‘The magazine was looking to feature good-looking and stylish
                      personalities and he fit the bill. He was quite ‘on’ about it as he had
                      an outgoing personality. ‘During the interview, he was asked about his
                      relationships and he said that an ex-girlfriend had let him down, but
                      didn’t elaborate.’ She described Capt Ooi as a metrosexual who dressed
                      in Paul Smith and designer clothes. She said: ‘He certainly looked like
                      a rich boy, a stylish guy. He drove a Mazda MX5 then and liked Calvin
                      Klein clothes.’//</span></span></em></p>

              <p>Dear lionnoisy,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) I didn't blame MINDEF. Don't put words into my mouth.</p>
              <p>2) <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How can Dr Ooi misunderstand that he had to serve EXTRa 3
                                          YEARS BOND? MINDEF now say the 3 year run concurrently. Do Dr Ooi and his lawyer sis both misunderstand the bond
                                          contract?Or the contract is not written very clearly?</span><span style="color: #003366;">  </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>You questioning a lawyer and a doctor ability to read a contract?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">H</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">e said his job of long hours,no job and no satisfaction</span></strong>, ''extended at will by an administration'' <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I dunt think he needed to work for so long hours.</span></strong></em> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Can u believe long  hours ,no joy and no satisfaction will
                                          drive him so sad?</span></strong> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">If he did not sign up for another course,then there is no
                                          extension, as he think.In fact,THERE IS NO EXTENSION,JUST RUNS
                                          CONCURRENTLY!! </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Seems to me that you've never served NS before. You just don't know how the SAF work do you? Go serve it and you'll know. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; accusation &amp; assumption here. </span></span></p>
              <p>Look this guy is dead. The family is sad. IF THEY SEE YOUR POST, THEY'LL BE EVEN MORE SAD AND PISS OFF. THINK OF YOURSELF IN THEIR SHOES BEFORE YOU DO YOUR POST!!!!</p>
