              <p>why dun u define poor in singapore? some people are rich, but poor in mentality, poor in understanding life, and poorer in self discipline and motivation. As long as the country provide you jobs, shelter, foods, medical and even a computer to get on. You call that poor??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You go to any government clinic or hospital with a sickness and they dun admit you and cure you just because of you got no money, then you come and talk to me. The PAP motto is to cure first, talk later.</p>

              <p><br>After leaving Malaysia, Dr Goh Keng Swee was the only one in the PAP Government with some military background, being a corporal in the Singapore Volunteer Corp.</p>
              <p>He invited <a rel="nofollow" href="http://militarynuts.com/ar/t85.htm">The first ‘Mexicans’ of SAF </a>to help in the creation of the SAF in 1966.</p>
              <p>He certainly did not visit every SAF Camp, only 1SIR, 20SA, 40SAR and SAFTI - as these units formed the backbone of the SAF then.</p>
              <p>The airforce also got his close attention and was then operating the Hawker Hunters at Tengah and Changi Air Bases, and with the Bloodhound I surface to air missiles located at Seletar.</p>
              <p>In 1966, the navy was only a two wooden boat affair with the ancient County Class LST and all located at Pulau Brani - which is now merged to Singapore island when it was an island between Singapore main island and Pulau Blankang Mati (now known as Sentosa).</p>
              <p>The 30 SCE located at Pulau Blankang Mati surely did not get to see him as the early batches struggled with the building of the ancient Bailey Bridges - experiencing quite a few casualties.</p>
