              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">BACK
                  in the third quarter of 2007, when global financial markets were still
                  b uoyant and the investor mood fairly exuberant, the Government of
                  Singapore Inves tment Corporation (GIC) pulled back: it sold some of
                  its equity holdings. As a r esult, when the opportunities to invest in
                  UBS and Citigroup arose, it had the cash in hand to do so - some US$16
                  billion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Speaking to Singapore reporters
                  in Davos o n Saturday, after a few days of discussions on sovereign
                  wealth funds at the Wor ld Economic Forum, GIC deputy chairman and
                  executive director Tony Tan said one question tha t came up during
                  interviews he had with foreign journalists here was - where did GIC get
                  the resources for its recent huge investments?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Explaining how an d why GIC had the means, he said: 'We have been very
                  worried about the financial markets for m any months. We thought that
                  the level of leverage in the US market was excessive , risk was not
                  being priced correctly, asset prices were going up at a rate whic h was
                  not sustainable. These worries have been growing over the years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> 'And in the second quarter last year, looking at all of these
                  developments, we took a fundam ental review of the GIC portfolio. Until
                  then, GIC had been fully invested in th e markets - they had served us
                  very well, giving us very good returns, but we felt that unde r these
                  circumstances, we should move towards a more conservative portfolio and
                  convert part of our equity holdings into cash, which is something we
                  have not do ne for many years.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> GIC did
                  just that in Q3 2007, 'in order to raise cash, because we were very
                  worried about the outlook for the economies and the financial markets '.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> At that point, the markets were still doing well - 'there had been mod
                  est falls, but they were still strong', Dr Tan noted. Of course,
                  'everything fell apart' by Q4. And by then, GIC had raised a
                  'considerable amount of liquid resources', he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> 'So when the invitation from UBS and Citigroup came to invest in t heir
                  equity, we had the resources which were available without having to
                  take emergency measu res to raise cash. A lot of money, but it's well
                  within the risk limits which we had prescribed for the finance sector.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> As it turned out, GIC's reading  of the market direction proved right, Dr Tan said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> 'What surprised us was the fact that when the markets actually turned,
                  they did so at such a speed and the contagion effect was so broad that
                  they affected even the best known and well regarded ba nks like UBS,
                  Citigroup and Morgan Stanley.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> But he
                  reiterated that the recent 'conflue nce of events' that hit banks in
                  the US and Europe, and which led to GIC's UBS a nd Citigroup ventures -
                  the US sub-prime crisis, recession fears, credit tighten ing - were
                  highly unusual circumstances.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> 'We will not
                  do this on a regular basis,' D r Tan said. While GIC is 'always on the
                  lookout for opportunities', he hopes 'th ere won't be another
                  confluence of events which will give us this opportunity ag ain', he
                  added. 'I think if there is another such confluence of events which
                  will make su ch opportunities available, then the world is in real
                  trouble.'</span></p>
