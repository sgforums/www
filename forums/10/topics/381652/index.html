              <p>Friday, 13 November 2009 09:23</p>
              <p><em>Chee Soon Juan</em><br> <br> <img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/poverty/NationalDay.JPG" border="1" alt="" width="300" height="220" align="left">I chanced upon a man dressed in office attire yesterday morning lying on a park bench. Covering his face was<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><em>The New Paper's</em> Wednesday edition with the headline in big, black letters: I WANT TO JUMP OFF WITH MY KIDS.<br> <br> It was a report on how Ng Chee Kiang set ablaze his flat, burnt his two
              children alive and then jumped to his death. He was a bankrupt and was
              being hounded by loan sharks, and was in the process of a divorce.</p>
              <p>When he lifted the newspaper from his face and saw me, Lim (as he
              later introduced himself) smiled one of those half-smiles. We chatted.
              He had just lost his job because his company found a cheaper
              replacement, someone from mainland China. <br> <br> Lim was contemplating his next move, not knowing where he could find
              another job as he was in his forties. "I don't think anyone will hire
              me if I tell them how old I am," he said blandly. <br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sadly, Lim's experience is not all that uncommon. As retrenchment and
              competition for jobs hot up, more and more people have no where to go -
              literally and economically. Singaporeans continue to face a difficult
              existence with wages plummeting but with the cost of living escalating. </strong></span></span><br> <br> This is the message that I have tried to get across in the 10
              interviews that I have done, and about to do, with US radio stations
              these past few days. <br> <br> All these years workers in this country have been getting the short end
              of the stick. They have no labour unions to speak up for them. The only
              existing one that has all the power has as its leader a cabinet
              minister who, incredibly, exhorts workers to work even "cheaper, better
              and faster". <br> <br> <img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/poverty/poor03.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="200" height="267" align="right">Included
              among them are elderly Singaporeans who have little option but to
              continue to work menial jobs like cleaning tables just to survive.
              There is no financial support for them in a system designed by a bunch
              of ministers who pay themselves $10,000/day. <br> <br> In the meantime, the Government floods Singapore with guest workers in
              the millions. More than one in three people you see on the streets in
              Singapore are not Singaporeans. <br> <br> While my colleagues and I have never objected to foreign talent – and
              let me be on record that we are in need of such talent – the truth is
              that the Foreign Talent Policy has much to do with foreign but little
              with talent.<br> <br> The reality is that the Government exploits cheap foreign labour to
              suppress local wages. Foreign workers are allowed into Singapore to
              keep wages low. Wages are kept low so that we can remain attractive to
              MNCs. <br> <br> The result is that Singaporeans bear the brunt of depressed wages.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br><br> Do the employers, many of them multinationals from America, care? With
              generous tax breaks and almost 100 percent repatriation of their
              profits, these MNCs adore Singapore as a business venue. And you have a
              Government that outlaws industrial action and crushes workers' rights
              to boot. It's corporate heaven on earth.</strong></span></span> <br> <br> The PAP even consults these foreign companies on how much Sinaporeans'
              should be paid. The National Wages Council has on its 2007/2008 board
              representatives from the US (
              	&lt;!--{12580788934570}--Douglas Miller), Japanese (Shigeru Kobayashi), and German (Alexander Melchers)  chambers of commerce.     <br> <br>The PAP's Foreign Talent Policy benefits not the workers, both
              local and foreign, but the rich and powerful, both local and foreign. <br> <br> When I get on the air in the US, it is the guy whom I met at the park
              and the old lady at the hawker centre who cleans tables whom I have
              have in mind.
              <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>This exploitation of Singaporeans must stop and Americans must know
              that their corporations cannot continue to operate in Singapore and
              ignore their corporate social responsibilities. </strong></span></span><br> <br> I call on the US not to remain silent when the Singapore Government, on behalf of American MNCs, exploits Singaporean workers.
              <br> <br> The ultimate tragedy, Martin Luther King Jr once reminded us, is not
              the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that
              by the good people.</p>

              <p>Agent3070. Your outlaw did well. He talk, just as anyone talks. We arent a commie state. Free enterprise flourishes. No different from any democratic country whom faces similar problems.</p>
              <p>The deeper issues lies with capitalists. Our govt had long heard such calls and are enacting legislation to compel these capitalists employ those 40s and above, long even before the outlaw bothered to pick up a pen one fine morning to determine who he can use to further his own goals.</p>
              <p>And besides talking, what had he done?</p>
              <p>Had he called on american capitalists, the way he called on his so call 'human rights' organisations to force the issue? Nope. He remained discreetly silent on it.</p>
              <p>Instead, he told americans on his supposed 'persecution', to save his own ugly ass. And burn every singapore citizen, young and old with trade embargoes, for his persecution by OUR ELECTED officials - the govt and its employees,  all for his own personal self ambitions!</p>
              <p>Let see how you whitewash the facts, 3070 and how he actually helped the ,,,,awwww...pitiful 40s year old he met on the street, that our society had long ago determined to help thru legislation, funds for upgrading, and other employment opportunities in other growth sectors.</p>

              <p>In every society, there will be poor and the unfortunate ones, you cannot deny that, at time, being poor is just because some one is richer than you, so you call yourself poor. Fair or not?</p>
              <p>With no doubt, Singapore poors and those unfortunate ones are much better than most of the countries around the world, and bear in mind, some old folks are just passing time and doing some exercising work, I met some of them, their childrens are rich or middle class singaporeans. So old folks are just plain stubborn, like my ah ma, still go and wash plates for our nearby kopitiam, and leave our house chores to the my maid. Haiz!!! too workholic liao. So dun be fool by some of them. At time, my dad will drove his merc to pick his mother up to the awe of the kopitiam peoples. But of course, some are geninuely in a sad state, mostly are those who need not treasure their life or family during their young times, but that is over, they can have a lots of avenue to seek for help, just a matter of able reach out to them. But they are stubborn. Kind of like they want to earn a living out of their own hands. All in all, Singapore had less such cases than countries having a full of them, the whole city can be in this state, so our so called poors or the unfortunate ones are more fortunate to be here.</p>

              <p>Only in the imbecelic mind of a X-rated Fraud will come someone to be "outlawlery" for its stand to be "civil obedience" - should we not fault the imbecile for its ability to even appreciate that everyone has a right to talk, as it will claim for itself ? </p>
              <p>Is Singapore not a 'commie' state' - when even China does not need to pretend to be one by disenfranchising the Chinese Government from running any businesses, and State operated businesses are shut-down or hived off to PRIVATE CAPITAL ?</p>
              <p>In Singapore's case, only the pseudo-intellect of a X-rated Fraud cannot discern that the PAP Government will be fraudulent to pretend to "PRIVATISE" the state operated Statutory Boards into Private Corporations that are capitalised by PUBLIC MONEY, and to offer the same Essential Infrastructural Services previously managed and were operated directly by the Government - as the commie countries such as the old Soviet Union, the old China, the present day Vietnam, North Korea, and Cuba still are.</p>
              <p>What problems have the X-rated Fraud suddenly alluding to when none were mentioned to qualify its position preferrred in a reckless statement made without any slightest degree at being circumspect ?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>The deeper issues lies with capitalists.

              <p>The bankrupt mind of the pseudo-intellect acting as a X-rated Fraud that pretend not to represent the PAP - can only be an imbecile to attempt to make anyone believe that there are any legislations in the pipeline - and proposed by the PAP - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">to compel these capitalists employ those 40s and above</span></em>".</p>
              <p>It has long been the position of the PAP Government to allow the pseudo-practise of a "free market to control wages" - when the open door policy remain open for foreign talent (whether skilled or unskilled) to freely enter the Singapore labor market with NO minnimum wage to protect Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>Obviously it is easy for a brainless pseudo-intellect to spout its verbiage without needing to think if LKY and his PAP will allow Dr Chee to do anything - even as LKY will have his PAP to muzzle Dr Chee and prevent him from talking any more truth on the real events occurring in Singapore. </p>

              <p>Is the X-rated Imbecile not attempting to wear the Size-XXX shoes that LKY will soon be leaving behind - by pretending that it can follow the same plagiarized political ideas, statements, and methods preferred by LKY ?</p>

              <p>With all the exposed hollow thoughts of a bankrupt mind in the X-rated Fraud, it is clear that its expertise lie in the plagiarizing skills and imitative acts to simply repeat all the Lies often enough and hope that the Lies will become Truth.</p>

              <p>This was the position of Dr Chee in his book "Dare to Change' published in 1992.</p>
              <p>This position was further validated by a 2008 NUS report - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.eaber.org/intranet/documents/42/784/SCAPE_Shandre%20_2006.pdf">‘Lessons from “Benchmark” Countries: Korea &amp; Ireland’ – Shandre M Thangavelu and Hu Guangzhou, Singapore Centre for Applied and Policy Economics, Department of Economics, National University of Singapore (*4) </a>- in which the report had stated that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the open economies of Ireland and Korea, and reported their success in tackling the skills shortage problems faced by their economies and have adjusted their industrial structures to produce higher value-added activities</span></em>." </p>
              <p>It is dismal prospect for the X-rated Fraud to learn to be more honest,or even to be more respectful to its self-deluded wider audience by giving them the respect that they are more intelligent than its own pseudo-intellect.</p>

              <p>Fact : Foreign workers are brought into Singapore to lower costs as the wages are considered too low for local residents as they encountered high cost of living.</p>
              <p>Government : Impose quota ie ratio of a number of local workers per foreign workers. Local workers' wages are higher than foreign workers's wages. However, these wages are still not sufficient to meet the high cost of living and hence the raising of GST from 5% to 7% to finance the implementation of the workfare scheme.</p>
              <p>Businessmen : Need cheap foreign workers to keep costs low to survive and to function smoothly.</p>
              <p>(A question is How come the businessmen cannot raise its productivity to keep costs low instead of depending on cheap foreign workers to keep cost low ? Is it due to high rental or land cost ?)</p>

              <p><em>Chee Soon Juan</em><br> <br> <img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/poverty/NationalDay.JPG" alt="" width="300" height="220">I chanced upon a man dressed in
              office attire yesterday morning lying on a park bench. Covering his
              face was <em>The New Paper's</em> Wednesday edition with the
              headline in big, black letters: I WANT TO JUMP OFF WITH MY
              KIDS.<br> <br> It was a report on how Ng Chee Kiang set ablaze his flat, burnt his
              two children alive and then jumped to his death. He was a bankrupt
              and was being hounded by loan sharks, and was in the process of a
              divorce.</p>
              <p>When he lifted the newspaper from his face and saw me, Lim (as
              he later introduced himself) smiled one of those half-smiles. We
              chatted. He had just lost his job because his company found a
              cheaper replacement, someone from mainland China.<br> <br> Lim was contemplating his next move, not knowing where he could
              find another job as he was in his forties. "I don't think anyone
              will hire me if I tell them how old I am," he said blandly.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sadly, Lim's experience is
              not all that uncommon. As retrenchment and competition for jobs hot
              up, more and more people have no where to go - literally and
              economically. Singaporeans continue to face a difficult existence
              with wages plummeting but with the cost of living
              escalating.</strong></span></span><br> <br> This is the message that I have tried to get across in the 10
              interviews that I have done, and about to do, with US radio
              stations these past few days. <br> <br> All these years workers in this country have been getting the short
              end of the stick. They have no labour unions to speak up for them.
              The only existing one that has all the power has as its leader a
              cabinet minister who, incredibly, exhorts workers to work even
              "cheaper, better and faster".<br> <br> <img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/poverty/poor03.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="267">Included among them are elderly
              Singaporeans who have little option but to continue to work menial
              jobs like cleaning tables just to survive. There is no financial
              support for them in a system designed by a bunch of ministers who
              pay themselves $10,000/day.<br> <br> In the meantime, the Government floods Singapore with guest workers
              in the millions. More than one in three people you see on the
              streets in Singapore are not Singaporeans.<br> <br> While my colleagues and I have never objected to foreign talent –
              and let me be on record that we are in need of such talent – the
              truth is that the Foreign Talent Policy has much to do with foreign
              but little with talent.<br> <br> The reality is that the Government exploits cheap foreign labour to
              suppress local wages. Foreign workers are allowed into Singapore to
              keep wages low. Wages are kept low so that we can remain attractive
              to MNCs.<br> <br> The result is that Singaporeans bear the brunt of depressed
              wages.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> <br> Do the employers, many of them multinationals from America, care?
              With generous tax breaks and almost 100 percent repatriation of
              their profits, these MNCs adore Singapore as a business venue. And
              you have a Government that outlaws industrial action and crushes
              workers' rights to boot. It's corporate heaven on
              earth.</strong></span></span><br> <br> The PAP even consults these foreign companies on how much
              Sinaporeans' should be paid. The National Wages Council has on its
              2007/2008 board representatives from the US (
              &lt;!--{12580788934570}--Douglas Miller), Japanese (Shigeru
              Kobayashi), and German (Alexander Melchers) chambers of commerce.
                 <br> <br> The PAP's Foreign Talent Policy benefits not the workers, both
              local and foreign, but the rich and powerful, both local and
              foreign.<br> <br> When I get on the air in the US, it is the guy whom I met at the
              park and the old lady at the hawker centre who cleans tables whom I
              have have in mind.<br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> This exploitation of Singaporeans must stop and Americans must know
              that their corporations cannot continue to operate in Singapore and
              ignore their corporate social
              responsibilities.</strong></span></span><br> <br> I call on the US not to remain silent when the Singapore
              Government, on behalf of American MNCs, exploits Singaporean
              workers.<br> <br> The ultimate tragedy, Martin Luther King Jr once reminded us, is
              not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence
              over that by the good people.</p>

              <p><br>no, those unable, should go for upgrading, training and improve themselves to suit the society, the problem with many peoples here is that they dun except the truth or the reality of what we are facing, most are still hallucinating about their past life and way of living, therefore, they are incapable to adapting to changes, especialy in this ever fast changing world. In the end they blame the society and the peoples who rule it, but never blame themselves or simply reflect on their situation.</p>
