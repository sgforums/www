              <p>This may be the way of the US and other countries, but not here in my homeland. We are more educated, civilised and egalitarian than them, because our society will make all attempts to ensure no one gets left behind.</p>
              <p>Not just by voice, whine or complains, but by actions and funds. This is Singapore.</p>

              <p><br>The X-rated Running Dog never fail to perform its circus act to protect its Masters.</p>
              <p>Can anyone count on the opinion of the X-rated Fraud who dare state that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">we are more educated, civilised and egalitarian than</span></em>" the US.</p>
              <p>With the pathetic performance in language skills and thinking abilities that depend on countless plagiarized ideas - so much for its X-rated opinion concerning education that did not seem to have moulded its abilities since kindergarten level.</p>
              <p>Is Singapore "civilised" by the standard of measure of MM LKY - who will have any Singaporean locked up under the ISA on his say-so, without any avenues to challenge the Detention Orders, nor any judicial oversight to ensure justice is available to those incarcerated ?</p>
              <p>"Egalitarian" ?</p>
              <p>One need to question if the dumb-ASS personified in the X-rated "Running Dog" has any clue to even understand the meaning of the word "Egalitarian" - considering its stupendous skills at being a buffoon in language skills ?</p>
              <p> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/egalitarian">"E-gal-i-tar'i-an" - Affirming, promoting, or characterized by belief in equal political, economic, social, and civil rights for all people.’ (*1) </a></p>
              <p>Is there any equal political, economic, social and civil rights for all Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Are Singaporeans entitled to any civil rights that are more then the US  have ?</p>
              <p>It is obvious that the X-rated Running Dog is not interested with the Truth, and is only interested in being a mouthpiece for the PAP.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the X-rated Running Dog is hallucinating itself as some Minister by mere association with the plagiarized ideas and words that it spouts with such vile vanity.</p>

They live together with a son who suffers from cerebral palsy.<br><br>Due to their ill-health, they have to stop working and depend on public assistance from the government to support themselves. Mr Yan had a stroke three months ago and is still recuperating.<br><br>According to her nephew, Madam Chen was worried her medical bills may impose a financial burden on the family.<br><br>Mr Yan has been sent to a old folks’ home and his son to a nursing home. There is nobody else in the family to take care of them.<br><br>As recipients of public assistance, both Mr Yan and Madam Chen would have received a monthly allowance of $330 from the state and they do not have to pay for their medical bills at government clinics and hospitals.<br><br>Singapore’s aging population is a perennial headache for the government which is exacerbated by the declining birth rates.<br><br>The government has encouraged Singaporeans to work as long as they can. Retirement age is extended to 62 and eventually to 67.<br><br>Immigration is also encouraged as a means to increasing the flagging population. 36 per cent of Singapore’s population now consists of foreigners.<br><br>There are few social welfare benefits for Singapore citizens. CPF, which is originally intended as a pension fund is now deemed inadequate to meet the retirement needs of Singaporeans.<br><br>Singapore’s cash-rich government has so far refrained from expanding the social safety net out of fear that it will lead to a crutch mentality among the populace.<br><br>“Welfare” is a taboo in Singapore officialdom which has consistently exhorted Singaporeans to be self-reliant.<br><br>Singapore’s income gap has widened considerably in the last decade. It is the second highest among the thirty most developed economies after Hong Kong whose result was skewed by the extraordinarily large numbers of billionaires.<br><br>MM Lee Kuan Yew brushed aside the widening income gap as an issue of concern during a recent forum saying that it “does not matter” for long as the government continues to create jobs for Singaporeans.<br><br>News source: Lianhe Wanbao, 19 November 2009</div></div>
