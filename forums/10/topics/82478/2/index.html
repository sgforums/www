If u think degree is useless, y r so many poly students apply to uni? And how u work actually depends on each individual character, not our cert. We MUST know where we stand in the society in order to survive. Know what u r good at,  and make a living out of ur gift. Try applying to Multi International Company , those giant cooperation like Shell, Exxon...u can feel it man!! Even a degree with poor honest wouldnt stand a chance!! Go to thier webpage and read wat they wan...u will feel it. That's y we must know where is our aim in life, and what company is suitable and not suitable. If u have good honest degree/ master /phd...no doubt company like BMW, MERC, FERARRI would hire u man to design thier car...like one of my fren. I ADMIT that he is indeed brilliant and capable. Earning about USD S$200K a year in german is wat he deserve. Am i going to compare wif him or am i going to try my best...u think for urself. And pls do not state such statment like a diploma holder have better creativity and synergy than degree...again..it is not the CERT, but personality.

Dun take the cream of the lot to compare.</div></blockquote>First of all...which sentence did i compare a diploma wif a master or phd  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> . I just made a statement, not a topic; that a degree is a foundation for education to proceed to master and phd. Pls read properly. I didnt go further to elaborate on it AND the MAIN, MAIN reason i wrote that reply was the statement u made; ur scorning statement that companies prefer to hire diploma than degree holders becoz they are more creative and synergy   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> . Previously i did mention something about my fren, u said i shdnt compare wif the cream. But do u know what u wrote in ur statment?? Ur statement seems to over shadow the "cream" too!! Diploma are more creative and synergy than degree holders!!, so does that mean the whole flock of them? some? mostly? majority? , therefore i assume wat u said was the whole flock of them, am i right? The grass is green. By this statement, all grass shd be green right?? Know my topic sentence, and read my conlcusion. I just want u to realize what u state was extremely wrong. In which statement i mention that CERT is the only important yard stick? i didnt, i still state that personality of an individual must be taken into account. Therefore for your statment " n the end, its still your capability/character/interest/accumulated skills and knowledge that will let you advance in your career" i agree wif u. I just disagree of wat u said previously. Dun misunderstood me. Spore economic had led us both, diploma and degree holders into a difficult situation... survival skill is therefore much needed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi to everyone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  This topic seems to be sliding into an argument between degree and diploma holders. Actually the point is the comanies should stick to the appropriate people for appropriate jobs. If they continue doing things this way, it is very dangerous to EVERYONE in the long run. I am sure all of you have heard about degree and even mba owners sweeping floors and being salesmen and bookshop assistant in other countries rite? I sincerely do not wish to see that in Singapore. It would also mean that all the GCE O,A and ITE level people would then have to be reduced to virtual beggars. This is a very dangerous trend to continue with.<br>I also notice that someone stated that degree people shows that they are capable if they can get the paper. I agree with that to a certain extent. But the person has distorted my main point again. The statement I was trying to make is that not everyone can afford (like some people I used to know who drives parents car and have BIG amounts of pocket moeny) to study full time for a degree. I am sure that there are also many other in my position who was or is considering dropping the idea of getting a degree first to get a job to SURVIVE first.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>simple......u can roughly know the person thru interview or u can give him a simple characteristic test. </blockquote>How useful is an interview ? People will be complaining tat it is unfair to people who tend to be nervous easily isn't it ? Can 10 minutes of interview know about a person well or know if he act well ? How accurate is a characteristic test ? Most people just give the answer which they expect to mean well rather than an honest reply.<br><br><blockquote>deakin university is no doubt a very good uni....but its just easier to get thru compare to our local uni.....u can imagine a below average student getting a degree</blockquote>Actually I never heard of deakin university....<br><br>In singapore, unless u r really needy of money, u should be able to get into university if your grades make it. There are a lot of loans and bursaries around to tide the people through the time for studying.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lets look at it in this perspective by placing a few assumptions.<br><br>1. all employers are looking for fresh grads (ite/poly/uni)<br>2.based on proportion, there are lesser people going to uni poly ite, in that order<br>3.Employers are maximising their hiring costs<br>4. when interviewing the prospective employee, there is nothing to diffeentiate except for their education qualification<br><br>So why wouldnt you hire a uni grad?<br><br>There are always exceptions and we should never use exceptions because they happen on a low frequency<br><br>MBAs cannot be compared to PHds<br>even so yo have to see what MBAs or PHDs is it confeered by and what discipline is it in.<br>To generalised, as long as you have money to pay for  an MBA<br>because alot of them its dependent on working knowledge, and management/BA cannot be theorized nor quantified so its very grey plus offering MBA is good Money (The Economist 2004 June)<br><br>On another note.<br><br>Although i have yet to work, i do know that good work experience(or rather a good CV) helps, and doing well for the interview helps too.<br><br></div>

Why ? Studying is like a race in a competitive environment as well. U need determination, preserverance, discipline, intellect, good command of language, dedication, positive attitute to achieve well. Diploma also meant studying well... but it is just tat getting a degree seems harder to achieve thus it speaks out more.<br><br>The paper do not say u will be better than a diploma holder but at least it shows u have some minimum competence in handling normal tasks. Tat is why in the beginning where no one has work experience, the paper u have is the only thing tat shows your competency in handling the job... When u have work experience then it will be a better guage of your ability. </div></blockquote>If you realise for a fact that both demand &amp; supply is a paper chase oriented environment, you should think global my friend.

Their fresh grad is the type that want  one to two years experience. Too bad I had to do the stupid NS. Or else I would gotten out two and a half years ealier when the economy was still slightly better. Those guys that time can get $1500. Me not only $1300 and if no experience sorry bye bye.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For the sake of discussion and the title, there is no point in bringing working exp into the picture. It is supposed to be a discussion on Diploma versus Degree, both of which should have the same amount of working exp. IMO working exp will be more important than the educational qualification one had, which is suppose to be for another discussion thread instead.</div>
