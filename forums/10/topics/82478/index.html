Even b4 u apply for a company...example ExxonMobil or other giant companies...they will try to tell u like ...no first class no need apply. Getting a degree is already not easy....wat more a first class. So...a poor degree wouldnt help u much and u will be most likely to work in company where they pay u a diploma $$ for a degree.

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that you must not really need a degree to succeed in life. But the economy is bad and Singapore is a very corporate society. A degree can at least give you a better chance of clinching a job. The rest of course is up to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> The thing is if your education is low, most people might not even want to give you a chance. Besides, at the risk of sounding a bit bias there is one fact I want to state. People in higher position usually have better chances of grabbing opportunities. When I was in the army, due to the fact that I had a clerical job instead of being a mechanic in my camp and also due to the fact that I got a 3SG rank, any "opportunities" were always shared among us people at the "top" first. Since I have got hight ambition, I don't want to start low if possible. Its not that I am not realistic but its just that people in low positions takes a long time to climb up an miss a lot of chances along the way <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

All these while i am not nailing down on diploma, but stating that companies prefer diploma holders because they can work better than degree holders is a dirrect assault. y dun say better than PHD ...better right? come on, degree provides a solid foundation for education, if u can, proceed to master and phd. If u think degree is useless, y r so many poly students apply to uni? And how u work actually depends on each individual character, not our cert. We MUST know where we stand in the society in order to survive. Know what u r good at,  and make a living out of ur gift. Try applying to Multi International Company , those giant cooperation like Shell, Exxon...u can feel it man!! Even a degree with poor honest wouldnt stand a chance!! Go to thier webpage and read wat they wan...u will feel it. That's y we must know where is our aim in life, and what company is suitable and not suitable. If u have good honest degree/ master /phd...no doubt company like BMW, MERC, FERARRI would hire u man to design thier car...like one of my fren. I ADMIT that he is indeed brilliant and capable. Earning about USD S$200K a year in german is wat he deserve. Am i going to compare wif him or am i going to try my best...u think for urself. And pls do not state such statment like a diploma holder have better creativity and synergy than degree...again..it is not the CERT, but personality. Come on...how many degree holders are working for NASA....dun they have any creative and innovative mind??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm...my advise would be...juz find a job 1st related to your field...then work for 1-2yrs n then try to search for job opportunities..in the current situation..work experiences weighs much more than certifications..it's the truth as i've seen real life examples..right now people are fighting for jobs..even most fresh deg. holders are setting down their expected salary...some even asking 1.3-1.4k...so..dip. holders out there will be geting a hard time...so...if got job..juz work 1st..get the experiences 1st then say..</div>

It might also be due to the fact that the HR do not understand the requirements of the job, thinking that degree holders are suited for the job. It is a great mismatch.<br>I have work in helpdesk b4. Even 'O' levels with experience or IT certs (e.g. MCSE, CCNA, etc) can be employed to do this simple job.</div>

All these while i am not nailing down on diploma, but stating that companies prefer diploma holders because they can work better than degree holders is a dirrect assault. y dun say better than PHD ...better right? come on, degree provides a solid foundation for education, if u can, proceed to master and phd. If u think degree is useless, y r so many poly students apply to uni? And how u work actually depends on each individual character, not our cert. We MUST know where we stand in the society in order to survive. Know what u r good at,  and make a living out of ur gift. Try applying to Multi International Company , those giant cooperation like Shell, Exxon...u can feel it man!! Even a degree with poor honest wouldnt stand a chance!! Go to thier webpage and read wat they wan...u will feel it. That's y we must know where is our aim in life, and what company is suitable and not suitable. If u have good honest degree/ master /phd...no doubt company like BMW, MERC, FERARRI would hire u man to design thier car...like one of my fren. I ADMIT that he is indeed brilliant and capable. Earning about USD S$200K a year in german is wat he deserve. Am i going to compare wif him or am i going to try my best...u think for urself. And pls do not state such statment like a diploma holder have better creativity and synergy than degree...again..it is not the CERT, but personality. Come on...how many degree holders are working for NASA....dun they have any creative and innovative mind?? </div></blockquote>I wouldn't refuse your opinion if u insist on your great paper qualification. Take note that what I have stated refers to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">job that can be done by both dip/deg holders</span>. Pls dun take master/PHD into it. That is another topic and it doesn't make sense to compare with them.<br><br>Furthering your education is another topic. Its good to further your education to gain in-depth knowledge to help you understand better in your career. I dun believe in furthering your education for the sake of getting the 'paper' only. In the end, its still your capability/character/interest/accumulated skills and knowledge that will let you advance in your career.<br><br>Given a choice as a non-degree holders, I wouldn't establish my career in a MNC. MNC judge your capability by your paper qualification. This is having great impact not only to the dip/ITE, even some degree holders felt demoralised/stagnant by it.<br><br>You mentioned about a fren of yours who is "indeed brilliant and capable" and is "Earning about USD S$200K a year in german". Great, I am glad that there are talented Singaporean. Note that my opinion is based on general/average ppl and jobs that can be done by both dip/deg holders. Dun take the cream of the lot to compare.</div>
