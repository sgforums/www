              <p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">It's still a struggle for jobless over-40s</span></strong><br> <br>By Radha Basu <br><br> <br>MADAM T. Nalaayini, 58, has been looking for a job since early this year. <br><br>The unmarried woman is the primary caregiver to her mother, Madam N. Karrapiah,<br>87,
              who has dementia. When the laboratory where Madam Nalaayani worked as
              an office attendant for the past 23 years decided to outsource some of
              its functions, she lost her job. She received a retrenchment payout,
              but she claims that after paying off debts, the money will not last her
              even a year. She used to earn around $1,200 a month.<br><br>She approached the Central Singapore Community Development Council (CDC) for<br>help
              to find a job, but there has been no luck yet. 'I think it's my age,'
              she lamented, sitting in her two-room rental flat at Lengkok Bahru as
              her mother looked on vacantly. 'I need to take care of my mother. What
              if I can't find a job again?' <br><br>Her fears are not entirely unfounded. The Government has been working hard to<br>ensure that older workers find jobs, <strong>but at least one set of statistics made<br>available to The Straits Times shows that the efforts have yet to bear fruit.</strong> <br><br>Despite a booming economy and nearly full employment, the CDCs were able to find<br>work for only one in four of the 36,000 older job-seekers who sought their help<br>last
              year. The figures pertain to workers aged 40 and above. This despite
              the fact that all five CDCs have extensive job-matching efforts in
              place, offering career guidance and training to workers and persuading
              companies to employ them. <strong>The obstacles lie with workers and employers, say CDC officers. </strong><br><br>The workers are often limited by circumstances, said Ms Charlotte George, who<br>manages employment assistance operations at Central Singapore CDC. The district<br>is home to more than 150,000 people aged 60 and above. <strong>Many
              of the vacancies that companies ply CDCs with are for jobs that are
              'physically demanding' and unsuitable for older people, she said. These
              include jobs in warehouses, as crane operators or welders, or in
              dispatch and courier positions.</strong> 'The general perception is
              that the younger you are, the more fit you are and the older folk lose
              out, even though some may be very fit,' said Ms George. <br><br>Many are hampered by family and caregiving responsibilities that prevent them<br>from doing shift work. Madam Nalaayini, for instance, said she could not work<br>the
              night shift as it would distress her mother. 'She is used to not seeing
              me during the day, but I worry that if I leave her alone at night, she
              may not be able to take it.'</p>
              <p>To make matters worse, many workers are rigid in their likes and dislikes, said<br>Mr Vengadesh Naidu, Ms George's counterpart in South East CDC. Some, for instance, want only jobs they are familiar with. <strong>Recently,
              a retrenched 45-yearold who had been a welder all his life asked for
              help. The CDC offered him jobs as a delivery assistant or gardener but
              he was not interested. 'He kept wanting a welder's job, saying that is
              the only thing he knew how to do,' said Mr Naidu.</strong> <br><br>Not all workers are as choosy. Mr Tay Teck Choon, 71, has been scouring job<br>advertisements since September last year when the art gallery where he worked<br>folded. He used to earn about $1,200 per month then, a far cry from the $15,000 he<br>earned
              before retiring as training manager of a multinational company in 1994.
              He knows the Government is encouraging older people to remain employed
              and he,<br>for one, is game. 'I have sent out more than 30 applications and have yet to go<br>for
              a single interview.' Even those seeking to fill training-related posts,
              for which he has experience, have turned him down. 'I've been told
              quite a few times that I am just too old,' said Mr Tay. <br><br>Yet, CDC staff such as Mr Naidu say that when approached by their officers, most<br>companies
              say they are open to hiring older workers. 'However, their recruitment
              patterns often show otherwise,' said Mr Naidu. One of his clients,
              part-time dishwasher Pushpa Rani, 54, was sent to an interview for the
              job of a laundry assistant with an old folk's home. 'I went for the
              interview and was told later that the position had already been
              filled,' said Ms Pushpa. But the CDC found the firm continuing to
              advertise for the post after that, said Mr Naidu. <br><br>Employers such as Mr Gary Haris of KH Security Agency say it is not ageism that<br>keeps
              older workers out in the cold. Market dynamics often play a deciding
              role. Close to 80 per cent of the company's estimated 170 security
              officers are aged 50 and above, thanks to a deliberate decision to hire
              older workers. But the policy has come with a price. 'We often find
              ourselves losing contracts to competitors who have a younger
              workforce,' said Mr Haris. 'We may want older workers, but our clients
              don't.'</p>
              <p>There are other pitfalls. Last year, after asking for the 'age profile' of its<br>workers,
              the company's insurer hiked insurance costs from $10,000 to $70,000.
              Although the company found another insurer who offered a lower price,
              Mr Haris<br>said it was virtually impossible to insure an employee
              older than 70. 'Exorbitant premiums may thus dissuade companies from
              hiring older workers.' <br><br><strong>Labour MP Halimah Yacob acknowledges that finding jobs for older workers is an<br>'uphill task', given Singapore's steady supply of cheap foreign labour. </strong>Companies
              that hire substantial numbers of older local workers should be 'more
              favourably considered' when they apply for work permits for foreign
              workers, said Madam Halimah, who is deputy secretary-general of the
              National Trades Union Congress. 'That could nudge employers to hire
              more older workers,' she said.</p>

              <p><br>... well, it appears to me that the problem here is that there are too much financial liabilities in hiring older workers; for example, Medical Costs, &amp; as indicated by TS - Insurance...</p>
              <p>... it basically boils down to the system; high living costs, high medical costs, ZERO welfare, &amp; a "government" that's centered ONLY on MONEY...</p>

              <p>The foreign workers are cheaper mah. If singaporeans dont want
              the job or cannot tahan, the foreigners will take it. Somemore they
              are cheaper and young mah. After they earn enuff, they will go back
              to their hometown and enjoy their old age.</p>

              <p>For Hong Kong, there are many entrepreneurs; thus they still have jobs after 40 becuz it is their own job.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, the largest employer, the government, have many employees over 40 I believe. Of course, only if you start working in the government from young do you get such benefits.</p>
              <p>I believe that those jobless over 40s are in danger not from foreign talents, but more from the younger generation, who also usually cost cheaper than them.</p>

              <p>are you then justifying for the status quo?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so like this no need to improve liao?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw, other countries are true big countries with many many cities.</p>
              <p>sg only has 1 city. 1 city country.</p>
              <p>overseas, they have ample opportunities to explore if they cannot compete in office arena , they can become farmers or invest in farming or other things.  in  sg, only office jobs available which is available to the entire world FT who is anyone with some qualification, even normal qualification.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sg is different. we employ the world record talents not for nothing.</p>
              <p>would it be right or wrong to expect or demand the best?</p>
              <p>if you look at things from a CEO performance perspective, you can then get enlightened. in the private sector, high pay = high performance is the least of all expectations. nothing less. u r  in private sector right or no rights?</p>
