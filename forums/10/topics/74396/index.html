            <div class='col-md body'>No, I do not feel tat Taiwan should be part of china. I have studied history and still maintain my stand tat Taiwan is as independent as it should be. In the past, China is ruled by KMT. However in the later stage, there spread the idea of communism and there r fighting between people who choose capitalist and communism. In the end, because of Japan in WW2, KMT lose the war in china and had to retreat to taiwan where communism take control. However it never attack Taiwan because of US.<br><br>Now, why does Taiwan have to be part of china ? China never succeed in controlling taiwan neither do KMT surrender. Why should it be part of china ? In the past when china is weak, more people feel tat taiwan is taiwan while china is china. It is only recently when china becomes strong people r starting to say taiwan is part of china. Wat is the basis for this ?</div>

It is not about 1661 etc, we should be talking about during 1949. If we r talking about 1661, Mongolian might as well talk Kublai Khan times where mongolia conquered most of asia europe.<br><br>The important things to note is when a nation retreat over to taiwan while its contesters rule over a big piece of its land. Does tat means the island have to go to them ? Like in British example, when British retreats to North Ireland, does its attacker after controlling its mainland have the right over North Ireland too ?<br><br></div>
