            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>China did control Taiwan. </blockquote>Yes, but China is controlling Taiwan isn't it ? KMT is from China. Instead of refering to history saying how Taiwan was being controlled by China, which is already out of point. KMT is ruling party for China which control Taiwan. There is a rebellion and KMT had lose so had to retreat to Taiwan. So why does Taiwan need to bow to PRC, which is formed after the rebellion ?<br><br><blockquote>Because of war, a few countries occupied Taiwan for a long period, including Holland and Japan. Mr Tay fight and took back Taiwan and then Japan occupied but return Taiwan to China after world world</blockquote>This is out. I am asking for dispute between China politics itself, not to other countries.<br><br><blockquote>One important point is when we say Taiwan is part of China we also means China is part of Taiwan. In conclusion:<br><br>China and Taiwan is ONE COUNTRY. </blockquote>To me both countries r different. Taiwan is Taiwan while China is China. Unless u give me a good reason why they r supposed to be the same ?<br><br><blockquote>-China will manage the "China"<br>- Taiwan will manage Taiwan in addition Taiwan will manage the "China"</blockquote>Yah right... China manage China and Taiwan. So Taiwan politcal parties should all be disbanded and had to follow the orders of China. In the end, it is just China control China, Taiwan just follow orders.<br><br><blockquote>Both "Gov" should sit down and talk how to manage the country rather then create problem and make Asia so unstable</blockquote>Both should really sit down and settle their differences. However if both party do not want to compromise, then tat is no point of discussion<br><br><blockquote>So there is Totally no change in politics or civilian life. Taiwan will have its President and Army. Politician will do whatever system they like and People will do whatever thing they like as usual.<br><br>Many other advantages:<br>- Legal politics position admited by UN<br>- Able to manage "China<br>- Forever peaceful<br>- Others (eg economy) </blockquote>Why don't China just forget about the whole thing and everything just remains the same. Both party can practise their own politics, both sides manage itself, "forever peaceful" is not achievable in both situations and economy can still be the same.<br><br>Controlled by China means its the end of the country politics. I do not think HK is free to recruit its own army or have a chance to be a democratic nation now.<br><br><blockquote>Please make the debate simple. Taiwan history are not easy to understand already, so no point bring in Vietname and Mongolia. You may create another two more topics for these countries if you want.</blockquote>My stand is always the same. On wat basis does china says Taiwan is under it ?</div>

The economic lost in China will be greater.<br><br>Furthermore, China isn't military up to task against Taiwan military hardware, especially air force. China is feverishly building many naval hardware like hundreds of mini subs which are already in place.<br><br>Taiwan maintains sleepers group throughout major cities in China which can be activated in time of crisis to retaliate.<br><br>So from now till 2010, everyone can sit tight that no major crisis will happen between both.<br><br>I support Taiwn independence like the many younger Taiwanese born citizen today.<br><br></div>
