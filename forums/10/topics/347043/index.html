              <p> </p>
              <p>A Singapore lawmaker has a 	simple explanation for the city-state's lack of babies: procreation, 	he says, is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"not our forte." </strong></span><br><br>Loo
              Choon Yong also suggested that because more free time did not
              necessarily result in more babies, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>people should work on Saturday</strong></span>s, a
              report in <em>The Straits Times</em> said. 	<br><br> "We should accept that as a people, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>our procreation talent is not our
              forte</strong></span> -- nothing to crow about," Loo told the legislature on Wednesday.
              <br><br>The
              government announced last year that it would double spending on
              incentives to address a baby shortage that threatens the city-state's
              future. <br><br>Previous efforts by authorities in the fast-paced,
              money-oriented and high-stress society failed to significantly raise
              the number of children. <br><br>Government figures say Singapore had a
              fertility rate of 1.29 babies per woman in 2007, well below the 2.1
              children per woman needed for the population to replace itself
              naturally. <br><br>While failing to boost the population, working only
              five days a week may also have affected Singapore's work ethic, the
              report quoted Loo as saying. <br><br>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I urge the government to take
              steps to determine whether our productivity and competitiveness have
              been affected by the five-day week</strong></span>," he said. <br><br>Most companies in Singapore work five 	days a week. 	<br><br>"I
              have nothing against our young Singaporeans having fun and partying.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But I hope they will work as hard as they play,</strong></span>" the MP was quoted as
              saying. <br><br>Loo was back in parliament on Thursday 	and could not be reached. 	<br><br><a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jtGqK1Osk7n1O0SuVINIyR0c74tA"><em>http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jtGqK1Osk7n1O0SuVINIyR0c74tA</em></a></p>

              <td style="overflow: hidden;">Dr. Loo Choon Yong is actually a <em>nominated</em> MP and according to Forbes one of the 40 richest persons in S'pore (net
                  worth $110m). For someone so prominent he certainly demonstrates some
                  rather eccentric logic.<br> <br> More free time means less babies? Huh? Surely it is the complete
                  reverse. If people are having to work their fingers to the bone 6 days
                  a week and return home worn out, the very last thing on their minds
                  would be procreation. They'd simply be too tired to even bloody think
                  about hanky-panky in the bedroom. All work and no play makes...no
                  babies, Dr. Loo.<br> <br> As for his comment about "procreation not being our forte" - that's
                  risible. Calling reproduction a 'forte' suggests that it's a métier, a
                  skill that has to be taught like playing the piano or even French
                  cooking! You'd have thought a doctor ought to know that birds do it,
                  bees do it, even educated fleas do it, no problem-o.<br> <br> He could have addressed the issue head-on by asking how is it Singapore
                  never had a problem with replacing its population for 150 years until
                  the 60's? Was it pure coincidence that LKY's brain-dead stop-at-two and
                  graduate-mothers dogma kicked in right about then? Did that stop the
                  nation's fecundity dead in its tracks? That would have been a more
                  fertile area to pontificate on.<br> <br> So do we have a nominated MP or a nominated buffoon in Parliament?</td>

              <p>On average, a baby was born in Singapore every

              <p>The high birth rates stretched facilities
                                                    at the Kandang Kerbau Hospital (KKH). Lee Suk
                                                    Ting, a Nursing Officer, recounted the situation
                                                    in 1962: “<em>The number of deliveries
                                                    in KKH was at its peak, with an average of
                                                    100
                                                    deliveries per day. The number of beds available
                                                    then fell far short of demand, and many deliveries
                                                    were conducted with patients lying on the floor
                                                    on mackintoshes or on transport trolleys. Patients
                                                    in the early stages of labour sat for long
                                                    hours on hard wooden benches waiting for a

              <p>Nearly all mothers with normal deliveries
                                                    had to be discharged within 24 hours. In 1966,
                                                    the number of deliveries reached a record high
                                                    of 39,835 and won KKH a place in the Guinness

                                                    Minister for Health, Mr. Yong Nyuk Lin, tabled
                                                    a White Paper in Parliament in September 1965
                                                    and outlined a <strong>Five-year Mass Family
                                                    Planning programme</strong> aimed at reducing the birth rate
                                                    from 29.9 per thousand in 1965 to 20 per thousand

                                                    Board (FPPB) was subsequently established in
                                                    January 1966 to implement the recommendations
                                                    in the White Paper. <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333; font-size: xx-small;"><sup>5</sup></span><br> <br> The national policy then was to provide family
                                                      planning facilities to all eligible married
                                                      women in the 15-44 years age group, numbering
                                                      about 180,000. A sum of S$1 million was allocated
                                                      for the entire programme.<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333; font-size: xx-small;"><sup>6 </sup></span>Although
                                                      the programme met with initial resistance,
                                                      more than 156,000
                                                      eventually received family planning services.<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333; font-size: xx-small;"><sup>7</sup></span> By the end of its third cycle in 1980, fertility
                                                      rate had declined to 1.7 children per female
                                                      population.<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333; font-size: xx-small;"><sup>8</sup></span> By then, however, Singapore’s
                                                economic growth and aging population meant that
                                                      it needed to maintain a sizeable workforce.
                                                      The family planning programme was revised
                                                      in 1986 to encourage Singaporeans to have
                                                more children.</p>

Only elites like them are working their ass off, coming up with stupid and senseless ideas that will probably backfire in a few years time. Then coming up with more stupid ideas to cover up their earlier mistakes, which again in a few years time, will backfire. Its like a cycle you see.

              <p>Ditto. It's amazing how some people rant and rant and rant against the regime but are fucking lazy to do anything about it like running for parliament, migrating etc.</p>
              <p>Another bunch of idiots paying lip-service. So akin to the regime they are ranting against.</p>
              <p>Lip-service gets us nowhere. It's sad that both the regime and the opposition are using it.</p>

              <p><strong>Do you know …</strong></p>
              <p>On average, a baby was born in Singapore every 11 minutes in 1965!<span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><sup>1</sup></span></p>
              <p>The high birth rates stretched facilities at the Kandang Kerbau Hospital (KKH). Lee Suk Ting, a Nursing Officer, recounted the situation in 1962: “<em>The number of deliveries in KKH was at its peak, with an average of 100 deliveries per day. The number of beds available then fell far short of demand, and many deliveries were conducted with patients lying on the floor on mackintoshes or on transport trolleys. Patients in the early stages of labour sat for long hours on hard wooden benches waiting for a bed.</em>” <span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
              <p>Nearly all mothers with normal deliveries had to be discharged within 24 hours. In 1966, the number of deliveries reached a record high of 39,835 and won KKH a place in the Guinness Book of Records for the largest number of births in a single maternity facility – a record it held for 10 years.<span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><sup>3</sup></span></p>
              <p>Recognising the potential impact of the high birth rates on the Republic's limited resources, Minister for Health, Mr. Yong Nyuk Lin, tabled a White Paper in Parliament in September 1965 and outlined a <strong>Five-year Mass Family Planning programme</strong> aimed at reducing the birth rate from 29.9 per thousand in 1965 to 20 per thousand in 1970.<span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><sup>4</sup></span> The Family Planning and Population Board (FPPB) was subsequently established in January 1966 to implement the recommendations in the White Paper. <span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><sup>5</sup></span><br><br>The national policy then was to provide family planning facilities to all eligible married women in the 15-44 years age group, numbering about 180,000. A sum of S$1 million was allocated for the entire programme.<span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><sup>6</sup></span> Although the programme met with initial resistance, more than 156,000 eventually received family planning services.<span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><sup>7</sup></span> By the end of its third cycle in 1980, fertility rate had declined to 1.7 children per female population.<span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><sup>8</sup></span> By then, however, Singapore’s economic growth and aging population meant that it needed to maintain a sizeable workforce. The family planning programme was revised in 1986 to encourage Singaporeans to have more children.</p>
