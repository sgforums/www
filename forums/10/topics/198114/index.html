            <div class='col-md body'>Thai govt downplay Singapore statesman's criticism on Thai politic<br><br>Thai government have downplayed former Singapore's former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's criticism of Thai politics in an article in Forbes magazine.<br><br>Foreign Minister Kantathi Suphamongkhon said what Lee wanted to point out in the article is that compromising is an alternative to end the country's political conflict.<br><br>He said that he has assigned the Thai Embassy in Singapore to follow up on this matter and inform the Singaporean leader the complexity of Thailand's political situation.<br><br>Lee wrote an article comparing and analyzing Thailand political situation with Iraq's. He said that authorities have to implement this subject carefully as he fears that it may affect the bilateral relationship of both countries.<br><br>Meanwhile Deputy Commerce Minister Preecha Laohapongchana on Thursday seemed to shrug off criticism by Singapore's former premier, saying that Thailand knew well and were well aware of how to deal with the current political and economic situation.<br><br>Preecha said he disagreed Singapore senior statesman. He chose to differ, and pointed out that Thailand's economic and political systems are clearly separated.<br><br>However, he conceded that the current political uncertainties had affected, "to some extent," confidence among both local and foreign entrepreneurs.<br><br>To restore that confidence, the caretaker government had closely monitored the trade and investment climate and tried to give entrepreneurs a proper understanding of the situation.<br><br>In addition Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Somkid Jatusripitak and many cabinet members had gone "on the road" to explain Thai economic conditions to foreign investors.<br><br>He believed that Thailand's political and uncertainties would ease once the general election is held and a new government is formed. The foreign investors would then return to invest in the kingdom again.<br><br>The Nation<br><br><a href="http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/30/headlines/headlines_30007694.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/30/headlines/headlines_30007694.php</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">This is a problem when an active politician takes on a 'SECOND JOB' as a writer for a foreign magazine, writing his views of a Third Country while still in the Government Cabinet of his own country.<br><br>What is MM LKY doing contributing his personal views about Thai Politics in a written article to FORBES ?<br><br>Has he forgotten that he remains a Minister of the Singapore Cabinet, and not a Junior Minister but as a MINNISTER MENTOR ?<br><br><strong>Surely his views would be seen as an interference in the DOMESTIC POLITICS of Thailand ?</strong><br><br>Do the areas of economics and politics mix ?<br><br>At what point do these areas converge to affect one on the other ?<br><br>Can the unique Singapore experience with our vulnerable size in physical boundaries, human and natural resources be compared to other countries with a larger land mass, population and natural endowments ?<br><br>Surely, even if there are political instability that spiral down-scale to the level of open violence, <strong>economic activities must continue in one form or another</strong> - although at a much slower pace then desired.<br><br>Iraq and Sri Lanka have seen political turmoil but maintained a minimum decent level of social order despite the violence, and with each country having a different degree of political order in the midst of militant violence - yet, economic activities continue to support the population.<br><br>Do the present deadlock in Thai Politics threaten the economic stability of Thailand ?<br><br>Surely, Thai economic activities continue in all the sectors of manufacturing, banking, trading and commerce ?<br><br>So long as the Thai political situation do not erupt into social disorder, militancy and violence that leads to a spiralling decline and non-existence of political and social order - much like the situation in Somalia, or Lebanon in its darkest days - are the personal views of MM LKY correct concerning Thai politics ?<br><br>This scare mongering of MM LKY of Political-Economic relationship has been used successfully in Singapore to a <strong>gullible and captive audience</strong>, and has resulted in perpetuating his political grip over Singapore political, social, and economic development for the last forty-five years.<br><br>Is Singapore's unique circumstances and experience relevant to other countries - to the extent that MM LKY's should export the same "scare-mongering " to other countries - that have entirely different sets of political, social, cultural and economic circumstances ?</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><span style="color: darkred;">On second thoughts, I suppose LKY was doing for his own interest - or more accurately for the interest of Temasek, which has bitten off more then it could digest in its take-over of Shin Corp.<br><br>Perhaps LKY call for a compromise by all parties is to help the Thai PM get out of the deepening morass that the Thai PM has found himself sinking into, which will include the dissolution of his political party, and himself being barred from Thai politics for the next five years.<br><br>All this will not be of any benefit to Temasek Holdings and the $3 Billion that was spent and probably worth much less as each month progress.</span><br><br></div>
