              <p>Is it possible to lower fees from saving created and yet provide better all round services to the members in organizations like clubs and Management Corporations ?</p>
              <p>In case you should think I am pulling a fast one, I can vouch at the appropriate time I could show you organizations in Singapore which have lowered their fees and charges through their efficiencies and productivity and past on such savings to members during the whole period of recessions during the period 2001 - 2007 and is still doing more for their members.</p>
              <p>Despite passing back more than $5 millionds of managemen fund contributions from the greater savings achieved and higher incomes created from approrpriate use of common property etc the Management Corporation is chalking up increases of surpluses.</p>
              <p>So it is not true as the government cannot save on expenditures and pass savings back to citizens and yet at the same time provide higher level of services as more humble organizations like I mention have done this all the time.</p>
              <p>One Management Corporation has reduced its Management Fund contribution from S$1.00 per share value per month in 2001 to presently S$0.20 per share value pm while continuing to turn in surpluses while members are enjoying excellent services.</p>
              <p>Of course through lowering the management fund contribution to $0.20 per share value pm the property is enjoying higher property and rental values.</p>
              <p>It may be asked : Why is the government telling us again and again it cannot lower the fees charged for public transport, medical and utility services and the only way to run the country is to keep increasing costs.</p>
              <p>Have we not better paid ministers and civil servants millions because they are said to be talented than the employees or council members of these humble voluntary council or committee members in private organizations who have been certainly outperforming these who are paid higher.</p>
              <p>Of course I will not be able to disclose these organizations without their official permissions. This post is just to tell you all that at the appropriate time if need be I will show the full accounts of such organizations and their lowering of fees yet attaining cost savings which have been passed on to their lucky members.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>creative way to save costs and increase efficiency and productivity?</p>

              <p>Our Town Council are over-spending on residents' monies with the additional layers created to manage the same estates. In the old days HDB managed the estates with lesser managers and lesser titles without all the General Managers, Senior and Senior Principal estates Officers costing $15,000.00 pm. With the creation of Mayors who are actually doing more or less the same estate routines like the old days, the costs of running the estates are double and triple that of the old days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no way government is going to increase efficiency or productivity to help residents save or get values for monies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the General Managers and Mayors are replaced by less high-sounding estates officers the salary costs will be halfed or reduced to one third.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the kind of saving possible in the private sector and from such savings the residents are paying lesser maintenance fees from $1.00 per share value pm to $0.20 per share value pm in the case I mentioned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On top of that big saving the services are getting more efficient and incomes are rising.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is the main reason why town councils/HDB in their present protectionist structure cannot be competitive as compared with the private sector's management.</p>

              <p>I have to agree with you that our kind of governing is not a A/B competitive universe. It is more like a power play. With all MPs and Ministers and judiciary and whole of civil service coming under the thumb of the power that be all the legalistic tweaking will have to play to its logical conclusions or lack of it through its natural course until NKF, Selamat, Shin Corp to give some irritations.</p>
              <p>For years there is no creativity or A versus B competitive or outsourcing or better rational solutions. Such a auto-piloting state has persisted for years without any change.</p>
              <p>Even if openness and accountability is the best form of government which will save us from extinction no one will listen here as that change will alter the power game and change the self-glorifying agenda of power that be which is like opium once afflicted cannot change.</p>
              <p>Every suggestion which may be proven and worthy have been put up even by the junior ministers at one time or another but these would not be followed as that will mean the loss of power.</p>
              <p>The practical truth is once leaders tasted power, there can be no more rational open or accountable government until more NKF, typhoon, selamat, shin corp, deeper and deeper recessions and total disasters.</p>

              <p>When we put up an opinion like this - possibility of reducing costs and passing back savings to the citizens citizens will benefit if this can be achieved in practice.</p>
              <p>I am telling you this can be achieved and cost savings passed back to owners of one property I am aware off.</p>
              <p>Why must you be such a turn-off disbelieving in everything forumers talk about as long as they seem to reflect on the M/W. Are you his cousin or niece in disguise as a fellow citizens with a view to discuss.</p>
