            <div class='col-md body'>Why pple, without asking, just put $50 inside in order to get the ERS?  Why so troublesome?<br><strong><blockquote><br>The ERS was given to Singaporeans to help them tide over the GST increase. However, the way in which one qualifies for the shares is somewhat puzzling.<br><br>One has first to put $50 into one's CPF account before one can lay one's hands on the ERS, not an easy task for some Singaporeans.<br><br>However, it is those who are unable to meet this 'minimal' requirement who might need the ERS more.<br><br>It was not until the press shed light on the problem did I realise how severe it was.<br><br>Much time and energy have been expended by grassroots leaders all over Singapore who went knocking on the doors of the less informed.<br><br>Member of Parliament Yeo Cheow Tong was reported to have donated $50 to a young couple who could not afford to top up. But there were many others whom our good MP could not help.<br><br>People who were not Internet-savvy or familiar with ATMs had to queue up for hours to top up their CPF account.<br><br>All these are a terrible waste of human resources. So, what is the rationale for the requirement to top up $50? Would it be the same if it was a $1 top-up? Then, for that matter, why do we need to top up at all?<br><br>LIM WAH FONG<br><br></blockquote></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.dianafreedman.com/images/Dollz/Girls%20Dollz/Heads/hflipblo.gif"></div>
