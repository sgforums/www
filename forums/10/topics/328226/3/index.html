As far as i know, in the earlier years, most singaporeans rent flat build by HDB, then LKY said all singaporean will own a house and a roof on their head. So HDB start selling house on 99 lease, and now, we go back to rent again??? Wow!</p>

              <p>Aiyo.. it's all how the policy is being worded mah.</p>
              <p>If HDB allow renters to pay rent with CPF.. is sama sama mah.</p>
              <p>Pay interest rates vs pay rent.....</p>
              <p>You own only the lease.. then you sub lease... to other renters. Or you rent.. and then sub-rent to other renters.. ... what's the diff ? Only thing is ..HDB no allow sub-rent.. but can sub-lease... harlow... like allow you to shit.. vs not allow you to shit in their toilet only wat.</p>
              <p>Then how much should we pay for a lease for a 3 room flat that only has 10 years left on it ? Current market rate for 3 room flat ... say... $200K ? Cannot be mah.</p>
              <p>Then you paying interest on a asset that has a depreciation due to a expiration.. like that is making meh ? Even the HDB wants to buy back your remainder lease so you can top up your minimum sum.. they apply a straight line depreciation on the value.</p>
              <p>Machiam a con job leh....bery confused.</p>
              <p>Then you put 100K in the HDB.. consider asset.. I put the difference in not paying the interest in other investments to earn money.. is also asset..the only difference is I control the asset and all asset in my own name.. but for you.. is HDB control the asset..because the property is still belong to HDB leh. So technically speaking hor.. your asset is only in the lease ownership.</p>
              <p>Oh , you want to rent out how much ? I consider..business must be good for a toilet jagar job.. your location is very prime.</p>
