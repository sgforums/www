              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">If
              Dr Chee Soon Juan succeeds, you will see good people coming to run
              instead of a bunch of cronies and the people can have real choices and
              choose. </span></strong></p>

              the good candidates run, whether Dr Chee would be suitable is anyone's
              guess but as it is, the immediate need is to show massive support for
              Dr Chee Soon Juan in support of his cause.. how can it be to support
              him for parliament when he is disqualified? </span></strong><a href="/forums/10/topics/327810?page=5"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png?1208925295" alt="Confused"></a></p>
