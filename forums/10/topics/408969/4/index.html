              <p>The scanning of votes is not done after the votes are counted, it is done while the votes are counted, at least that's what I suspect. The voting boxes are sealed after counting, so it would be difficult, but not impossible to break open if they wanted to. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During the last election, Ling How Doong said on the news that the election officials took their time to place all the voting slips under a light and he was commenting that the place was already so bright, why the need to shine it under the lamp. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>It's people like you that will cause Singapore to forever go down the path of having an inexplicable fear of voting against the PAP.</p>
              <p>There is absolutely NO evidence of votes being recorded by the ruling party. My dad, who was an election official at one of the voting stations, told me that there is no such thing about PAP people attempting to record the votes made by the citizens.</p>
              <p>All votes are guarded by the election official, and then sent to the courts for sealing. To break the seal requires adequate justification, and has to be made with the representatives of both parties involved in that election.</p>

              <p>I don't see where is the evidence that supporting opposition would cause one person's career to derail. It's totally baseless, and is a fear that is bordering on superstition.</p>
              <p>The point is, if my fellow citizens don't wake up, and start learning to take responsibility for the fate of where our country will go, Singapore is doomed to go down this same route, and in 30 years time, as I mentioned, we will  have more and more social consequences from the current policies of today.</p>

              <p><br>It's not whether you are right or I am right. But if we continue to believe that voting is tracked (almost like a superstition), it will continue to keep citizens from being responsible for our own country</p>
              <p>As I said, there is no evidence of such a thing, and its just a scare tactic of our ruling party.</p>
              <p>I also think there is no issues with supporting the opposition. I am pro-opposition but I am not a PAP-hater. There's a difference between the 2 types of people.</p>
