              <p>I know we are one of the top few surveillance soceities, but I really don't think the powers-that-be are so free.</p>
              <p>Additionally, treating those who did not vote for you badly is not really going to be a way to win votes, if anything it will lead to more disgruntlement on the ground. The whole Potong Pasir/ Hougang upgrading saga should be a clear enough indication that Singaporeans have grown a bit beyond the stick and carrot approach towards determining who they would like to vote for.</p>
              <p>If anything I always find the whole "hey vote for us and we'll upgrade your estate (I live in Hougang)" a tad bit condescending. I am more interested in the general and long term good of Singapore then if my flat has new lifts.  </p>

              <p>Spoilt votes not counted... Means if people actually chose SDA.... but ticks... the vote is voided.... So means SDA loses a percentage of its vote.</p>
