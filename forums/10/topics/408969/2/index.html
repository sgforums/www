              <p>They are definitely tracked, in order for them to gerrymander the election boundaries.</p>
              <p>Why do you think the election boundaries look the way they do now? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you don't think that they track your votes, you should go with your group of friends and exchange each other's ballot paper. See if they stop you from exchanging. I once went with my parents, tried exchanging the ballot slip and was stopped. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>If all ballot slips are the same and unmarked, there is no difference if I switch around the ballot slips, unless they are tracked by some invisible serial numbers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During the last election, Ling How Doong (opposition candidate) did claim that the vote counting officials took a long time to place all the ballot paper under a "lamp", they could have improvised a scanner under the lamp. There is no need to break open the sealed ballot boxes after elections to count the votes again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if they have knowledge that you vote for opposition party, there is nothing much they can do, unless you are a high ranking civil servant (your promotions and length of service will be affected). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
