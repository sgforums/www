              <p><br>Screaming for freedom is the easy thing to do, any party can do that. In fact, anyone can scream for freedom and etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, freedom itself cannot govern or run a country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You do not govern a country by allowing freedom. You must have plans, economic, social plans and so on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Must you wait for those things to happen before anyone can decides on policies and issues?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If that's the reasoning, the PAP should stop putting up any economic policy, governing policy simply due to singapore not being free enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Under no circumstances can anyone ignore policies. Politics HAS a go beyond the simple issue of fighting for freedom and etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is many aspects of politics, however in this thread, we are going to focus on one thing, that is the governing policies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you do not want to say anything constructive, real economic plans, how the government should run a country, I do suggest that you do not waste anyone's time here. Do not use the PAP or the political system here in singapore as an excuse to say we do not need to care about how singapore should be run.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You guys talk about tearing down the PAP and so on, but what kind of government do you want to see? A party that sits there and do nothing?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can you handle the truth? That politics go beyond the simple issue of freedom? That politicis is beyond the 'fun to watch politics? '</p>

              <p>I will say this again, it is not about the party themselves, but what policies the party brings forward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And you have to talk about issues beyond a tax raise. I can agree with the PAP on certain issues, but I will also disagree on some of the PAP's policy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally, I do have certain viewpoints and stance that I hope any political party should take.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's talk about rising cost of living from food to transportation. The cost of food and transportation is all affected by the cost of oil. The problem is, we do not have a real alternative energy source other tha natural gas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what can be done to resolve a long term problem? Firstly, build nuclear power station( not nuclear enrichment facilities) which does not pose a military threat to the region.</p>
              <p>Say what you want about solar, wind and tidal energy, but singapore simply do not have the space to accomadate such technology, and use them on a reasonable scale. If we choose solar as our main energy source, the cost of generating eletricity will go up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, Nuclear energy is a risk, but it is a risk that is necessary, as there  is no other viable alternative. If we do not go nuclear, once we run of out fuel and natural gas, we will be too reliant on neighbouring countries for their power stations, like their nuclear power plant. Which is not a good thing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Instead, singapore should build nuclear facility, and if we generate enough power, export them to neighbouring states like Malaysia. If not, train workers who is able to run nuclear facilities, as you need HIGHLY trained workforce to do that, then export our expertise to the region.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Transportation wise, government should push for incentive in regards to electric cars. Provide incentive to car makers which wants to build elecitric cars here. Cost of oil will rise again sooner or later, electric cars can provide more value in the long run. Gave grants to companies who improve electric car techology. Let them set up their industries here in singapore, their R&amp;D department as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, nationalise the transportation companies like SMRT( meaning make them less profit driven) , free rides for children, students and the eldery. For the working adults, amount spend on transportation should be minimum, at the most $ 50 per month, no matter the distance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For public transporation, shift and change the types of buses used, and let them use an electric engine as well, make us less dependant on the foreign market.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Raise the COE tax and ERP tax on private ownership of cars. Cars are an luxury, let it be an luxury. Singapore is a city, walking for a while will not kill you, and when you have a good enough public transportation system, make full use of that system.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Food issues, look into concepts of a tower farming, or underground farming. Either build skyscrapers meant to grow food or develop a artifical underground system where food can be grown. Reason? Ensure that we are not too dependent on foreign food, a food crisis is enough to kill off singapore. We do need to be dependent on ourselves as well. We do not have enough land area to have a normal farm, hence our only choice is to build up or down. Those kind of artifical buildings need skilled labours as well, which is why I believe it secure or provides a sort of skilled labour that cannot be easily replaced by countries besides us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, those projects is energy intensive, which is why we need a reliable power source, nuclear energy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tax issues? Tax a company's windfall profits, increase tax on companies, MNCs or private companies when they become rich enough to support themselves. We need a decent middle-class society to function. Lower tax on lower and lower tier middle income group.</p>
              <p>Create a maximum salary on CEOs and managers. Try your best to lower and spread the wealth around. Grant higher income groups incentives when the economy is doing well, for their effort in balancing the income gap, and increasing the GDP of the nation as a whole.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regulate the companies frequently, ensure no companies decides to take a risk that is too dangerous. If a company is in danger, and can harm the country, nationalise it, and replace the decision making body of those companies. Provide certain benefits to companies that uphold good business values.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Decrease our reliance on a service economy. Espeically in regards to tourism. Unless the world can suddenly find a new alternative energy that is cheaper than oil, tourism will undoubtly decline. The rising cost of transportation continues to rise, even when the price of oil droped recently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rely less on tourism to boast the economy in the long run, in the short run, it is viable, but do not be too reliant on tourism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Focus heavily on energy related industry, that is a thing we needs to address.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Worker/social issues? Conduct checks on failing business, try and predict the surivival of some business. If some business is going to collaspe, either bring in new companies in to replace the failing company, or provide temporary aid to people who have just lost their jobs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Workers or employees with a family to support will be given priority, such as giving our money and pay for a basic cost of living, food, water electricity, and cover the basic cost of schools, such as the schools equipment fees and so on. Grant families a certain amount of CPF to be used under such scenario. Give them a limit for 3 months at the most, their new job may not be too good, but they have to cut down their cost of living.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the elderly, government should provide the aged with free living quarters, free food, water and energy. However, encourage childrens to look after their parents depending on their income. A social net should be provided for the elderly. Also, increase the retirement age, people in modern society do have a longer life, and can work for a longer period of time.</p>
              <p>Allow them to do so, and prevent companies to retire older employees simply because they are older. Lawsuit can be made against companies if no reasonable reason has been given to lay off older employee. Set up a council to judge this issues, before bringing them to the court, as most people who get laid off don't really have money to begin with. Again, provide companies with benefits if they choose to take care of the older employees. People who want to have a later retirement age ususally have more financial diffculties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Education wise, set up a political issues class at the secondary school level. Avoid talking about political parties, and focus on social issues. Let the class and teachers discuss about government policies, and what kind of new ideas can be brought up. Allow debates to take place time to time, and ensure younger generation do have the necessary knowledge to vote. Let the students know about political issues, and let them form their opinions on it. If possible, employ teachers who have a political science or history background, where the issue of running a state is given some sort of focus. Students do not need to pass a exam on this topic, but they should be given education and discussion on these issues.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Allowing social/political issues to be discussed in Junior College is too late, and polytechincs students don't even have a chance to discuss it among peers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, extend compulsary education to secondary school levels, knowledge is important no matter what. Without proper education and knowledge, it is easy for us to regress technologically. Decrease the cost of universities for locals if possible, and decrease the amount of foreign students.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What we want to do is to attract foreign students, but we need to attract the best of the best. The less slots given, the harder it is to get in, and only those that excel can get in. Increase R&amp;D projects, in regards to energy issues if possible, we need to find a way to attract more people here. If countries like US choose to remain conservative on certain scientific issues, it is our chance to grab those talents who want to develop their ideas here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, more locals should be given a chance to get into university, as the need for higher education is always required. Increase the space of uni for poly grads, there has been a growing trend where people who choose to get into JC choose the poly route. Let the poly be more academic and have a slightly harder and more in depth study. Let our poly be able to compete with regional university, which is not impossible. Improve our education standards. Rather than letting those talents fade away and go overseas, we want to retain those people inside our university. Split univeristy intake equally among poly grads and JC grads.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If cannot allow our skilled labour force to decline, we need a society of extremely skilled labour force. Granting people who did not get into poly  or did not get into Universrity lower our reputation of a skilled labour force.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, I have provided some of my political issue and stance, beyond the mindless PAP, electoral system bashing. Poh and others, I would like to hear the political issues that you support.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>It would be a nightmare if in a big boo boo situation, money is spent without check and balance.  Just a hypothetical scenario. ;)</p>
              <p>We need to redefine the meaning of 'People Representation'.</p>
              <p>Singapore is fortunate that its citizens have a high level of education - this means they should have the mental ability to tell what is right or wrong. So, Opposition should be able to reach out to them and let them hear what they have to say and offer and ultimately let the People decide. Their decision will be the right decision.</p>
              <p>A country should be decided by this highly educated people and not any 1 man, no matter how nobel his motives may be. The reason is, Singapore is a Democracy.</p>

              <p>Regarding gay marriages or civil unions (or how it's politically called), i have no issues whatever so with it. To me, it's just a legal procedure that declares another person your legal dependant.</p>
              <p>My issue however, is when homosexuals decide they need to publicise and push their lifestyle on the general public. You do your banging behind your close doors and it stays there. 2 grown men kissing and hugging in public will never be acceptable (Though grown women probably won't generate that much protests, i reckon)</p>
              <p>My stand is that homosexuality is not natural (as it fulfills no understandable evolutionary purposes) but i won't deny that it exists. Trying to force them to live a hestrosexual lifestyle is just as unnatural as forcing all men to like the color pink.</p>
              <p>Abortion well, it's the woman's choice. Who in the world would like a huge metallic object inserted into your orifice and snip off something ? It's personal choice.</p>
              <p>Though they should go through counselling to ensure they understand fully the implication of what they're doing before they proceed.</p>
              <p>Killing off an unborn baby is bad of course, but so is bringing the baby into the world and not being prepared to take care of it.</p>

              <p>I will say this again, it is not about the party themselves, but what policies the party brings forward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And you have to talk about issues beyond a tax raise. I can agree with the PAP on certain issues, but I will also disagree on some of the PAP's policy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally, I do have certain viewpoints and stance that I hope any political party should take.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's talk about rising cost of living from food to transportation. The cost of food and transportation is all affected by the cost of oil. The problem is, we do not have a real alternative energy source other tha natural gas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what can be done to resolve a long term problem? Firstly, build nuclear power station( not nuclear enrichment facilities) which does not pose a military threat to the region.</p>
              <p>Say what you want about solar, wind and tidal energy, but singapore simply do not have the space to accomadate such technology, and use them on a reasonable scale. If we choose solar as our main energy source, the cost of generating eletricity will go up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, Nuclear energy is a risk, but it is a risk that is necessary, as there  is no other viable alternative. If we do not go nuclear, once we run of out fuel and natural gas, we will be too reliant on neighbouring countries for their power stations, like their nuclear power plant. Which is not a good thing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Instead, singapore should build nuclear facility, and if we generate enough power, export them to neighbouring states like Malaysia. If not, train workers who is able to run nuclear facilities, as you need HIGHLY trained workforce to do that, then export our expertise to the region.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Transportation wise, government should push for incentive in regards to electric cars. Provide incentive to car makers which wants to build elecitric cars here. Cost of oil will rise again sooner or later, electric cars can provide more value in the long run. Gave grants to companies who improve electric car techology. Let them set up their industries here in singapore, their R&amp;D department as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, nationalise the transportation companies like SMRT( meaning make them less profit driven) , free rides for children, students and the eldery. For the working adults, amount spend on transportation should be minimum, at the most $ 50 per month, no matter the distance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For public transporation, shift and change the types of buses used, and let them use an electric engine as well, make us less dependant on the foreign market.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Raise the COE tax and ERP tax on private ownership of cars. Cars are an luxury, let it be an luxury. Singapore is a city, walking for a while will not kill you, and when you have a good enough public transportation system, make full use of that system.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Food issues, look into concepts of a tower farming, or underground farming. Either build skyscrapers meant to grow food or develop a artifical underground system where food can be grown. Reason? Ensure that we are not too dependent on foreign food, a food crisis is enough to kill off singapore. We do need to be dependent on ourselves as well. We do not have enough land area to have a normal farm, hence our only choice is to build up or down. Those kind of artifical buildings need skilled labours as well, which is why I believe it secure or provides a sort of skilled labour that cannot be easily replaced by countries besides us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, those projects is energy intensive, which is why we need a reliable power source, nuclear energy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tax issues? Tax a company's windfall profits, increase tax on companies, MNCs or private companies when they become rich enough to support themselves. We need a decent middle-class society to function. Lower tax on lower and lower tier middle income group.</p>
              <p>Create a maximum salary on CEOs and managers. Try your best to lower and spread the wealth around. Grant higher income groups incentives when the economy is doing well, for their effort in balancing the income gap, and increasing the GDP of the nation as a whole.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regulate the companies frequently, ensure no companies decides to take a risk that is too dangerous. If a company is in danger, and can harm the country, nationalise it, and replace the decision making body of those companies. Provide certain benefits to companies that uphold good business values.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Decrease our reliance on a service economy. Espeically in regards to tourism. Unless the world can suddenly find a new alternative energy that is cheaper than oil, tourism will undoubtly decline. The rising cost of transportation continues to rise, even when the price of oil droped recently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rely less on tourism to boast the economy in the long run, in the short run, it is viable, but do not be too reliant on tourism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Focus heavily on energy related industry, that is a thing we needs to address.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Worker/social issues? Conduct checks on failing business, try and predict the surivival of some business. If some business is going to collaspe, either bring in new companies in to replace the failing company, or provide temporary aid to people who have just lost their jobs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Workers or employees with a family to support will be given priority, such as giving our money and pay for a basic cost of living, food, water electricity, and cover the basic cost of schools, such as the schools equipment fees and so on. Grant families a certain amount of CPF to be used under such scenario. Give them a limit for 3 months at the most, their new job may not be too good, but they have to cut down their cost of living.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the elderly, government should provide the aged with free living quarters, free food, water and energy. However, encourage childrens to look after their parents depending on their income. A social net should be provided for the elderly. Also, increase the retirement age, people in modern society do have a longer life, and can work for a longer period of time.</p>
              <p>Allow them to do so, and prevent companies to retire older employees simply because they are older. Lawsuit can be made against companies if no reasonable reason has been given to lay off older employee. Set up a council to judge this issues, before bringing them to the court, as most people who get laid off don't really have money to begin with. Again, provide companies with benefits if they choose to take care of the older employees. People who want to have a later retirement age ususally have more financial diffculties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Education wise, set up a political issues class at the secondary school level. Avoid talking about political parties, and focus on social issues. Let the class and teachers discuss about government policies, and what kind of new ideas can be brought up. Allow debates to take place time to time, and ensure younger generation do have the necessary knowledge to vote. Let the students know about political issues, and let them form their opinions on it. If possible, employ teachers who have a political science or history background, where the issue of running a state is given some sort of focus. Students do not need to pass a exam on this topic, but they should be given education and discussion on these issues.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Allowing social/political issues to be discussed in Junior College is too late, and polytechincs students don't even have a chance to discuss it among peers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, extend compulsary education to secondary school levels, knowledge is important no matter what. Without proper education and knowledge, it is easy for us to regress technologically. Decrease the cost of universities for locals if possible, and decrease the amount of foreign students.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What we want to do is to attract foreign students, but we need to attract the best of the best. The less slots given, the harder it is to get in, and only those that excel can get in. Increase R&amp;D projects, in regards to energy issues if possible, we need to find a way to attract more people here. If countries like US choose to remain conservative on certain scientific issues, it is our chance to grab those talents who want to develop their ideas here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, more locals should be given a chance to get into university, as the need for higher education is always required. Increase the space of uni for poly grads, there has been a growing trend where people who choose to get into JC choose the poly route. Let the poly be more academic and have a slightly harder and more in depth study. Let our poly be able to compete with regional university, which is not impossible. Improve our education standards. Rather than letting those talents fade away and go overseas, we want to retain those people inside our university. Split univeristy intake equally among poly grads and JC grads.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If cannot allow our skilled labour force to decline, we need a society of extremely skilled labour force. Granting people who did not get into poly  or did not get into Universrity lower our reputation of a skilled labour force.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, I have provided some of my political issue and stance, beyond the mindless PAP, electoral system bashing. Poh and others, I would like to hear the political issues that you support.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Sir, need I remind you that a party should be something more than an oppositon? Most importantly, seek to be something more than an opposition party?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In debating competition, no team has ever won a debate by saying your proposal sucks, hence we win. Even when we are from the opposition side, we have to bring up a counter proposal at times. If not, one can always stick to the status quo, that no new policy is needed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When a person asked me 'what sort of proposal do I have?', and I do not have one, then I can simply say that we should stick to the status quo, and argue why the current policy is good enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I can agree with the proposal to a certain extend, then I can justify myself questioning the proposal, but saying I am here to find weakness in your proposal and fix it, or even improve it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A political party by nature, should not expect itself to be an opposition only , instead, it should be able to tell us why it should run the country, support and oppose proposals selectively.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many people wants to remove the PAP from power, yet at the same time, they never talk about how should the country be run. They are seeking to remove the ruling party without ever thinking of the fact that another party still needs to run the country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end, if the new ruling party adopt the exact same policies the PAP did, same stance and etc, then in actual fact, we did not experience any real change, beyond a party with a different name in power.</p>

              <p>ray245, your topic deserve more than the regular flippant remarks so I would like to answer you properly, that is if you can help me out.</p>
              <p>I belongs to a cohort with little to no knowledge on economic policies and politics, and this is mainly due to our education level. We probably make up the bulk of the rantings and whinings on our government policies in the forums and coffeeshops too.</p>
              <p>So maybe you can help by telling me; what would you label the current PAP government economic policy and politic?</p>
