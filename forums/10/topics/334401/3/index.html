              <p>ray245, your topic deserve more than the regular flippant remarks so I would like to answer you properly, that is if you can help me out.</p>
              <p>I belongs to a cohort with little to no knowledge on economic policies and politics, and this is mainly due to our education level. We probably make up the bulk of the rantings and whinings on our government policies in the forums and coffeeshops too.</p>
              <p>So maybe you can help by telling me; what would you label the current PAP government economic policy and politic?</p>
              </div>

              <p><br>Frankly speaking, I do think that the PAP is quite flexible. Politically speaking, they are considered to be a center left government, and do lean towards socialism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Their role as a party government as the governments and their idea of pragmatism means their political idealology can be altered.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Economic terms, the PAP is liberal, yet at the same time, do pratice socialism. Government intervention in the market is there, regulation is also part of the PAP policy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only area where the PAP leans towards the right is social issues. From unnatural sex, the rights of homosexuals, political repression and free speech wise, this is the only area where their idealology leans towards the right.</p>
              <p>Religous issues, they are more conservative in some ways, mainly due to the fact that their power base do have a sizable make up of christians, which are more conservative( not saying anything good or bad with being conservative) than other religion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps wikipedia can offer some help?</p>

              <p>Since the early years of the PAP's rule, the idea of survival has been a central theme of Singaporean politics. According to Diane Mauzy and R.S. Milne, most analysts of Singapore have discerned four major "ideologies" of the PAP: <a title="Pragmatism" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Pragmatism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pragmatism</span></span></a>, <a title="Meritocracy" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Meritocracy"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">meritocracy</span></span></a>, <a title="Multiracialism" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Multiracialism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">multiracialism</span></span></a>, and <a title="Asian values" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Asian_values"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Asian values</span></span></a> or <a title="Communitarianism" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Communitarianism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">communitarianism</span></span></a>. In January 1991, the PAP introduced the <a class="new" title="White Paper on Shared Values (page does not exist)" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/w/index.php?title=White_Paper_on_Shared_Values&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">White Paper on Shared Values</span></span></a>, which tried to create a national ideology and institutionalize Asian values. The party also has 'rejected' what they considered Western-style <a title="Liberal democracy" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Liberal_democracy"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">liberal democracy</span></span></a>. Some claim largely as a political statement because of the heavy utilisation of many aspects of liberal democracy in Singapore's public policy, specifically the <a title="Welfare state" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Welfare_state"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">welfare state</span></span></a> and recognition of democratic institutions. Professor Hussin Mutalib, however, states that for Lee Kuan Yew "Singapore would be better off without liberal democracy"<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="http://movies.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[4]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The party <a title="Macroeconomics" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Macroeconomics"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">economic ideology</span></span></a> has always accepted the need for some <a class="mw-redirect" title="Social welfare" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Social_welfare"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">welfare spending</span></span></a>, pragmatic <a title="Economic interventionism" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Economic_interventionism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">economic interventionism</span></span></a> and general <a class="mw-redirect" title="Keynesian" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Keynesian"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Keynesian</span></span></a> <a title="Economic policy" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Economic_policy"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">economic policy</span></span></a>.

              <p>Lee Kuan Yew has also said in 1992: "Through <a title="Hong Kong" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Hong_Kong"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Hong Kong</span></span></a> watching, I concluded that state welfare and subsidies blunted the individual's drive to succeed. I watched with amazement the ease with which Hong Kong workers adjusted their salaries upwards in boom times and downwards in recessions. I resolved to reverse course on the welfare policies which my party had inherited or copied from <a class="mw-redirect" title="British Labour Party" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/British_Labour_Party"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">British Labour Party</span></span></a> policies."<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="http://movies.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[5]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The party is deeply suspicious of <a title="Communism" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Communism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">communist</span></span></a> political ideologies, despite a brief joint alliance with the communists against <a title="Colonialism" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Colonialism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">colonialism</span></span></a> in Singapore during the party's early years. It has since considered itself subscribing to <a title="Social democracy" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Social_democracy"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">social democratic</span></span></a> ideologies, though the party has clearly moved to towards <a title="Neoliberalism" href="http://movies.sgforums.com/wiki/Neoliberalism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">neoliberal</span></span></a> and pro-market reforms since the 1970s.</p>

              <p>The problem with the opposition party right now, is they attack the PAP using one angle of attack, attacking the social conservatism of the PAP, hence the free speech argument and so on. However, you cannot win an election if your arguments and base of attacks relys on one single issue. You have to expand your approach, and let people know that even by fluke, and the opposition manage to take the election as a new government, the new party can manage the country from day 1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The attack dog angle, where all a political party aspire to be is to form an opposition, is something that almost everyone can do. The coffee shop uncles, to the forum members here. One should not use the popularism angle to gain votes. Inciting a mob for example, is not helpful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do think that forum members need to be more liberal, and less conservative when they approach the PAP. You cannot say that everything argued by the PAP is lies and etc, try and understand the issue which they have brought up, and find opposing political ideaology to counter it. If you agree with the PAP, you can just agree with them. Agreeing with the PAP is nothing to be ashamed of, other all, not one can be absoulte in their political belief. Hence if possible, try and visit the PAP's website, go to their forum, and you will notice even among the PAP, there is disagreements with the issue. Hence talk about the issue at hand, and less on the party itself. Reason being, you can agree with the hated PAP on certain issues!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the voting system is based on a system, where you vote based on issues and policy, you might be surprised with the party  you are voting for. Instead of voting for the name, you are voting on the issue itself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like you have to answer a MCQ, where in regards to one issue, you have several choice available, and choose those issues that you agree with.</p>

              <p><br>Not really. A privatisation of companies is a left wing idea actually, The concept of socialism, as compared to a free market, where there should be no government intervention.</p>

              <p>Just because they nationalise a company does not make a nation any less captialistic. Within the system of captialism, there has been camps who are more pro-socialism, and pro- deregulation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which is why the opposition needs to create a political stand in the next election and has to show us that they are even more flexible to run a nation, also they need to have the intention of running a nation, not just a GRC.</p>

              <p>Its good to hear comments about TRANSPARENCY.</p>
              <p>Lets put things in perspective.</p>
              <p>1. What is the definition of the word?</p>
              <p>source : Wall street words</p>
              <p><strong>transparency</strong></p>
              <dl><dd>The <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>full</strong></span></span>, accurate, and timely disclosure of information.</dd></dl>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. How is this word used ?  Is it the right word to use? Based on the definition, many companies are not TRANSPARENT. What I mean is the wrong word is used.</p>
              <p>Another word more suitable and appropriate should be used.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Is TRANSPARENCY measurable in a SCIENTIFIC absolute way?</p>
              <p>   I want to ask everyone here, how much you really understand this simple word, is TRANSPARENCY measured QUALITATIVELY or QUANTITATIVELY?</p>
              <p>If it is a qualitative measurement, to me, its a subjective measurement. To different people, the assessment can be different?</p>
              <p>If its a quantitative measurement, who has the exact formula?</p>
              <p><br>if no one has a convincing reply, then, I like to say that the word Transparency is used loosely and not completely correctly and another word more appropriate should be used.</p>
              <p>Disclaimer :  I am not financially savvy. Just a layman, brudder. so, if you know better, please clarify.</p>

              <p><br>Do you really want to pay people money just to oppose their policy? If you want to vote for a political party, you do need to think that I am actually going to vote that party into power, as compared to voting in a opposition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only useful opposition is one that can actually put up a decent fight, and actually BE the government. Only then, will that party have a meaningful role as the opposition, one that actually oppose policy when it is bad, and agree with policy when it is good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you want to vote for a party, how can you really tell if the party that you vote for will definelty BE a minority, hence becoming an opposition? What about the fact that MAYBE, just maybe, the majority of the people in singapore is thinking the same thing, and vote for the opposition just because they want an opposition, and in the end the opposition party become the new government?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Moreover, even within the PAP,  there are different factions within a party. In any large orgainsation, differnent factions will be form, each with their own ideas to run a nation. Especially with a versatile party like the PAP. When they swing left to right on issues, have you ever wondered that there might be people who support a new direction, and the people who oppose a new direction?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So when you are voting for a opposition party, vote for them because they can lead the nation, not because they can oppose. Please, you don't even to have qualification to be the opposition and oppose almost policy. Members here can do a rather good job opposing almost every policy. So why do we have to vote and let people have an easy well paid job?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You vote for a party because they can run your area or GRC well, then they can also run the country on a national level.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>And if the opposition show us that they are willingly and is able to lead the nation, you are going to stop voting for the opposition parties?</p>
