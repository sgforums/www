To him, moral value is not an issue so he/she just go on to shoot shoot shoot.   This person is no different from gazelle.  This person is cold blooded, no compassion that is why he/she sees nothing wrong that PAP support evil regime by supplying arms to them.   </div></blockquote>Before call someone idiot - you better go check get your fact right first .Think you been short change by your friend !!! There is some stuff that he did not tell you .  For example - he may have been pick up by police trying to stage protest, or he may be sending SMS on sensitive nature or emailing sensitive stuff .. that got him tracked.<br><br>Maybe you the idiot that been short change by your friend as he did not tell you the whole story !!!  He may have record as a activtities or something.<br><br>By the way - you say it is your neighbour's friend - so it is friend's friend ..... a lot of rumour was started with things like this - I hear from friend's friend .... without getting the whole story right. So like that heard friend's friend - what the different of your comments with the aunties comments make in the wet market  ... all is gossip stuff.  So without clear prove and verification just based on hear say ... you want to call me a idiot based on that, shame on you, like that where is your so call moral ?<br><br>Moral value ? who is the one who define it ? you ? Please do not push your set of moral standard onto others ...<br><br>Yes I am cold blooded and no compassion - yes i do not bring feeling when i do judgement - unlike you get crowded by all the things that you cannot stand back and think and look at the whole picture, just blindly pass judgement based on your emotion.<br><br>So emotion give you the reason to call some one idiot ? Well it does show how much character you have already.</div>

Our message is an invitation to China to do the right thing in Burma, not an attack -- yet even that seemed too much for media that fear Chinese reprisals.<br><br>We won't let our voice be silenced like this. We're taking our message to the streets, in an international day of action on Saturday -- details are on our petition page, and below. And we're redoubling our efforts to make our voice louder: our petition is approaching 600,000 signatures, closing fast on our 1 million goal.The petition link is below - send this email to all your friends and family and help us reach 1 million voices by Saturday!<br><br><a href="http://www.avaaz.org/en/stand_with_burma/w.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.avaaz.org/en/stand_with_burma/w.php</a>"</div>
