The general using<br><br>this excuse tried to use order or intimidation to charge them if they never obey order. If the average Burmese troops have education like ITE, A level or poly diploma, they will be thinking hard enough of the consequences to fire at their own people especially the poor monk who are armless.  As the saying goes, troops not highly educated is a blessing for the general to use them as killing machines.</div>
