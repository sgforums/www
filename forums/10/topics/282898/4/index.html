Now where is the moral in that? Not only that there is none in it, S'pore goes one big circle and condemn the kid for buying cigarette after selling them. That so hypocritical. So wat if the USA is doing it, so wat if the world is doing it, everyone is doing it doesnt mean it is right and that we must follow it and jump on the band wagon for profit over moral value!!

To him, moral value is not an issue so he/she just go on to shoot shoot shoot.   This person is no different from gazelle.  This person is cold blooded, no compassion that is why he/she sees nothing wrong that PAP support evil regime by supplying arms to them.</div>
