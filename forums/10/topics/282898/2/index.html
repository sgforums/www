The singapore is helping the disgusting myanmar gahmen to monitor the Myanmar people in Singapore when the world leaders and world communities condemn the evil regime of Myanmar.   </div></blockquote>Australia sell what to Burma ? have you check that up ? By the way Australia do sell lot of stuff to Burma - just because the volume is smaller then singapore does that make it right ?<br><br>If the world communities is condemning evil regime of Myanmar - why is there also Australia business and trade there, isn't that saying one thing and doing another - which is even worst then Singapore.<br><br>You have prove that Singapore government is monitoring Myanmar people in Singapore ? If that is so that mean Singapore governement is being mornitored by australia governement ....that is why you know ?  By the way, how does singapore government monitoring Myanmar people care to explain more  - seem like we do not have that type of manpower to do it ....<br><br>So singapore is wrong to sell arms to burma, when the whole whole is all producing arms , if they do not buy from singapore, then they can buy from others. So how many the myanmar gahmen have shot dead so far using singapore arms. How many innocents have australia shot dead so far in iraq ? How many students die in US shooting using US made arms ? Seem a lot more them in 1 year then  those kill in mynmar for the past 5 years add together.<br><br>Iraq under sadamn have weapon supply to him by US !!! those are the same weapons that let him hold his power  and his military might ....!!!<br><br></div>

Since that kid will still buy it from someone else if u dun sell it to kid? Might as well make a earning out of the poor kid misery since that kid is doom to it anyway? Now where is the moral in that? Not only that there is none in it, S'pore goes one big circle and condemn the kid for buying cigarette after selling them. That so hypocritical. So wat if the USA is doing it, so wat if the world is doing it, everyone is doing it doesnt mean it is right and that we must follow it and jump on the band wagon for profit over moral value!! Yes this kinda mind set may seem very naive to you but I do have my own principle and there is something that i will not cross for the seek of $$$ unlike our MIW!</div>

Why must they "oil for food" expensive oil for cheap food.  It is daylight robbery in the name of justice ? </div></blockquote>Did the Oil-for-Food program accomplish its mission?<br><br>Yes. The mission of the Oil-for-Food program was to address the humanitarian impact of sanctions on the IraqÂ’s citizens, while maintaining their efficacy, which kept the Hussein regime from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. Under the program, enough food was imported to feed all 27 million Iraqis and the average daily caloric intake of the people of Iraq was increased 83 percent, from 1,200 kilocalories to 2,200 kilocalories per person per day. In addition, malnutrition rates in 2002 in the central and southern part of the country were half those in 1996 among children under the age of five; in the three northern governorates, chronic malnutrition decreased 56 percent. The program also contributed to national vaccination campaigns that helped reduce child mortality and eradicated polio in Iraq since May 29, 2003.<br><br>As usual, there was fraud everywhere that hampered the program. Saddam used Oil for Food as a way to circumvent economic sanctions, bring in enormous amounts of money and lavish that money on himself and his cronies.<br></div>

The mission of the Oil-for-Food program was to address the humanitarian impact of sanctions on the IraqÂ’s citizens, while maintaining their efficacy, which kept the Hussein regime from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. Under the program, enough food was imported to feed all 27 million Iraqis and the average daily caloric intake of the people of Iraq was increased 83 percent, from 1,200 kilocalories to 2,200 kilocalories per person per day. In addition, malnutrition rates in 2002 in the central and southern part of the country were half those in 1996 among children under the age of five; in the three northern governorates, chronic malnutrition decreased 56 percent. The program also contributed to national vaccination campaigns that helped reduce child mortality and eradicated polio in Iraq since May 29, 2003.<br><br>As usual, there was fraud everywhere that hampered the program.
