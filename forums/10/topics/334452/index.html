              <p><strong><span class="contentpagetitle"> The myth of Singaporean democracy</span></strong></p>
              <p><em>Diane Francis<br>National Post<br></em><br>Singapore represents itself as a good place to live and do business -- a democracy with the rule of law.<br><br>In
                                        reality, Singapore is a bully. But it ensures that the rest of the
                                        world fails to realize it by using a carefully crafted PR strategy
                                        designed to portray the city-state as a model of good government and
                                        economic development.</p>
              <p><br>"The frustrating thing is that people continue to see Singapore as
                                        a rules-based society. I want the international community to realize
                                        the abuses," said secretary-general of the Singapore Democratic Party
                                        and leader of the opposition, Dr. Chee Soon Juan, in an exclusive
                                        telephone interview yesterday from his home in Singapore. "Fortunately,
                                        international organizations are getting involved, like Lawyers Rights
                                        Watch, the International Bar Association, the Inter-national Commission
                                        of Jurists. All have criticized Singapore."<br><br>Dr. Chee should
                                        know. His saga, which began in 1992, reads like the Book of Job and
                                        shows that the city-state of five million people is truly an autocracy
                                        whose ruling elite use defamation lawsuits and other court techniques
                                        to harass democratic activists like Chee, as well as media and
                                        corporate entities which fall out of favour.<br><br>This Thursday, Dr.
                                        Chee will be on trial for the eighth time. He is accused of the "crime"
                                        of holding a meeting with more than five persons without a permit. (So
                                        much for the Singapore constitution's guarantee of freedom of opinion,
                                        expression and assembly.)<br><br>"Every time we [have] applied for a
                                        permit we have been turned down and the minister said that he would
                                        never grant a permit," Dr. Chee explained.<br><br>His ordeal began
                                        after he joined the opposition party and criticized the cronyism and
                                        secrecy of the Singaporean government. Since then, lawsuits waged by
                                        the ruling elite have bankrupted him personally and are about to
                                        bankrupt his political party. He has ended up in jail because he is no
                                        longer able to pay the fines, and he has lost his university position
                                        as a lecturer. Throughout, Dr. Chee has been denied basic legal rights
                                        such as legal representation and the right to cross-examine and present
                                        a defence. Every time he criticizes such unjust treatment he is sued
                                        for defamation, then fined huge amounts or sent to jail.<br><br>Singapore
                                        also muzzles the press. Local media is government-owned and foreigners
                                        have been harassed when they tried to report on such abuses.
                                        "International newspapers, the Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, Fair
                                        Eastern Economic Review, Time, the Economist, International Herald
                                        Tribune [and] Bloomberg have all been sued and/or prosecuted for making
                                        statements about these matters," Dr. Chee said.<br><br>Fortunately, a
                                        team of lawyers, led by Canadian law firm Amsterdam &amp; Peroff in
                                        Toronto, has been set up in order to help Dr. Chee defend himself in
                                        court and to embarrass Singapore before the world for its failure to
                                        uphold the rule of law. The team is headed by Bob Amsterdam (who
                                        defended Mikhail Khodorkovsky and other high-profile Russians against
                                        the oppressive Putin regime), U. K. defamation expert Anthony Julius
                                        (who represented Lady Di) and American law professor.<br><br>William
                                        Burke-White. "The Singaporean authorities are using the law to repress
                                        political rivals and as punishment," Amsterdam said in a phone
                                        interview from his headquarters in London. "It's a myth that Singapore
                                        is a democracy, a complete myth."<br><br>The team is going to help Dr.
                                        Chee represent himself in court and also intends to bring the injustice
                                        to the attention of the United Nations. They also plan to register the
                                        Singapore Democratic Party in their jurisdictions so that it may
                                        continue its work as an exiled entity.<br><br>On Thursday, Dr. Chee
                                        will have to represent himself, however. The Singapore court will not
                                        give standing to a foreign lawyer, and local lawyers have been
                                        frightened away from his case. There is no Legal Aid representation
                                        provided either. He knows he probably faces jail again because he
                                        cannot pay any more fines.<br><br>"I survive financially by selling
                                        books. I peddle them on the street. I was trained in academia but after
                                        I joined the opposition in 1992 I was sacked and since then nobody will
                                        want to work with me. They are frightened of guilt by association," he
                                        said.<br><br>He was fired by a member of parliament with the ruling
                                        party. "When I said my sacking was politically motivated, he sued me
                                        for defamation. I went to court, lost and the court awarded damages of
                                        US$350,000. My wife and I sold our house, car and everything to pay
                                        this fine," he said.<br><br>Another two defamation lawsuits resulted in
                                        US$400,000 in fines after Dr. Chee raised questions about Singapore's
                                        secret financial support for the corrupt Suharto regime in Indonesia.<br><br>"The
                                        significance of those cases was we didn't even go to trial. It was a
                                        summary judgment, decided by the judge in chambers without any right to
                                        cross-examine," he said.<br><br>"A third case in 2006 was a defamation
                                        lawsuit by former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew and his son, the current
                                        Prime Minister, over an article written in our party's newspaper. Fines
                                        were huge [US$610,000] and the judgment was delivered in the judge's
                                        chambers again."<br><br>When Dr. Chee criticized the result, the judge said this constituted contempt of court and jailed him for 12 days.<br><br>"I've
                                        been convicted on seven occasions already and have another nine charges
                                        outstanding. I can't afford to pay any fines so I will have to go to
                                        prison. The only way out is to leave, but if I leave the government
                                        wins and if the government wins the people lose. Singapore is my home
                                        and lack of transparency and accountability will simply result in huge
                                        problems down the road for my country and for my children."<br><br>"I
                                        hope to see democracies like Canada, the U. S. and others in the world
                                        pay attention to these matters before it's too late. Ultimately, their
                                        interests are going to be affected as well." <br><br><a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/columnists/story.html?id=09416cba-10e6-4a88-9c8b-af3d87727536"><em>http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/columnists/story </em></a></p>

              <p><strong>The interview in full</strong></p>
              <p><em><br>Q. Do you have a family and are you frightened of violence?</em></p>
              <p><br>A. “I’ve got three kids, 9, 6 and 4 and a wonderful wife. I do not feel in danger in that way."<br><br><em>Q. How do you survive financially?</em></p>
              <p><br>A.
                  "I sell books, peddle them on the street. I was trained in academia but
                  after I joined the opposition in 1992 I was sacked and since then I
                  haven’t been nobody will want to work with me. It's guilt by
                  association. I can't a lawyer to represent me for that reason too."</p>
              <p><em>Q. What international organizations are you contacting for help?</em></p>
              <p><br>A.
                  "Lawyers Rights Watch, the International Bar Association, International
                  Commission to jurists all have criticized and that helps because I want
                  the international community to realize the abuses."</p>
              <p><em>Q. Is the business/financial community also at risk by such court activities in terms of contracts and litigation?</em></p>
              <p><br>A.
                  “Ironically, there was a case here involving a Canadian co. Enernorth
                  which signed with a Singapore company. There was a dispute over
                  commercial matters, the matter settled in Singapore courts. Enernorth
                  was frustrated and appealed in Canada's courts, saying that Singapore's
                  courts were not impartial. But the Canadian court was not convinced
                  unfortunately. It's diffiult to get other jurisdictions to look into
                  this matter.”<br>"I want to alert the international business community
                  there are problems with the rule of law. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Singapore government
                  lavishes these companies. They operate tax free, can repatriate all
                  profits and Singapore keeps wages  very low. There is suppression of
                  wages because there are no independent labor unions. So companies love
                  Singapore and wouldn’t say anything to jeopardize their situation."</span></strong><br><br><em>Q. If Singapore drives your party into bankruptcy is there any opposition parties left?</em></p>
              <p><br>A. "The only opposition party that’s called for a reform of the system is ours. This is an offense against reforms."</p>
              <p>Q. <em>What is their strategy against you?</em></p>
              <p><br>A. Keep levying fines and lawsuits that I cannot pay and put me in jail for contempt.</p>
              <p><em>Q. What about the Singapore Strait Times and local press dissent?</em></p>
              <p><br>A.
                  "It's all biased. the media is owned by the government. The person in
                  charge of publications is the former deputy Prime Minister himself. The
                  internet is all we've got."</p>
              <p><em>Q. How many people live in  Singapore and how would you describe their form of governance?</em></p>
              <p><br>A.
                  "There are about five million, one-quarter are non-Singaporeans or
                  guest workers. It is a dictatorship. In the last 10 years half the
                  workforce has not gotten an increase in real wages. There are
                  significant layoffs and many homeless living on beaches, on the
                  streets, in government housing blocks. They don’t have a voice. There
                  are free food lines at temples and they are getting very long. This is
                  contrasted with the ministers of the government which are the highest
                  paid politicians in the world. The Prime Minister makes six times' more
                  than the President of the United States. And yet when we bring up these
                  matters -- no transparency which breeds corruption -- we get sued."</p>
              <p><em>Q. Why should the world care?</em></p>
              <p><br>A.
                  "Singapore is too small to register concern but look at China and
                  Russia. They are emulating and admiring Singapore as a model of an
                  autocracy that doesn't live by the rule of law. The world's democracies
                  should pay attention to the situation because it is catching on in
                  Vietnam, Burma, Latin America, Ukraine, India. Singapore is proposing
                  itself as an alternative to the democratic way of life."<br><em><br>Q. Are NGOs helping?</em></p>
              <p><br>A.
                  “Now and then. We are really hoping to at least be able to come up with
                  a sustained campaign whereby more information can get out to the
                  international community, try to get a network among the international
                  community. We have had some help from Canadian teachers unions and the
                  Canadian branch of Amnesty International.”<br><br><em>Q. What happened on June 2008 at the trial involving Lee Kuan Yew, former Prime Minister?</em></p>
              <p><br>A.
                  "We cross examined Lee Kwan Yew at that trial. He kept hiding behind
                  his counsel, the judge kept ruling all our questions irrelevant. In the
                  end, we were charged with contempt of court. It got so egregious at one
                  point that Lee brought in all his body guards, eight of them. They
                  barged into the courtroom, right in the middle of the hearing when his
                  son was on the stand. The door flung open. Justice should be blind to
                  the status of all litigants but here was the leader of Singapore. He
                  insisted that his testimony last through lunch and for only two hours
                  because he was busy. Then he left and the judge was fine with that."</p>
              <p><br>“We
                  said that was unforgiveable and then were convicted of contempt of
                  court. The judge came up with a ruling ordering us to pay both Lees
                  (father and son, past and current Prime Ministers) US$610,000. There is
                  no way I can personally or the other executives of the party but they
                  named the party as a defendant so they can move against the party and
                  push it into bankruptcy."<br><br><em>Q. How many members in your party?</em></p>
              <p><br>A. "About 40 or 50 people dare to walk with us in public."</p>
              <p><em>Q. Is autocracy a cultural matter?</em></p>
              <p><br>A.
                  "We were very democratic when we first became independent from the
                  British in the 1950s, but since the first prime minister came into
                  power he’s usurped the constitution and clamped down on everything for
                  the better part of the last half a century we’ve been this way. There
                  is no civil society, no opposition, no fundamental freedoms of speech,
                  assembly or media."</p>

              <p>Excerpts from Paul Krugman's article: <a href="http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/myth.html">The Myth Of Asia's Miracle</a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier;">&lt;Consider, in particular, the case of Singapore.
              Between 1966 and 1990, the Singaporean economy grew a remarkable 8.5 percent
              per annum, three times as fast as the United States; per capita income
              grew at a 6.6 percent rate, roughly doubling every decade. This achievement
              seems to be a kind of economic miracle. But the miracle turns out to have
              been based on perspiration rather than inspiration: Singapore grew through
              a mobilization of resources that would have done Stalin proud. The employed
              share of the population surged from 27 to 51 percent. The educational standards
              of that work force were dramatically upgraded: while in 1966 more than
              half the workers had no formal education at all, by 1990 two-thirds had
              completed secondary education. Above all, the country had made an awesome
              investment in physical capital: investment as a share of output rose from
              11 to more than 40<em> </em>percent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier;">Even without going through the formal exercise
              of growth accounting, these numbers should make it obvious that Singapore's
              growth has been based largely on<strong> </strong>one-time changes in<strong> </strong>behavior
              that cannot be repeated. Over the past generation the percentage of people
              employed has almost<strong> </strong>doubled; it cannot double again. A half-educated
              work force has been replaced<em> </em>by one in<strong> </strong>which the bulk of
              workers has high school diplomas; it is unlikely that a generation from
              now most Singaporeans will have Ph.D's. And<strong> </strong>an investment share
              of 40 percent is amazingly high by any standard; a share of 7O percent
              would be ridiculous. So one can immediately conclude that Singapore is
              unlikely to achieve future growth rates comparable to those of the past.&gt;</span></p>

              <p>Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel price in economics this year.<br> In essence, Singapore growth is going to plateau. But this is better than trying to force it to grow by adding foreign people and own population.Because it may work 1 generation, but after that, its turtle all the way down... <br><br>I am not an economist... will read his article in full when i have time.</p>

              <p>Let me just point this out here, US did NOT became rich and powerful because of Democracy.</p>
              <p> America itself is resource rich and have no immediate threats on its borders. It exploits other countries by paying worthless paper and debts for natural resources, and imposing regime changes on countries that refuses to take it.</p>
              <p>Notice that the happy democracies are all in Europe? And that Denmark also have fossil fuel resources? Why Scandinavia countries are so "happy"? Because they've got North Sea Oil to sustain its economy.</p>
              <p>We want democracy so we can avoid cronyism and nepotism in the system. To make sure more reasoned opinions can be heard. It will NOT reduce prices, but it will avoid spikes.</p>
              <p>Believing that democracy without access to natural resources will promise wealth and power is absure to the extreme. It is NOT a holy grail, it is simply a system just like communism and  theocracies. You cannot build a terrace house with just ice cream sticks.</p>
              <p>If we want a true healthy democracy, we need to understand that the price we must pay for democracy. Thinking that there won't be any price tag for it is precisely the immature mentality that will cripple democracy.</p>
