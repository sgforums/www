            <div class='col-md body'>Side tracking abit, but my view is that irregardless of whatever revolutionary changes to the language curriculums, the children in schools would only preceive such changes as mere shortcuts or easier routes towards getting better grade.<br><br>The prevaliant emphasis towards improvement in Education has always been based on extrinsic factors, such as curriculum re-structuring, teachers' training and developments, introducing and implementing more and more sidelining committies, programmes and activities for the students.<br><br>While the above can indeed help raise GRADES to certain extend, why has the intrinsic focus been largely left unfocused.<br><br>A child's personal interest remains the primary motivator for his/her own learning - be it a language, science or maths subject.<br><br>Learning takes place under both formal and informal settings.<br><br>Nobody needs to teach a child about BayBlades or Pokemons - they'll memorize everything about these cartoon characters simply because the children held an interest in them in the first place.<br><br>By using terms such as 'Mastery' or even worse, percentage-based breakdowns to vaguely assign how much 'portion' a language should be learned, this approach is certainly quite some way off apart from what the spirit and essence of true education should be.<br><br>Grades are good only when they are used as vague measurements for assessment on Learning.<br><br>They should be not used in the current continuing fashion as specific end objectives for Education no more.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that to many of us, to be effectively bilingual in both English and Chinese is very difficult, if not impossible. Even those who are perceived to be the creme de la creme in terms of languages, are not able to stand up against native speakers of English and Chinese.<br><br>I have taken pride on being able to speak, write and read comfortably in both languages. However, when I came to Japan to study a few years ago, I find that though Singaporeans' English are on the whole, much better than their Asian counterparts, we still sound incoherent in front of the native speakers, including both Americans and British. The same can be said for our Chinese. We have been too used to speaking a language that is sprinkled with phrases from the different languages in our daily life, that we forgot how to speak in one language alone. How many of us can say that we speak in purely English or Chinese/Malay/Tamil everyday?<br><br>However, knowing both languages is indeed a great advantage. Whenever, I meet other foreign students, I can speak in English with them.  Nevertheless, speaking in Chinese to the Chinese or the Taiwanese will elicit a more enthusiastic response since we share a common cultural background. Nothing beats a Chinese proverb or two in the conversations.<br><br>It is imperative that Singapore keeps its bilingual language system, though I must admit that without compromises, we will end up being proficient in none. Maybe it is indeed the way to go if we are to maintain our edge in this part of the world.</div>

But then, how much exposure do we have now?</div></blockquote>I guess that is up to individuals and family. Possibly the parents has the greatest influence over a child's language ability since th child tends to read and learn what the parents choose to teach as well as what the parents read themselves.<br><br>I do not believe learning an additional language is that difficult. Problem is usually the interest which directly influence the exposure. Unfortunately for children who's parent believe Mandarin is useless, they creates an environment which indeed makes it useless.<br><br>Like someone else said here, creating interest is really more important than forcing a child to learn the language. In fact, this applies to all subjects taught in School. In fact, I would even dare say that what is wrong with Singapore Education now is that in the attempt to make students to score that perfect 100, they kill the interest to learn each of those subject. Learning should be fun. It should never be about scoring 'A's. Isn't the buzzword "life long learning".<br><br>Anyway, I personally intend for my next generation to learn both lanaguages and I will teach at home what the school choose to give up in School. That is, at least, what I will be doing. I have benefited from knowing both languages and I intend to pass that benefit to the next generation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From young, my parents keep on saying Chinese must know Chinese, so I tend to focus more on Chinese. Actually it does not take much effort as I grow up speaking Mandarin at home or anywhere.  I entered a SAP school during primary school and there was no other races in the school. For my level, there was one Malay/Chinese pupil but she also took Chinese. I never got to know her as we were never in the same class before, so anywhere I go around in school, people all communicate in Mandarin except with the teachers.<br><br>Anyway Chinese swordfighting novels are good to read, therefore I ended up reading more Chinese books than English books after primary 5 or 6. In the end, now my English suffers.  Even though I know how to answer in English, I tend to ask or answer questions in Mandarin even if the other party is speaking in English.<br><br></div>

There is no such thing as 100% English, 100% Chinese."<br><br>give your point of views. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> </div></blockquote>i had to say i tried to balance both the lang. i tend to speak more in chinese than eng. a ratio of 7:3. however, i write and read more in eng. i also watch both sides of movies and tv programmes and listen to eng and mandarin music equally. this is how i balanc e the langs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by 01024G:<br><strong>From young, my parents keep on saying Chinese must know Chinese, so I tend to focus more on Chinese. Actually it does not take much effort as I grow up speaking Mandarin at home or anywhere.  I entered a SAP school during primary school and there was no other races in the school. For my level, there was one Malay/Chinese pupil but she also took Chinese. I never got to know her as we were never in the same class before, so anywhere I go around in school, people all communicate in Mandarin except with the teachers.<br><br>Anyway [b]Chinese swordfighting novels are good to read</strong>, therefore I ended up reading more Chinese books than English books after primary 5 or 6. In the end, now my English suffers.  Even though I know how to answer in English, I tend to ask or answer questions in Mandarin even if the other party is speaking in English.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>If you can read the traditional chinese wu xia xiao shuo, not the comic, your chinese is good; and if you enjoy reading it then I'd say your chinese is at a level probably above average singaporean.<br><br>What you need now is to read more english books, not read less chinese books.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What MM Lee said really puzzled me. Since he started the bilingual policy Chinese language has been taught as a second language and Chinese schools have closed. Only one out of seven or eight subjects was taught in Chinese, so, do we actually have a choice to decide which language to master?</div>
