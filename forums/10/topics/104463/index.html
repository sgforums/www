That said, I have taken a personal interest in brushing up on my Mandarin just for the sake of it.  I'd agree with robertteh that making of a subject compulsory is the easiest way of killing one's interest in said subject.

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that English will be a more viable language to learn. This is for economic and social and racial cohesion reasons perhaps. I believe that most of us can see that whenever we converse in our mother tongue, we inadvertently alienate our friends who are of different race. Furthermore, most of the subjects that we learn are written in English.<br><br>In retrospect though, it is viable to learn Japanese too..... it helps understanding some movies better  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well..I actually agree to this, I noticed that when I like English, I tend to hate chinese. Perhaps this could be due to the fatc that most of my friends prefer speaking to me in english rather than chinese. But ever since I started learning Japanese, I seem to have a sense of renewed respect for my chinese<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> So Perhaps it is possible to master both English and Chinese but if you are able to do that, you belong to the Bilingual Elite.</div>

But we don have the one to one tuition and we are often in environment where we have to speak chinese. So I really dont know if old man's experience is relevant to me.<br><br>The main problem with most of us is that we grew up thinking in english and we do mental translation when we speak chinese, that is difficult. Our parents used to think in chinese dialects and they also have problem learning english initially till they started thinking in english.<br><br>Gobemen likes to attach a number to everything. Language learning should be fun and fun cannot be measured by numbers. The fun in learning english and chinese are different as the culture are different and each should be allowed to develop in its own pace. How to say this is 60% and that is 40%? Is this percentage of usage or competency in the language? if you language competency is low then do you use more to improve otherwise this competency will drop further??<br><br>In europe, most people speak at least 3 languages, and english may not be one of the them. I think singapore should encourage the learning of all our official languages, including tamil and malay. There are also big economic value in these two languages as India and Indonesia economy improve.<br>In this case other races will not feel alienated.</div>

But we don have the one to one tuition and we are often in environment where we have to speak chinese. So I really dont know if old man's experience is relevant to me.<br><br>The main problem with most of us is that we grew up thinking in english and we do mental translation when we speak chinese, that is difficult. Our parents used to think in chinese dialects and they also have problem learning english initially till they started thinking in english.</div></blockquote>Agreed.  Studying a language in a sanitised classroom environment is not ideal - immersing oneself in a culture is the best way of studying a language.  Besides, the study of languages is much more than just learning how to read, write and speak the language - those are simply the doors to that culture's philosophy.<br><br>Also, the proportion of our time spent in English- and Chinese-speaking environments could well determine the percentage balance described by MML, creating a self-correcting mechanism.  After all, if you spend 80 percent of your time in a Chinese-speaking environment, being more than "20 percent English" serves little practical purpose.<br><br>Odd that you should mention thinking in languages, sgdiehard.  During my national service, I realised that I was thinking in Hokkien at one point. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I have always been more Chinese than English until I grow older when I work for the ang mo. But at that same time, I find that reading Chinese is extremely useful. I travel to Japan often now and am very very glad that, although I cannot speak Japanese, I can read almost everything in Japan.<br><br>Also, I was even surprised once when in Korea. At the time, although I am unable to communicate to a Korean in Korea and his English sucks, but yet somehow he knows how to write Chinese!! So, we communicated in Chinese Writing!! So, being able to read and write Chinese may be more useful than one may think. The east Asian countries seems to be heavily influence by ancient China culture.</div>
