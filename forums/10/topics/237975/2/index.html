In 2011, when another election comes, they will promise more things, and if voters still vote for opposition, they will get the brunt of this sort of rubbish.<br><br>While I don't deny the fact that upgrading does take time, why should the two estates with a significant number of elderly not getting the upgrades?<br><br><blockquote>As recent as 2004, CIPC funds have been allocated to Potong Pasir to the amount of $71,000 to build children's playgrounds as well as related facilities around it as proposed by the CCC.</blockquote>OK, fair enough.
