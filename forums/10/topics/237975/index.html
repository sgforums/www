            <div class='col-md body'>The Straits Times article on 15 Feb covers both lift upgrading and ramps for the handicapped, which are two separate issues. I believe the CIPC funds will cover the ramps in Opposition estates, but not the lift upgrading programme and I expect a clarification will come in time.<br><br>As a principle, I feel that Singaporeans who vote in the ruling party should benefit more than those who voted against them. Therefore I have no issue with the priority given to PAP constituencies for upgrading projects, a policy which had been rejected by the Opposition MPs.<br><br>On this matter of CIPC funding, I think the Straits Times report is not accurate. This matter had been raised in Parliament previously and the government has clarified that Opposition constituencies have access to and have benefited from CIPC funding previously. This is an excerpt from the SDA's website, since there are forumners here who do not believe in any government sources. This is a reply by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) in Parliament on 9 Mar 2006:<br><br>"Finally, Mr Chiam asked again and pleaded that the Government not be discriminatory against Opposition MPs with regard to CIPC funds.  Let me just reiterate again that the objective of CIPC funding is to improve the infrastructure, recreational facilities and general amenities of the whole constituency.  The budget is limited and is allocated to the Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs) based on the merits of the projects that they proposed.  This is because the CCCs interact closely with residents and are, therefore, in a good position to assess the needs of their residents.  In response to Mr Chiam's point that we are being unfair to the Opposition MPs because we give PAP MPs CIPC funds, <strong>we do not give PAP MPs CIPC funds.  CIPC funds are give to the CCCs to operate the proposed projects for improvements in the constituencies.  These projects are then presented to the CIPC Committee which will then evaluate the proposals.  Town Councils are responsible for the management and maintenance of the common areas in HDB estates.  So if Town Councils wish to put up their improvement projects in their estates they can do so using their Town Council fund.</strong><br><br>The Chairman:  Yes, Mr Chiam.  Please make it short.<br><br>Mr Chiam See Tong: Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary clearly knows that Opposition wards do not have grassroots.  In that case, does it mean that we shall never get CIPC funds at all?<br><br>Some hon. Members:  You have.<br><br>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman: <strong>I have not answered, but I think the House has answered on my behalf.  Sir, Opposition wards have got Citizens' Consultative Committees.  It is not true that Opposition wards like Potong Pasir have not received CIPC funding.  As recent as 2004, CIPC funds have been allocated to Potong Pasir to the amount of $71,000 to build children's playgrounds as well as related facilities around it as proposed by the CCC.  </strong><br><br>Let me reiterate again that the CIPC funds are for Singaporeans.  Mr Chiam mentioned earlier that Singaporeans in Opposition wards like Potong Pasir are deprived of the funds.  <strong>They are not deprived of the funds.  The CCC can put up the proposal, which they have, and it has been approved before.  So it is not right to say that Singaporeans who do National Service, pay taxes, living in Opposition ward, do not get what Singaporeans who live elsewhere can get.</strong>"<br><br>Therefore, it is up to the Opposition MPs to do some work and get their CCCs to propose plans to build ramps and other facilities for the elderly. They have access to CIPC funds if their CCCs will put up a viable proposal. Of course, this will not cover the lift upgrading projects, which Chiam had previously said he could fund</div>
