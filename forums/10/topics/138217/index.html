The figure for men was one per cent.<br><br>The origins of Singapore's sterilization programme lie, as with<br>India, in a visit from Margaret Sanger. In February 1936 she<br>advocated that family planning should be an essential part of the<br>state's public health programme. In 1944 the Singapore Family<br>Planning Association (SFPA) was founded. In February 1959, Professor<br>B. H. Sheares told Sanger's IPPF congress in New Delhi that<br>sterilization rather than birth control was the way forward for<br>Singapore. Sheares published his views in Singapore in June when<br>Sanger happened to be in the country to lend support. These events<br>coincided with the election of the People's Action Party (PAP)<br>government, which proclaimed its support in July. By 1965 the<br>Ministry of Health had taken over all responsibility for family<br>planning from the SFPA. It became the sole executive agency for<br>family planning, and had the power to take over the functions and<br>seize the assets of any other family planning agencies. The State<br>became the sole authority with control over fertility.<br><br>The Government published a white paper on family planning in 1965, at<br>a time when there were only 5,000 sterilization 'acceptors' per<br>annum. By 1969 Prime minister Lee Kuan Yew had pushed through bills<br>legalizing abortion in 'voluntary' sterilization. The sterilization<br>bill became increasingly liberalized. At first it applied to women<br>with six or more children. By 1972 it applied to women with two<br>children, or to women with only one child if there were sufficient<br>medical, therapeutic or environmental grounds. From 1974 the law was<br>amended to include any woman who was either married or over twenty-<br>one.<br><br>In a speech in support of the 1969 acts, Lee expressed the<br>degenerationist's support for eugenic policies, both in terms of<br>raising the quality of racial stock and in reducing public<br>expenditure on welfare programmes:<br><br>One of the crucial yardsticks by which we shall have to judge the<br>results of the new abortion law combined with the voluntary<br>sterilization law will be whether it tends to raise or lower the<br>total quality of our population. We must encourage those who earn<br>less than $200 per month and cannot afford to nurture and educate<br>many children never to have more than two. Intelligent application of<br>these laws can help reduce the distortion that has already set in ...<br>we will regret the time lost, if we do not now take the first<br>tentative step towards correcting a trend which can leave our society<br>with a large number of the physically, intellectually and culturally<br>anaemic.<br>The 1969 sterilization act set up a five-man Eugenics Board to<br>authorize sterilizations. While it included two doctors, a social<br>worker and one 'other', it was chaired by a district judge. With the<br>final liberalization of the law in 1974, the Eugenics Board was<br>disbanded, and authority for all sterilization decisions was vested<br>in individual doctors.<br><br>In 1969, there were 14,000 sterilizations in Singapore. In 1970 this<br>increased to 24,000. The numbers increased steadily and by 1973 the<br>annual figure was 93,000. This trend continued to a peak in 1976 of<br>99,000 sterilizations. Saw Swee-Hock describes the typical profile of<br>sterilized women in 1976: ' 86 per cent were Singapore citizens and<br>85 percent were not working, presumably performing home housework.<br>About 81 percent had practiced birth control either at the time of<br>sterilization or previous to that, and almost all of them, 97<br>percent, were being sterilized for socioeconomic reasons such<br>as "financial difficulties" and "family completed". As high as 70<br>percent had their sterilization performed during the postpartum<br>period and another 19 percent during the post-abortal period... Some<br>92 per cent of all sterilization operations were performed in<br>government institutions.'<br><br>The financial elements of Lee's eugenic plan are reflected in<br>Singapore's policies of incentives and disincentives. These are<br>designed to motivate people 'voluntarily' to limit their families to<br>two children or less. Each is, in reality, a coercive policy designed<br>to motivate sterilization 'acceptance'. (1) Maternity leave. In 1973<br>the government withdrew the right to paid maternity leave for the<br>delivery of third and subsequent children. Within the Civil Service,<br>the conditions are modified so that maternity leave for third and<br>subsequent children is paid, provided the woman agrees to be<br>sterilized at delivery. Alternatively, seven days un-recorded paid<br>leave is offered to male and female civil servants for the purpose of<br>accepting a sterilization operation.<br><br>(2) Accouchement fees. From 1969 these had been progressively raised<br>for second and subsequent children. In July 1975 they were raised as<br>follows:<br><br>Birth order Class of hospital ward<br>A B C<br>1rst child $300 $120 $60<br>2nd child $360 $180 $90<br>3rd child $420 $240 $120<br>4th child $480 $300 $240<br>Subsequent $480 $360 $300<br><br>The significance of these figures is that the proportionate increase<br>is highest in class C wards, i.e. those used by the poorest patients<br>who are least able to afford the increase. The ' stick' of<br>increasingly higher fees is matched by the 'carrot' of sterilization.<br>Ward fees for classes Band C are waived if either husband or wife<br>agrees to sterilization within six months of delivery. Ward charges<br>for class C patients are reimbursed upon application after<br>sterilization. Another aspect of this policy is that women expecting<br>their third or subsequent children are not entitled to free antenatal<br>care, but are charged $10 per visit.<br><br>(3) Income tax. In 1973 the government announced that $750 tax relief<br>would be granted for the first and second children, with $500 relief<br>for the third. Fourth or subsequent children do not qualify for any<br>tax relief. As Saw notes, 'By comparison with the measures<br>incorporated in maternity leave and accouchement fee, the tax relief<br>measure has a wider and more lasting influence because it applies to<br>all payers with children and penalizes those affected every year in<br>their tax returns instead of just once.'<br><br>(4) Housing. Prior to 1973 housing was allocated on a points system,<br>with higher priority given to those with larger families. Deciding<br>that this policy encouraged fertility, the government modified the<br>rules so that families regardless of size had equal priority in<br>housing. Rules regarding sub-letting were also revised, so that only<br>families with three or fewer children were allowed to sub-let rooms<br>and earn extra income. This policy had the effect, again, of<br>penalizing most those who could least afford the penalty.<br><br>(5) Education. Prime Minister Lee places a very high value on an<br>educated Ã©lite. A keen supporter of the British class-based system of<br>public schools and admission to the universities of Oxford and<br>Cambridge, Lee created model schools in Singapore during his first<br>years as Prime Minister. In 1973 his government introduced new rules<br>for admission to the superior ' Primary One' places in certain<br>schools. The first three children were to be eligible, but the fourth<br>would not be eligible unless one of the parents 'agreed' to be<br>sterilized. A series of complex amendments were made to this rule,<br>some of which resulted in arbitrary inequalities, quite apart from<br>being coercive.<br><br>Saw noted that the measure penalizes parents retrospectively since it<br>applies to parents who had their children many years ago when such a<br>rule did not exist. Parents affected by this measure have to send<br>their fourth and subsequent children to less desired schools, apart<br>from the daily trouble of sending them to different schools from<br>their first three children. Among all the measures, this measure<br>appears to be the only one that imposes a penalty on the children<br>directly by depriving them of being with their brothers/sisters in<br>the same school, and all the inconveniences that go with it. But the<br>measure does act as a deterrent to some couples thinking of having a<br>fourth or higher parity children.<br>The immediate outcome of giving priority to children whose parents<br>were sterilized was that in 1975 there was a conspicuous rush by<br>parents, more often than not the mother, to undergo sterilization in<br>order to take advantage of this new ruling.<br><br>...In the 1975 registration exercise many children of old boys or<br>girls, staff and parents who had direct connections with the schools<br>were not given places in the good schools of their choice. Instead,<br>these schools, particularly the mission schools, found they had a<br>sizeable number of pupils who were complete 'strangers' to the<br>schools but were admitted on the basis of their parents having been<br>sterilized.<br><br>(6) Work permits. Foreigners who earn less than $750 in Singapore are<br>obliged to register with the ministry of labour for a work permit.<br>Since 1973 guest workers wanting to marry a Singapore citizen and<br>take up permanent residence were required to obtain the permission of<br>the Commissioner of Employment. Many applications in the 1970s were<br>rejected, and thousands of guest workers were expecting children out<br>of wedlock. In 1976 the government introduced a rule where by<br>permission to marry (and, importantly, access to social services like<br>health care) would be granted provided one member of the couple<br>agreed to be sterilized at the birth of the Second child. Failure to<br>comply could result in the withdrawal of all of all benefits,<br>including the work permit. The family would also be denied access to<br>housing, education and health services.<br><br>Lee's eugenic programme has probably been one of the most effective<br>ever undertaken. The birth rate in Singapore dropped from 6.5 per<br>woman in 1957 to 1.9 per woman in 1977. Within twenty years his<br>programme has put the country on course to exceed zero population<br>growth and achieve negative population growth. One figure that the<br>government does not like to quote is that a 1973 survey revealed that<br>more than 46 per cent of married women between the ages of fifteen<br>and forty-four disagreed with Lee's two-child policy, believing that<br>they should be allowed to have more than two children if they wished<br>to.<br><br>Meanwhile, new incentives are introduced, such as Lee's scheme to pay<br>the dinner bills of courting- couples of the right social and<br>intellectual attainment - a positive eugenic policy to help create<br>a 'superior' race.</div>
