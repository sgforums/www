            <div class='col-md body'>HE was looking ahead to a bright future, planning to work part-time while studying for a business degree.<br><br>--CRYSTAL CHAN<br>And his parents had high hopes that he would soon be able to take care of them.<br><br>Today, Jeremy Tan, 23, lies in a vegetative state in hospital, with doctors giving him little chance of ever recovering.<br><br>He was two months from completing his national service (NS) when he suffered permanent brain damage in a mystery fall, most likely from his third-storey room, at the Seletar Camp nine months ago. (See other report.) His parents have found it hard to come to terms with the tragedy.<br><br>THREW AWAY PHOTOS<br><br>His mother, Madam Hor Hong Kiow, 45, hates to be reminded of what her only son looked like before the incident.<br><br>So much so she threw away all the photographs of Jeremy in happier times.<br><br>Madam Hor, a shop cashier, did not want to be interviewed, but her husband, Mr Tan Kian Lee, spoke about her grief.<br><br>'In the first few days after Jeremy was hospitalised, my wife cried as she looked at photos of our son when he was healthy,' he said.<br><br>'After that, she could no longer bring herself to look at the pictures so she threw almost all of them away.'<br><br>Mr Tan managed to find one picture of Jeremy and his sister Chia Min in their childhood and keeps it in his wallet.<br><br>And these questions keeps buzzing in his mind: How did Jeremy fall? Why did he have to become a vegetable?<br><br>There were no witnesses to the fall and Jeremy is in no condition to talk.<br><br>He said in Mandarin: 'We know life must go on but we'll never have peace of mind until we know what happened.<br><br>'We were hoping that our son could care for us after he finished NS. But now, it's the other way around.'<br><br>The family's nightmare began at 7.30pm on 3 Aug last year.<br><br>Mr Tan, who is unemployed, was watching television with Chia Min, 17, when he got a call from the Singapore Armed Forces.<br><br>He was told that Jeremy had been found unconscious and bleeding from his head in Seletar Camp.<br><br>COULDN'T STAND UP<br><br>Speaking to The New Paper in his three-room Jalan Dua flat, off Old Airport Road, he recalled: 'I was so shocked I couldn't stand up and my daughter had to support me.'<br><br>The family rushed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and saw Jeremy, a polytechnic graduate, lying in bed with tubes poking out of his body.<br><br>A neurologist told the Tans he was in a vegetative state and would need to be cared for the rest of his life.<br><br>'We cried our hearts out when we saw him like this.<br><br>'He was perfectly healthy, but after the fall, he's incapable of doing anything,' said Mr Tan.<br><br>Before the tragedy, Jeremy used to jog and do standing broad jumps every day.<br><br>Madam Hor became depressed and now suffers from insomnia.<br><br>Mr Tan said: 'Sometimes, she tells me to get a baby boy for her because she considers that she has lost a son.<br><br>'I'm praying hard that nothing will happen to her because she's the sole breadwinner.<br><br>'I won't know what to do if she loses her job.'<br><br>The family visits Jeremy every day, hoping for a miracle, although doctors have told them he will not recover.<br><br>They wipe the sweat from his head and say encouraging words like: 'You'll get well soon.'<br><br>OPENS AND CLOSES EYES<br><br>But Jeremy, who can open and close his eyes, only stares at his family.<br><br>Mr Tan said Jeremy hoped to sit for the Scholastic Assessment Test and study for a business degree at the Singapore Management University.<br><br>'He talked about working part-time to finance his education. He also hoped to do some small business as he thought he would earn more than a salaried worker.'<br><br>Mr Tan said his son, who has a business diploma from Temasek Polytechnic, is single and has a cheerful personality.<br><br>Adding to their pain are unkind remarks from some people.<br><br>'One relative told me, 'You must have owed your son a lot in your previous life. That's why you're repaying him now in his present life,' ' Mr Tan said.<br><br>'One neighbour told me that I must have done some bad things, so my son's tragedy is retribution.'<br><br>Chia Min, who is close to her brother, was affected by the tragedy and failed her O levels last year. Mr Tan said she did not have the heart to study hard after what happened.<br><br>Said Mr Tan: 'Only one person is physically hurt but three people are emotionally hit.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just look at situations like this, and you can see why stupid policies in place, have no place for unfortunate people like them!<br><br>Left to fend for themselves so much that they need to be on local papers. Who's actually supposed to be responsilble for their predicament???<br><br>Can you make a guess???<br><br>===============================================<br>Family worries about money woes<br>May 12, 2006<br><br>HIS son's medical expenses have come to more than $35,000, Mr Tan Kian Lee said, showing The New Paper the hospital bill.<br><br>--CRYSTAL CHAN<br>The total amount of subsidies is not known. Mr Tan is worried about how he can pay for the continuing care that Jeremy will need.<br><br>Even after Jeremy is discharged, he will need medication to prevent cramps in his legs and relieve his digestive problems. He also needs medicine for his recurring fever.<br><br>Mr Tan estimates that all the medicines would cost about $100 a month.<br><br>'We also need to buy things like diapers and feeding tubes as Jeremy can neither go to the toilet or feed himself,' Mr Tan said.<br><br>'I would also need to hire a maid to help me as I need to rest too.<br><br>'That means spending almost $1,000 every month.'<br><br>As Madam Hor earns about $2,000 a month, the family is not considered to be in the low-income group. So they do not qualify for any welfare schemes.<br><br>Mr Tan, who used to be a cleaner, said he has been unemployed for two years after his employer went out of business.<br><br>Mr Tan also said he has high blood pressure and suffered a heart attack in 2001.<br><br>Every month, the Tans spend $1,170 on utilities, medicines for Mr Tan's hypertension and transport fares and other expenses for Madam Hor and their daughter.<br><br>To cut expenses, Mr Tan is thinking of cancelling his daughter's mathematics tuition, on which he spends $150 every month.<br><br></div>
