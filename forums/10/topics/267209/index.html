So it is too early to say that government is omnipotent or all too powerful. In the face of nkf it has lost some shine of its seeming omnipotence. The real test as regards its paying its ministers any salaries it like has not come yet but sooner or later there will be fault line or break point.<br><br>This break point is where more wrongs are being exposed like the intense profiteering schemes by HDB and URA which are not even disclosed in the annual budget in the gst increases. So it is too early to say who is in charge and will finally decide who call the shot. Singapore is still a young country and has not matured politically on the overriding need of government to serve the people.</div>
