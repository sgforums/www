            <div class='col-md body'>Australia will not punish Singapore over hanging-PM<br>By Michelle Nichols and Jan Dahinten<br><br>CANBERRA/SINGAPORE, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Australia will not punish Singapore over the planned execution of an Australian drug smuggler, Prime Minister John Howard said on Thursday ahead of protests around the country to oppose the Dec. 2 hanging.<br><br>Howard rejected calls by a prominent government politician for the hanging of Nguyen Tuong Van, 25, to be taken into account in the Canberra government's deliberations on whether to grant Singapore Airlines access to the Sydney-Los Angeles air route.<br><br>Australia has unsuccessfully pleaded for clemency for Nguyen -- convicted by Singapore of smuggling 400 grams (0.9 lb) of heroin from Cambodia. He was arrested while in transit at Singapore's Changi airport.<br><br>Amnesty International plans to hold protests against the execution around Australia during the next four days.<br><br>Nguyen's hanging comes as Australia finalises a review of its aviation policy that includes considering whether to grant Singapore Airlines , the world's second-largest airline by market value, access to the trans-Pacific route.<br><br>"I don't support linking the two things and they won't be linked. That would not be in Australia's interests, it would not be good policy. The Singapore Airlines issue is a separate issue," Howard told Australian radio.<br><br>Howard was responding to a suggestion made by government backbencher Bruce Baird, who heads the Australian parliament's Amnesty International group, earlier on Thursday.<br><br>"I'm not saying it should be made a condition, I just think it is one of the issues that should be taken into consideration," Baird told Australian radio.<br><br>Australia's Qantas and bankrupt U.S. carrier United Airlines, part of UAL Corp , are the only airlines offering direct flights from Australia to the United States. Discount carrier Virgin Blue also wants U.S. access.<br><br>Howard has also dismissed calls for trade sanctions to be imposed on Singapore over the case. Human rights campaigners have suggested Australians boycott companies linked to the city-state, but such a campaign does not appear to have taken off.<br><br>NO CLEMENCY<br><br>Rob Hulls, Attorney General for the state of Victoria who flew to Singapore to plead for the Melbourne man's reprieve, said on Thursday he had been told by the government that all avenues to stop the execution had been exhausted.<br><br>Hulls met a junior government minister for 20 minutes on Thursday and later spoke to Nguyen's mother and his brother at Australia's High Commission -- a meeting which he described as the toughest one he has ever had.<br><br>"It was very difficult to explain to them that the Singaporean minister I met today is of the view that he doesn't believe there is any further grounds to review the clemency petition," he told reporters after spending an hour with the family.<br><br>"We had a sandwich, we had an orange juice, we had a chat. It's very, very difficult ... when you're sitting with a mother whose son is about to be executed."<br><br>Hulls said the death penalty or caning of convicts -- a common punishment in Singapore for offences ranging from vandalism and immigration violations to drug crimes -- were "not punishments that belong to a 21st century justice system".<br><br>Australian Greens leader Bob Brown called on Thursday for Canberra to suspend an agreement allowing Singapore to station military forces in Australia, which Brown said included an entire basic jet training unit and 12 Super Puma helicopters.<br><br>"The hypocrisy of Singapore's huge investments in Burma, one of the world's biggest exporters of illegal drugs, while shrugging off Australia's requests to commute Van Nguyen's sentence to life imprisonment cannot be ignored," Brown said.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">NO PROVE DON'T SAY SO MUCH LAH ! AUSTRALIAN ! GO BALI AND RAPE GIRLS AND LITTLE BOYS NEVER SAY !</span> </span><br><br>Nguyen's mother, who met Howard last week, and his twin brother are visiting him daily ahead of his execution. Australia has said Nguyen was carrying drugs to help his twin pay off debts to loan sharks.<br><br>Australia asked for clemency on the grounds that Nguyen had cooperated and could be a witness in future drug cases.<br><br>Howard said he would not raise Nguyen's case at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Malta this week.<br><br></div>
