In those days, lions will rule over the rabbits or any lesser beings.<br><br>Today, guns, bombs, fighter planes, blue-water fleets, submarines, satellites, missiles, IT, automation, internet and technologies will knock out anyone trying to be a lion telling the rabbits about his power. Times have changed but have our lions changed.<br><br>In our case we are still talking about lions trying to rule with all kinds of hype about rhetorical lion leadership. We are talking about academic qualifications and grades when the basics and fundamentals of success are entrepreneurship and broad-based knowledge application. All the hypes about academics and pure education is not going to get us anywhere. It is application of knowledge by every citizen that counts for job creation and ultimate success. If government leaders do not get a quick update the economy is not going to get anywhere competitive. Talking about old theories of study and pure education is not going to make much difference. After all these years we have produced so many more educated elites and scholars and the economy remains stagnant and directionless. So it is not good corporate governance to only talk theories any more.<br><br>Basics are changing and applications of knowledge is to be promoted. Give everyone the equal opportunity to do as he can and all will be well. Only when you understand your new challenge can you give rise to good or competitive governing or results.<br><br>So dear Leaders, wake up. People know more about leadership. They want high-level of management excellence and good corporate governance to motivate all to succeed not creating more surpluses for the government or make the few leaders or elites richer and in control of them for nothing.<br><br>We have too many educated people. Leaders are people given a chance to do a job. Leaders have to know their duties and responsibilities to do a good job for the new Singapore. Try to do a good job to motivate all so that you will get their support. Stop talking down on them as if they are kids and need you to tell them what is sacrifice or good ideas.<br><br>Just produce a low-cost and value-adding new economic re-structuring fast and create jobs for every unemployed and new job entrants. Don't go on talking too much. Make things work and get results or else you will lose the confidence of people this time round.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another illustration to defend the government's obsession with elitism. LKY once said that elitism is what got Singapore where we are today. Seems he cannot get over the notion of elitism that he was brought up with under the British colonial masters. Cannot blame him: he studied in RI and Cambridge...his upbringing reinforced his notions of class distinction.<br><br>The government must realize the world has moved on. Education is no longer restricted to the privileged few and egalitarianism, not elitism, will characterize Singapore in the twenty-first century.<br></div>
