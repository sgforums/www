In a way, he was not totally wrong in pushing for his own rewards to keep up with what is happening in GLCs and the public sector's method of self-rewards.<br><br>SBS therefore has to keep raising their fares at the expense of the public commuters and tax payers because of such self-reward schemes instituted through corporatization under the Goh Keng Swee doctrine - push up salaries to upgrade the economy to value-adding model.<br><br>Major mistakes have been made by our political leaders in assuming that Singapore public sector was underpaid not knowing that by the 1980s, public sector sinecure managers who do not worry about profits or where the funds are coming from were paid three times that of equivalent positions in the private sector.<br><br>A Car Park division director was paid more than S$10,000.00 pm when private car park operator could only pay their equivalent manager only S$5,000.00 pm at the most.<br><br>So if you want proof, we do have plenty. Look at teacher's pay of S$8,000 pm as compared with adjunct teacher (relief) of S$100 per day.<br><br>The whole salary scheme for public sector has been screwed up on some wrong assumptions of the past and yet our leaders do not want to admit such fundamental errors of government.</div></blockquote>This is one of the strategy of the ruling party in controlling of all major businesses,  to reward its officials and winning more votes......... the persons in these organisations will also affect and influence thier friends, relatives and who ever!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[reply to a posting in youngpap.org.sg on 1.2.2007]<br><br>People have been conned by the elites in their making of salary comparison with the private sector. Their comparison has been selective to give a lop-sided picture so as to enable them to claim for higher salaries and rewards. There is no apple-to-apple comparison at all.<br><br>Because of such self-rewards by the elites coupled with the general lack of accountability and transparency in their top-down system of government, it is the citizens who finally end up suffering from all kinds of higher fees and charges which are regularly adjusted upwards to pay for these highers salaries and bonuses to the elites in the government, GLCs GST, higher HDB flat prices, higher utilities, etc.<br><br>That is why we end up with NKF CEO and many blue-eye boys in GLCs paying themselves with connivance of their board multi-million salaries and bonuses to no end.<br><br>Our leaders were seen openly supporting these CEOs' self-rewards calling them peanuts as seen in the aftermath of NKF bomb-shell disclosures of extragavant self-reward malpractices.<br><br>Examples include HDB staff who were paid S$8,000.00 - S$15,000.00 pm almost three times the private sector building managers (paid S$3,000.00 - S$5,000.00 pm who have more skills and who make more decisions and take more risks as compared with HDB multi-tier staff who are doing mundane works.<br><br>More examples are teachers who are paid S$8,000.00 pm as compared with adjunct teachers teaching alongside them with better results and creativity who are paid pittance of only S$100 per day.<br><br>These elites make selective artful comparisons to push for their own salary increases and promotion. They cleverly avoided making comparison who others who are paid lower salaries in private sector and governing bigger countries with greater responsibilities whereas our ministers are only concerned with mere taxing and cost-recovery.<br><br>For example, where some CEOs are paid higher, it is because these ceos were entrepreneur investors who have invested their own monies in the business and shareholders approve their higher salaries because of proven performance or invention of a certain successful products which create jobs for Singaporeans. But once their companies are not performing they will lower their own salaries or suffer losses.<br><br>In the case of government and civil servants, they do not invest their own moneis in the business. They just collect fees and taxes and use them to spend on whatever they need and even stinge on spending them to provide needed services and instead only accumulate them like NKF as surpluses to claim success so that they could pay their own higher salaries and bonuses and even retirement benefits by the millions.<br><br>The same malpractices are being carried on in the GLCs where ex-civil servants were seconded and given high-sounding positions like CEOs and paid multi-million salaries copied from highest paying jobs in the private sector.<br><br>Is there an apple-to-apple comparison in copying private-sector salaries of entrepreneur investors into the ceos of GLCs funded by public taxes and fees?</div>
