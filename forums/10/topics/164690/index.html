Why ? they are complaining that singapore does 320 million trade while Australia does only 27 million ! If they so right then they would have 0% trade !!! dealing with them is still dealing with them, regardless of percentage !!!<br><br>Anyway there are 2 choice , one you bring the whole god damn army in , and invade the country and tell the poor farmer that you invaded their country to stop him from growing opium , which is his priced crops and only means of living since you boycott or sanction all other stuff . Yep he will join the damn terrorist or grow more opium.  Bravo way to go with the australia idea !!!<br><br>The other way is like what other countries in Asia &amp; Singapore. Try to engage it into trade and other business, offer that country other mean and open more ways to the people way of earning money instead. You thing sanction or other blockage will work, in fact it only force the poor farmers and folks to be more dependent on growing opium . Only by encouraging their economy and offering alternative which is what Singapore &amp; other Asia government is doing , but it works .</div>

What you want to do, invaded Burma and return her to power? She has not been strong enough to hold her post, thus the country may be throw into civil wars and chaos, yes that is the so call freedom at all cost !!!
