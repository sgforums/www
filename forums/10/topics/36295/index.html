Water supply is expected<br>to be restored by Friday at the earliest, making this the worst water<br>crisis to hit the city which have to  endure a daily shortage of 157.5<br>million litres.  By tomorrow morning, taps are expected to run dry in<br>the Central Business District and nearby residential areas which<br>are dependent on the Sungai Johor water treatment plant<br>supplying 30 per cent of Johor Baru's water needs.<br><br>The affected areas are Johor Baru City, Jalan Nong Chik, Jalan<br>Kolam Ayer, Jalan Tun Razak, Jalan Tebrau, Taman Perling,<br>Taman Universiti, Bandar Baru Uda, Larkin, Kg Melaju Majidee,<br>Kempas, Kebun Teh, Tampoi, Pandan, Permas Jaya, Taman Mt<br>Austin and Taman Johor Jaya.<br>The main pipeline leading from the treatment plant burst when a<br>landslip brought down tonnes of earth from a man-made hillslope at<br>Taman Puteri Wangsa's Puteri Park development at about 7.20pm<br>yesterday.The force of the tumbling earth bent the exposed<br>pipeline some 45 degrees, causing it to break and leak its high-<br>pressured contents.<br><br>This required SAJ Holdings Sdn Bhd (SAJH), which manages the<br>water treatment plant, to shut down the controlling valve and cut off<br>the water supply before the surrounding area became submerged.<br>Measuring 1.5 metres in diametre, the pipeline was one of four<br>running over a ditch which served as a drainage system for the<br>construction site. The three other pipelines belong to Singapore's<br>Public Utilities Board.<br><br>It is not immediately known what caused the landslip as Johor Baru<br>had been experiencing clear weather for the past two days.<br>A site check by the New Straits Times today saw excavators<br>operated by the project developer unearthing the pipeline which<br>had been completely buried hours before. SAJH civil engineers<br>were also present to assess the damage.<br>SAJH corporate communications manager Azmi Mahmood said<br>contingency measures have already been taken to alleviate the<br>suffering of residents and businesses who have never experienced<br>a water supply disruption of this magnitude.<br>"Residents have yet to feel the impact of the mishap since our<br>major tanks servicing the residential areas have a storage capacity<br>lasting 24 hours," Azmi said at the site of the landslide.<br>Measures include installing static tanks at strategic areas and<br>deploying water tankers to residential areas once every 24 hours<br>until the water supply is restored in stages.<br><br>Private tankers have also been deployed to distribute water to<br>people in stricken areas, bringing the total number to 30. There will<br>be additional tankers servicing these areas as and when the need<br>arises.<br><br>"We are working round-the-clock with the developer to repair the<br>pipeline and restore water supply as soon as possible," he<br>said. "We are taking all the necessary measures to improve the<br>situation which resulted from unforseen circumstances."<br>Azmi said residents can call SAJH's 24-hour hotline at 07-2224222<br>should they face problems in obtaining water during the crisis.</div>
