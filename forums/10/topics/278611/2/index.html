Just compare a 5-room flat built in the early nineties with a 5-room flat built since 2000. The difference in size is very obvious, especially if you look at the living room. In the past there wasn't even such a thing as a Civil Defence shelter within a flat, but now there is, and it's counted as a room!<br><br>d) The only change I see in the transport system is that the MRT stations are being transformed into shopping centres, which has nothing to do with the business of transporting people.</div>
