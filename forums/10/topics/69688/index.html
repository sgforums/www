            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>If they are serious about a language must not be just in school but in daily routine life.</strong></blockquote>Yes. Basic words of wisdom, it might even be a cheng yu. You are the best at something because you are familiar with it by practicing it everyday. All our subjects are in English, except for Chinese. How the hell are we expected to do well in CHinese then?<br><br><blockquote><strong>the mandarin speaking and the angmo speaking may not mix freely, but they may all haf the common passion for the chinese culture. and this culture is wat shapes one's values and principles, and is more impt than the lang one speaks. </strong></blockquote>Yeah they dont mix, they should not mix. Chinese people dont talk to me by choice, unless impelled to by compulsion. I dont agree on both races having passion for Chinese culture. Chinese culture, as of right now, is boring, because it is not glamourous as western culture. If you want something to be interesting and liked by everyone, you need publicity, you need mass media portraying how cool it is.... e.g after LAST SAMURAI, more people will be cool about Japanese culture. But given Singapore's limited creativity in the film industry, i dont believe it will be possible to glamourise Chinese culture... unless we have a hollywood movie about China.</div>
