Assisting them were experts from Subaru, international motorsports group Prodrive and New Zealand's Possum Bourne Motorsport.<br><br>'We took two weeks to complete the first car, and nine days to complete the second,' said Motor Image chief executive Glenn Tan, explaining that processes are being fine-tuned to prepare for full-scale production.<br><br>'Full-scale' here means around five cars a month for a start; and 10 to 15 every month in the near future, said Mr Tan.<br><br>Not exactly mass production, but a small step towards rekindling a car assembly industry which Singapore abandoned more than 30 years ago.<br><br>The Government seems thrilled. Economic Development Board (EDB) director of logistics and transport Manohar Khiatani said: 'We are delighted that the cars are being built in Singapore. It also demonstrates the unique role that Singapore can play in the automotive design and engineering landscape in the region.'<br><br><strong>Mr Khiatani's department has been wooing automotive groups to set up shop here.</strong><br><br>Mr Tan said it is working with the EDB on a 'training grant'. It is also collaborating with the National University of Singapore on research and development.<br><br>The Singapore-assembled rally cars - not meant for street use - are based on the Subaru WRX Spec C model. Each costing around $25,000 before tax, the cars are stripped down completely and rebuilt.<br><br>The rear seats are removed to accommodate reinforced steel bars; up to 300 points around the body and chassis are rewelded for extra stiffness; the transmission gets a new clutch; and the engine is made to conform to 'Group N' racing rules.<br><br>Group N cars are standard production models governed by a set of motorsports rules for its modifications. They are used for competition, mainly in rally racing, and have a limited capacity of 2,000cc.<br><br>'We put in close to $100,000 worth of work into each car,' Mr Tan said.<br><br>Each vehicle is likely to be sold for $145,000, without registration fees, to car enthusiasts, weekend racers or pro racers.<br><br>The cars will go on an Asian roadshow after the Nov 9 to 19 Singapore Motorshow.<br><br>'We have got a lot of inquiries, but we wanted people to see the completed cars before taking orders,' said Mr Tan.<br><br>Motor Image is the region's biggest Subaru agent, with franchises in seven countries.<br></blockquote></div>
