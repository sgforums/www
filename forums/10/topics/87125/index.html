            <div class='col-md body'>I am telling the story I knowÂ….  Whoever having different views are welcome to comment:<br><br>Apr 2003:<br>Mr. Goh Chok Tong blamed China for Â“importing SARS into SingaporeÂ”, as a PM from a Â“friendlyÂ” nation.<br><br>Apr 29, 2003:<br>During Asean meeting on SARS, Mr. Goh Chok Tong let our premier Wen Jia Bao wait for 5 mins, which is considered very unfriendly and impolite in all diplomatic situations. When our premier suggested establishing a SARS fund, Mr. Goh Chok Tong rejected it. Mr. Goh Chok Tong claimed, aftering closure of  Asean Meeting in Thailand, that it took China at least 2 to 3 years to overcome SARS and he suggested that Do Not put all eggs inside same basket. We all know now, what he said was not true. He is hitting China when we were down.<br><br>May 2003:<br>Mr. Goh Chok Tong cancelled official trip to China due to the fear of getting SARS, while French PM and Indian Defense Minister did not. I am sure he is not a poltroon, but just an excellent businessman whoÂ’s good at grasping chance to insult China.<br><br>We saw what a Â“friendlyÂ” nation has done to us so far, and none of us made a sound.<br><br>May 18, 2003<br>Mr. Goh Chok Tong claimed that Singapore would like to share the lessons during the SARS and donated some thermal cameras to China. In deed, we have developed such equipments and put them in use. Any way, we accepted as a gift from a friend and we thank Singapore for giving hand.<br><br>What was coming next was SingaporeÂ’s DMPÂ’s Â“un-official and privateÂ” visit to Taiwan. None of leaders in this world has paid such a Â“un-official and privateÂ” visit to Taiwan except Singapore at this critical point of time. None of them, including those nations that established Â“officialÂ” relationship with Taiwan.<br><br>Claiming that unofficial and private sounds to me like saying that, Â‘hi, man, I am going to hit you on the testicle, but donÂ’t worry, it is unofficial and private.Â”<br><br>As a Chinese who always view Singaporean as brothers &amp; sisters coming from same ancestors, I would like to ask, are all these supposed to be done to China by a Â“friendlyÂ” Singapore? We take Singapore as a friend, but what has Singapore done to us?<br><br>Singapore friends, please put yourselves into our shoes and think about it. I understand that it is probably the case that Singapore DMPÂ’s visit to Taiwan might be driven by United States behind the scene. However, it is absolutely unwise for Singapore to be involved in Taiwan Strait. It is a bloody chess board on which three parties are playing, namely United States, China and Taiwan. On this chess board, even testing water pays its own price. It is none of SingaporeÂ’s business, after all. China has been a good friend of Singapore for 14 years and we appreciate this friendship so far and forever. We wish you could understand our concern and do not try to get chestnut from fire. I hope you can realised the point that China will take Taiwan back at whatever price. It is for sure.</div>
