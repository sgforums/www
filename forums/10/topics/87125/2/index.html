            <div class='col-md body'>Before we progress any further, I've to make my stand clear. I am not anti-China. As an oversea Chinese,<br><br>I am proud to see that China is able to sent a shuttle to space<br><br>I am proud to see the Chinese team play in the World Cup<br><br>I am proud when they win medals in the Olympics<br><br>What irks me is China's stand on Taiwanese issue. They threaten  to use force all the time which I think is uncivilise and barbaric. If China is a democratic and developed Taiwan will be more than happy to reunite with China.<br><br>East and West Germany were two independent countries separated by ideology but were united eventually without bloodshed. I sincerly hope Taiwan and China can follow their example.<br><br>By the way you still have not comment on the Tainanmen issue.<br><br>......and you don't have to reply to every post if you don't want to.

An incident happened last time when i was attending a wedding dinner. Upon reaching there, i accidentally stepped onto a chewing gum. Must be from someone that smuggle it in coz chewing gum is banned in Singapore. Then with the chewing gum stuck on my shoe soles, and i went in the hotel with the sticky sound and feeling as i was walking inside. I think this got nothing to do with a country democracy.</div>
