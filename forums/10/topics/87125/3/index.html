Yes Chinese only has got 3000 years WRITTEN history. But Chinese existed already for at least 5000 years.

Yes Chinese only has got 3000 years WRITTEN history. But Chinese existed already for at least 5000 years. Although i am living in Singapore, but my forefathers are from China, that means my ancestors were all from China last time. Although I am a Singaporean, but i won't forget my roots. I have elder relatives living in Hainan island which is my forefather's hometown and my father is still writting letter back to stay in contact. </div></blockquote>if you talk about the existence of chinese.. maybe you can get back to 10s and thousands years back.. not only 5000 years ago.. the recoginized human being's history  is only based on language record.. that is the only evidence when u talk about a people's history.<br><br>also i am doing the same thing as your father is doing..</div>
