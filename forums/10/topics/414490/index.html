            <div class='col-md body'><p>While the Singapore government preaches religious tolerance, I find it disconcernting in recent years that some government bodies or statuatory boards are celebrating spiritually negative festivals like Halloween. Will there still be any respect for the individual boundaries of individual employees especially when it goes against their religous belief or will they be "forced" to participate. I personally think government bodies should maintain a neutral stand to be fair to all. By celebrating festivals like Halloween, it is sending out a message that it is ok to do so although it goes again some religion. Am apalled at the sad state of our society.</p></div>

              <p>I don't agree with your logic. The singapore government is not supposed to behave like a commercial body. In this case, the religious tolerance that it is practicing is a double standard cause they are causing their own employees to do things that goes against their religious belief. And turning a blind eye to such things going on right under its nose just because it is "profitable"? Where is the intergrity of our government then. Where is the respect for individual religious boundaries. I feel sad that things have to come to this. Then my trust in the intergrity that our government preach is sadly misplaced.</p>

              <p>I think you are shifting the subject matter. The issue is it ok to force people to do things that goes against their religious beliefs. Yes or No. Overzealousness has nothing to do with it. Just like some Muslims wear the Tundung and some don't. You can't force a person who wears the Tundung to remove it saying he/she is overzealous. Just like some Christians like to pratice Feng Shui which is against the bible and they use all kinds of reasons to justify it. The question I repeat here again is it even ethical that you force people to do things against their religion?</p>

              <p>Do I even have to justify my position to you? I'm answerable to God not man. Instead of asking me so many question, why don't you just answer my questions whether you think if it is right or wrong? What is your religion and what is your stand then? Stop trying to answer my question with one of your own please. If you have nothing constructive to contribute then please keep your peace.</p>
