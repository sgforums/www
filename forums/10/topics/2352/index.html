            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore has indicated its interest in the JSF program since 1999, when it signed along with Israel and Turkey a Letter of Offer and Acceptance to be a Tier 4 (FMS major participant) participant in the JSF program. Singapore has already donated $3.6 million to the JSF effort. We definitely are getting JSF to replace the F-16s, however, the JSF is not a contender in the current competition to replace the A-4s as the JSF is still too early along in its program.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thats IF its ever going to be ready. Its so bloody obvious that initial entry into service date is WAAAAYYY too optimistic, and already insiders say that the projected cost per aircraft is going to be 40-50 million USD per piece instead of 30-40 million, and thats AFTER factoring in economies of scale. The requirements of each service are so widely varied, its going to end up almost like 3 different aircraft for the USAF, USN and USMC rather than the same aircraft, with only minimal commonality. The last time the services tried to have a common aircraft, the USAF hijacked the entire program and got the F-111.<br><br>Lets not get too excited about the JSF guys...the whole damn program might get axed altogether</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It will NOT get axed for a couple of reasons:<br>1. Axe it, and America will have no plane to sell for the next 40 years, essentially giving<br>2. Axe it, and they will piss Britain off, big time. They are quite unilateral, but they know better than to piss off they staunchest ally.<br>3. The war in Afghanistan has produced a wonderful spinoff- the huge military budget increase. There's money enuff for the JSF program now(after goddamned Clinton starved the military. I hate him not for his adultery, but his blatent lack of concern for the military budget)<br>4. Axe it, and the Marines might just bomb the White House :-) (they need to replace the AV-8B soon)<br><br>Now, why take such a cynical view of the JSF program? Granted, it has to fulfil pretty demanding criterias, but during the F-111 saga, computer aided design technology had not advanced to a stage possible to meet the demands from each service. The Services are much more well-behaved this time.(not pushing its requirements unnecessarily) Now, its very possible, and to do it economically too. It will be on budget. That's the most important criteria, and the JSF team has already demonstrated to the services that its possible. IOC date of 2008 is ambitious, considering a couple of still-maturing technologies used on the JSF, but not unfeasible, especially whrn they are using a phased approach to the JSF's introduction. The first JSF's will have more basic capability, with succeeding blocks of JSF being introduced being increasingly capable, until they become the all-up JSF.</div>

Furthermore, the Netherlands and possible most of the current F-16 operators will take up F-35. I can almost certainly be sure that RSAF will take F35.
