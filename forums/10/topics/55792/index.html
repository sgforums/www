            <div class='col-md body'>Wednesday's - 27 August 2003 - Headlines in the Straits Times screamed that<br>" <strong>Singapore Wage Cost Burden is heavier than in the US</strong> " .<br><br>Surprisingly, the report only concentrated on the wages of the Singapore Workers but did not mention that Singapore <strong>POLITICIANS</strong> and <strong>MINISTERS</strong> have their wages bigger than those paid to <strong>US President and US Politicians</strong>.<br><br>While it was great to <strong>artificially forced wages </strong>to go up throughout the 1990's - so as to achieve the Swiss Standard of Living - somehow it was lost on the Government that Singapore Wages will outprice ourselves from the world.<br><br>Has the Singapore Government forgotten the purpose of Higher Wages during 1990's - (besides achieving a Swiss Standard of Living) ?<br><br>Have they forgotten that it was to force the Labor Intensive Industries to quit Singapore, and to force factories to retrain our Singapore Workers to take on <strong>HIGHER VALUE WORK </strong>?<br><br>What has happened to all those glorious plans ?<br><br>Workers have been convinced to accept Companies cut to Workers' Pay so as to save jobs. Workers also have accepted retrenchment - or "restructuring" - to save the jobs of other fellow workers.<br><br>Now, despite all the brilliant plans cutting into Workers interests, the ultimate sacred cow (that belonged to LKY's 40% CPF Rate) is being offered to be slaughtered - yet the Singapore Government remained tight fisted in pump priming the economy, which the Malaysian Government had done 6 months ago that resulted in Wednesday announcement that Malaysia's ecnomy had a 4.9% growth during the second quarter of 2003.<br><br>Yet the Government held on to the various price increases in public transport, hospital fees, utility charges, telephone charges - until another surprised discovery has made us out to be higher than USA or Hong Kong or Timbuctoo. Until then, the Singapore Government might as well milk the Singapore Citizen Bulls and Cows until the milk runs out.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Wage cost burden heavier than in US </span></span></strong><br><strong>Quoting a Perc global survey, Deputy PM Tony Tan tells why it is urgent that costs are brought down through CPF rate cuts </strong><br><br>By M. Nirmala<br><br>SINGAPORE'S workers have become more expensive than those in the United States and Australia, according to an international survey.<br><br><strong>LABOUR COSTS </strong><br><br>Grade<br>Japan 8.5<br>South Korea  6<br>Hong Kong  5.56<br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Singapore 5.5</span> </strong><br>Taiwan 5.33<br>US 5.07<br>Australia 4.8<br>Malaysia 3.9<br>Indonesia 3.33<br>Vietnam 3.33<br>Thailand 3<br>India 2.8<br>The Philippines  2.67<br>China 2<br>Grades range from zero to 10,with zero being the lowest cost possible and the the highest<br><br>Source: PERC<br><br>It shows Singapore is not just ahead of developing countries but also developed cities such as New York and Sydney.<br><br>This 'alarming' situation worries Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan, who brought it up yesterday to show why the Central Provident Fund (CPF) rates must be cut swiftly and substantially.<br><br>The survey issued by the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (Perc) firm on July 2 shows that on a scale of zero to 10, with zero being the lowest labour cost country, Singapore stood at 5.5, the fourth highest among 14 countries surveyed. This puts it ahead of the US (5.07) and Australia (4.8 ) .<br><br>'To me, this is a profoundly important statistic. It's a simple one but it gets to the nub of the problem. We have priced our labour out of the market,' Dr Tan told reporters, elaborating on a speech he made later at a dinner to celebrate the 35th anniversary of Sembawang Shipyard and its employees' union, and National Day.<br><br>He made it plain he was not expecting workers here to match the cheap wages of China and India or those of neighbouring countries.<br><br>'But it is crucial that we do not price ourselves ahead of developed countries which are also our competitors in the global market,' he said.<br><br>He acknowledged that obtaining a correct reading of the economic situation was difficult.<br><br>However, a meeting in June with US businessmen in New York led him to realise there was something amiss here. The Americans were confident of a resurgence in their economy but back home, he found companies continued to retrench.<br><br>'There was something more than the Sars' impact or other transitory factors. It must be a structural factor.'<br><br>The Perc report crystallised the problem: high wage costs.<br><br>Its labour cost index is derived from a survey of expatriates working in Asia, asking them to rate the country's labour cost. The finding is checked for consistency against its data on other labour costs.<br><br>The Perc survey also looked at overall costs of doing business, prime rents and utility costs, and Singapore did relatively better.<br><br>As Dr Tan pointed out, measures are in place to ease other business rigidities: Corporate tax will be cut to 20 per cent by 2005, many government charges have been cut or removed, and land prices are kept affordable.<br><br>The need now is to remove the rigidity in wage structure - the CPF rates, said Dr Tan.<br><br>It makes companies less flexible because it is 'a tax on cash flow'. By lowering it, more money is immediately available to keep companies viable, thus saving jobs.<br><br>'We have no choice but to reduce our CPF rates substantially and quickly if we want to save jobs,' he said, echoing similar calls made on Sunday by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.<br><br>Mr Goh had said the current 36 per cent could be lowered to possibly 30 per cent.<br><br>Yesterday, Dr Tan said: 'The more substantial the cut, the more likely you don't have to make another cut down the road.'<br><br>He assured Singaporeans of help: 'No Singaporean will lose his or her home or be denied medical care because of the cut in CPF. We will help Singaporeans to meet their mortgage payments.'<br><br>Poor families will also get aid for daily needs, he added.<br><br>Dr Tan's call for a CPF cut was supported last night by Mr M. Ramasamy, president of the Sembawang Shipyard Employees' Union.<br><br>He said: 'It's for our survival and we should have done it much earlier.'<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,206710,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,206710,00.html?</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Look, US federal government have very large reserves in their bank.<br><br>If current US government wanted to raise taxes to the people, they have strong opposition political parties to resist the move. Our government don't don't have that power of resisitance or to oppose. Every bill and act just pass like doctors faking MCs.<br><br>Look at Singapore. We have to raise taxes to pay for our government's bureaucracy-choked administration and its deficits here and there when evr we have an economy downturn. The federal US government all it needs to do is to withdraw a bit of reserves from their own bank, hence the people don't need to pay taxes as much. Thus the better ratio between their wages and cost of living. They are afterall a long-established nation but Singapore is younger. Very much younger.<br><br>It is not exactly about the wages that bother Singaporeans. It is the amount we have to pay for our cost of living using our wages.<br><br>Apart from the nonsensical people who says I don't have current money for cashflow beause I am asset rich with all the 5 or 6Cs I've got.<br><br>The rest of the Singaporeans who take buses or MRT are struggling.<br><br>That's why you see Singaporeans making a big fuss out of our mass transit fees, ERP fees, CPF and others.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Generally, the step they took is to show the world that Singapore is doing something to stop the rot in local economic. But they are kinda short sighted.<br><br>Reformative of wage structure, Wage cut, deduction of CPF, lowering Company taxes and income taxes dun at all help to shape things up. Rather, it is adding burden to it citizen; like us.<br><br>Most of our monthly salary/CPF is use to settle bills and housing loans. With the above like wage restructuring, wage cut, deduction of CPF was like adding kilos onto tons that was already on our shoulder. Our government turned blinded to the facts that it needs two hand to clap. If they are really out the help us, they should too lower our daily expenses at the same time ie, transport, all those stupid unnecessary taxes, daily expenses (food); generally the living standard in this island.<br><br>Sometime i really dun understand what those politician are thinking or are they being manuipilated by others behind the curtian? How is it possible to lower citizen wage but at the same time maintain the current living standard.<br><br>How many percentage of citizen gain from the company/income taxes rebate? Just a handful!!! And for that, they raise the GST to offset their lost. What is this? Just like their left hand pass you a bowl of rice and their right hand snatch it back from you.<br><br>One more thing, aint CPF our money. Why they say cut mean cut? Although, the cutting part is from the employer potion, but it is still our money, isnt it? What is the rational for the employers' potion of the CPF? Shouldnt they understand the rational before doing anything to it?<br><br>Richer will gets richer, by stepping over the poor!!!! Our economic will get unbalance, should the wage reform was implemented with CPF cut. The 1st option in my mind now is if possible, get out of this island.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now I'm no economist, but I really have to question the logic of the Perc survey, if its done the way which I think its done, ie. by comparing the wages of one country across the board vs that of another country.<br><br>Now my question is: Isn't it unfair to compare wages this way? Australia and US might be developed countries, but a large proportion of their workforces are employed in the agricultural and other low-paying sectors. Would it be fair to take into account the wages in, for example Iowa, South Carolina and North Dakota when comparing the wages in Singapore vs the US as a whole? I don't think so.<br><br>Wouldn't a comparison with countries like Singapore (eg Taiwan, Japan and HK), with small land areas, relatively high population density and highly urbanised people, seem to make more sense?<br><br>Just goes to show that you can use a set of statistics to skew a conclusion anyway you want it.</div>
