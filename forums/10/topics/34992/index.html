            <div class='col-md body'>Port subsidies disguises competitiveness<br>THE much-vaunted port privatisation policy in Malaysia may have sent its first distress signal.<br><br>Recent reports that the Malaysian government is considering direct financial subsidy to ports is an ominous sign that all is not well in the aggressive stance adopted in promoting private sector investments in ports.<br><br>Ports that blazed the trail in diverting container traffic away from Singapore amid pomp and fanfare, are said to be seeking financial assistance from the government.<br><br>In fact, one of the major ports is understood to have secured cash subsidies while another is known to be busy trying to make out a case for itself.<br><br>The move for the government to come to the aid of private sector investors in distress in the transport sector is not without precedent.<br><br>The government decision to take over the capital investments made by the private sector in the development of the urban light transit system, the monorail, and taking over the privatised national airline are persuasive examples of the priority it places in protecting transport infrastructure investments.<br><br>Arguments advanced for subsidy by the ports are not unbelievingly simple: As they are an instrument of the government's policy to redirect trade away from Singapore, it is the responsibility of the government to see to it that they are not financially distressed (even if the situation was brought about by themselves through price distortion).<br><br>Although recent attempts have been made to revise the port tariff, the shipping industry - the liner sector in particular - has warned that it may not be a good time.<br><br>Several liner shipping companies are counting huge losses - the Singapore-owned Neptune Orient Line, for instance, recorded losses topping US$330 million (S$574 million) last year, while closer to home, Malaysia International Shipping Corp noted a loss of about RM150 million (S$69.5 million) in its liner sector.<br><br>Current market reality dictates it may be inopportune. Singapore, which has lost a substantial share of its market to the Malaysian ports, is fighting back.<br><br>Taking the threat to its economic lifeline seriously, last July, the cash-rich Singapore port slashed its charges - by as much as 50 per cent for transshipment traffic - in a bid to stop the migration of shipping lines to Malaysian ports.<br><br>Under the new discount and incentive package by PSA Corporation, customers will be granted an across-the-board additional 10 per cent rebate on all bills at PSA Corp's cargo terminals.<br><br>PSA Corp also slashed by half the charges on empty container handling, which is understood to account for 15 per cent of its local container handling. It is expected that the one-year cuts will amount to about $300 million.<br><br>PRICE OF FOOLISHNESS<br>PSA Corp also announced brand new 'customer-focused' flexibility, which its customers said would give them better longer-term negotiating leverage, including the much-talked-about offers of dedicated berths through joint ventures or long-term leases.<br><br>Shipping lines in Port Klang said the initiatives by Singapore to slash its rates and the offer of new terms have narrowed the differences with Malaysian ports.<br><br>The ports, which are most pressured to raise the tariffs, are those that gave unprecedented discounts, priding themselves as the cheapest in the world. With the price now being paid for the generosity, government subsidy is being sought to defray their foolishness.<br><br>Subsidy, while not entirely objectionable to promote specific national or strategic agenda or policies, may raise important questions over national port policy objectives and direction.<br><br>Financial subsidy has an in-built deficiency and brings with it an inherent weakness to market economies as it distorts prices and encourages inefficiency and wastefulness to the economy.<br><br>Financial subsidy may, in this specific case, disguise competitiveness of the ports and ultimately, financial subsidy may benefit only foreign shipping lines and cargoes of foreign countries that are transshipped at the local ports.<br><br>Why should the benefits of the financial subsidy go towards a Chinese or a French shipping line that transships Indonesian cargo to Japan at the local ports? Should Malaysia subsidise the handling of Indonesia exports, or from Thailand, India?<br><br>This Ports World article was carried in the New Straits Times on Feb 3.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PSA container volumes up 28%<br>SINGAPORE'S PSA Corp, operator of the world's second-busiest container port, said yesterday that it moved 28 per cent more containers through its local and overseas terminals last month compared to a year ago.<br><br>In the face of stiff competition on its home turf from regional competitors such as Malaysia's Port of Tanjung Pelepas, which has drawn away Danish shipping line Maersk Sealand and Taiwan's Evergreen Marine, PSA said throughput at its Singapore port rose 5 per cent to 1.38 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) compared to the corresponding period last year.<br><br>However, the bulk of the growth came from PSA's network of terminals around the world, which saw container throughput surge 118 per cent to 727,000 TEUs. PSA has 14 port projects in eight countries: Brunei, Belgium, China, India, Italy, Korea, Portugal and Yemen. --Reuters<br><br>looks like there are 1 winner (PSA) and 3 losers (PTP, Maersk and evergreen) ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
