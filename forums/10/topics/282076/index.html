            <div class='col-md body'><br>This article smacks ckearky of government propaganda!<br>Intent on psyching us all into Padi-field Cows that ploughs the fields till they die...!!!<br><br>===========================<br><strong>Don't let fake study go to your HEAD<br>Net report that early retirement leads to longer life is a hoax<br>By Leong Ching<br><br>September 26, 2007  </strong><br><br>THE 'study' sounds logical and is seductive - quit earlier, live longer.<br><br>Reason: Less stress.<br><br>A complex title and a string of academic qualifications after the authors' name seemed to add credibility.<br><br>But Optimum Strategies for Creativity and Longevity by Sing Lin, who has a PhD, is a hoax that has lasted long and travelled well.<br><br>It emerged again on Sunday, forcing no less than Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to expose the hoax in his dialogue with 500 grassroots leaders.<br><br>The 'study' was cited by a member of the audience to question the wisdom of delaying retirement.<br><br>The 'study', which claims to have been conducted on Boeing employees, is illustrated with a chart showing that people who retired at the age of 50 had an average life span of 86.<br><br>People who retire at 65 lived only till 66.<br><br>'An important conclusion from this study is that for every year one works beyond age 55, one loses two years of life span on average,' it said.<br><br>At the dialogue, PM Lee was quick to debunk the myth. 'I can tell you for sure that it is not true... there is no such study. It's a hoax.'<br><br>Ms Cham Hui Fong, NTUC's director of industrial relations, read it with amusement.<br><br>'It was a practical joke which has been circulating for many years! Somehow, many tend to believe that if you retire and relax, you will live longer.<br><br>'It does not and cannot mean that if one does not work at all, he will live forever.'<br><br>Ms Cham has been in the labour movement for 16 years and is not easily taken in by such surveys.<br><br>She was nominated to be an MP by the union movement and is known for her fiery speeches as an NMP.<br><br>CONVINCING LOGIC<br><br>But, for the ordinary man, there is a beguiling logic to the arguments of the fake study.<br><br>It said: 'If you are not able to get out of the pressure cooker or the high-speed battleground at the age of 55, and 'have' to keep on working hard until the age of 65 or older, then you probably will die within 18 months of retirement.<br><br>'By working very hard in the pressure cooker for 10 more years beyond the age of 55, you give up at least 20 years of your life span on average.'<br><br>Stress has been blamed for a wide range of health problems - from ulcers to cancers.<br><br>Instinctively, people feel that they will lead a 'better life' if they did not have to wake up to a high-stress job every morning.<br><br>That dream scenario would have been a life like Mr Gerard Ee's when he retired young - at 56.<br><br>But that retirement lasted two weeks. He returned to 'work' - but without a salary.<br><br>The former accountant from Ernst &amp; Young was appointed the chairman of the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) at its lowest point when its former CEO TT Durai stepped down in July 2005.<br><br>Today, he still oversees the now-thriving NKF and also chairs The Third Age, an organisation for seniors.<br><br>'My retirement from E&amp;Y was purely contractual,' he said. 'After 30 years as a practising accountant, it was time to move on and do other things. Thus, retirement is not 'stopping' and certainly not ceasing to 'live' to one's fullest.'<br><br>But not many people have the luxury of stepping out of the corporate life like him.<br><br>Would workers have a better life if they took a job with less stress, with a smaller title and smaller pay?<br><br>Mr Ee said: 'This is a major issue and will remain one until people adopt the paradigms of the 21st century. It is not the title but rather what is it that you have - a competitive advantage - over others.'<br><br>You are paid according to the value you produce.<br><br>Mr Ee pointed out: 'A brilliant 70-year-old who can produce millions in profit in equity trade will be paid accordingly and be in great demand by the fund managers.<br><br>'A 40-year-old engineer who has not kept up to date with the latest processes will be paid yesterday's wages and be easily replaced by the younger engineer who is more up to date.'<br><br>The accountant in him said: 'It is a simple formula - no one gets paid for nothing. Thus, first determine how much money you want or need - then there is a price to pay.'<br><br>The price, he said, could be in different ways - less time with the family, more stress at work, and for the unfortunate few, poorer physical health.<br><br>Perhaps the best thing the 'Boeing hoax' can teach us is that while the facts are wrong, the principle of work-life balance is an important one.<br><br>Ms Cham said: '(This applies) not just to older workers but everyone. The older ones will probably appreciate a better balance after spending so much time at work.<br><br>'But to retire totally can be trying for some who prefer to phase in gradual retirement.'<br><br></div>
