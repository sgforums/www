The petitions are signed by over 1000 signatories at the front of Burmese Embassy.<br><br>4 SDP members were taken by plain clothe police in 2 vans.<br><br>posted by uncleyap at 2:11 PM  </div></blockquote>This arrest thingy is expected and was alredi a foregone conclusion. The 5 of them knew what wud happen to them and yet they went ahead. Just 5 of them standing in the rain carrying placards was easy to bundle up the police van. Wonder what it wud be if there are 50, 500 or 5000. The full Tactical Police Force will have to be activated!<br>To me, the 5 made a peaceful demo. They did not do anything to harm people, destroy things or property, nor did they take anything from anyone. This demo has no criminality other than 'legality'. To those who knew law or studied law - legal is what the law-makers make. Prostituition is immoral but can be legalised! Kissing in public is showing affection but can be criminalised (in some Muslim countries). So gathering of 5 is illegal assembly - why 5? Why not 2?<br>The arrest yesterday has political overtone, the law was used to make it legal to arrest a non-criminal, non-violent, non anti-social activity.<br>In this respect, I look at the 5 who made the public demo against the junta in Burma as a show of support for the repressed people of Burma, not just TALK!</div>
