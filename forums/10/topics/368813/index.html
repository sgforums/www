              <p>Dentist pain in Oz PR renew.Son &amp; daughter r OZ citizens cant help!!</p>
              <p>SG dentist,wife and son of 21 years old (yo )(who just finished SG National Service</p>
              <p>in Mar 2009.read below.) were refused to renew their OZ PR status.Their 13 yo son and 16 yo daugher are Oz citizens.The 13 yo son has been studying in SG and intended to start Oz education in early 2009.(read my 2 nd post).</p>
              <p>The 16 yo daughter has been studying in SG RI 6 years programme.</p>
              <p>The couple PR were first granted in 1994,but they stayed very short in Oz.</p>
              <p>Every country can do what they like in migration matters.</p>
              <p>SG ICA is also famous for some strange decisions.</p>
              <p>So,be careful.Ladies and gentlemen.Why a mess if u cant be with your kids</p>
              <p>if they stay in Oz?</p>
              <p>Migration ,if goes wrong ,is very painful.Many pple think a move when the situation in SG looks bad.Think carefully.If u cant make a living in a place which u are damn familiar,do u think u can be better in a new place?Also,u are not the</p>
              <p>majority race there.See how SG pple treat FT then u know,eg pple</p>
              <p>from PRC.same race but different language also suffer.</p>
              <p>Not to mention u have different color.</p>
              <p>I suggest u read migration cases decisions here to prepare for the worst.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>In the past years, we were compelled to<span style="color: #ff0000;"> stay back in Singapore so as to be
              there for our mothers after both our fathers succumbed
              to cancer</span>. Much as we
              would love to, the financial burden we carried from the previous economic
              downturn had prevented us from making
              more trips to Australia. But we always
              knew we would be returning to Australia one day. As the children grew up and
              beginning to
              have minds of their own, we could sense the day was coming closer.
              When we were finally relieved of our financial commitment several
              months ago, we
              immediately went to book flights to travel to Adelaide and Melbourne in Nov08
              during the school holidays.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The purpose of the trip was primarily to check out Melbourne (it appeared to
              be a popular destination for our Singaporean friends
              who migrated to Australia)
              to see if we would be comfortable residing there and to check out schools for
              our children. David and
              Dorcas are keen to go to school in Australia especially
              after interaction with our friends' school-going children in Melbourne. We
              concluded after the Melbourne trip that we would prefer to return to Sydney
              where we had resided previously. We are more comfortable
              and familiar with
              Sydney, and it is also where we have a strong support network of friends.</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p>Upon returning to Singapore from Melbourne on 29Nov, the letters dated
              26Nov08 from the Australian High Commission in Singapore were
              waiting to inform
              us that our application for the five-year Resident Return Visa had not been
              successful. We did a fresh application
              on 5Dec08 for the five-year Resident
              Return Visa indicating<span style="color: #ff0000;"> that we had started to take action towards progressively
              returning to
              Australia over the next couple of years</span>. In support of the
              application, we submitted our email exchanges with the Registrar of Covenant
              Christian S<span style="color: #ff0000;">chool in Belrose NS W which confirmed that the school has a place for
              David in Feb09 </span>and we would proceed to prepare the
              paperwork for the
              enrolment.</p>
              <br>
              <p>By 8 Dec 08, we had successfully enrolled David for Year 9 at Covenant
              Christian School to start school on 2 Feb 09. David, turning
              14 on 1 Feb 09, is
              too young to be on his own and he is very much dependent on his parents for care
              and nurturing. Because of the
              nature of my job, I am able to relocate to Sydney
              at a much shorter notice than Toong Sing. Therefore, David and I will leave for
              Sydney on 29 Jan 09.</p>
