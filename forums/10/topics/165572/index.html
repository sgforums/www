Personally, what do think of our opposition parties? </strong>[/b]</blockquote>Our opposition parties have been run to the ground being pummelled with frequent defamation law suits that overwhelmed the most hardened souls like JBJ. The whole media propanganda is being used to discredit them.<br><br>We have a crop of promising politicians like Tan Liang Hong and Francis Seow and CSJ  but they have been exiled and the existing ones are too mild and controlled who dare not raise any good and objective arguments except the stereotyped ones so as not to get into troubles. Through some kind of reverse psychology they would try to pretend that our existing oppositions are alive and well.<br><br>Actually they were hardly any news about the opposition MPs so as not to promote them. This state of political freedom is partly due to the fault of the people who easily believe their propaganda to discredit the oppositions like CSJ until the people frequently echo what the press are saying about him. This is how powerful brainwashing by the press can do to the people.<br><br>The leaders talk about inclusiveness and openness but our political freedom and process are dismally oppressive and people still do not understand.<br><br>If they want to be inclusive they should start with freeing up the whole political process from liberalizing the press to dismantling the GRC or allow proportional representation to make the change.</div>

Do we need scholars only?<br><br>Lim Kim San - the masterbuilder and media czar<br><br>http://www.singapore-window.org/sw00/001205aw.htm<br><br>"That's why we will never get another cabinet like the one Lee had," he says. "We had various qualifications and backgrounds. That's what makes a good cabinet, not just 1st class degrees."<br><br>But bottom line, what does Lim really think of his old mate, Lee Kuan Yew? Some whisper that Lim, like other "old guard" leaders Toh Chin Chye, Ong Pang Boon, Jek Yeun Thong and Devan Nair, is sour toward Lee for the way he always insisted on being No. 1. The talk goes that Lee was lucky to catapult straight into the premiership since it suited his talent for oratory, vision, and strategic thinking. Had he needed to deal with the nuts and bolts of running a specific ministry, he might have come a cropper. If Lim shares this view, he keeps it to himself. Publicly, he says that without Lee's leadership, Singapore "would probably be like a third-world country now."</div>
