            <div class='col-md body'>Subject: Farmer and his loyal cows<br><br>Long time ago in China, there lived a little farmer who was very well-off in his town. He immigrated to a foreign land because he wanted more for his life. In the new land he arrived at, there were many cows who also have travelled a thousand mile from their far away homeland where they were poor, there were drought,famine and death where they came from. Some cows had died on the way, some died trying and left offspring and some made it to this land. The farmer being experienced in farming being to round up all the local cow and promised to make life better for them and their offspring. That one day the land will be filled with greens pasture and crops sufficient to feed their offspring and next generation. They can grow and be fatten in the land that together they will be build. So the cows worked...<br><br>The farmer make them worked the land and it produced crops which benefited the farmer. Season by seasons the farmer harvest from the land that the cows have work very hard on. The cows suffered but never lost hope in the promise that the farmer had made. The cows believed that the land will be better for their offspring than where they came from. The harvest was good and brought good wealth to the farmer that he came rich and quickly brought fame to himself. Sudden his neighbours begin to notice his success, while some praise him for his good skills, some envied the farmer and his cows with hatred. The farmer wanted establish his fame in the neighbourhood so he wanted to built himself a monument to commemorate his success, to show off to other and his family back in China. So he sold all the harvest to have someone built him a huge twin white domes besides the river to beautify the farm. But he forgotten to keep the harvest for the next sowing season so he took from the feeds for his cows...<br><br>The farmer was also very impatient man, he thought why not also milk the cows so he can supply to The Diary Company and earn more returns from diary products sold. So the farmer invested in "Campbell Product Factory" milking machines because he thinking the cows are working to slow and the land is not producing enough money to built his monument and further more the farm need to grow faster. So the farmers sold the idea to the cows. He milked the cows and promise that the milk will be made into cheese, cakes and diary produced that can be kept for the cows and their off-spring. They can use it when the cows are old or can work no more on the farm. But the farmer could not resist the delicious diary product that was create using these milk and he began to eat off their produce and sold some to earn more...<br><br>After sometime, the farmer was not happy and wanted more because his neighbour farm just got bigger. He thought to himself, the farmer next door has cows and brown horses. I like horses especially white ones, they are fast, graceful, strong and smarter than our own silly cows. So without any knowledge the farmer went out to bought himself some white horses, entertainment horse which other farmers find them useless to their farm and because work horse are considered highly priced and valuable they kept it for themselves. The farmer bought these white horses at a very high price thinking that he was paying for quality horses. So he set them the lead the cows to work the land hoping it will do a better job by leading them before they are smarter. Hope he can keep his eyes off thing and rest while the horse and the cow will work the land, the farmer also put horse blinds on the white horses so they can go straight and not be distracted, but it irritated the horses.  The white horses are lazy and not used to hard work but play. They devised an idea so that they can deceived the farmer. They loosen the rope to the plough so while the cows are pulling the plough, they will not shoulder any burden and yet be leading the cows. And with the horse blinds on they can sleep without the farmer noticing...<br><br>Since the farmer has invested heavily on these white horses, the farmer also fenced off the best portion of the farm so the white horses can graze on the best pasture and grow fat, leaving the dried grass and weeds to the cows. But the cows kept work even harder thinking by doing so they can produce more crops and in the end may benefit from more left-over. And the land began to grow and produce more. Then farmer thought to himself, ever since I brought these white horses the land had become more productive. So I should reduce the numbers of cow to a plough and put more horses. As days goes by, the cows became weaker and weaker because of the uneven yoke. The horse was fatten but the cows were getting malnourished. Now the farm have equal number of horses to cows. The farmer harvest more and sold the extra harvest. With the money the farmer employ engineers to built a 'Electric Reproduction Pump'. So when the cows on it way to the field, passes through it, it will help generate electricity to be used in the entire farm so the farmer can save on electricity...<br><br>One day the farmer realised that the pasture could not support all the farm's animals. He thought the cows are lazy and they eat a lot of grass while the horses are doing the most work in the farm. He told the cows, our farm is not producing enough to feed all. In order to preserve for your offspring's, we may need to slaughter some of you so the others may live on. So he slaughter some of the cows and sold them for more money, with the money he bought farming tools, leather saddles for the horses. He also brought golden horse shoes for the white horses for their contribution for previous year of harvest...<br><br>One day the farmer's helper Mr Mark 'Bold' Tanner suggested to create more land, he said cows don't really need much space to live in while the white horses need arches of field to play in. So they began to built little shed just fitting to the cows. He also enlarge the fences for the horses pan and reduces the portion for the cow to graze. Ah Tan also enlarged his own little cottage with the extra land...<br><br>One day, the meteorological station announced a prolong dry spell is coming and all farmer should prepare for it. The farmer went to the cows and said, I am afraid the quality of your milk is not good enough. The fat content in your milk cannot produce sufficient diary product you need for retire and your offspring. So the farmer took more diary products out from the storage for himself to prepare for the drought. Then he increase the milk machine rate and milked the cows more often so that he can stock up more than what he has taken from the storage...<br><br>Now, the dry spell was almost over. The drought did not spare some of the farmers cows, the cows had to weather the harsh conditions during this period. Because food was scares the farmer continue to slaughter the cows for meat and sold them for money to built food for himself. With the money the farmer also specially built a barn and had hidden all the white horse inside. He air conditioned for the horse because of the dirty and dust will hurt the white horses. He also built a water storage tank and a cooling pool for the horses...<br><br>The meteorological station predicted that the good raining season is coming and advice that all farmer to take the opportunity to sow as many seeds for so harvest will be good. The farmer needed more money to buy quality seeds so he can sow them and prepare for huge harvest. Prices of horses has gone up but the farmer needed more white horses because he still consider them superior than his own local cows. And with the farmer is also expecting good harvest, it can do more good even if it cost him more to maintained them. He thought with last years harvest record, I should have twice the amount of white horse to a cow. The population of cow need to grow for more milking. If need be I still can slaughter more cows and sell their meat for money.<br><br>So the farmer went to the cows and said:<br><br>"We have all worked this hard for the land, like your forefathers, for the sake of your offspring you must endure, you must work even harder then them. With prices of seeds going up, I will have to reduce your feeds so I can invest in quality seeds and more whites horses to help you work this land.<br><br>The farm also needs more cows, we won't have to buy them because you need to populate this land and the land will belong to your offspring. But If need be we will also can borrow some white horses. Maybe one day they will put horns on their heads and treat them like cows and hope they can live with us."<br><br>After his speech to the cows, the farmer went for a vacant in the city. He bought himself a nice little condo and plan to shift there for his retirement......................<br><br></div>

Not to mentioned, when a cow is old it is 1. Slaughtered, 2. Discarded 3. Outcasted.<br><br>A. Retrenched, CPF cut below average..why? Do they need lesser? Are they no in need for more medical expense from aging problems? Almost all has exhausted their CPF for their children , studies, housing &amp; etc during the prime life..<br><br>B. Gahmen said: Aging population is a burden to the Gahmen......and should be taken care by the people.....so their usefulness is over? Did they not contribute to the country, slaves themselves to build a 1st world country? Did they not worked to the bones for a beautifully painted dream? So who is sitting comfortably and discarding once good citizen of Singapore? Now you tell them to go to hell, take care of yourselves &amp; then cut their CPF &amp; withhold their withdraw? Are they at that mature age, wise enough to handle their own hard earn savings? Or do they still consider them old fool with a mind of a child. The same kind of attitude is in display in the parliament. And they still think all Singapore are childish, lack talent &amp; wisdom &amp; should be dictated by 1 man. They should be the "COW"...population when told, work with told, pay when told...<br><br>C. Straits Times: "Elderly man found dead after 3 days in his 1 rooms flat".... Has this man no children?
