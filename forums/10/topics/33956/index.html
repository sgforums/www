If it refuses to compromise...go to war." But war, he said, is not the solution in resolving problems between two countries.<br><br>"The approach in knowing what is ours and not to give in without knowing what is ours," he said, adding that the time had come for Malaysia to think business like to benefit from its ties with other countries.<br><br>-- BERNAMA<br><br><strong>Syed hamid is twisting his word that he has memtioned in the above report which i got.he told reporter today that he Did not mention the word WAR.haha..stupid foreign minster trying to act smart again!</strong><strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi all... read this....... me damn HOT rite now..... those sucker!!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Let's get this straight. That stupid Singapore started this whole thing. They stole Batu Putih and they are willing to sacrifice innocent malaysin lives over theirs. Sure we do all know about the supposable secret forward defence plan. Hey singaporeans? Do you think we dont in' know about the Mersing line? We knew about it all the time you ing wanker. You might have your high tech weapons and gadgets, ISRAELIS trained midgets. But hear this, the Malaysian armed forces are not politically driven. They are RELIGOUSLY and PATRIOTICALLY driven. They would do anything even sacrificng their life. You should be grateful that so far both singapore and malaysia live side by side peacefully, we even supply you a cheap source of water. It is even cheaper that what the Malaysian people have to pay. SO i want to remind both you and me that this is a avoidable. If it comes to worst, and Singapore strike first, ALLAH would help us and destroy you. Just remember when Great Britain first invaded Afghanistan all of her army were killed. YOU MIGHT HAVE THE WEAPON, BUT WE HAVE THE WILL TO SURVIVE. Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Brunei would definitely sides with Malaysia. Because they could see that Singapore's forward defence was wrong and down right ing UNETHICAL!You asked to be independence and we gave it to you, and all you can do is stab us from the back. Thanks alot you asshole. We saw the dagger before you could stab it. All you could do now is to reflect, who is your closest neighbor? Malaysia or israel?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> knn.... i dont know whats inside there head!!! shit?or what??<br>http://www.strategypage.com/messageboards/messages/73-58.asp<br><br></div>

What a joke...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>1) Brunei has no business with Malaysia. They are with Allah BUT they have more sense.<br><br>2) Indonesia has enough businesses at home. Though not having enough sense, creating riots and strikes against causing social and political instabilities at their home, which in turn causing their ever down spiralling economy etc... They need their troops to control their people, some how, and fight the terrorists. A weak economy disallows they for a war. Though they can spiritually support Malaysia... Conclusion, they have ENOUGH businesses.<br><br>3) Phillipines is mainly Catholics and they need to fight their own terrorists' groups. They have no business with Malaysia.<br><br>3) Thialand is mainly Buddhists and they need to fight their own rebel and terrorists' groups. Buddhism some more encouraged peace. They have no business with Malaysia. Their economy is still not strong enough for a war.<br><br>4) Malaysia. All talk, no do. If they have enough sense, they will not start war like Americans. So does Singapore. I don't think they'll start a bloody war for one stone at the sea (unless they're dumb), so do we. The problem with Malaysia is that they don't fight like a gentleman, with truth and grace ("I did not say war, I LIE!"). I still respect Malaysia enough, still, in turn, they should return respect, like a gentleman. ( oo0oo ) Or else I would name Malaysia in small letters ( <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> i.e. malaysia), cause it didn't win my respect.<br><br>The Malaysian authorities should make sure they don't find trouble with my next visit to Malaysia (cause I'm a Singaporean  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ). If they do anything to me that does not make sense, they'll be barbarians, not gentleman)<br></div>
