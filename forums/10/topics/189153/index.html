            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is a US$193 billion dollar economy, and the head should earn more.<br>Look at Lee Ka Shing, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, they are earning way more that our ministers. I think each minister should be paid at least US10 mil + private jet, free housing, free Car (of course must add Cash Card as well), free ship, free first class air ticket (based on SQ prices , just in case their private jet fails). They also deserve to get more shares (in terms of Singapore Shares, maybe 5% should be held by PM, since he is the Head), can also include share options.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Like Real.<br>Running a country is suppose to be service to the nation, not for personal greed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr Low Thia Kiang made a point in his speech which i think is reasonable.The suggestion is that minister's pay be pegged to a multipler on what the lowest 20% income bracket people earn<br><br>Eg if the multipler is x100 if the lowest 20% income earner earn $800 per month,then using this multipler,minister should get x100 = $80,000.If these lowest income bracket earn more,the ministers will earn more to reward them for policies well ran.<br><br>This way,it is really staying together,moving ahead (PAP's slogan for AMK GRC campaign),and not some staying together,stay the same or even move back while others who are better off and the PAP moving ahead.This way there is the encouragement for minister to really think about the poor and to help them and to help themselves too,win-win situation,and it will make these ministers to be accountable to the people for their policies and not just get rediculous high salaries month after months even if their policies turn out to be failures.<br><br></div>

It is not about equating talented personnels with greediness, but a fact of life. It is of course the best case scenerio if we can get the equally capable and passionate people.

But how about the other way round through reverse multiplier.<br><br>Assuming that the annual income is $100,000 then depending on one's performance level or policies the salary are deductable through the mulitipler process ranging from 1-5 scale.

Either ways are arguable but the reverse multiplier has the benefits of the doubt that the best men are always seek out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>Rubbish!!!!!Mr LTK's suggestion is the logical way in getting the ministers pay to peg against the lowest income people.  With that way, I am sure people with good heart and best of best in talent and knowledges will join him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
