              <p>SINGAPORE, May 13, 2009 – <span style="color: red;"><strong>A legal battle is looming in Singapore over $25 million which allegedly belonged to the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.</strong></span><br> <br> The lawyers representing rival claimants to the money, held in
              Singapore, met with a high court judge for the second time in three
              days to discuss how to proceed with their claims.<br> <br> It was agreed during the brief in chambers meeting that they would now
              undertake preparatory work ahead of an eventual court hearing, the
              lawyers said.<br> <br> “The argument is all about who in the end is entitled to the money,”
              Kenneth Tan, a senior legal counsel who is representing more than 9,500
              victims of human rights abuses during Marcos’ rule, told AFP.<br> <br> Justice Kan Ting Chiu has not yet set a date for a hearing.<br> <br> Besides the rights victims, other claimants include the Philippine
              government and the Philippine National Bank as well as four foundations
              alleged to be Marcos fronts.<br> <br> Last year, Singapore’s highest court rejected an appeal by the Philippine government to take hold of the money.<br> <br> Singapore’s Court of Appeal affirmed an earlier ruling by a high court
              judge who said the Philippine government must prove that it owns the
              bank deposits in the face of competing claims from other parties.<br> <br> The appeal court has said the $25 million held in escrow is the
              remainder of some $100 million in Marcos funds deposited in a bank in
              Singapore.<br> <br> The rest had been transferred to the Philippine government in 2003 before rival claims had been lodged, it said.<br> <br> Marcos was toppled in a popular revolt in 1986 and died in exile in Hawaii in 1989. <span style="color: red;"><strong>He was accused of plundering billions of dollars from his country, but his family denies the accusation.</strong></span><br> <br> More than 500 civil and criminal suits have been filed worldwide against members of Marcos’s family and his estate.<br> <br> Despite years of hearings and investigations, no Marcos relative has been sent to jail, but <span style="color: red;"><strong>human
              rights victims won a judgement for damages in a Hawaii court, which
              forms the basis of their claim to the assets in Singapore.</strong></span><br> <br> -----------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Latest updates at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a></strong>:<br> <br> 1.
