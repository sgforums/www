            <div class='col-md body'>my answer to this question would be a NO.<br>Terrorists are aggressive and antagonistic people who are fighting for land, rights etc...But above all, they are fighting for their political convictions and beliefs. These people do not understand the language of fear, nor do they respond to threats. By using terror tactics as a counter attack against them, we will never be able to effectively stamp out terrorism simply cos these people have fought for and will continue to fight for what they so strongly believe in. They will only cease fighting when these deep-seated convictions they so strongly hold on to have been eroded, which will never be the case since these terrorists are subjected to a mighty lot of brainwashing.<br><br>Perhaps, we will never be able to totally eradicate terrorism from e face of the earth. Some conflicts are simply unsolvable, given the deep-rooted nature of conflicts today. As such, i feel that the best way to deal with these terrorists is through the various diplomatic initiatives of our political leaders. Although we may not be able to eliminate those terrorists, at least these will prevent conflicts from escalating and so undermine the works of these terrorists.</div>

They dun take school children hostage or blow up ppl on buses. Dun expect them to treat terrorists with kiddy gloves.

            <div class='col-md body'>The history of conflicts between Islam and Jews is too deep for our understanding.<br><br>If we are to read the bible, we will find that the two religions were in conflicts from the beginning of human history.<br><br>We cannot readily find any solutions for them without going back to historical root causes.<br><br>What were the original causes? I believe they were embedded in religion itself.<br><br>Suppose there is a unifying religion that can bring the two together. I believe Islam believed that anything else other than their own religion is heresy.<br><br>Similarly, I believe that any Jew will believe that any other belief than their own is unacceptable.<br><br>So for centuries they were involved in conflicts that never will end. So, to find deeper root causes and have them discussed openly with a more tolerable attitudes towards each other's belief without agenda to control one another is the first stage of reconciliation.<br><br>Can someone be appointed to propose this phase of reconciliation to begin soon? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhism dun force. Its subtle, gentle, fascinating and most of all non aggressive. It encourages us to think for others and ourselves. You can ask all sorts of questions but you feel ressuring.It doenst say once you are in buddhism you cannot convert to other religion. Nows thats a real 'religion. In fact most buddhists will tell you buddhism is not a religion, its life, science and most of all its practical. They practise it daily.<br><br>Peaceful, love, kindness and scientific.<br><br></div>
