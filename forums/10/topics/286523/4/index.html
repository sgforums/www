            <div class='col-md body'>I think tis is a win win situation and an improvement. They can earn a bit from storing tis money but we also save time and inconvenience as well. If u think your 100 stored value is gonna generate a lot of significant cash in a month, then use back the old system. If u think tis is a scam, then everything in life r scams. U don't put the money in the stored value but put it in the bank. The bank use it lend others at a much higher rate. They earn a big profit from it. Tat is a scam too ? So should we spend every cent we earn to prevent being cheated ? Companies earn profit, they r not charities. There is a choice. If u don't like it, then use back the old system.<br><br>Furthermore, if u ask me if I prefer some person who got rich from the power system or the gov, I prefer the gov because u r more likely able to get tis money to improve our lives. If u give to some private companies, then they will earn tis money and leave absolute naught to others.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
