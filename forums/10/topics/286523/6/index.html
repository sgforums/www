To install you your bicycle?<br><br>When these ERP cards are installed on new cars, the machine n cost of installation has already been factored into selling price of the car,how come<br><br>the first three years is free of charge n later need to be paid? If they want to charge it, they should charge it upfront, not free on the first three years n later need to be paid. I assumed during the first three years of free trial of ERP, the govt could have incurred charges of gibing it free to the people.<br>How much is one ERP card reader?</div>

It came as a surprise when it suddenly announced its efforts at privatisation in creating new private companies.<br><br>Unfortunately, the privatisation scam was merely an exercise to distance itself from accusations of being directly responsible for increasing fluctuations in rate increases in response to whatever market forces.<br><br>Since their creation have Singaporeans seen those four companies providing  lower electricity rates ?<br><br>How can this happen when Electric Rates are pegged to the fluctuation of the oil prices that are beyond the control of even the MIW Government ?<br><br>By splitting into four separate companies - are we not burden with four sets of separate replication of infrastructural costs of management, work force and equipment ?<br><br>Have these new companies achieve any new operating efficiencies when their economies of scale has been compromised ?<br><br>If at all, the constant creation of new companies to replace existing Government Statutory Boards is merely to create new opportunities for the massive size of retiring loyal MIW cronies and hard working Civil Servants to ''retire'' from public service, with high paying jobs as senior executives in these new corporations in the <span style="font-style: italic;">''Private Sector''</span> - all paid for by the pockets of Singaporeans.<br><br>Take a peek at the <strong><a href="http://www.yeocheowtong.com/Salaries.html#Lieutenant-Colonel%20Fong" rel="nofollow">web of Government Owned Companies</a></strong> in the Privatisation Effort of this MIW Government, and you can see the heads of all these Private Corporation are loyalists of the MIW clones.<br><br>With such a burden of MIW clones managing a growiing web of Government owned <span style="font-style: italic;">''Private Companies''</span> to provide the same services previously provided by Statutory Boards - do we need to understand further the cause of such high cost of essential services that affect the Cost of Living in Singapore ?<br></span><br><br></div>

A is now providing electricity to North, while B to South, C to East and D to West. If our government's objective is privatised everything and allow every household to be able to choose and buy electricity from any of the 4 power stations.<br><br>How would that be possible?<br><br>These are my guess.<br><br>a) Option 1<br>A, B, C, and D, will have to lay down new cable network physically to connect themselves to every household island wide. that means, we will have 4 meters, 4 sets of wiring etc at every household.<br><br>b) Option 2<br>To continue with existing infrastucture, but allow A. B. C and D. cross supply and sell to one another territory and control the billing at consumer end.<br><br>Personally I think option 2 is what our government is looking for and it does make sense to require the consumer to pay as you use as not power station would want to be liable for one another customers.<br><br>Please dont quote me hor, I am just guessing. </div></blockquote>The answer to that is rather simple. Coz in other bigger country, there is a lot of electric and gas company. They sell gas and electric and charge on a quarterly basis. If you don;t like the plan or scheme of one, you can alway go to another. However there is only about 5max such big company in most cases. I can go into detail about how they do it but i won't. Just google it and u will find out the detail.</div>
