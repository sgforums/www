In the city of Bern, they have lanes for trams/trains/cars/cyclists.

Each time we are given <strong>one</strong> example to the contrary.<br>Thus we become complacent about improving our social graces.  More than thirty years of courtesy campaign we had, and it  produced barren results. Our young adults today, have lived through those courtesy campaign years, as students; what  did they learn? In those thirty years, how many children went through our education system? Does the results today commensurate with all those years of courtesy campaign?<br><br>The fault lies in our failure to inculcate social etiquette to our young. The fault lies with the government, the parents, and society in general. And as we keep failing to teach our young manners, bad behaviour in our society will  persist.<br>We therefore will have yet another young man, killing his passenger, or commuters waiting at a busstop.<br><br>And cyclist  will ride on pavements, to stay alive.</div>

There is report of death too. ..  then many were saying they should be on the road instead ..  I had a few brushes with these cyclist too ..  anyway, on the road, when I see cyclist, I change lane to give them as much space as possible, but when road condition doesn't allow I will just follow behind them until I can overtake safely.  I was a cyclist before and I know how dangerous it can be when motorist do not give way.  However, you do see some cyclist that will suddenly turn right in front of you especially at the change of traffic light.  They somehow expect motorist to give way,.
