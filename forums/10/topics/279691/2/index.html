            <div class='col-md body'>I cycle on the road too. Cycle on the road is dangerous but u need to be defense and now know to protect yrself too.<br><br>If u cycle on the road.<br><br>A side mirror is a must.<br>1. cos u know what is behind u and will have enough time to react.<br>Example ,u saw a bus behind and closng near the roadside. Yr number one  reaction is to slow down and keep as near the side of the road as possible and allow the bus to pass.<br><br>2. When overtaking ,with side mirror. U will know when to safely overtake other bicycle or stationery cars.<br><br>Becareful at junction, a lot of cars intend to overtake u and turn in...<br><br>So far, most cyclist kenna accident becos,they don't know what is coming from behind of them.<br><br>Btw,cycling on road is more faster and fun. Best is,u don't need to pay road tax and not subjected to redlight camera.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Yr neck will get crammed.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Just like driving or riding.
