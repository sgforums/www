            <div class='col-md body'>Most Malay Singaporeans are thankful and happy that they are weaned off their pacifiers early by the Singapore system which mould them into the world class citizens who are able to compete even globally. Unlike other system which spoon feed them to the grave, and still they have not grown up and and were seen asking for more! A clever mother will not spoon feed their child to such manner that the child spoilt to become helpless and not able to face the world when they eventually become an old and mentally retarded kid who does not even know how to feed himself!<br><br>Most foreigners  are envious of the Malay Singaporeans who are hard working, wealthy and eager to learn! Eventhough they are minority in Singapore, most are doing very well and most are much better off than their Chinese or Indian counterparts. Basically they have the intelligence and that diligence most foreigners envied, yet some of their brothers overseas are trying to inculcate a sense of cynicism in the Malay Singaporeans when those brothers cannot even take care of themselves! It is analogious of teaching your father how to fuck!<br><br>Are they too jealous of their success or are they trying to destabilise Singapore by trying to create racial disharmony?<br><br>Most Singaporean Malays earn a pay much better than the Mentri Beasar's of most of the states of Malaysia, and they know their destiny is in their own hands, yet there are pauper like heroes trying to champion for them when they could not even  have a balanced diet in their 3 daily meals!<br><br>Malay Singaporeans knew that the state did not owe them a living, they have to work hard like any other citizens to earn their economic, social or other status. They are the independant lots and need no sympathy from any of their well wishers. Economically they stand tall among their Asian brothers yet they are not boastful and they mind their own business!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A mentri besar's pay is not likely to exceed that of the Prime Minister's. Dr. M's pay has just been upgraded to slightly less than 20,000ringgit/month, so it's highly unlikely that a mentri besar,s pay has gone up that much. However, those undertable income may come to millions, no one knows!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder where you people get your facts on Malaysia PM and Menteri Besar's salary. Seems a little overblown, don't you think?<br><br>PM earns around RM20k. That's as far as the facts remain. MB's can earn RM10k (got this from some website hosted by some opposition movement). But the RM1million a month... hmm true too.. we know where this money comes from, right? It is obvious, but everyone keeps quiet. How else could ex-Selangor MB 'smuggle' in RM2million into Aust? Try calculating his salary per anum, and multiply it by 5... it is hardly near that figure.<br><br>Explains everything.</div>

Err, that's probably twice the amount households of other races earn on average(middle class). Where in the world do you obtain this number?
