Still it came out to be strong mandate. I think it will always be strong mandate. I have come to the point of just feeling disgusted and disappointed with my fellow people when they complain.<br>I watched 7 samurai, in the village there was this person who was always ready to swing vote, betray, speak loudly of fears and doomsday prophecy and others will blindly follow.<br><br>Then there are promised incentives such as upgrading, progress shares, package give outs and etc. I hear my MIL always praise endlessly the current party. She gloated me when the party she voted won and believe there will be more money to take from them (how silly). She obviously do not want to know the truth. I hear from my parents who lived through British rule and also post WWII, during independence and the struggle. The only comment I got was to be very weary of the first family. All my parents felt was the current party and the GLCs, subsidaries they spun off are killing all small businesses and preventing free market and a small way for people to make a living.<br><br></div>

As minority government they cannot keep on rising prices and then act blur... not everyone in Singapore earn $600K peanuts salaries like them...</div>
