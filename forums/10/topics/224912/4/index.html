            <div class='col-md body'>Are people in sg ready for the realities and responsibilities of choices, if we are let loose? If yes, then the PAP should not be in power a long time ago, as people had already made more appealing choices. If we are not ready, then shouldn't PAP be ruling instead of some other irresponsible parties?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by the Bear:</div><div class="quote_body">we are stuck in this rut as everything is decided for us, just like a child who is prevented from growing up mentally, there will be the pressures which will build up.. a resentment.. but when we are let loose, we are not ready for the realities and responsibilities of choices we have to make when we are mature...<br><br></div></blockquote>But what's the point? Where's the pratically in it?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by foomwee88:</div><div class="quote_body">The true will prevail someday  and somehow!!!!Great ppl will die but he will be remembered by heart by the ppls 4ever!!!!</div></blockquote>Of course it will be the best if all the gold medals winners are true born sgreans. However we had proven to ourselves we have limited sports talent. So if the government did nothing to boast the golds, then there will be a bunch of people commenting that they're not doing enough. So where will the argument end? If in a potluck party, there isn't enough papercups, someone have to go buy it. If a bank's sales staff is not doing well, they'll have to employ more potential canidates, either from the population, or head-hunt from other banks. There is neither time nor luxury to slowly invest in own talents.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Nelstar:</div><div class="quote_body">They invest in "talents" who can't become the elite in their country of birth.<br><br>I rather have more sports school paid for, develop a future for these sportsmen in our country... than to pluck talents and use them for their limited lifespan and do nothing for our country than to just put accolades on our shirt.<br><br>So what if we achieve gold? People who loved their sports had to mine their lives through endless grief in the offices, in the sales line, in the production lines and see mascots bought from other countries paraded around.<br><br></div></blockquote>So I blame Mcdonalds for selling the Happy Meals at lower prices, opening most outlets 24hours, having delivery service, and throwing in a free toy despite my massive objection, hence enticing me to eat if frequently, resulting in my H-cup man breasts and 80 inches low waist jeans?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by onceinabluemoon:</div><div class="quote_body"> if I hear of anyone becoming a Casino gambling addict... I will blame PAP and the Singapore government for ignoring the massive objections to the casino.</div></blockquote>True there are many areas pap is not performing to expectations, but some of the things had to be done the way they were done in that particular situation. Though it could be redundant now. We should perhaps focus more on the direct areas that government is not addressing adequetely. Areas like the below article. Sg will continue the way we are now, if the people have no access to, or do not bother about, both sides of the coin. Think sg can only change if we/the opposition parties (creditable ones only) really  focus on the correct areas. We also have to take responsibilities on the correctness of the information we come upon and not be too navie.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"CitizensÂ’ privacy rights occasionally have been infringed, and the government has restricted freedom of speech and freedom of the press and has limited other civil and political rights. Censorship of sexual, political and racially or religiously sensitive content is extensive.<br><br>Singapore does not offer a civilian service alternative to two-year compulsory military service.
