And this of course implies that the remaining 'deficit' amount of subsidize which will have to be given, will be done so at the expense of other taypayers - a significant number of whom will be non-smokers.<br><br>So looking at this concern from this aspect, is there really a double edge issue now?<br><br>And please take this into note as well.<br><br>Being sick or falling ill from the harms of smoking don't merely end there at an economical or accounting equation logic.<br><br>The smokers themselves will also be faced with the physical sufferings - along with the deep worries of their caring family members as well.<br><br>So for the sake of your family and yourself - drop that damn stick today.<br><br>The sums will never work out to a smoker's advantage.</div>
