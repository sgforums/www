People expect to be paid what they are worth and that has nothing to do with "greed". Greed is when you expect to be paid more than what you are worth.<br><br>Many people do not even expect or desire to be paid what they think they are worth. That is why the TT Durai episode and the minister's pay increases left such a bitter taste in people's mouth.<br><br>When it comes to Charity funds and Public Money, it becomes GREED when you take as much as you can just because you are in a position of power to do so. People expect noble, honorable people to stand for office.<br><br>You cannot probe into their affairs and their motives constantly and when you see them so GREEDY, then your suspicions must be raised. You will be wondering if the policies they make are for the interest of themselves, their cronies, their party or for the Public good.</div>

(People who do not view unconstrained acquisitiveness as a vice will generally use a word other than greed, which has strong negative connotations.)<br><br>Some desire to increase one's wealth is nearly universal and acceptable in any culture, but this simple want is not considered greed. Greed is the extreme form of this desire, especially where one desires things simply for the sake of owning them. Greed may entail acquiring material possessions at the expense of another person's welfare (for example, a father buying himself a new car rather than fix the roof of his family's home) or otherwise reflect flawed priorities.<br><br>Coveting another person's goods is usually called envy, a word commonly confused with jealousy. The two words denote opposite forms of greed. We may envy and wish to have the possessions or qualities of another, but we jealously guard the possessions or qualities we believe we have and refuse to share these with others. Greed for food or drink, combined with excessive indulgence in them, is called gluttony. Excessive greed for and indulgence in sex is called lust, although this term no longer carries as negative connotations as it once did.<br><br>Greed is sometimes represented by the frog.<br><br>A woodcut by Ugo da Carpi, is entitled "Hercules Chasing Avarice from the Temple of the Muses." [1]. Thomas Aquinas metaphorically described the sin of Avarice as "Mammon being carried up from Hell by a wolf, coming to inflame the human heart with Greed".<br><br>Proponents of laissez-faire capitalism sometimes argue that greed should not be considered a negative trait and should instead be embraced, as they claim that greed is a profoundly benevolent force in human affairs, as well as a necessary foundation for the capitalist system. Critics have argued this definition confuses greed with self-interest, which can be benign.<br><br>[edit] Greed vs. Happiness<br>Buddhists believe greed is based on incorrectly connecting material wealth with happiness. This is caused by a view that exaggerates the positive aspects of an object; that is, acquiring material objects has less impact than we imagine on our feelings of happiness. This view has been correlated by studies in the field of happiness economics, which confirm that beyond the provision of a basic level of material comfort, more wealth does not create greater happiness.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gordon Gekko's Words of Wisdom from the movie "Wall Street":<br><br>Gordon Gekko: Teldar Paper, Mr. Cromwell, Teldar Paper has 33 different vice presidents each earning over 200 thousand dollars a year. Now, I have spent the last two months analyzing what all these guys do, and I still can't figure it out. One thing I do know is that our paper company lost 110 million dollars last year, and I'll bet that half of that was spent in all the paperwork going back and forth between all these vice presidents. The new law of evolution in corporate America seems to be survival of the unfittest. Well, in my book you either do it right or you get eliminated. In the last seven deals that I've been involved with, there were 2.5 million stockholders who have made a pretax profit of 12 billion dollars. Thank you. I am not a destroyer of companies. I am a liberator of them! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right, greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms; greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind. And greed, you mark my words, will not only save Teldar Paper, but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA. Thank you very much. </span><br><br>Gordon Gekko: Greed is good.<br><br>Gordon Gekko: If you need a friend, get a dog.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">I think our ministers must have lots of dogs as friends.</span></strong><br><br></div>

And who knows what is the final cost after the judgement for the case.
