We've not seen one like it in all our years in the law.

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the cyber counter agents at the other site has posted the news of the Curry Puff hawker in Yishun as if all hawkers are earning big monies and ministers are underpaid and should be allowed to take more from the tax coffer.<br><br>This is only to be expected as what we have is a system where our ministers and top civil servants like Chief Justice seem to have no compunction in taking tax payers' monies by wrongful means like making biased comparison with the successful hawkers or stock brokers or estate agents.<br><br>People must expect them to continue to publicise news like the curry puff hawkers who make tons of monies indirectly implying that ministers are not earning enough and people should allow them to plunder into reserves and surpluses to take their own salaries of any amounts in order to match these hawkers.<br><br>The Chief Justice in giving his legal officers the latest salary increases and bonuses is doing the same. He would rather keep quiet about the many legal officers who are laid back and not deserving their higher pays and concentrate in talking about those who are getting higher salaries in the private sector.<br><br>We can expect our morality to go the same way of our public servants and ministers with this kind of self-taking of own salaries going on ad nausem.<br><br>When citizens are not even earning enough to pay for the necessities and utilities or transportation, we are seeing ministers and top civil servants taking away their monies with all the excuses and half-truths that private sector people are doing well.<br><br>Can they really like the curry puff hawkers create employments for the people who are underpaid or unemployed?<br><br>Can they stop importing cheap foreign labors to come in and take away their jobs or take away their retirement monies and pretend to be giving them back only after they are dead or near dead.<br><br>It is sad that all our leaders and top public servants are now getting from bad to worse behaving in this manner. Yet the Chief Justice being our legal and moral custodian cannot see it is wrong for them to take tax payers' monies using falsehood in this blatant manner. It is a case of wrong being portrayed as right through use of power and position.<br><br>The hawkers at least earn their monies honestly with their efforts, and entrepreneurship unlike those who use power to take their own salary increases and bonuses and annuities from the public tax payers' surpluses squeezed from the people with artful and unsubstantiated comparison which is a much bigger crime deserved to be punished by firing squad.<br><br>That is why once the leaders become greedy and envious of what curry puff makers are earning they will eventually lose their morality and can no longer govern with respect and support of the people.<br><br>How can the president being people's moral guardian sing poetry about the placid negara when this sort of misuse of power is happening ?</div>

You seemed to have a grudge more than greed!<br>Both Bill and Warren are greedy but not necessarily in negative ways. If they were not, then it is quite impossible for them to accumulate riches, and then donate. These are wiser people than the rest but it does not mean they were not greedy. Greed is the driving force for their successes to beat or run-down competitors, to achieve good returns on investments, and so forth.<br>Again, I find you linkages hard to fathom.</div>
