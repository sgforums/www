              <p><br>Welcome to capitalism, the ideal scene of it is to go into a recession and when it recovered, increase tax and cost of living, till a stage of backlashing and we go into a recession again, and when recovered again, tax will increase and so son...that is how the system works ya.</p>

              <p><br>2% unemployement is consider full employment,</p>
              <p>so, we typical have a 3% employment net. as economy recover, alots of companies are restructing itself to be Cheaper, Better and Faster. Those that survived the recession would had redesigned their employment policies to be lean, effective and efficient. Therefore you will see a down in employement, due to restructuring of employment policies by Company's HR. New ways of working and technology can also create certain structure unemployment for some people, therefore it is important that one must be able to change with the market labour demand inorder to get employed. The changes can be upgrading, retraining, reskilling or other Professional education upgrading.</p>
              <p>Finally, bearing in mind our aging workforce population, as more and more are retired or retrenched at old age during the last downturn, the figure can affect the unemployment rates. eg, you give 20months of paid to a 58yo old guy as retrenchment benefit, he will take it with delight, after that, he goes into early retirement, which mean that a potential employable person is not employed.</p>

              <p>I see what's coming. Soon consumer confidence will rise, start wisely spending their money for what they think they deserved for the hard work and sacrifice for the past year, companies make more money, gives bigger bonuses and increment to staff who had loyally stuck with them on lower wages, and these employees become consumers, and so the cycle of boom blooms.</p>
              <p>Boomz, man!!!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Without your help and your sacrifices, this breakthrough would not have been possible, despite attempts by some here to sow discord and dissatisfaction, which you largely ignored, and keep the nose to the grind.</p>
              <p>Your efforts had shown, and the results evident. You had helped our society pull through the greatest trial of our times - recession on a global scale. Give yourself a pat on the back.</p>
              <p>I am honoured and priviledged to have you beside me through this trial. Thanks a million!!!!</p>
              <p>Now, let us together help the 5% unemployed citizens on our shores with recommendations for job openings, contribution, etc as well as the less priviledged amongst us, and help them rise with us.</p>
