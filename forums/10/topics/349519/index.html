              <p>Thursday, 26 February 2009</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/items2/driving_a_wedge.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="140" align="right"><em>Singapore Democrats<br><br></em>The <em>Today</em> newspaper wrote to Dr Chee Soon Juan asking for his response to Mr
                      Chiam See Tong's criticisms about the SDP. Its Senior Reporter, Mr Loh
                      Chee Kong, said that he had interviewed Mr Chiam on Wednesday in which
                      Mr Chiam said that the Singapore Democrats had engaged in
                      "conspiratorial and destructive politics."<br><br>Mr Loh wanted Dr
                      Chee's "take on what had happened within the SDP then" and what is Dr
                      Chee's present relationship with Mr Chiam. He added that Mr Chiam was
                      sore that he was "forced out" of the party he founded. Mr Loh said that
                      the story is slated to be published in this Saturday's edition of the
                      newspaper.  Read Dr Chee's reply to Mr Loh:</p>
              <blockquote><br>As apparent during the interview, Mr Chiam was still
                      upset over the way he felt he was "forced out"-- in his words -- of the
                      party he had founded. He was visibly sore that there were people in the
                      party then who failed to understand his vision of a "two-party system"
                      and were more interested in engaging in what he called "conspiratorial
                      and destructive politics".  Mr Chiam added that he is not on speaking
                      terms with you because of what had happened.<br>-  Loh Chee Kong<br><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">   Senior Reporter, TODAY </span></span></blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear Mr Loh,<br><br>First,
                      let me say that I have no desire to let myself and my party be dragged
                      by you into a mud-slinging match with another opposition party.<br><br>Readers
                      will ask themselves: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why this and why now? </strong></span>The break up with Mr Chiam
                      See Tong in the SDP happened nearly two decades ago. This was
                      extensively covered and utilised by the PAP and its media to criticise
                      the Singapore Democrats.<br><br>Yet, your newspaper decides to
                      resurrect the issue today. One need not be a genius to see what
                      motivates this present exercise. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You are obviously trying to remind
                      Singaporeans of the episode in the hope that you can turn opinion
                      against the SDP again. </strong></span><br><br>Why now? This is not hard to figure out
                      given two recent developments: One, is that the general elections are
                      expected to be called in the not-too-distant future and the PAP needs
                      to run down the Singapore Democrats.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Two, the SDP has been
                      calling for the opposition to work closer together. </strong></span>The PAP needs to
                      halt this process as a united opposition is not in its interest. The
                      PAP has always depended on the divide-and-conquer tactic to trump the
                      opposition.<br><br>Mr Chiam's views of the SDP are not news. If you are
                      truly interested in political fallouts, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a story about the "stepping
                      down" of Ms Ho Ching as Temasek's chief</strong></span> and what was really happening
                      behind the scenes would thrill your readers no end, and assuredly send
                      your newspaper's sales to record highs. <br><br>Despite such real
                      information that the newspaper should be telling your readers, you
                      choose to write on something that happened in 1993 and which has
                      already been milked dry by your colleagues.<br><br>Now that the
                      Singapore Democrats are moving ahead and gaining momentum in attracting
                      support especially on the Internet, the media knows that it needs to do
                      something, however blatant and despicable, to halt our progress.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thanks but no thanks, we prefer to concentrate our attention on the PAP.</strong></span><br><br>Chee Soon Juan<br>Secretary-General <br>Singapore Democratic Party</p>

              by <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>secretly causing discord between him and his friends, allies,
              advisors, family, commanders, soldiers, and population. </strong></span>While he
              is preoccupied settling internal disputes his ability to attack
              or defend, is compromised.</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"> </p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"><strong>Six Dynasties Period China</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">In the later Wei dynasty, the emperor Tai
              Wu led a hundred thousand troops against the Song general Zang
              Zhi. The emperor, with his superior forces, chased general Zhang
              to the city of Yu where he was cornered.</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">The city was strongly
              fortified and so the emperor planned to surround it and starve
              the defenders into surrender. Feeling confident of his position,
              the emperor sent a cart carrying a large jar of wine to the city
              gate with the message asking for the traditional exchange of wine
              before commencing his siege of the city.</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">Zang Zhi knew that he
              needed to fight a decisive battle quickly, or suffer defeat, saw
              this as an opportunity. He sent some soldiers to gratefully
              accept the jar of wine and in turn deliver another large jar
              sealed with the wine maker's stamp.</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">When a cup of this wine was
              poured for the emperor it was discovered to be urine. This caused
              the emperor a humiliating loss of face before his own troops and
              in a rage ordered an immediate assault on the city. The defenders
              were well prepared and the bodies of the slain imperial troops
              piled up nearly to the top of the ramparts.In his haste and anger
              the emperor lost half his forces.</p>
