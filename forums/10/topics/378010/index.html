'I would not use the word 'peaceful rise'. In Chinese it sounds okay, but in English it sounds like you are rising like a mushroom; you scare people. Why not call it a cultural renaissance?' -- PHOTO: LIM SIN THAI<br><br>THE key to the relationship between China and the United States may lie right in the Americans' backyard, said Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew on Wednesday.<br><br>Speaking during a dialogue at the fifth anniversary dinner of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy on Wednesday night, he said that those concerned about whether China will rise peacefully need to worry, not about the current generation of Chinese leaders, but their children and grandchildren - people like the thousands of Chinese students currently studying in the US.<br><br>He said: 'I tell my American friends, I won't worry about them (China) today. You've got tens of thousands of Chinese students. You give them a bad time, they will go home and nurse a grievance. But if you accept them, it's a different world.'<br><br>In particular, he said that these young Chinese need to feel connected to the world as stakeholders, for example in negotiations on global warming.<br><br>'If I were the US, I would spend time to make sure the mindset of the younger generation is not one of hostility, but one of acceptance that you are a stakeholder.'<br><br>As for the current generation, he said he was confident they wanted peace after going through events like the Great Leap Forward and a Cultural Revolution gone mad.<br><br>As for how China could convince the world it can rise peacefully, MM Lee suggested starting with a bit of branding. 'I would not use the word 'peaceful rise'. In Chinese it sounds okay, but in English it sounds like you are rising like a mushroom; you scare people. Why not call it a cultural renaissance?'<br><br>In the event, the Chinese used the term 'peaceful development'. Mr Lee also took time to reflect on the changes he saw in China after some 32 visits to the country since 1976.<br><br>And as the country developed, he noted, its relationship with Singapore also changed. China used to ask him for advice in the past, but not anymore.<br><br>'Now we're talking at a different level. The relationship is at a more realistic level. You can't ask me with four million people to give advice to 1.3billion people.'<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_424799.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #417e15;">http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking...ry_424799.html</span></span></a></div>

              <div><strong>MM Lee launches book by Infosys founder Murthy<br><br>By Pearl Forss, Channel NewsAsia<br>Posted: 11 May 2009 2329 hrs</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/imagegallery/store/phpQxUGwx.jpg" alt=""><br><br>SINGAPORE: One of India's most prominent businessmen, Narayana Murthy, has said the accountability of India's political system must be improved for the country to move forward.<br><br><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/imagegallery/store/phpNSqm7T.jpg" alt=""><br>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew<br><br><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/imagegallery/store/phpGIxPwv.jpg" alt=""><br>Narayana Murthy<br><br>His comments came as the country is holding the world's largest democratic elections.<br><br>Mr Murthy, the founder of IT company Infosys, was in Singapore to launch a book.<br><br>Nasdaq-listed Infosys employs about 100,000 people in 22 countries. But its founder lives in a three-bedroom house and drives a 1.5-litre Opel Astra. Mr Murthy does not watch TV nor party.<br><br>He said the reason he started business is because as a young man, entrepreneurship was the best way he could serve his community.<br><br>And he said Minister Mentor Lee is his hero.<br><br>"Singapore is a real example of a country that has transformed herself from a third world country to a first world country in my own lifetime. All in, an environment of peace and harmony in a multicultural world, thanks of course to a cadre of aspirational and value-based leadership which has indeed led by example," said Mr Murthy.<br><br>"Singapore serves as a great example for all countries, both developing and developed. I'm so happy that my hero, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, is releasing the book here in Singapore," he added.<br><br>Mr Murthy believes the transparency and accountability of India's political system must be improved for the country to move forward.<br><br>And these are some of the views detailed in his book titled "A Better India: A Better World", which was launched by Minister Mentor Lee on Monday.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "There are limitations in the Indian constitutional system and the Indian political system that prevents it from going at high speed.<br><br>"I did not realise it until we engaged India closely. Since then we have realised that whatever the political leadership may want to do, it must go through a very complex system at the centre, and then even a more complex system in the various states.<br><br>"And the amount of work that is on the shoulders of these Ministers makes it necessary for each man, each Minister to be like Mr Murthy but Mr Murthy is a rare individual.<br><br>"So Indians will go at a tempo which is decided by their constitution, by their ethnic mix, by their voting patterns and the resulting coalition governments, which makes for very difficult decision making."<br><br>Mr Lee had told Mr Murthy previously that India needed political leaders like him. But Mr Murthy said he has no political ambition.<br><br>Source: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/428494/1/.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/428494/1/.html</span></span></a></div>

              <p><strong>From our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Below is a scanned copy of a flyer emailed to us by a reader:</span></strong></p>
              <p>Dear admin,</p>
              <p>I live in a HDB flat &amp; I received this piece of note slipped under the door recently.</p>
              <p>I couldn’t paste it on your webpage so I decided to email it to you instead as you may be interested in it.</p>
              <p>I’ve erased the telephone number course I don’t want the person to receive any prank call. I believe this is no fault of the PRs or foreigners but rather the problem lies with the government policies.</p>
              <p>The question is, how can we ever hope to have affordable HDB flats when we have foreigners who are distributing flyers saying they are “willing to give higher price..” to buy the same HDB flats we are living in??</p>
              <p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/hdbprflyer.jpg" alt="" width="542" height="721"></p>
              <p><strong>EDITORS’ NOTE:</strong></p>
              <p>With the Singapore government being the largest landlord and property developer at the same time, there is no free market in Singapore as it is able to fix the housing prices as it wishes due to its complete monopoly.</p>
              <p>The prices of HDB flats are rising due to the following artificial factors created by the government:</p>
              <p>1. Constant and ready demand for HDB flats as they are a basic necessity in Singapore. If Singaporeans and PRs do not purchase HDB flats, they will have no where to stay unless they opt for rental.</p>
              <p>2. Increasing demand by allowing an increasing number of foreigners to become PRs and to purchase flats. As PRs usually hold a decent-paying job, they will have few problems paying for a resale flat. Besides, since some may not settle down in Singapore, they do not mind paying more now as they can always sell them at a profit later on when they leave.</p>
              <p>3. Limiting supply by capping the number of new flats built: With few completed subsidized flats in the market, Singaporeans will have no choice but to compete for flats with the PRs in the resale market thereby causing the prices to go up. The number of flats built in the last few years are considerably less than that in the 1990s. (HDB Infoweb)</p>
              <p>4. Complete monopoly over the public housing sector: With virtually no competitors, HDB is able to sell its flats at any prices as it wishes as there is no pressure on them to bring down the prices.</p>
              <p>5. Since there are PRs like the above couple who are willing to “spoil the market” to secure a flat in their desired location, sellers will naturally jack up the COVs to make a “killing”. This will eventually lead to higher COVs in the long run. Already we are seeing ridiculously high COVs like the $70,000 paid for a 3-room resale flat in Toa Payoh (Lianhe Wanbao, 14 September 2009)</p>

              <p><strong>Produced by The Enquirer TV, The Singapore Enquirer</strong></p>
              <p>(Also watch the video interview with Mr Chua’s wife in the thread below)</p>
              <p><strong>Prologue:</strong></p>
              <p>69 year old Mr Chua used to work as a construction laborer in the past. He is still healthy and able to work, but nobody wants to employ him, citing age as a concern.</p>
              <p>As he does not qualify for the Public Assistance scheme, he is only given a monthly allowance of $150 which he supplements by borrowing from his friends.</p>

              <p><strong>Excerpts of interview translated from Hokkien:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> Do you go to look for work ?</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chua:</strong> Yes, I cycled everywhere from Geylang to Whampoa, but they say I am too old and refuse to employ me…..I told my friends like this die already I have no job to do, no job no money. If this house has to be paid by me, then I really die.</p>
              <p><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> How much did the government give you a month ?</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chua (crying):</strong> S$150 only. They open a bank account for me and deposit the money into it every month.</p>
              <p><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> Is it enough ?</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chua:</strong> Not enough. The water bills is already a couple of dollars…..in 2, 3 or at most 4 days, the money is gone.</p>
              <p><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> Are food prices high now ?</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chua:</strong> Yes, very expensive ! When I go out to look for job, I dare not drink coffee at coffeeshop. I ordered hot water instead, no money what to eat ? Can only drink water.</p>
              <p><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> Did you ask your MP to help you look for job.</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chua:</strong> Yes, they gave me a job as a sweeper at ….don’t know where, offered me S$300 monthly, but the transport fares cost a hundred plus dollars already.</p>
              <p><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> Did you ever go hungry ?</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chua:</strong> When we are hungry, just take some roti (bread).</p>
              <p><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> Do you still have CPF ?</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chua:</strong> No.</p>
              <p><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> Are you upset with your predicament ?</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chua:</strong> Yes, but what to do ? When we run out of money, I have to go around to borrow from my friends and when the S$150 is deposited on every 3rd of the month, I will use it to repay them.</p>

              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Video produced by The Enquirer TV, The Singapore Enquirer</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Prologue:</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">70 year old Madam Tan has 9 children who gives her $500 – $700 monthly on average for living expenses. Yet she continues to collect used cardboards to sell in her neighborhood. She claimed she does not need the money and is doing so to keep herself healthy.</p>

              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Excerpts of interview:</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> “How much cardboards do you collect daily ?”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Madam Tan:</strong> “Not a lot, just a few – look over there.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> “How much do you learn from selling them ?”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Madam Tan:</strong> “Now times are bad, about S$1.50 after 3 days, at most S$3.00″</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> “Do you have any children ?”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Madam Tan:</strong> “Yes, 9 of them. They give me money for my monthly expenses.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> “Then why are you still working ?”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Madam Tan:</strong> “To keep myself healthy lor, my legs are very weak, so I need to exercise.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> “Why don’t you rest at home ?”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Madam Tan:</strong> “Nothing better to do lah, keep staying at home will go mad.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> “Are you happy with your present life ?”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Madam Tan:</strong> “Okay lah, in life most important must take things easy, don’t brood over problems, eat well, sleep well, I live a simple life.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Afterthought:</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">In November 2008, we published a story from a reader about a 74 year old Madam Neo who has been picking cardboards for a living for the past 10 years (read the article <a href="http://wayangparty.com/2008/11/15/a-true-story-of-an-old-lady-who-have-been-selling-cardboards-for-10-years-to-survive/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>).  We were indeed surprised that there are actually elderly around who are in this “trade” to keep themselves fit.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Madam Tan appeared to be cheerful throughout the interview. Unfortunately, she belonged to the minority. For every Madam Tan, there will be at least a dozen Madam Neos who need to collect used cardboards in their twilight years to feed themselves.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">If the current price for used cardboards as quoted by Madam Tan above is true, this means that many elderly who are dependent on the “cardboard industry” to make a living will have to starve every other day as S$3.00 can hardly buy enough food for a day.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><em>EDITORS’ NOTE: Tomorrow, we will bring a series of exclusive interviews with Singaporeans on the most pressing question on our readers’ mind: who will you vote for if an election is held this year, the PAP or the opposition ?
