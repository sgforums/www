              <p>This foreign talent thingy is a sensitive topic. But seriously, if
              you are really strong, no one can bring you down. I believe RJC brought
              up this issue because they see JJC as a major threat now in the long
              run.</p>
              <p>And I can only say they are smart to borrow this issue to
              worsen the resentment here because everyone knows that this issue has
              been debated for so many years already. So do you smell a hidden agenda
              now? You guys decide. But that is politics already.</p>
              <p>Kinda sad to
              see how a simple game, like any other sports, driven by passion, dreams
              and glory, turned into something so black, dirty and fugly.</p>
              <p>And
              are you guys that unfeeling? Those foreign students are humans too. All
              they want is a pleasant environment to study and stuffs. Some of them
              came over without their parents. And most of them cried to bed missing
              their homeland. It is not easy for them. And before you wanna say
              things like <strong>nobody ask them to come here what!</strong>, try to respect
              that courage they have to leave everything behind to pursue their
              dreams in foreign lands like here first. Because, I doubt so you have.</p>
              <p>Apart from that, foreign talents promote competitions. So why not we take up the challenge?</p>

              <p>Singapore is a small city state. As of to date, we have 1 million strong work permit holders and growing (just work permit alone). Far more than our combined SAF soldiering forces. <br><br>Foreign Talent do not promote competion per se, as the PAP govt wants you to believe. It is too simplisitic a view to be uphold as a divine principle. <br><br>The whole idea of a country's competion is multi-faceted involving functioning of the govt to economy dynaminism to cultural attributes to population size to the people's ability to adapt and adopt with time etc.<br><br>The reality of having this huge pool of foreigners is simply because our population has been on the decline for the last 10 to 20 years. <br><br>With the race between HK and Sg to the finish line of zeroing corporate taxation; and with the switching of tax structure from direct to indrect, it makes good sense for our govt to flood Sg with foreigners to collect expenditure revenue tax.   <br> <br>We cannot have unlimited access to foreigners, without making us feeling displace as a people and overwhelm by this foreign influx, competing for limited resources of job, essentail services and healthcare services.</p>

              <p>You simply cannot deny that foreigners do tickle our culture and local mindset. At all level of the this society, from childrens to students to workers to top talent professionals, you cannot deny that there are clashes, even in my golf club where the elites of Singapore Chinese and China Chinese are against each other views and opinons. As human are territory bounded living thing, peoples will tend to protect their own space and home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, of course we can open our doors to foreigners, be it working or students, we do welcome them, but they also have to understand where they are, question raised will be, is Singaporeans going to suit them or are these foreigners going to suit into Singaporean culture. To most of them, both are facing a culture shock. It takes time, however I have to agree to some forumers here that there should be a limit to anything, when is the influx going to stop, what are the quotas required, all these have to be spell out by the govt, not simply just open the door and even allow cats and dogs to enter. Our govt had no other way in tackle the diminishing of population here, therefore welcome foreigners and hope that problem will be solve. I am afraid they may have forgotton the risk factor of doing it. It may cost them their seats in the parliament if they do not really look into the limitation of foreigners coming in. And worst, instead of increase the population, the setback can be a total dependent on foreigners that result in a revolution. They have to look into it, it is not that we dun welcome foreigners, with or without them, there are still quarrelling and fighting in games and sports, you can call that total committment or idiot.</p>
