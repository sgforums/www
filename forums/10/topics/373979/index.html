              <p><strong>Financial Times, 1 Sep 2009</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>West sparks Singapore fund shake-up</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The Government of Singapore Investment
              Corporation, one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds,
              yesterday announced a senior management shake-up prompted by concerns
              about protectionism and regulatory change in the west.</strong></span><br> <br> GIC, estimated by Deutsche Bank to have assets of about $300bn, said it
              had appointed Lim Chow Kiat to the new post of president for Europe,
              based in London, while Anthony Lim Weng Kin would become president for
              Americas, based in New York.<br> <br> The new regional heads - both internal appointments - will outrank the
              regional representatives of GIC's three investment subsidiaries and
              will be expected to promote contacts with policy makers and opinion
              formers as the fall-out from the global financial crisis becomes
              clearer.<br> <br> "The appointments come at a time when critical changes will be made to
              the global financial system, and there is a need for GIC to not only
              gather but also contribute deeper insights into investment
              opportunities and challenges in the coming years," GIC said.<br> <br> GIC declined to comment further on the appointments. However, Tony Tan,
              GIC's deputy chairman and executive director, said in a speech last
              month that Asian financial institutions faced both "tremendous
              opportunities" and major challenges in western countries.<br> <br> "A lack of co-ordination in regulatory architecture and practice,
              together with the rising global unemployment in coming years, may lead
              to regional trading and financial blocs or at worst, a retreat to
              protectionism and nationalism," he said.<br> <br> The latest GIC management shake-up follows the appointment in June of
              Lim Siong Guan, a former head of the Singapore civil service, as GIC
              group president.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The fund, chaired by Lee Kuan Yew, the former
              Singapore prime minister, says it intends to remain a long-term
              investor in western financial groups, in spite of unrealised losses on
              investments in UBS and Citigroup made at the onset of the financial
              crisis in late 2007.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Mr Lee said in February that the fund's value had fallen by 25 per cent from its peak because of the global financial turmoil.</strong></span><br> <br> Separately, Moody's credit ratings agency said yesterday that its
              ratings outlook for Singapore Power and PSA, the Singapore ports
              company, would be changed in the event of a material sale of stakes by
              Temasek, the city state's other sovereign wealth fund.<br> <br> Moody's said a new operating charter unveiled by Temasek last week was
              consistent with its existing aim of diversifying its holdings, and was
              factored into its rating. However, its ratings for PSA and Singapore
              Power benefited from its expectations of support by Temasek.<br> <br> --------------------------<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">Latest updates @ <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com</a><br> <br> 1.
