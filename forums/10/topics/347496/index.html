              <p>Ok, last try.
                  
                  Remember that guy, Mr. Tan Yong Soon? He actually lacks that sensitivity when he publicises his own travelogue (and indirectly his wealth and extravagence mind you)  when everyone is bracing themselves for hard times ahead. And worse, u see the govt justifying and defending their own people! I applaud Makeeda for her frank entry "Serve the public, don't feed off it" on this issue. She's right! What bad PR this is! The govt's image just gets worse by the day as the dirty linen gets uncovered each day...
                  
                  Which brings us to the topic about SALARY. $$$. It's such a sensitive issue, esp in hard times like this. And the govt keeps telling us to brace up for harder times ahead. I agree. But are they themselves setting a good example? This article which I've read, entitled "Boom Over - No More Fat Pay For Singapore CEOs" was written by a renowned writer in the media field. He wrote some CEOs are already taking the lead to take a cut in their salaries e.g. EO Liew Mun Leong of Singapore-based CapitaLand, South-east Asia's biggest property developer, said he will take a 20 per cent pay cut while the salaries of his senior executives will be cut from three to 20 per cent from January 2009.
                  
                  Will we see the govt ministers doing the same? 
                  
                  I wish the govt can start to really do something about their image. It's certainly not helping esp when we are relying on them to tide us thru this crisis and they make themselves seem like a wrong choice. Maybe they can start by taking a cut in their salaries.</p>

              <p>from what I read, they the greedy pap have cut their pay.   I don't think it is sufficient to just cut up to 20%.   They are not doing a good job.   Good times, strong GDP growth, they claim credit and never mention it is because of US we are enjoying growth, now with the current economy downturn they point fingers and put all blame to US.   </p>
              <p>They pay themselves so much - world class salary and mm lee claims that he has a team of talents, grade A ministers.    With these so called talented people and the obscene filthy salary they pay themselves they can't even save sg from being the first in asia to go into recession.</p>
              <p>Quit lah PAP!   YOu are hopeless!</p>

              <p>Bear is absolutely right. Ministers always hide behind the "civil servants" tag when all they are essentially are politicians. And by hiding behind this tag, all the typical everyday civil servants ploughing away to earn a decent living get their name sullied as well whenever the ministers do something insensitive [since they never do anything wrong].</p>
              <p><br>I can only hope that the general readership is discerning enough to know the difference between an everyday civil servant and our ministers.</p>
