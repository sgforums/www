However, the amount of meat is also much higher.<br>2) The outside price is about same price as, or even cheaper than, Jack's Place in Singapore (which is already much higher than food court). However, the portions are larger. Hence, eating out is actually cheaper than in Singapore if you like western food or lots of meat.<br>3) Most cheaper food in Singapore are mainly a source of carbs and trans-fats. Not exactly a very healthy diet.<br><br>In addition, supermarket prices of food stuff (meat, dairy products) are mostly the same, if not cheaper, than in Singapore. Only the vegetables are sometimes twice as expensive =&gt; which is still at a rather low price as compared to the meat and other things that you would buy.</div></blockquote>With the greatest respect, I think many of the issues you mentioned are peripheral. I could go on by telling you shopping bags aren't free in supermarkets in Germany either, but that doesn't make their service standards inferior to Asian countries just because they value environmental conservation more than Asians do.<br><br>To put your views in perspective, you may argue that a meal at McDonald's in London would easily set you back the equivalent of SGD10.00. That said, have you ever considered the minimum wage in the UK is Â£5.75 (SGD17.25) an hour? That translates to you being able to grab yourself a McDonald's meal for roughly half an hour's work. Could you do the same in Singapore if you were working at minimum wage levels (take the wages of the lowest-tier jobs imaginable given this regime doesn't have minimum wage) even though a meal costs just Â£2?</div>

The gahmen of Aus cares for the people first before any foreigners, they exercise their responsibility to protect the interest and rice bowl of the people there.  Over here, the sickening gahmen cares for FTs more than the locals.   This is reason enough for people to migrate to Aus.</div>

I could go on by telling you shopping bags aren't free in supermarkets in Germany either, but that doesn't make their service standards inferior to Asian countries just because they value environmental conservation more than Asians do.<br><br>To put your views in perspective, you may argue that a meal at McDonald's in London would easily set you back the equivalent of SGD10.00. That said, have you ever considered the minimum wage in the UK is Â£5.75 (SGD17.25) an hour? That translates to you being able to grab yourself a McDonald's meal for roughly half an hour's work. Could you do the same in Singapore if you were working at minimum wage levels (take the wages of the lowest-tier jobs imaginable given this regime doesn't have minimum wage) even though a meal costs just Â£2?</div></blockquote>I think you put it in better words than me. In short, wages in Germany is much higher than here, prices of their staple food is same, if not cheaper, than here. In addition, housing is also cheaper per unit land area, working hours are also shorter. Each employee is given at least 30 days of annual leave a year, and they have more public holidays than Singapore. Germany's education is also heavily subsidized, although they have made it mandatory to pay 500 euros per semester from this semester onwards in the uni. However, Germany's economy is not lagging at all, but growing, even with so many benefits; their economy is the 3rd largest in the world, after US and Japan. Their ministers are also not as highly paid as Singapore's, yet they can manage their big country just as well, if not better. Unemployment rates are also falling. All these facts are gotten from my module in economics over there in Germany by professor RÃ¼rup.<br><br>Fyi, regarding the plastic bags, you only need to pay for the plastic bags in the major supermarkets. Minor supermarkets or shops continue to provide free plastic bags to customers.</div>
