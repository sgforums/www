However you have to be prepared to adapt and start from square 1.<br><br>Another thing for what's it is worth - prepare for the culture shock - people here are very vocal. Alot of things function differently . When it is your credit , don't let others take it.  The first two years are the hardest imho because you are struggling to find your base and adapt. .<br><br>Find support with friends you already know but don't just stay within the Singaporean community because you will be isolating yourself from their culture. Join your colleagues for afterwork drinks - that is the best way of networking . And their weddings are fun - almost everyone gets drunk cept for the designated drivers who look very pissed off because they can't drink.<br><br>Don't think life is laid back all the time in Australia - alot of people have the misconception that working in Australia is laid back. It is yet  it is not . People here tend to be laid back when they can but when it comes to the crunch , some work 7 day weeks sometimes to meet deadlines.<br><br></div></blockquote>Thx 4 the advice dude...<br>It'll definately come in handy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

However, wouldn't 1) and 3) also apply to those who insist that people who have migrated have made a mistake?<br><br>It all comes down to a matter of each person's priorities.  If somebody's perfectly happy staying in Singapore, or if somebody's perfectly happy staying somewhere else, what business does anybody have telling him that he's wrong?<br><br>On the other hand, going back to the original thread, choosing to leave Singapore simply because one does not like it there (or conversely to stay simply because some other country has an undesirable characteristic) is not an entirely rational act - after all, what's to say that the simple absence of the problem is enough to make one happy?  It makes a lot more sense for someone to find a place that offers things that he likes and head that way.<br><br>Some people like what Singapore offers them and choose to stay and that's great.  Other people have found something in another country that they really like - why should anybody rain on their parade?</div>
