He was comparing Germany. Asian foods/groceries will be expensive in western countries and vice versa. But its is true that local foods tend to be carb laden.

            <div class='col-md body'>It all comes down to a personal value system, and whether you are able to migrate or not.<br><br>Consumer prices will continue to rise on a slightly steeper trend than other nations with a higher degree of self sufficiency. (e.g. have to buy sand and water). You can bite the bullet or pack up and go.<br><br>Many people prefer the western culture, where life/culture is pro family. Some prefer the buzz and faster paced local culture. I kow for fact, in Australia, in companies run by Australians, the general attitude is, at 6pm your boss will tell you to go home and have a life.<br><br>Just for an example to illustrate the difference in culture:<br><br>Its like a worker has to watch his kid's soccer game at school. He skipped work for a few hours on tuesday afternoon. A project dateline a week later, was delayed maybe a day or 2.<br><br>The boss can react in 1 of 2 ways<br><br>1 "Why weren't you at work tuesday afternoon? Is your son's soccer game that impt?"<br>2 "Why the project had to be delayed? How did your son do at the game btw"<br><br>Reaction 1 would probably be what you get here in SG. Although that may be changing.<br><br>of course there are other factors to consider, this is just an illustration.<br><br>Working culture aside, PRs and Citizens get preferential treatment in terms of employment. Meaning, a company has to justify to the government that it cannot find a Citizen or PR to do the job, before approval to hire a foreigner.<br><br>It also comes down to effort put into work vs creature comforts. Some poeple may think, "I live in a cosmopolitan city/nation, why do I still have the rice-bowl mentality?" I remember a loacl bank using a golden rice bowl in a current ad poster.<br><br>Sure there is always a sacrifice or a down side to uprooting and moving on to another nation. Then again, if the benefits out weigh the downside, and there are work-arounds (e.g. avoid highly crime prone areas). many would think, why not move?</div>
