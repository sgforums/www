How many Malays do you know of have migrated?<br><br>Singapore is small, limited by its land size. Younger Singaporeans are better educated and can have access to places outside Singapore for something different. Australia is big, english speaking, nearer to singapore, there is no harm really for anybody wanting some different lifestyle to consider migrating there.<br><br>If Canada were nearer, then more singaporean would consider moving to vancouver rather than perth, at least they don't have to live the four seasons upside down. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I know many people are now considering spending their retirement in southern China, like yunnan, where the weather is cool and air not polluted, cost of living is very very cheap.<br><br>I even know a few Singaporean who stay long term in Thailand.<br><br>The younger singaporean are better educated and qualified, many older singaporeans are relatively cash rich when their children are grown up, the fact that they want to stay in another country to enjoy life is a not a reflection of how bad singapore is, but they should thank their parents or the opportunity to have stayed in Singapore for the last 20 to 30 years, which put them in good position to have alternatives.</div>
