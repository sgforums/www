That's the main concern that I've heard from my acquaintances who've gone back. Nonetheless, they are very much in the minority.<br><br>Most are happy to remain overseas. No doubt, the food ain't cheaper. But the salaries are definitely better. If you miss sg food, just go back for a holiday. Not only does your higher salary enable you to, but the exchange rate as well.<br><br>A recent case that I'd encountered was a colleague's friend who'd just emigrated. She was fed up with the stress, pressure, long hours, and less-than satisfactory pay in sg.<br><br>All the 'quitters' that I've met in these overseas places all speak of the sillyporean system with great disdain. Funny enough, these sillyporean work conditions do manifest themselves sometimes overseas, when you end up working for a sg/asian boss.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  True, true.   Only the minority I come across come back.   This minority come back because of family commitment or can't find jobs there.   On the whole, the vast majority don't want to come back.  They rather pay high tax there than to come back here to face the PAP to be under their control.<br><br>Yeah, what I meant when I said 9 out of 10, that is based on me questioning people around and they said it is 9 out of 10 won't wanna come back.   If people here are just so unhappy that I did not post any statistic to show, then too bad!

They have always relied on a nanny state for everything, same logic as taking a domesticated bird and setting it free in the wild, the domesticated bird will not survive too long in the wild.<br><br>Those that have not returned, are the majority who are independent and capable (higher tier in intelligence), they can adapt to the new outside environment without having a nanny state to tell them everything. That's why Singapore is suffering a brain drain, the smart leave, we replenish them with 3rd world citizens and those returning back to Singapore are the rejects that cannot make it in the real world.</div>
