              <p>(A recall of an old post at asiaone.com)</p>
              <p>Who created it?<br> <br> A system of government which taxes the citizens and denies provisions
              of essential services to the people like housing, medicare,
              transportation and utilities. As if this is not burden enough to the
              people, the government went further to practise all kinds of creative
              accounting schemes to make double profits on lands acquired
              compulsorily from people at dirt cheap prices through HDB and URA and
              on disposals of assets and infrastructures to GLCs.<br> <br> Such a system means that citizens pay taxes and yet are not getting the
              entitled services resulting in many kidney and other chronic medical
              patients being left to be looked after by the people themselves through
              charity.<br> <br> When NKF was formed, of course, it lessened the burdens of many kidney
              patients who otherwise will have to struggle with their own expenses
              entirely without help to the relief of the government of Mr.</p>
              <p>Mrs. Goh Chok
              Tong of course were very grateful to whatever NKF and Durai were
              doing and were seen to be supporting the highest pay for Durai which she called
              peanuts.<br> <br> So who created the NKF problems? Government or NKF or Durai?</p>

              <p>I have shown you by rationale your chicken and egg logic was not very correct.

              <p>Nation building is a big issue concerning every citizen. One man is not enough and he should not try to claim credit. He should also be more willing to admit his past domination of every sphere of political life including suing political oppositions for the slightest negative remarks made in the course of electioneering or politicking as defamation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chicken or egg first ? Let all judge who caused all these NKF or Mas Selamat. If the root cause i.e. taxing hoarding taxes and creating surpluses and profiteering through HDB and all GLCs is not understood by leaders will we likely to solve our many problems like rising costs of living or upgrading the economy to value-adding technology-driven first-world economy talked about for years?</p>

              <p>It is very simple. There is no chicken or egg condition attached when people went to the poll to elect leaders to govern the country. Even if these leaders were elected without pays or with low pays they must still do their jobs well done and not give any excuses for any failure to try to explain them away or deny them with a chicken and egg poser.</p>
              <p>In the election the leaders do not tell the electorate they agree to stand for election only on certain conditions like they are not answerable for any failures beyond their control.</p>
              <p>They must show results and people are the final judge of any results or lack of results and people will remain their master and not become their servile slaves to let them do as they like due to any propaganda.</p>
              <p>Leadership should include ability to win over the people of all shape and sizes personality traits or dispositions. If they have no patience or personal EQ to win over the people in general and opponents as well they are not fit to be leaders period.</p>
              <p>Leaders must remain calm and act professionally and above board at all times no matter how trying the circumstances may be. If they cannot accept or tolerate criticisms right or wrong and try to fix them with underhand like sending cover agents to undermine civil views and opinions they are not good leaders.</p>
              <p>They must pass high standards of test such as the above-mentioned in order to lead the people with justice and equity, logic, rationale setting personal example with endurance of sacrifice as necessary like Nelson Mendela or Gandhi has done.</p>
              <p>Good leaders must answer to problems and issues as disclosed in NKF and not sue critics or oppositions for trying to question them over such problems.</p>
              <p>It is simply not right to put up all kinds of propaganda to make people look bad in order to make themselves too better especially in overseas visits to Middle East recently.</p>
              <p>This kind of government can be described simply as "Chih Li Bah Wai" or loosely translated "Biting the fingers that feed food" or "Getting filled at home while crawling out to serve others"</p>
              <p>It is wrong to use power to get their way like legalistic wrangling or passing all sorts of laws to get their way or to increase their own pays and rewards or undermine fair and free election like the GRC</p>
              <p>From the above review of our governing system it should be quite clear that our governing system has left much to be desired.</p>
              <p>This type of government is parochial and not sustainable especially in the internet age.</p>
              <p>Many loyal citizens here have put up their views on this subject with logic and rationale. There is an urgent need to overhaul the whole governing system for the better.</p>
              <p>Otherwise the government will continue to face criticisms and unhappiness as seen all over the island.</p>
              <p>Moreover our leaders are being paid handsomely at the world's highest salary for iron ricebowl bill collector without accountablity for major mistakes or errors as seen in Mas Selamat.</p>
              <p>He who pays the piper calls the tune. So it is wrong to keep denying or pushing away any problem by blaming on the people for wnatever reason.</p>
              <p>Your reference to the chicken and egg situation in any solving of problem is giving the leaders more excuses to deny problems.</p>
              <p>If MHA is not up to the mark he should offer his resignation at least. If PM cannot solve the major problems like the rising costs of living or doing business or failure in uplifting the quality of life as reported by international index, he should either resign or reshuffle his cabinet.</p>
              <p>By blaming any failure to solve major problems or sending a team of counter-insurgency agent to call them names or discourage them from giving views and opinions is very unprofessional.</p>
              <p>Government has been high handed and arrogant for too long now. It will be too naive to listen to all the propagandas and even putting on thinking cap.</p>
