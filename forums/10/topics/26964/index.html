            <div class='col-md body'>Its a known fact that the latest version of the Harpoon missile(I don't know which model) works like a mini-cruise missile. It can be used against both land and sea targets. And these missiles are already in use by the RSN. Singapore is rumoured to have an extensive constellation of 'spy' satellites in orbit around the equatorial region. I think that its is possible to extend the range of the current missiles maybe by the Singapore Technologies people. The terrain data of this region from the satelites together with GPS can be used to guide our missiles. The new Harpoons can then be adapted for use by the RSAF ,RSN and maybe even the Army! We can install these missiles on the MPA(Fokker) for the RSAF, frigates,corvettes and submarines for the RSN. We can even make a cruise missile launcher vehicle for the Army! Other than the Harpoon,another possible way is through the use of UAVs. Its is rumoured that the RSAF have acquired supersonic UAVs for fast and on the spot type of survellience on enemy targets. I propose that these UAVs(I think the name is Firefly, but not so sure) be converted to cruise missiles by adding a warhead instead of the cameras. I do not represent any government agencies. All the above are my own personal ideas. Please correct me if I made any mistakes in information given above.I wish to discuss the possibility and feasibility of my proposals. Please give me your views. Thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I have not heard of Singapore having any standoff weapons, unless you count the harpoon. Last I heard, the UAV was still a "possibility", possible under which context, I am not sure even. It has been published that Singapore has "silver bullets" for use in extreme scenarios, and "Defending Singapore In The 21st Century" wrote - As with other armed forces, the SAF will exploit developements in the field of stand-off precision technology. I doubt Singapore would openly declare that we have any standoff weapons, it would undoubtedly kick off an arms race and verbal wars from our neighbours up north.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh ya, recently, Malaysia has expressed an interest in the Indian-produced Brahmos. That's one mother of a a cruise missile (though its an ASM, there are thoughts about developing a land-attack version of the missile). But then, they've been expressing lot's of interest in just about everything, even India's ALH:<br>_____________________________________________________<br>Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) VP marketing Shmuel Eckhouse signed an agreement with Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL) of India a few days ago to jointly develop an attack helicopter.<br>This is the first agreement of its kind arising from the closer Israeli-Indian defense relationship.<br><br>IAI competed against Elbit Systems (Nasdaq: ESLTF) and France's Eurocopter in the HAL tender. IAI will participate both in the helicopter's development and marketing around the world.<br><br>The agreement follows IAI's strategic cooperation agreement with HAL to develop joint projects in India, Israel and third countries.<br><br>The project is called the Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH). HAL will manufacture the fuselage, while IAI will be responsible for developing its avionics and other advanced systems through its subsidiaries. The helicopter will probably use French-built engines.<br><br>The ALH is designed for attack, intelligence gathering and anti-tank and anti-submarine operations. The first customer will be the Indian Army, which is expected to order over 300. Each helicopter will cost about $4.5 million.<br><br>The ALH project is one of the joint projects with HAL under consideration by IAI.<br><br>IAI and HAL hope to interest other armies in addition to supplying the Indian Army. Israel is not expected to buy the helicopter, since the Israel Air Force uses only US-built attack helicopters, such as the Apache and Cobra.<br><br>Several countries, mainly in the Third World, have expressed interest in the ALH, including Vietnam, Nepal, Malaysia, and Trinidad and Tobago. Development of the ALH will probably be completed by 2004-05.<br>____________________________________________________<br><br>Also, in a recent Flight International article, some avaition industry sources said that though the notification to congress stated a possible sale of 18 SuperHornets, the probable number was more likely 12.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In fact an arm race has already begun to some extend.Several major acquisitions recently by our northern neighbour.As i said earlier on.Malaysia is speeding up its train to close its gap with singapore even in terms of military supremacy in the SEA region<br>.<br>Well......singapore is one nation that are really secretive about its arm inventories regardless of which defense related services.<br>Having acquired Stand-off missiles or some other sophisticated arms  is not unexpected.If singapore happens to get US arms<br>Mmmmm.........quite possible such procurement report will be publish officially over government Website its no escape from the press.(so drop the idea of any cruise missile or stand-off missile from the US)<br><br>I believe all of here has heard about the possible existent of israelis Popeye Stand-off in RSAF.The possiblility is petty high , since singapore independence the armed forces has close military technology collaboration and ties with the israeli.<br><br>Your opinion??????? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

I think this would greatly simplify any logistic issues that may occur. It is much easier to maintain just 1 model of missile, which is quite versatile now. Since the RSN, and perhaps RSAF, has much experience in Harpoons already,  this Block 2 upgrade seems very likely.<br><br>As for Popeyes in SAF service, I think we've talk about this before some time ago. Anyways, If the US is unwilling to sell them to us, we can always go to the Isrealis for the missiles. They would greatly boost our Air to Surface capability. There is a definite possibility that Popeyes could be acquired, or has already been acquired.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with EXCO's point of solving logistical problems if the Harpoon can be used as a cruise missile against land targets. It can also serve as a sort of disguise for the cruise missile's real purpose. What about the UAV option can anyone with information please comment on this possibility? I have a few questions: What is a standoff weapon? and What is  popeye missile? Please provide links if possible,thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
