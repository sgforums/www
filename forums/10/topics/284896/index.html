            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: Farmers at the Lim Chu Kang area have sent a petition with 1,000 signatures to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, calling for an end to storing granite in their backyard.<br><br>The government has explained that storing granite is part of its strategy to ensure that there is an adequate supply of essential building materials to tide the construction industry over in the short term, due to IndonesiaÂ’s ban in granite exports to Singapore.<br><br>The granite stockpile, which nearly covers an area of 20 football fields, is located in the Kranji countryside where a variety of fruits and vegetables is produced.<br><br>The 20 farmers who form the Kranji Countryside Association are worried that their crops may be affected, despite efforts by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) to reduce dust by erecting a 6mÂ—high fence around the granite stockpile.<br><br>That is why they decided to send their produce, along with the petition, to the prime minister at the Istana, hoping that he could help reverse the decision to store granite in their backyard.<br><br>Kenny Eng, ViceÂ—President of Kranji Countryside Association, said: "When we started the petition, we just wanted to see for ourselves whether Singaporeans and tourists felt the same way. Within a short twoÂ—andÂ—aÂ—half weeks, we hit 1,000 signatures. It shows that Singaporeans are really concerned."<br><br>One of the Singaporeans said: "This is probably the only place (countryside) left in Singapore. So I think the granite should not be placed here."<br><br>A tourist said: "The dust and the debris from the concrete, etc could have an effect on the plants."<br><br>"ItÂ’s a great shame; they are trying to get children interested in the environment by teaching them about vegetables. A lot of children should see the sort of landscape that was Singapore before so many buildings went up," another said.<br><br>Farmers at Kranji are also worried that the fence around the granite stockpile may prevent sunlight from reaching the farms.<br><br>They agreed that granite stockpiling is necessary, but they do not want it in their backyard.<br><br>But the BCA, which has consulted the farmers, explained that it had already studied possible sites for stockpiling and Lim Chu Kang was selected because it is away from densely builtÂ—up urban areas.<br><br>BCA also added that due care would be taken to mitigate any negative impact on the environment, which includes having a designated route for trucks, and adequate drainage to discharge rainwater.<br><br>Â— CNA/so</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I refer to the letter published in the forum by Ivy Singh, ST 15 Oct,2007. I noticed that the granite was barged at Tuas, I wonder why they dont store the granite at Tuas, an industrial area rather than transport 30km to Lim Chu Kang, what is the reason government will give?</div>

Urban visitors flock there on weekends.<br><br>About 10 farmers had banded together in 2005 to form the Kranji Countryside Association to promote the area. The association now has around 20 members.<br><br>It argued that a stockpile there, along with trucks regularly ferrying in granite, would hurt the farms and despoil the area.<br><br>On Oct 9, it sent a petition to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong with more than 1,000 signatures in a bid to 'save Singapore's countryside'.<br><br>Yesterday, the ministry's spokesman explained that the recent Indonesian sand ban and granite restrictions illustrated the strategic importance of a local stockpile.<br><br>Also, the land is listed as a 'reserve' site, meaning there is no fixed use for this land for the next 15 to 20 years.<br><br>The spokesman reassured the farmers that the ministry has a programme to monitor the water and soil conditions in the area. It will ensure that disruptions are minimised.<br><br>But Mrs Ivy Singh-Lim, the association's president, was not placated.<br><br>She insisted that the same arguments were being trotted out by the ministry.<br><br><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">She said: 'I would like to invite the Prime Minister down on a weekend to see the hundreds of children and families here. If, after that, he can still say that the stockpile here is the right thing to do, then I shall accept it.'</span> </span></strong><br><br></blockquote>An open invitation to the PM.
