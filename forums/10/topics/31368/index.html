There is a multitude of legislations that control business practices and the type of business that private enterprise can involve itself with. The current saga in the control of NatSteel is one of Private Money versus the preferred Government approved Personalities to take over this GLC in the supposed divestment of GLCs.<br><br>Â“Our Government does not control Schools?Â”<br><br>Try opening a Private School and not run afoul of legislations that controls and monitor the activities of education.<br><br>How do you explain the fact that there are so many PAP linked Kindergarten Schools built and located at the void decks of HDB Flats; and yet there is a dearth of similar Opposition Party run Kindergarten in the HDB Heartlands of Opposition Controlled Constituencies?<br><br>The official reason given - in obstructing the setting up of Kindergartens to be operated by Opposition Parties - is that such educational facilities operated by the Opposition Parties will run counter to the educational policies set by the Ruling Political Party.<br><br>The Ruling Politicians have politicized education at the kindergarten levels; yet the irony of it all is that when Students reach University or Tertiary Level of education, the same students are systematically de-politicized Â– all Â“activities with political overtonesÂ” conducted by tertiary level students, are closely monitored and systematically controlled.<br><br>The Government still does not control Religion, Businesses and Schools?<br><br></div>

If you are aiming for a society like that in the US, I would like to ask if the Singaporean population is mature enough to live in such a society?  I know of a russian defector, many years ago who commented that Singaporeans don't appreciate alot of things the gov't does. . . little things like your CPF will mean alot to you when you are old and can't work,<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> btw, the retirement age in the US is over 70, that retirement age was set long ago when most people died before hitting 70. . . , the US gov't dun want to pay too much retirement benefits. . ., is that a better deal for you??? oh yah, and now in the US you have an option of a fixed deposit set aside for old age, it is not taxed and some employers do contribute to such a fund for employees, sound like Singapore's CPF eh?<br><br>How many Singaporeans will dare think differently on issues, or even dare to look at the Â“other side of the coinÂ” with an open mind?<br><br>How many dare to think and write their thoughts clearly and cut through issues with an honest eye?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Chee Soon Juan, although I for one definitely DO NOT support any of his 'honest' thoughts and written work.<br><br>How many truly believe that Politics is best left to Politicians?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I don't and I agree with you mainly on one point, that Singaporeans should take an active interest in the politics of their country, But i do not think that the gov't has 'discouraged' in any form, Singaporeans from taking on such an interest. . . Note that the crowd who visit 'Chit Chat', 'Food' and 'Politics' differ to some extent and that people who do visit Sgforums do so for different reasons.<br><br>and I'm 14 (this year anyway) and yah, I'm the only one in class visiting such forums (I think) . . .and to foxtrout8, dunno why this hasn't helped my history and social studies. . . classmates, most of whom mug the whole day and some even A and O level textbook (note: we were in sec 2 this year), do better than me. . .<br><br></div></blockquote>and Atobe, no offence meant to you in this post, hopefully none taken, i don't mind a moderate opposition to the gov't like your's, just don't give Singaporeans any more Chee Soon Juans. . .</div>

The compensation amount is way beyond the norm of other countries in the Commonwealth Â– which Singapore is member of; and such punitive amount is to numb the enthusiasm of any Singaporeans who dare enter the Political Realm.<br><br>The other efforts to numb the Singaporean mind, is the involvement of Singaporean heartlanders to the mundane issues of their immediate community, and take his attention from the Main Political Issues that affect Singapore.<br><br>Their active participation in the political process is limited to voting for the upgrading of your neighborhood, but there will be no Referendum Voting for the increase of GST Â– which will go up by 33.3333 PERCENT, when it is increased from 3% to 4%. The numbed Singaporean mind have been persuaded to accept this REASONABLE increase, and generosity of the Government in making it a 2-step increase instead of shooting for a GST of 5% - which will be a shocking 60 percent increase from 3% !!!<br><br>A fine political system and Government Rule would be that of Korea in 2002, where an unknown citizen can be elected to be a President, and where the ENTIRE Government machinery RESPECT the PeopleÂ’s Choice, and obey the command of the ELECTED leader.<br><br>In SingaporeÂ’s experience with the Elected Presidency, when the late Ong Teng Cheong was Â“electedÂ” as the Â“PeopleÂ’s ChoiceÂ” Â– (actually the entire process was a show, as there were only two candidates that have been approved and put up by the PAP) Â– and when he asked for an accounting of the Government Investment Corporation, and the SingaporeÂ’s Reserve, he was stone-walled.<br><br>He was told that it will be impossible to do so, and that it will take 52 man-years to prepare this report. The Report was finally grudglingly produced on the part of the Government.<br><br>Yet the Elected Presidency is suppose to hold the Second Key to protect our Reserves. This authority was 'fine tuned', 'clarified" and amended to suit the Government's position.<br><br>With so many PAP appointed persons holding all the key positions of Government, what will happen when a popular Opposition Party should be elected to form the next Government, as had happened in Taiwan?<br><br>Will the entire country be thrown into chaos, with the Government machinery frozen, as the new Government will NOT be able to use funds that it has not accumulated to run the new Government? Will the PAP Political Appointees sitting in all the key positions of Government and Semi-Government Bodies Â“sabotageÂ” the Government machinery that is now supposedly in the hand of an Elected Opposition Party?<br><br>This had happened in Taiwan, when the Taiwanese Opposition DPP won the election but was obstructed and prevented from effective rule by the Kuomintang Political Appointees put in place over the years by the out-going Kuomintang Government.<br><br>Concerning the CPF payout, it was initially planned that the payout will be in full at the age of 55 years. Then came a host of schemes to Â“look afterÂ” the same people, as life expectancy was supposed to have been prolonged, and the same people Â“could notÂ” look after themselves. Additional funds were then prevented from being drawn out for the sake of Medisave, Special Accounts, and now you are AUTOMATICALLY signed up to a CPF Insurance Plan if you do not object Â– (this is against the guidelines of the Insurance Act).<br><br>There are many Â“Political ThinkersÂ” in Singapore. Dr Chee Soon Juan has good personal intentions for Singapore Â– being a HDB heartlander himself Â– and reading his books, you can discern his ideas come from careful thinking. Certainly his inexperience in the early days of his involvement in politics have cost him dearly. His efforts have not been helped very much by a system that controls the media and all information that the public receives. Try meeting him at his public forum, and listen to some of his speeches, and question and answers sessions. Give him some credit for effort at least Â– even J.B.Jeyaratnam has finally won recognition for his sincerity from DPM, when the SM had accused him as a Â‘charlatanÂ’, and had drilled him to the ground.<br><br>It is great to know that you are interested in Politics at this age, but let not the local press mould your own thought process. Visit all the sites on the Web, both the Government controlled, and the Opposition controlled, and the International sites, then form your own thoughts and views. DonÂ’t be jingoistic about being a true Singaporean must be loyal to Government alone.<br><br>A true Singaporean is true to Singapore, and for the sake of Singapore, we should think for the best system for Singapore, not what the Government think is best for us.<br><br>Politics reserve for Politicians only ?<br><br></div>
