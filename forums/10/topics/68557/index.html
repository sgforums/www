Badawi (or more affectionately called 'Pak Lah' by all Malaysians).<br><br>'Pak Lah' was the Malaysian Foreign Minister before taking on the role of being the Deputy Prime Minister, and as the previous FM, he had a tremendously good relationship with almost everyone in the Singapore Cabinet.<br><br>The humilty of 'Pak Lah' to plan a visit to Singapore to present the design of the 'New Bridge' to replace the Causeway, certainly is a refreshing approach in bilateral relationship.<br><br>Is there a new waft of fresh air clearing the old ways of business in the Malaysian Government, in the manner that they conduct business with the Singapore Government ?<br><br>No more the 'Abang and Adek' mind set ?</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: green;"><span class="large">KL to show S'pore new designs for causeway </span> </span></strong><br>KUALA LUMPUR -- Malaysia will submit fresh proposals to Singapore to try to resolve an impasse over a new bridge Malaysia wants to build to connect the two neighbours, news reports said on Monday.<br><br>Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi is expected to soon present Singaporean officials with new design ideas for the bridge, which would replace a causeway that nearly 100,000 Malaysians currently use to commute to work in the city-state, said Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar.<br><br>The official Bernama news agency quoted him as having said: 'We will then see what Singapore's response is. I think if there is a right spirit on both sides, these are matters which are not impossible to resolve.'<br><br>Malaysian officials have said the new bridge, which it hopes to complete by the end of 2005, would ease congestion and boost passenger flow between the two countries.<br><br>The project had earlier been part of a package deal that included an extension of Malaysia's water supply to Singapore beyond 2061.<br><br>But the plan stalled when Malaysia called off talks in 2002, after it alleged that Singapore was not prepared to pay fair rates for the water. The two sides did not agree on a design for the new bridge before the talks collapsed.<br><br>Malaysian officials said last year they did not need approval from Singapore to begin work on the bridge. But without the Republic's approval, the new bridge could end dangling in the middle of Johor Strait, which separates the two neighbours.<br><br>Singapore's Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar recently said that Malaysia would be violating international law if it unilaterally pursues the plan to demolish its side of the causeway and start work on a new bridge.<br><br>Leaders of both countries said last month they wanted to work to settle a string of disputes that have hampered relations for years, including territorial claims, the price of water that Malaysia supplies to Singapore, and the use of military airspace. -- AP<br><br>Extracted from the Straits Times, Tuesday Edition, 3 Feb 2004<br>This news article will be archived from the following site by<br>6 Feb 2004:<br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/latest/story/0,4390,233136-1075759140,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/latest/story/0,4390,233136-1075759140,00.html?</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When we made a decision, it is by weighing the pros and cons. If it is all pros and no cons, then there shouldn't be a dilemma in implementing the idea straight away. If it is all cons and no pros, then forget it, the idea is silly<br><br>For the bridge issue, if water is allow to flow through the causeway, wat <strong>benefits </strong>do singapore get ?<br><br>If we let the old causeway remains, or we improves the structure using the existence foundations, the cost will be kept lower too isn't it ? And another problem I had raised is the potential of Malaysian to allow small boats like tugboats to pass through. The straits may be narrow, but the ship now r more nimble.

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe the tugboat is a wrong term to use. However from a website from Maesk, the width of a boat can go to as low as 25m. HOw wide is the causeway ? It is 1056 m, which can be considered as the shortest distance between singapore and malaysia. HOw many 25 metres ship can filled 1 km ? 40 ships sailing side by side. How wide do u think suez canal is ? The minimum width is <strong>60m</strong> Wat is the problem then ? About your traffic issue, they can follow Suez Canal and state that the ship should move in one direction only. It is <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">achievable</span></strong><br><br>http://www.maersksealand.com/<br>http://geography.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http%3A%2F%2Fi-cias.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Feo-direct-frame.pl%3Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fi-cias.com%2Fe.o%2Fsuez_can.htm<br><br>And wat has your sembawang shipyard got to do with anything ? All it ever says is tat OCEAN going vessel can go through half of the route along singapore, and a small one can easily navigates for the remaining journey. In the past singapore is able to dredge to make the water deeper. Do u think malaysia can't do the same for area near pulau ubin ?<br><br>http://www.mse.com.my/businesses/shiprepair.html<br><br><blockquote>I will give you an OSCAR equivalent for great scientific thinking.<br><br>For Achimedean Principle to work, the amount of water rise or displaced, will depend on the amount of mass being added - NOT removed.<br><br>A rise in sea water level around Pulau Ubin, caused by water being released with the existing Causeway being demolished ?<br><br>The deposits have been - since time immemorial - flowing down the rivers from Peninsula Malaya into the Straits, with or without the bridge, the deposits have been carried and flowing in and around the vicinity of Ubin and Tekong. </blockquote>I believe u probably fail to understand tat I am NOT talking about your regular BATHTUB. We r talking about the sea currents movement ! If the bridge is clear, sea current will be able to flow freely not just at the southen end of singapore but at the northen end as well. During certain seasons, due to the different temperature of different bodies of water, sea current will moves from the eastern end of singapore to the western end or vice versa. Since the velocity of these water is fast, they will tend to cary away sendiments with them. As such, the depth of the water around the region will goes deeper. If these water is through, it will be able to clear away the sentiments brought over by the malaysia river as well.<br><br><blockquote><br>Nothing except the budget - and its their ringgit anyway.<br><br>Nothing can stop Malaysia to do anything to do whatever they must do; but certainly the cutting on their side will be anything except 'SLIGHTLY'.<br><br>It will have to be a major effort in not only cutting the sides of the shore lines, but also DREDGING THE SEA BED for the ENTIRE DISTANCE of the Johor Straits - beginning from the mouth of the Straits.<br><br>If the Southern Ports located in Johor State are to be successful - especially that at Pasir Gudang - they will need to have enough manouvering space along the Johor Straits.<br><br>Johor State will have to see a major land slip into the waters of the Straits - up to 1 km wide, along its entire southern coastline facing Singapore, which will result in the loss of Johor Bahru, including the majestic Sultan's Palace, the Straits View Hotel, and quite a large cut of commercial, industrial and residential properties. </blockquote>Is the water distance between singapore and malaysia really tat shallow ? I doubt it as 60m in distance will be sufficient for small vessel to pass through like in Suez Canal. Will the work involved be tat incredibly great ? We r working on existing sea bodies (not dry land) with the new improved technology today, for a short distance. Do u think malaysia cannot afford to do such work ?<br><br><blockquote><br>Surely, the ball is in their court, and as PM GCT had said they will have to give us a good reason why the existing Causeway need to be demolished, and replaced with a new bridge that will cost us at least $500million.<br><br>Perhaps for the sake of long term goodwill between the two countries, Singapore will probably accept the New Bridge being constructed.

If they just wanted the causeway to modernise, it can still be done, and more cheaper and safer if the old foundation is left alone. We can still negotiate with the malaysian since their main objective is just to modernise the causeway. Wat pros do we have for making the water being able to pass through ? It may turn life threathening if we r too complacent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why would any ships want to waste their time docking at 1 end of malaysia, to put them ships onto smaller boats to ship to the other end at pasir gudang, only to re-load it back onto another ship when they can save all that trouble and just dock at singapore and let us handle it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WHy do u think they will have a problem docking at one end of malaysia, then change to a smaller boat and send the goods directly to the region ? They could easily use the smaller ship and sails direct to Indonesia, Vietnam etc isn't it ? Wat is more, these smaller vessel can still fare well in seas. Wat is the problem of them travelling directly to Australia or China if the goods tat need to be transported isn't of a great volume ?</div>

The Suez canal (or Kra Canal, if it's ever built) is taken out of necessity as the alternative is a much, much longer trip around the long end.<br><br>however, the island of Singapore does not represent such a great Bocking mass and it will be far more economical, faster, and safer to travel around the long way with top notch ports in the way then inch along through a tiny congested bottleneck for safety purposes.
