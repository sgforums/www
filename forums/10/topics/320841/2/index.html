              <p>You are still trying to argue with me when you have no leg to stand on?</p>
              <p>Don't even bother telling me to find out how polyclinics get their subsidies. Simple fact: Polyclinic doctors are paid an amount per month to function unlike private GPs. Simple fact 2:  Private GPs pay their own rental, their own salaries and staff/operating costs. A simple assumption : Private GPs do not have large bulk discounts from medical or pharmaceutical companies because they are not big enough to profit from. The government releases tenders for supply and usually the cheapest gets in. So taking an average bill from a private GP doesn't really cut it for me if that is where you get your info from.</p>
              <p><strong>Go read out how much the overall direct patient subsidies are  - and I quote - overall patient subsidies exceeded more than 1.6 billion and projected to exceed 2.2 billion by 2012. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I don't see hundreds of billions of dollars.</span></strong> Those are totals.</p>
              <p>I attached a government release for your reference. http://www.moh.gov.sg/mohcorp/uploadedFiles/Means-Testing/Healthcare%20We%20Can%20All%20Afford.pdf</p>

              <p>Goodboy. I am glad you listened to me and re-read my posts and
                  study those links. " You don't see" is a dangerous trait for
                  someone who claims to work in the medical industry.</p>
              <p>"Subsidies come from government for some categories of our
                  population (how many percent of the population  - I won't
                  know)"  - <strong>just won't cut it. How could you, a
                  singaporean, not KNOW where the subsidies comes
                  from?</strong> Either you are not a singaporean or
                  don't wish to admit the truth.</p>
              <p>I am not here to give you a free education. Go work it out
                  yourself if you dispute my extrapolation. I have wasted enough time
                  as it is with you.</p>
              <p>Here's something to help you. After that, do crawl back into
                  your rubbish bin. Maths made simple:-</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>LOL take your own advice about being Singaporean , the rubbish bin and the mathematics involved.  </strong></span></p>
              <p>I said I won't know what is the percentage of the population would use public beds not private beds . Some people could go to private hospitals and private doctors. <strong>Care to give an estimate percentage of the population that gets admitted into the hospital  currently in Singapore ? The rates are published but how many people in the whole population use public beds?  </strong>That means no counting of duplicate admissions of the same person and give a separation between each person using a publicly subsidised beds. Some people don't even need hospital admissions. Some would need repeat admissions - but even MOH doesn't give figures on repeat admissions. <strong><br> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Usually they count based on  rate of admissions/discharges ,episodes and length of stay in the hospital or the number of attendances/visits in a polyclinic  . Check your regular MOH statistics. <br></strong></p>
              <p>I am not here to give you an education either but it seems that you need one badly when it comes to the healthcare system statistics. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Would it hurt so much to say that your stats are overinflated and wrong because you used the wrong calculation methods ?  Nope , you choose to go on the emotional defensive. </span></strong></p>

              <p>Deerhunter, this forum doesn't care whether you support PAP or SDP or WP or any other opposition, or whether you are Gazelle or clones a not. But as long as you maintain your rudeness, you are not welcomed at all. The same goes even in the society outside.</p>
              <p>Even if you are constantly being the vent for rude people outside, you are a plain loser by choosing to hide behind an online identity to throw rude remarks to others.</p>

              <p>The government did show an expenditure of $1.6 billion for the year ended 2006 as claimed by the Elmer Fudd's link. (Deer Hunter weminds me of Elmer Fudd hunting for wabbits).</p>
              <p>But the government failed to show the profits from hospitals, the $1.6 billion are all transfers for operating expenditure. What happened to the profits from Hospital Beds, Surgeries, Test and A&amp;E?</p>
              <p>According to SGH, their patient days is around 400,888, which would rake in approximately $50 million for SGH alone. The surgeries performed in SGH alone is around 70,000, with an approximated cost of $5,000 per surgery, it would rake in approximately $350 million for SGH. SGH alone would make roughly around $400 million to 500 million. What about the other hospitals?</p>

              <p>Deerhunter has to learn that for himself to defend his statement of <em></em></p>
              <p><em>"Many here believe that our govt hoards money or they are all
                                      very rich. The truth is that whatever that is in our treasury is
                                      OUR money. It composes of our CPF savings as well as our Nation's
                                      tax revenues, including budgets surpluses, due to conservative
                                      spending. The govt is not rich. They are only caretakers of our
                                      money. And as such, they have to be very very careful with it."</em></p>
              <p>One should actually also ask why the ministers get paid so much like MNC CEOs when they are only caretakers of such a small country - even the president of united states gets paid less than our precious ministers.</p>
