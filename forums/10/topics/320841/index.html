              <p>Many here believe that our govt hoards money or they are all very rich. The truth is that whatever that is in our treasury is OUR money. It composes of our CPF savings as well as our Nation's tax revenues, including budgets surpluses, due to conservative spending. The govt is not rich. They are only caretakers of our money. And as such, they have to be very very careful with it.</p>
              <p>Many want more welfare and social action, including giving handouts from our budget surpluses and <strong>$300billion (S$414.3billion)</strong> reserves.</p>
              <p>It seems alot of money, but just take a lot on some of the examples on providing health care costs alone.</p>
              <p>Singapore's top killer is Cancer. At least 26% of the population around 3.5million contracts it. That means 910,000 citizens. To cure cancer, it would cost around $300,000 and rising for one patient. That would mean<strong> S$273 billion</strong> set aside just to cure our citizens of cancer, leaving only S$141 billion, even though not all will need medical attention at the same time, of course!</p>
              <p>Heart disease is the second greatest killer in Singapore. The usual fee is around S$50,000 per citizen = another <strong>$45 billion</strong> set aside to help our citizens at 80% subsidy.</p>
              <p>Just these 2 killers alone will cost our country <strong>S$318 billion</strong>. What about education, government, military, and other social costs? And not to mention a significant portion of it is CPF to be returned to citizens?</p>
              <p>Point is - can we afford to provide more social welfare, espacially in medical aid, costs which are outside of our nation's control, without incurring more tax revenues such as GST, more so on our young?</p>
              <p>Or should we invest our reserves in a careful manner so that it may bring long term returns on investments?</p>
              <p>As these are our monies, would you dare trust just any joker who fights for 'freedom of speech', distorts reality, spreads anarchy to handle and run our funds?</p>
              <p>Do think, before one accuses the govt of not caring enough. The govt has no money. It is our money that will be prudently used. If everyone asks for handouts, then where will the money come from, other than from each of us who are slotting hard together, contributing to make Singapore a better place?</p>
              <p>Disclaimer. The figures are not precise, but just in general only. For exact and precise figures, please go to the relevant department of statistics for it. This post is written simply and for general consumption.</p>

              <p>As mentioned, the S$273 billion will not be used at the same minute, as not all current citizens will be diagnosed with cancer the same second. The money will for that purpose will be depleted and will be gradual over time.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>They pay lower salaries to nurses from other countries because it cuts down on healthcare costs. There is a huge world wide shortage of nurses to the point where the poorer african countries have appealed to WHO not to let the richer developed nations take their own nurses.</p>
              <p>Qualified graduates from the polytechnics don't earn as much as the other developed nations. Seriously - the salary cannot be even compared without them considering running out.</p>
              <p>The only reason why I think they have a bachelor of nursing course now is because they found out that other countries like Australia and UK are hijacking Singaporean trained nurses easily off their workforce. How? When the bachelor of nursing in Singapore was non-existent , nurses used to go overseas to acquire the degree and on the way the registration in the respective Australian states (which made it easier for migration) or UK to work part time or as a casual.</p>
              <p>Compared to the crap  hours , salaries, working etiquette (where a doctor is obeyed without questions) and patient workloads that Singapore have, Australia is heavenly. They are trying to make the leakage of nurses smaller by superficially glorifying it . That is my personal view .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The higher cost of medical care cannot be negated easilywhen you are talking about upgrading direct patient care personnel  (dr/nurses/PT/OT) in the latest medical breakthrough or equipment.</p>
              <p>However I think there can be savings made by cutting off the bureacratic ranks . Singapore doesn't even need separate groups  running the hospitals on the north, south, east , west because Singapore is too small . One centralised authority will be able do it .</p>
              <p>Furthermore , I have the priviledge of working overseas and I noted what some healthcare bodies do to generate income innovatively - they come up with some kick arse application which is good ,test it in some hospitals,debug it improve it to a commercial standard and they sell it to the private sector , other states or EVEN OTHER COUNTRIES- the monies come back to them for use.

              <p>I don't think the government is so open about how much it spends in detail. However I would appreciate any sources that substantiate your calculations because the equations are too simplistic. Did you remember to include casemix in? Different drgs and procedural codes have different costing. I would love to check on which drg or ICD9/10  codes you based your calculations on.</p>

              <p>Thus the expenditure for advertising to inform the general public to keep healthy, as well as research grants for EDB's A star teams to come out with better cures, and the setting up of a bio-tech hub in our country.

              <p>Deerhunter - what are your qualifications if you claim to speak for the people and go around estimating costs to prove that the government has next to nought in its coffers?</p>
              <p>The reason why I know about casemix and drgs  is because I used to work on the data sets and costings  with the people who actually created casemix (in Australia). Singapore bought the casemix system to use it to control costs. That is why I am questioning you. I also used to work in the Singaporean healthcare system and I know how the system works in Singapore. So who are you really to tell me to tone down? </p>
              <p>Even the government will be cautious about saying that they have nothing in their coffers or cannot afford more medical subsidies. It demoralises the people. The stance the Singaporean govt has been taking differs from what you are saying. It is because they don't want people to be reliant on a welfare system and abuse the system , thereby creating a burden  for the country .  That has always been their stance. Not because they cannot afford it</p>

              <p>a. Where the 80% of subsidy for a high medical bill comes from for 26% of our population affected by cancer.</p>
              <p>b. Where the 80% of subsidy for a high medical bill comes from for 26% of our population affected by heart disease.</p>
              <p>c. Where the additional S$17 comes from for a patient who seeks outpatient treatment in govt clinics (S$8) as opposed to private ones whom charges an average S$25</p>
              <p>I will make it simple for you. You don't have to pull data from medical statistics. Just focus the answer to one average salaried person whom has to pay S$300,000 for his medical expenditure and tell me where his subsidy comes from.</p>

              <p><br> Emotional? No. But don't worry. I think this argument is healthy as
              long as it sticks to the facts, as compared to ones by some
              others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree with you that it MAY make no sense to you, for what we
              are dealing here is clearly a complex issue dealing with our
              reserves as well healthcare costs with a demographically changing
              aging population, with the inclusion of FT/FW/PR factor thrown
              in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you mentioned - "If you want to post an opinion which
              generalises everything to defend the government's apparent lack of
              money , be prepared to defend it."</p>
              <p>Fine. If you dispute my figures and methodology on where the
              money comes from, then please show to the man on the street:-</p>
              <p>a. Where the 80% of subsidy for a high medical bill comes
              from for 26% of our population affected by cancer.</p>
              <p>b. Where the 80% of subsidy for a high medical bill comes
              from for 26% of our population affected by heart disease.</p>
              <p>c. Where the additional S$17 comes from for a patient who seeks
              outpatient treatment in govt clinics (S$8) as opposed to
              private ones whom charges an average S$25</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>And your lovely quote</p>
              <p>Many want more welfare and social action, including giving
              handouts from our budget surpluses and <strong>$300billion
              (S$414.3billion)</strong> reserves.</p>
              <p>It seems alot of money, but just take a lot on some of the
              examples on providing health care costs alone.</p>
              <p>Singapore's top killer is Cancer. At least 26% of the population
              around 3.5million contracts it. That means 910,000 citizens.
              To cure cancer, it would cost around $300,000 and rising for one
              patient. That would mean <strong>S$273 billion</strong> set aside
              just to cure our citizens of cancer, leaving only S$141 billion,
              even though not all will need medical attention at the same time,
              of course!</p>
              <p>Heart disease is the second greatest killer in Singapore. The
              usual fee is around S$50,000 per citizen = another <strong>$45
              billion</strong> set aside to help our citizens at 80% subsidy.</p>
              <p>Just these 2 killers alone will cost our country <strong>S$318
              billion</strong>. What about education, government, military, and
              other social costs? And not to mention a significant portion of it
              is CPF to be returned to citizens?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <br>
              <p>I will make it simple for you. You don't have to pull data from
              medical statistics. Just focus the answer to one average
              salaried person whom has to pay S$300,000 for his medical
              expenditure and tell me where his subsidy comes from.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are still trying to argue with me when you have no leg to stand on?</p>
              <p>Don't even bother telling me to find out how polyclinics get their subsidies. Simple fact: Polyclinic doctors are paid an amount per month to function unlike private GPs. Simple fact 2:  Private GPs pay their own rental, their own salaries and staff/operating costs. A simple assumption : Private GPs do not have large bulk discounts from medical or pharmaceutical companies because they are not big enough to profit from. The government releases tenders for supply and usually the cheapest gets in. So taking an average bill from a private GP doesn't really cut it for me if that is where you get your info from.</p>
              <p><strong>Go
              read out how much the overall direct patient subsidies are  - and I quote - overall
              patient subsidies exceeded more than 1.6 billion and projected to
              exceed 2.2 billion by 2012.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> I don't see hundreds of billions of dollars.</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>Those are totals.</p>
              <p>I attached a government release for your reference.

              <p>You asking my qualifications? In this forum? And i claim to

              <p>Spit it out. What's your agenda. I had thought we would have a
              healthy debate, but with you this latest post, I guess it wouldn't
              be such.</p>
              <p>As for 'working in whatever fields you are, i would not return

              <p>That is not answering the question. That is diverting a question which you cannot afford to answer . Referring to people's opinions as rubbish bins are an aggravation in my view . Bending the judiciary forum thread? Recall it? </p>
